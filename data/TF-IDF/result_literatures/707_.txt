Because of the poor sintering ability and low phase purity limit in the applicationof a Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte, it is important to find an effectiveway to obtain a pure and dense Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic at reduced temperature.
In this study, high conductive indium-tin oxide (ITO) was innovativelyused as the sintering additive to improve the purity and density of theNa3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic.
The influence of ITO additive on density, phase,microstructure and conductivity of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic was investigated.
Archimedes method, x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy andcomplex impedance spectroscopy were used as experimental techniques toevaluate the effect of the additive.
The results show that the ITO sinteringadditive increases not only the purity and density but also the conductivity ofthe Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic.
The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic with 3 wt.% ITOadditive sintered at 1150C for 4 h possesses a high density of 3.15 g/cm3 andgood conductivity of (3.95 ± 0.12) 9 104 S/cm.
The main objective of this work is to verify thatITO can be used as an effective additive inNa3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte.
The ITO additivecan reduce the sintering temperature, increase thedensity and improve the conductivity, which is dueto the distortion of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 lattice.
Byadding 3 wt.% ITO, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 sintered at1150C for 4 h obtains a high density of 3.15 g/cm3and good conductivity of (3.95 ± 0.12) 9 104 S/cm.
The increase in conductivity is attributed to thedense microstructure, uniform grain size, distributionof excess ITO in the liquid phase and lesscoulombic repulsion between the In3+ and the Na+.
