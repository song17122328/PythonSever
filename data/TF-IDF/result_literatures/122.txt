Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) Na3V2(PO4)3(NVP) is a type of promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) with superior structural integrity, high energy density, and fast diffusion of sodium ions. However, NVP suffers from intrinsically low electrical conductivity, which results in poor rate performance. Herein, we report on the outstanding cathode performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP@C-ZIF67) wrapped by the ZIF-67-derived carbon, which was prepared by sol−gel method and solid-phase method. Electrochemical measurements show an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g−1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity maintains 82 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 10 C. The results indicate the improvement in electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance due to the Co doping from ZIF-67. Moreover, we calculate the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions by the cyclic voltammetry (CV, DNa+ = 1.521 × 10−11 and 2.3484 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 for charging and discharging, respectively) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT, DNa+ ranges from 10−11−10−15 cm2 s−1). The exceptional performance is ascribed to the excellent structural stability and outstanding electrical conductivity of NVP modified by porous carbon skeleton and ZIF-67-derived carbon.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated in the advanced energy storage field over the past few years due to the high energy density, green initiative, and safety.1−5 However, the scarcity of Li resources hinders the development of LIBs. Hence, it is necessary to search for alternative energy storage devices. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered the most promising alternative to LIBs because of the abundant resources of sodium (Na) and the similarity of the rockingchair mechanism.6,7 The sodium ions (Na+) in SIBs have poor kinetics due to their large radius, which leads to the insertion/ extraction problem of SIBs.8,9 This causes damage to the electrode’s structural stability due to the significant change in the lattice structure during the charge/discharge cycle.10 Moreover, the low power density and poor long-cycle stability of SIBs urgently need to be improved. In particular, the cathode materials present a lower energy density than anode materials due to the limited insertion/extraction of Na+ and heavy chemical formulas. Thus, developing cathode materials for SIBs is a focus of current research.6
Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has drawn intense attention because of the sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) and the reversible sodiation/desodiation behavior. For NVP, the commodious diffusion channel of Na+ in the lattice structure results from its 3D open framework and the large vacant sites for the transfer of Na+, which ensures the structural stability and high ion conductivity.11−13 Moreover, NVP has a higher theoretical energy density (≈400 Wh kg−1) and reversible working voltage plateau (≈3.4 V based on a V3+/V4+ redox couple) than some of the SIBs cathode materials.14−16
Nevertheless, the poor electronic conductivity of a phosphate-based framework results in undesirable rate performance.17−20 To address this problem, wrapping NVP with carbonaceous conductive materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, or hard carbon, etc.) and heteroatom doping on the carbon matrix are effective ways to improve electronic conductivity and maximize the power density.21−24
Recently, many researchers have enhanced the diffusion kinetics and electrochemical performance of NVP through wrapping carbonaceous conductive materials or doping heteroatoms. Chen et al. synthesized an Al-doped NASICON-type Na3V2−xAlx(PO4)3/C, which enhanced the structural stability and electrochemical performance due to the high ion conductivity and low internal resistances of Al3+ (carbon source: C6H12O6; aluminum source: γ-Al2O3).25 Shen et al. prepared an N-doped carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3/C+N to improve the cycling stability and rate performance by increasing the electronic conductivity and creating active sites and numerous extrinsic defects (carbon source: citric acid, nitrogen source: polyvinylpyrrolidone) with N.26 A N,Bcodoped carbon-coated 3D flowerlike Na3V2(PO4)3 designed by Jiang et al. displays outstanding electrochemical performance using C6H12O6 and NH4HB4O7·H2O as the source of carbon, nitrogen, and boron.27 Nevertheless, these studies used two substances, one as a carbon source and the other as the doping heteroatom source, and these precursors suffer from high toxicity and high cost.
In search of battery storage systems, metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) stand out as a promising solution to the problems discussed above. It is easy to regulate the morphology and structure of MOFs to control the ionic and electronic transfer kinetics. MOFs can offer a nanoporous structure with a controllable pore size and geometry to promote the infiltration of electrolyte and increase cyclic stability of the charge/discharge progress.28,29 Therefore, MOFs can be used to embellish electrode materials of batteries.
Herein, we prepare an NVP cathode wrapped by ZIF-67 and sinter it in N2 atmosphere. ZIF-67 can wrap a uniform carbon layer on the NVP surface and introduce Co due to the special zeolite midazolide skeleton structure and its strong adhesiveness on the inorganic surface.30,31 This structure enhances the electronic conductivity and the charge/discharge capacity of NVP cathode. As a result, NVP@C-ZIF67 presents a high specific discharge capacity of 135 mA h g−1 at 1 C under a voltage of 2.3−3.9 V; it also has an excellent rate and cycling performance. These demonstrate the superiority of the ZIF-67 for carbon coating.
2.1. Preparation of ZIF-67. The ZIF-67 particles were synthesized by a typical coprecipitation method. First, 1.6 g of 2methylimidazole and 1.4 g of cobalt-nitrate hexahydrate were completely dissolved in 40 mL of methanol solution, respectively. The 2-methylimidazole solution was then slowly added to the cobaltnitrate hexahydrate solution while quickly stirring until the reaction completed. The mixture was rinsed with dehydrated alcohol three times after aging at room temperature for 12 h, then dried at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain a purple powder.
2.2. Preparation of NVP@C-ZIF67. The NVP@C-ZIF67 was synthesized through a sol−gel method and solid-phase method as indicated below. Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, N H4VO3, NH4H2PO4, and citric acid took part in the reaction, where the citric acid was used not only as an organic cross-linker but also as a carbon source. First, the citric acid was dissolved in deionized water by continuously stirring at 60 °C, and then NH4VO3 was slowly added to the citric acid solution. After dissolving it completely, the mixed solution of Na2CO3 and NH4H2PO4 was added into the reaction solution, and then increased the temperature to 80 °C for 4 h while stirring (molar ratio of citric acid/Na2CO3/NH4VO3/NH4H2PO4 was 4:3:4:6). Then, the gel was dried at 80 °C for 16 h after grinding and initially sintered at 350 °C for 4 h in a tubular furnace under an argon atmosphere. After that, the black powder products were sufficiently wrapped with ZIF-67 (5% of the mass of black powder products). Finally, the mixed powder was sintered at 800 °C for 8 h in a tubular furnace under an argon atmosphere to obtain the NVP@C-ZIF67.
2.3. Material Characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The morphologies and microstructure of samples were observed by a Zeiss G500 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Jem 2100 highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The content of carbon was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler Toledo), and the carbon phase analysis was determined by Raman Spectroscopy (inVia, 532 nm green laser beam) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALABXi+). The Brunauer− Emmett−Teller (BET) measurement was carried out by v-sorb 2800p.
2.4. Electrochemical Measurements. The electrode slurry was prepared by mixing active material (80 wt %), acetylene black (10 wt %), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt %) in the appropriate amounts of N-methy1-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The homogeneous slurry was coated on the aluminum foil by a doctor-blading technique (the average thickness is 150 μm) and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. A disk electrode was punched with a diameter of 1.2 cm, with the average loading mass of active material being approximately 1−1.27 mg/cm2. CR 2032 coin-type cells were fabricated in an Ar-filled glovebox with oxygen and H2O contents of less than 1 ppm. The sodium metal is used as the anode, and the separators are glass fiber. The electrolyte is 1 M NaClO4 in ethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate (1:1) with 5 wt % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The electrochemical tests (cycling and rate performance) were carried out using a Land CT2001A battery tester at a voltage range of 2.3−3.9 V (vs Na/Na+) at room temperature. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted by a CHI660A electrochemical workstation.
To explore the effects of the ZIF-67-derived carbon on the structure and electrochemical performance of NVP, we synthesized NVP and NVP@C-ZIF67 by sol−gel and solidphase methods. The ZIF-67 not only serves as a carbon source but also introduces Co3+. XRD, Raman spectrum, and BET measurement of NVP and NVP@C-ZIF67 samples were conducted and exhibited in Figures 1 and S1.
Figure 1a shows the XRD patterns of samples NVP@CZIF67 and NVP, and all the diffraction peaks are well-indexed to the R3̅c space group of the rhombohedral NASICON structure.32,33 The peak positions and intensities of NVP and NVP@C-ZIF67 are precisely consistent with the Powder Diffraction File no. 62−0345 (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, 2010) and display a high degree of crystallization, which indicates no impurities formed. In other words, the crystal structures of NVP are not varied by the ZIF67-derived carbon.
To confirm the effects of the ZIF-67-derived carbon wrapping on the carbon layer for NVP@C-ZIF67, Raman spectrum of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP samples were tested and provided in Figures 1b and S1a. I n Figure 1b, the two broad carbon bands locate at 1334 and 1588 cm−1, which correspond to the D band (disordered-induced phonon mode) and G band (graphite band).34,35 The intensity ratios of the corresponding D band to G band (ID/IG) for NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP are 0.92 and 0.94, respectively. The ID/IG ratio for NVP@C-ZIF67 indicates a relatively high degree of graphitization, which improved the electrical conductivity by the ZIF-67derived carbon and further enhanced the electrochemical performance.6,26
To further determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP, the BET results were displayed in Figures 1c and S1b. I n Figures 1c and S1b, both NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP show an IV-type isotherm of mesoporous characteristic,36 and the pore size distributions of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP both range from 5 to 30 nm. In contrast, the BET curve of NVP@C-ZIF67 has a larger mesoporous hysteresis loop than that of NVP, which is related to the higher surface area of NVP@C-ZIF67 (81.1 m2/g) than NVP (52.7 m2/g). This indicates that NVP@C-ZIF67 provides more pores and adsorption sites. Therefore, NVP@C-ZIF67 can increase the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, thus contributing to the rapid migration of Na+ to enhance electrochemical performance. In addition, as shown in Figure S2, the carbon content of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP measured by TGA tests are 6.58 and 5.74%, respectively, which proved that the ZIF-67-derived carbon increases the carbon content.
 Furthermore, XPS spectra were measured to investigate the chemical composition and transition metal oxidation states of NVP@C-ZIF67. The XPS peak splitting spectrum of C 1s, O 1s, and V 2p for NVP@C-ZIF67 are shown in Figure 1d−f, respectively. The spectral peaks for Na 1s, O 1s, V 2p, C 1s, and P 2p were identified in the inset of Figure 1d. The C 1s peak splitting in Figure 1d presents four bonding configurations with the corresponding intensities. Accordingly, the sp2 carbon corresponds to the CC bond, which occupies the highest content at 284.6 eV, indicating the superior electrical conductivity of carbon for NVP@C-ZIF67, and the other three peaks representing C−O (285.6 eV), CO (287 eV), and O− CO (288.5 eV) correspond to different C−O bonding configurations of the sp3 carbon. The O 1s peak was divided into three peaks assigned to V−O, P−O, CO, and C−O bonds, respectively, as shown in Figure 1e. In Figure 1f, the two core peaks are V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2, which split into four subpeaks. The subpeaks at 516.8 and 523.7 eV indicate the presence of V3+, and the subpeaks at 527.7 and 524.8 eV correspond to V4+.6,36 The XPS analysis shows that the Co content is only 0.87% on the sample surface. Though the Co peak is not explicitly presented in the XPS survey, the presence of Co is distinctly shown in the EDS mapping.
The morphology of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP samples are investigated by SEM. The carbon skeleton is interlinked by citric acid, as shown in Figures 2a and S3.6 Carbon holes of various sizes are distributed from the edge to the middle of the NVP@C-ZIF67 sample. The carbon holes became smaller and denser as they get closer to the edge. This provides a large surface area for sufficient contact with the electrolyte to accelerate the transfer of Na+. Moreover, the NVP particles are wrapped in the porous carbon skeleton structure or clung to its surface, which provides many channels for Na+ transport. The NVP sample in Figure S4 shows the same morphology as the NVP@C-ZIF67 sample, indicating that the ZIF-67 (Figure S5) derived carbon wrapping does not change the morphology of the samples.
The crystalline structure and detailed morphology of NVP@ C-ZIF67 were further investigated by HRTEM in Figure 2b. The HRTEM image in Figure 2b exhibits the marked lattice fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.251 nm and the (300) plane of Na3V2(PO4)3 with a rhombohedral structure.26 A uniform carbon layer with a thickness of about 4.5 nm can be clearly seen wrapped on the sample surface. In this way, the electrochemical property of NVP@C-ZIF67 is enhanced due to the improved electrical conductivity by the ZIF-67-derived carbon. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping displays a homogeneous distribution of Na, V, P, O, and Co species in NVP@C-ZIF67 sample, indicating that the sample has a good dispersion, as shown in Figure 2c−h.
The sodium storage capabilities of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP were tested at the voltage range of 2.3−3.9 V. First, the cycling behavior of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP for 500 cycles at 1 C (1 C = 117 mA h g−1) are presented in Figure 3a. NVP@C-ZIF67 shows an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g−1, which is much higher than that of NVP of 105 mA h g−1. The discharge-specific capacity of NVP@C-ZIF67 measures 113 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles. Both capacities are higher than previous reports, for example, the NVP@C-BN designed Jiang et al. has an initial capacity of 114 mA h g−1 at 1 C and a final capacity of 104 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles.27 In comparison, the final capacity of 113 mA h g−1 at 1 C after 500 cycles of the NVP@C-ZIF67 is much higher than the final capacity of NVP@C-BN. Furthermore, the discharge curves of NVP@CZIF67 maintain a smooth state without obvious fluctuations, manifesting its stability during the charge and discharge process. In summary, the cycling performance of NVP@CZIF67 is better than that of NVP.
To explore the effect of the ZIF-67-derived carbon on rate capability, rate capability tests for NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP were performed at different rates for 10 cycles in Figure 3b. It shows that the discharge-specific capacities of NVP@C-ZIF67 are 128, 120, 111, 96, 85, 76, and 67 mA h g−1 at 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 C, respectively. The discharge-specific capacities at 1−50 C of NVP@C-ZIF67 are all higher than the capacities of the Na3V2−xAlx(PO4)3/C prepared by Chen et al. under small current density,25 which indicates the better rate performance of NVP@C-ZIF67. Furthermore, the dischargespecific capacities of NVP is only 97, 90, 80, 65, 53, 45, and 42 mA h g−1, which are not suitable for practical applications. For NVP@C-ZIF67, however, when the current density was reset to 1 C from 50 C, it remains a discharge-specific capacity of 126 mA h g−1, showing its stability under the impact of the large current density. The excellent cycle performance and rate capability of NVP@C-ZIF67 are ascribed to the ZIF-67derived carbon. Besides, the Co doping in V sites can promote the cycle performance,37−39 and carbon coating can enhance the electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties.40,41
Figure 3c presents the Nyquist plots of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP and the corresponding fitted equivalent circuit model. The open-circuit voltage of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP are 2.945 and 2.982 V, respectively. The curves are composed of a semicircle at a high- and a low-frequency straight slope, as shown in Figure 3c. The NVP@C-ZIF67 has a smaller semicircle diameter than that of NVP, indicating that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of NVP@C-ZIF67 (617.4 Ω) i s smaller than that of NVP (853 Ω). NVP@C-ZIF67 has a low charge-transfer resistance, which shows its reponsive and quick electron transportation.
To investigate the Na+ insertion/extraction behavior, Figures 4a and S6 show the CV curves at 0.1 mV s−1 of NVP@C-ZIF67 and NVP, respectively. The CV curves of NVP@C-ZIF67 exhibit a redox couple peak located at around 3.4 V, which corresponds to the V4+/V3+ redox couple in the transformation of Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV2(PO4)3. However, an extra peak appears next to the reduction peak, which is connected with the insertion of Na+ to NVP.36 This phenomenon results from the local redox environment rearrangement of the NASICON structure, which transfers Na+ from Na(1) to Na(2) sites.24 NVP shows a similar behavior in Figure S6a. Figure 4b displays the CV curves at 0.1−0.5 mV s−1 of NVP@C-ZIF67. At different scanning rates, the CV curves have the same shape, and the redox peak can effectively maintain its current density and voltage position. Moreover, peaks 1 (oxidation peaks) and 2 (reduction peaks) in Figure 4b were selected for the calculation of the b-value, using the following formulas [eqs 1 and 2]:
where i represents the peak current, v represents the scanning rate, and a and b represent the adjustable parameters. Obtained by fitting log(i)−log(v) lines, b is the ratio of pseudocapacitance to the embedded sodium storage. The b-values of peaks 1 and 2 are 0.307 and 0.637, respectively, as shown in Figure 4c. The b-values are close to 0.5, indicating that the sodium insertion/extraction process dominates the electrochemical sodium storage process, and the pseudocapacitance sodium storage plays a supplementary role.42−44
Moreover, the diffusion coefficient (D) o f Na+ was calculated by CV from the following formula [eq 3]:
where Ip represents the peak current, A denotes the area of the electrode, n represents the number of electrons in reaction, CNadenotes the molar concentration of Na+, and v presents the scanning rate. Figure 4d shows the excellent linear relationship between Ip and v1/2 of oxidation peaks and reduction peaks, validating a controlled-diffusion process during the sodium storage in electrodes.42 For NVP@C-ZIF67, the D values calculated from oxidation peaks and reduction peaks are 1.521 × 10−11 and 2.3484 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, respectively. Furthermore, the D values of NVP are calculated to be 1.156 × 10−11 and 2.03 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, respectively, as shown in Figure S6b,c. The D values of NVP are lower than those of NVP@C-ZIF67, indicating the improved sodium ion diffusion dynamics and electrochemical performance through the ZIF-67-derived carbon wrapping.
To further investigate the cycling performance and rate capability of NVP@C-ZIF67, Figure 5a presents the charge/ discharge curves corresponding to the cycling performance of NVP@C-ZIF67 for cycles 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500, using a voltage range of 2.3−3.9 V (vs Na/Na+) at 1 C. All profiles have flat voltage platforms at about 3.4 V, corresponding to the V3+/V4+ redox voltage during the insertion/extraction of two Na ions.45 The NVP@C-ZIF67 has an initial discharge-specific capacity of 135 mA h g−1, and in cycles 1−500, the voltage platforms remain almost constant except for a slight decrease in the capacity. Figure 5b shows the charge/discharge curves corresponding to the rate capability of NVP@C-ZIF67 at different current densities from 1 to 50 C. It was observed that with the increase of current density, NVP@C-ZIF67 maintains a regular charge/discharge curve and a stable voltage platform, although its charge/discharge-specific capacity is decreasing. Figure S7 presents the charge/discharge curves of NVP corresponding to the rate capability of NVP at different current density from 1 to 50 C. Compared with Figure 5b,intervals of the charge/discharge curves of NVP@C-ZIF67 are smaller than those of NVP, and the charge/discharge curves of NVP@C-ZIF67 are smoother than those of NVP. Moreover, the charge/discharge curves of NVP are less irregular than those of NVP@C-ZIF67. These results indicate the better electronic conductivity of NVP@C-ZIF67.
 Considering the safety issues and cycling stability for practical applications, the cycling ability of NVP@C-ZIF67 was tested at 10 C for 1000 cycles. In Figure 5c, the initial discharge-specific capacity is 101 mA h g−1, and it can maintain a high capacity at 82 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. In comparison, an N-doped carbon-coated NVP presented by Shen et al. exhibits an initial capacity of 74.5 mA h g−1 and a final capacity of 69 mA h g−1 at 5 C (100 cycles).26 NVP@CZIF67 shows better performance in the initial capacity, final capacity, current density, and cycle number. The corresponding Coulombic efficiency is kept between 98 and 100%, manifesting the stable charge/discharge capacity among different cycles. Furthermore, and the charge/discharge curve remains smooth without obvious fluctuations, demonstrating the materials’ good stability during long-term cycling at a high rate. These outstanding electrochemical performances make NVP@C-ZIF67 a great candidate for practical applications.
To examine the dynamics of Na+ diffusion of NVP@CZIF67, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was used to further characterize the electrodes. GITT is a unique electrochemical technique to calculate Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa+) in the charge/discharge process. Figure 6a shows the GITT curves of NVP@C-ZIF67 as a function of time at 2.6−3.5 V. The half-cell was charged at a constant current flux (0.1 C) for 2 min followed by an opencircuit standing for 2 min to allow the half-cell voltage to relax to its steady-state value (Es). This procedure is repeated for the full voltage window of operation.46 The diffusion coefficient of Na+ was calculated by the following formula [eq 4]:
where mB denotes the weight of active materials, MB represents the molar mass, VM stands for the molar volume, and S denotes the area of the electrode. In Figure 6b, ΔEs is IR drop, and ΔEτis the difference in potential values in the time range of t0 and t0+τ during galvanostatic charge.47 Figure 6c displays a good linear relationship between voltage and τ1/2, which is the fundamental condition of the eq 4. The calculative results of Na+ diffusion coefficient in the charge/discharge process are shown in Figure 6d, presenting the areas of Na+ dense diffusion at a voltage of around 3.4 V, which corresponds to the V4+/V3+ redox peak in the CV curves of NVP@C-ZIF67. The order of magnitude of Na+ diffusion coefficient is between 10−11 and 10−15, which is consistent with CV calculations (1.521 × 10−11 and 2.3484 × 10−11 cm2 s−1), as shown in Figure 6d. As a result, the fast Na+ transport leads to the excellent electrochemical performance of NVP@C-ZIF67.
In summary, we successfully prepared ZIF-67-derived carbonwrapped Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP@C-ZIF67) by sol−gel and solidphase methods. The NVP particles are wrapped within or clung to the surface of the porous carbon skeleton structure, and the ZIF-67-derived carbon is wrapped on the surface of NVP, which effectively improves the electrical conductivity. The obtained NVP@C-ZIF67 displays a high initial dischargespecific capacity of 135 mA h g−1 at 1 C, and the discharge capacity remains at 82 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 10 C, indicating the superb capacity and excellent stability during long-term cycling at a high rate. NVP@C-ZIF67 not only shows an outstanding rate capability at the rate of 1−50 C but also exhibits a high Na+ diffusion coefficient of 1.521 × 10−11 and 2.3484 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique calculations. Therefore, the excellent electrochemical performance of NVP@C-ZIF67 makes it a promising cathode material for sodium ion batteries.
