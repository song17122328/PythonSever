NASICON-structured  Na3V2(PO4)3  possessing  three-dimensional  channel  for raised electrochemical Journal Pre-proofNa3V2(PO4)3  through  solgel  method.  Carbon-encapsulated  chlorine-doped  Na3V2(PO4)3 composites reveal performance.  Among (NVP@C/Cl-30)  with  proper  chlorine  exhibits the  best performance. NVP@C/Cl-30 delivers the discharge capacity of 104.2, 86.4, 52.2 mAh g-1 at  40,  1000,  4000  mA  g-1,  severally,  much  higher  than  those  of  chlorine-undoped composite. Moreover, NVP@C/Cl-30 demonstrates excellent  cycling  performance. 


Currently,  fossil energy (including oil, coal,  and  natural  gas)  is consumed  in a  huge amount. With the  limited  reserves of  fossil energy, the  growing demand and uncontrolled exploitation  will  accelerate  the  depletion  of  fossil  energy  [1-6].  At  the  same  time, environmental problems such as soil pollution and greenhouse effect occur [7]. Therefore, exploring  new  energy  systems  has  become  a  top  priority  [8,  9].  

Renewable  natural resources are not fully utilized yet.

Sodium  ion battery  is considered  to be the  most suitable replacement  for  lithium  ion battery  [19,  20].  Sodium  ion  battery  has  attracted  wide  attention  in  renewable  energy attention  [10].  As  a  kind  of  electrochemical  energy  storage,  lithium  io n  battery  has  the advantages of high working voltage and  long cycling life [11-13]. Now, advanced lithium ion  battery  technology  has  been  used  in  many  mobile  electronic  devices  and  electric vehicles  [14-16].  However,  due  to  the  relative  shortage  of  lithium  sources,  uneven distribution, and  consequent price  increase, the  use of  lithium  ion battery  for sustainable development  in  renewable  energy  and  smart  grids  has  also  aroused  concern  [17].  


To alleviate  these  problems,  many  studies  have  focused  on  new  alternative  energy  systems ion  battery,  sodium storage and conversion  in recent  years. Compared with  lithium  ion battery  that  has been commercialized,  it  has  the  following  characteristics:  (a)  A  similar  working  principle.  In charging/discharging  process  of  sodium ions  are  reversibly embedded/extracted  between  cathode  and  anode  electrodes,  so  they  are  called  “rocking chair”  batteries  [21].  


Sodium  ions  migrate  repeatedly  between  cathode  and  anode  to achieve  energy  storage  and  release.  The  whole  process is  very  similar  to  the charging/discharging process of lithium ion battery [22]. (b) Similar embedding/extracting chemistry. Sodium and  lithium belong to the same  main  group and  have similar chemical and  physical  property  [23].  Lithium  and  sodium  ions  can  be  reversibly  embedded  and extracted  in  electrode  materials  with  similar  structures  [21].  (c)  Low  resource  cost.  The reserve  of  sodium  resource  in  the  earth  is  much  higher  than  that  of  lithium,  which  is widely distributed in seawater [24]. Sodium resource is rich and easy to get, and the price is  cheaper.  In  this  sense,  the  low-cost  nature  of  sodium  ion  batteries  makes  them  more promising in large-scale energy storage. (d) The relative atomic mass of sodium is greater than that of  lithium, and  standard electrode potential of  sodium (-2.71 V)  is about 0.3 V higher  than  that  of  lithium  [25].  These  factors  result  in  slightly  lower  energy  density  of sodium  ion  batteries  compared  with  lithium  ion  batteries  [26]. 

Sodium  ion  batteries  are  composed  of  anode,  cathode,  electrolyte  and  separating membrane. The electrode  is core part of battery,  which  is composed of  three parts: active material, conductive agent and binder. Active substance participates in redox reaction and determines  the  basic  characteristics  of  electrode.  The  selection  of  cathode  materials  for sodium  ion  batteries  should  follow  some  basic  principles,  such  as  good  electrical conductivity,  ion  channels  with  rapid  diffusion  of  sodium  ions  [27],  high  chemical structure  stability  [28],  low  cost,  easy  synthetic  process,  and  so  on.  Sodium  and  lithium have similar physicochemical properties. Therefore, by  referring the  research experience of  lithium  ion  battery  electrode  materials,  research  on  sodium  ion  battery  materials  has made more progress and technology development in recent years [29]. 


However, it should not be overlooked that the  most  important difference between sodium and  lithium  is  that sodium ion radius is larger than that of lithium ion, which makes sodium ion tend to cause 

Researchers  are  trying  to  find  a  cathode  electrode  material  with  large  channels. 

Cathodes  for  sodium  ion  batteries,  such  as  phosphates  [33,  34],  polyanionic  compounds [35,  36],  and  layered  transitionmetal  oxides  [37-39]  have  been  widely  investigated. 

NASICON-structured  Na3V2(PO4)3  is  a  polyanionic  phosphate  with  a  unique  structure that  imparts  a  broad  transport  channels  for  sodium  ions  [40].  There  are  strong  P-O covalent bond in crystal of Na3V2(PO4)3 compound [41]. So it has good structural stability and  thermodynamic  stability,  and  exhibits  excellent  sodium  storage  performance  in electrochemical  tests. In this paper,  we designed carbon-encapsulated and chlorine-doped Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode  through easy solgel  method. The process of preparing  material and  electrode  is  roughly  shown  in  Figure  1.  It  is  well  known  that  carbon  encapsulation can increase the electrical conductivity of  the electrode and maybe enhance the dispersive property of particles, which was confirmed by much previous literature [42, 43]. A carbon more  volume  expansion  in  crystal  structure  of the  embedded  material.layer  with  appropriate  thickness  mitigates  the  problem  of  low  inherent  conductivity  of Na3V2(PO4)3. Also, anionic doping can  impact the  conductivity  and crystal structure.  Xu  et  al.  [46]  discovered  that  Na3V1.98(PO4)2.9F0.3/C  presents  a  higher  sodium  ion diffusion coefficient, which is three orders of magnitude larger than F-undoped composite. 

F  and  Cl  in  the  same  main  group  have  the  similar  physicochemical  property.  Compared with  F  element,  Cl  exhibits  the  advantages  of  less  toxicity  and  low  cost.  In  our  work, carbon  encapsulation  and  chlorine  doping  strategy  was  employed  to  conjointly  enhance the performances of Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode. Carbon encapsulation  improves the electrical conductivity,  and  chlorine  doping  enhances  the  ionic  conductivity. 

During  the  synthesis  process  of  blank  sample,  0.52  g  of  NH4VO3  was  added  to  40 mL of deionized water with magnetic stirring, and was placed in a 50 °C water bath. Then 0.54 g of CH3COONa, 0.76 g of NH4H2PO4 and 0.6 g of glucose were added to the baker. 

For the chlorine-doped samples, NaCl, NH4H2PO4 and CH3COONa were added according to  stoichiometric  proportion,  and  the  amounts  of  other  raw  materials  were  unchanged. 

After all  ingredients  were added, the sealed beaker was stirred  for 3 hours. Then put  it  in an  oven  at  80  °C  to  remove  excess  water.   The  obtained  precursors  were  calcined  in  a 450 °C tube furnace for 2 hours and then kept at 750 °C for 6 hours under conservation of Ar  atmosphere.  The  Na3V2(PO4)3@C,  Na3V2(PO4)2.95Cl0.15@C,  Na3V2(PO4)2.9Cl0.3@C and  Na3V2(PO4)2.85Cl0.45@C  samples  were  denoted  as  NVP@C,  NVP@C/Cl-15, NVP@C/Cl-30 and NVP@C/Cl-45, respectively. 

P, O, and Cl are similarly and evenly distributed among the composite. The distribution of carbon  is  different  with  other  elements.  Excessive  carbon  comes  from  the  conductive adhesive for testing. Figure 4g is SEM image of NTP@C/Cl-30, and corresponding EDX spectrum  (Figure  4h)  displays  the  existence  of  Na,  V,  P,  O,  C,  and  Cl  elements.  This proves  that  Cl  is  successfully  introduced  and  present  homogeneous  distribution  in TEM  measurement  was  further  characterized  to  study  morphology  and  structure  of chlorine  doped  composite.  Representative  TEM  and  high-resolution  TEM  images  of NVP@C/Cl-30 are shown  in  Figure 5. As can be observed, NVP@C/Cl-30 is composed of particles with size of dozens to hundreds nanometers. This morphology can shorten the pathway  and  accelerate  the  migration  of  sodium  ion.  The  nanostructure  of  composite mainly  comes  from  synthesis  method  of  solgel  route.  The  highresolution  TEM  image confirms  the carbon encapsulation structure.  The carbon  layer  is  mainly amorphous, and the thickness is found to be about 6 nm. The formed carbon layer can serve as conducting network,  which  can  raise  electrical  conductivity  of  electrode  and  resulting  improved electrochemical properties. NVP@C/Cl-30 demonstrates characteristic crystalline  feature and lattice fringe with d-spacing of 0.251 nm, which is attributed to interplanar spacing of (300) plane of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3. This further verifies the Na3V2(PO4)3 structure XPS  measurement  was  conducted to confirm  the existence of  Cl  in NTP@C/Cl-30. 


According to the XPS survey spectrum in Figure 6, the characteristic peaks of Na, V, P, O, C, and Cl are observed obviously, which are located at 1071.1, 517.4, 133.5, 531.0, 284.8, and  198.3  eV,  severally.  Clearly,  Cl  element  is  incorporated  into  the  composite,  which matches  the  EDX  spectrum  and elemental  mapping  results. 

In  order  to  quantify  carbon  content  of  composites,  TGA  measurements  were conducted  from  ambient  temperature  to  550  °C  in  air  atmosphere.  The  TGA  curves  of NVP@C and NVP@C/Cl-30 are plotted in Figure 7. Weight loss at 30-250 °C is ascribed to separation of water  from composite. And carbon combustion  from encapsulated  layer mainly takes place  in the range of  300-500 °C. Total carbon content of two composites  is determined to be about 5%. Clearly, chlorine doping  has  no obvious effect on the carbon encapsulation  for  the  composite.  The  carbon  layer  comes  from  the  pyrolysis  reaction  of glucose  as carbon  source. 


The  rate  performances  of  all  composites  at  various  current  density  are  presented  in composites  decreases,  demonstrating  that  the  intercalation/deintercalation  of  sodium  ion is controlled by  ion  migration [47]. Among all composites,  the discharge capacity  firstly incerases  and then  decreases  with increasing the  content  of  doped  chlorine. NVP@C/Cl-30 composite with proper chlorine content exhibits the best electrochemical performances.  NVP@C/Cl-30  delivers  speciﬁc  reversible  capacity  of  104.2,  86.4,  52.2 mAh g-1 at current density of 40, 1000, 4000 mA g-1, severally, much higher than those for NVP@C  composite  (74.2,  46.4,  21.1  mAh  g-1).  Compared  with  NVP@C/Cl-30, NVP@C/Cl-45  shows  inferior  electrochemical  performance.  


It  is  maybe  due  to  that excessive  content  of  dop  Cl  slightly  alters  its  crystal  structure,  as  can  be  known  from XRD  measurement. Moreover, when current density  is back  from 4000 to 40  mA  g-1, the discharge  capacity  for  each  composite  can  recover  well.  This  indicates  the  excellent tolerance  in  high  current  density  for  each  composite   due  to  the  good  structure  of Na3V2(PO4)3. The NVP@C/Cl-30 electrode recovers the discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g-1 at 40 mA g-1. The excellent rate performances of NVP@C/Cl-30 are jointly ascribed to the  conductive  carbon  encapsulation  and  chlorine  doping  with  proper  content,  further raising  electron and sodium  ion  migration.  The charging-discharging curves  for NVP@C and NVP@C/Cl-30 composites at  various current density are compared  in  Figure 8b and 8c. As observed, the curves for NVP@C/Cl-30 composite can keep better in contrast with NVP@C.  Moreover,  discharging  voltage  for  NVP@C/Cl-30  is  larger  than  that  for NVP@C  at  all  current  density.  The  larger  discharge  voltage  can  help  to  increase  cell energy  density. 

Effect of chlorine doping on  intercalation/deintercalation ability  of sodium  ions  was compared  by  cyclic  voltammetry  measurements.  The  cyclic  voltammetry  curves  of NVP@C and NVP@C/Cl-30 are presented  in Figure 9, recorded at 0.2  mV s-1 in 2.3-4.2 V.  As  observed,  both  electrodes  exhibit  a  clear  pair  of  redox  peak.  However, NVP@C/Cl-30  exhibits  sharper  oxidation/reduction  peak.  The  peak  current  density  for oxidation  and  reduction  reactions  of  NVP@C/Cl-30  composite  reaches  0.242  A  g-1  and 0.190 A g-1, much higher than those of NVP@C (0.142 A g-1, 0.121 A g-1). Moreover, the peak potential  gap  for NVP@C/Cl-30 decreases  from 0.416 V to 0.240 V compared with NVP@C.  The  increased  peak  current  density  and  depressed  peak  potential  gap  indicate the  enhancement  of  electrochemical  performances.  Cyclic  voltammetry  results  confirm that  chlorine  doping  can greatly  raise  electrochemical  kinetics  of Na3V2(PO4)3. 

Electrochemical kinetics of NVP@C and NVP@C/Cl-30 composites were compared by  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  measurements.  Electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy  of  NVP@C  and  NVP@C/Cl-30  in  0.01-10000  Hz  are  presented  in  Figure 10a.  All  plots  consist  of  semicircle  in  highfrequency  area  and  slanted  line  in lowfrequency  area.  The  intercept  with  X  axis  reflects  the  resistance  of  the  cell  system (Rs).  The  semicircle  and  slanted  line  correspond  to  charge  transfer  impedance  (Rct)  and Warburg  impedance  (W),  severally.  Rct  for  NVP@C/Cl-30  decreases  from  1025.1  Ω  to 287.5  Ω  compared  with  NVP@C,  indicating  that  the  impedance  of  electrochemical reaction was  greatly depressed by chlorine doping on PO43 site.  Rs  for NVP@C/Cl-30  is 9.01  Ω,  slightly  smaller  than  that  for  NVP@C  (12.1  Ω),  which  is  due  to  that  chlorine doping can  raise  the electrical conductivity of the composite  [48]. Moreover,  the slope of slanted  line  for  NVP@C/Cl-30  is  larger  than  that  for  NVP@C.  By  the  literature  [49],  it can be concluded that chlorine doping can accelerate the diffusion of sodium ion in crystal lattice.  The  reduced  impedance  of  electrochemical  reaction  and  sodium  ion  diffusion coming  from  chlorine  doping  can  help  to  raise  rate  performance  of  Na3V2(PO4)3-based electrode.  The  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  results  are  in  accordance  with cyclic  voltammetry  measurements.  Figure  10b  presents  the  relationship  between  Z′  and ω-1/2 obtained  from  line at  low  frequency. The diffusion coefficient of Na+ (DNa+) can be figured  out  using  the  following  formulas  [50]. 

In formulas, T is temperature, R is gas constant, C is concentration of sodium ions, F is Faraday constant, n is number of transfer electrons, A is area of electrode, σ is Warburg factor, ω  is angular  frequency.  As  can be determned by the  above  formulas, the DNa+ for NC and NC/Cl-30 are 6.49×10-15 and 8.64×10-14 cm2 s−1, respectively. It is clear that DNafor NC/Cl-30 is obviously larger than that for NC, which comes from the chlorine doping accelerating  sodium  ion  diffusion. 

Long-term  cycling  performances  of  NVP@C  and  NVP@C/Cl-30  for  500  cycles  at 800  mA  g-1  are  presented  in  Figure  11.  NVP@C  and  NVP@C/Cl-30  deliver  initial discharge  capacity  of  41.1  and  83.4  mAh  g-1,  respectively.  As  can  be  seen,  in  the  first several  cycles,  the  discharge  capacity  increases  slightly  for  both  composites  with increasing cycle  number, which  is probably due to the activation of electrode at relatively high current density. After 500 cycles, discharge capacity of NVP@C/Cl-30 reaches 80.7 mAh  g-1,  50.9  mAh  g-1  larger  than  that  of  NVP@C.  Compared  to  NVP@C  (65.2%), NVP@C/Cl-30 demonstrates  higher capacity  retention of 93.0% compared  to  the  largest discharge  capacity  (NVP@C:  45.7  mAh  g-1,  NVP@C/Cl-30:  86.8  mAh  g-1).  High capacity  retention  of  NVP@C/Cl-30  is  principally  due  to  stable  NASICON  structure  of Na3V2(PO4)3.  Moreover,  chlorine  doping  increases  electrical  and  ionic  conductivity, further  decreasing  electrochemical  polarization  of  the  cell. 

In  addition, structure stability of NVP@C/Cl-30 electrode  was  further characterized by SEM  measurements after  charging-discharging test  for  various cycles at 800  mA  g-1. 

Corresponding results are displayed in  Figure 12. As observed, all electrodes demonstrate similar  morphology  after  different  cycles.  There  is  no  obvious  structure  wreck.  The electrode  exhibits  relatively  crude  surface,  consisting  of  some  nano-scale  particles appeared. This  is  in agreement  with  the  morphology of as-prepared composite.  The SEM results  of  cycled  electrode  after  long-term  charging-discharging  test  imply  the  excellent structure  stability  of NVP@C/Cl-30 cathode. 


NVP@C/Cl-30 composite  demonstrates  better cycling  performances. 

In  summary,  carbon-encapsulated,  chlorine-doped  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  for  sodium ion  battery  have  been  prepared  by  solgel  route  and  subsequent  high-temperature calcination.  The  as-prepared  composite  with  proper  doped  chlorine  (NVP@C/Cl-30) demonstrates outstanding rate performance and excellent cycling stability. NVP@C/Cl-30 delivers  discharge  capacity  of  104.2,  86.4,  52.2  mAh  g-1  at  40,  1000,  4000  mA  g-1, severally,  much  higher  than  those  for  NVP@C  (74.2,  46.4,  21.1  mAh  g-1).  Capacity retention  for  NVP@C/Cl-30  can  reach  93.0%  (500  cycles,  800  mA  g-1).  Outstanding performances of NVP@C/Cl-30  mainly  result  from the  nanostructure of particles, carbon encapsulation  and  chlorine  doping  modification  for  Na3V2(PO4)3.  Shortened  migration pathway  of  sodium  ion,  enhanced  electrical  and  ionic  conductivity  jointly  raise  the performance  of Na3V2(PO4)3-based composite.
