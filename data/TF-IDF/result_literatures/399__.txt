Boron doped LiZr2(PO4)3 electrolyte was successfully synthesized via facile hydrothermal synthesis. Our results show that boron doping mainly happens on the Zr-site of Li1+xZr2-xBx(PO4)3 not the P-site of Li1+6xZr2(P1xBxO4)3. Rietveld refinement of the unit-cell parameters was performed, and it was verified by consideration of Vegard’s law that it is possible to obtain phase purity up to x = 0.05 in Li1+xZr2xBx(PO4)3. This corresponds with phases present in the XRD data, which shows the additional presence of the low temperature (monoclinic) phase for the powder sintered at 1200 C for 12 h of compositions with x  0.075. The compositions inside the solid solution undergo the phase transition from triclinic to rhombohedral when heating from 25 to 100C.

Thus, to minimize lithium losses, it was decided to synthesize LiZr2(PO4)3 using a hydrothermal method and to start by trying to dope LiZr2(PO4)3 with boron on the P-site due to the more similar ionic radii of B3+ and P5+, B = 0.25 Å Vs P = 0.31 Å [19], useful for forming the 4-coordinate tetrahedron necessary for the P-site. Secondly, attempts were made to dope LiZr2(PO4)3 with B on the Zr-site. Here B3+ offers a much smaller ionic radius than Zr4+, B = 0.41 Å Vs Zr = 0.86 Å [19], when forming the 6-coordinate octahedron as required for the Zr-site. Due to the higher ionic conduction of the high temperature phase, it was also decided to sinter the high temperature phase instead of the low temperature phase, but attempting from the beginning to avoid temperatures as high as 1200C.

The method adapted from the recent work by Kim et al. does not offer good reproducibility as we could not achieve phase purity for LiZr2(PO4)3. It was possible to achieve phase purity for LiZr2(PO4)3 with the method adapted from Alamo et al. Zr-site is the preferential mechanism for B doping of LiZr2(PO4)3 and not the P-site. It is possible to obtain phase purity only up to x = 0.05, which coincides with the XRD data that after Li1.075Zr1.925B0.075(PO4)3 there is no solid solution. Despite the efforts, it was not possible to obtain dense pellets and with physical integrity after sintering, suggesting more work would be needed in order to try further approaches to progress to the next goal of measuring impedance for LiZr2(PO4)3 and Li1.05Zr1.95B0.05(PO4)3.
