All-solid-state sodium batteries are the promising candidate for the next generation of large-scale energy storage with exceptional safety, reliability and stability. The solid electrolytes are the key components for enabling all-solid-state sodium batteries with high electrochemical performances. The current developments of solid electrolytes were reviewed in this article. In particular, the intrinsic properties of solid electrolytes and the effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between solid electrolytes and electrodes are deeply discussed. Besides, several directions are also suggested for developing the solid electrolytes and improving the interfacial contacts for future practical applications of all-solid-state sodium batteries.

As the effective energy storage and conversion technology for the integration of renewable resources, the electrochemically secondary batteries have attracted great attentions in the past few decades [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Among these, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are very popular because of high energy density, high power output, and long cycling lifetime, which have been widely applied in the modern life, such as portable electronics and electric vehicles [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, the low reserves of Li salts and increase of cost with rising demands have been becoming the stringent problems. Therefore, it's imperative to develop alternative energy storage system for future replacement of LIBs. After intensively studied in recent years, the sodium (Na) batteries have been considered as one of most promising candidates because of highly abundant Na resource, low cost, and comparative performances to that of LIBs [5], [7], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. However, the conventional Na batteries based on organic liquid electrolyte are still suffered from safety issues, such as liquid leakage, weak thermal stability with ignitability and explosiveness, which are similar to liquid electrolyte based LIBs. Comparing to organic liquid electrolyte, the solid electrolyte own high thermal stability, low flammability, no leakage and volatilization, no risk of fire and explosion, which are beneficial for developing all-solid-state Na battery with high safety and stability [27], [28], [29], [30]. Furthermore, Na metal can be utilized in all-solid-state battery, in which the energy density can be enhanced greatly, and formation of dendrites can be restrained to prevent the internal short circuit.

As the critical component of all-solid-state Na battery, the solid electrolyte plays a key role by acting as both ionic conductor and separator between cathode and anode (Fig. 1). However, the practical applications of all-solid-state Na batteries are still hindered by some deficiencies of solid electrolytes, including low ionic conductivity at room temperature, narrow electrochemical window, weak chemical/electrochemical stability, and poor interfacial compatibility between electrodes and electrolytes, especially the insufficient contact with limited ions transport pathways during volume changes of electrodes for Na insertions/extractions [27], [28], [29], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Thus, there are two key points that urgent to be solved for developing all-solid-state Na batteries: one is fabricating solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, the other is how to make an intimate interface between solid electrolyte and electrode.

In this Review, the widely studied Na-ions solid electrolytes with structures and ionic conductivities as well as preparation methods and electrochemical/chemical stabilities will be briefly summarized, which are classified into several parts, including β/β′′-alumina, sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON), sulfides, polymers and others. And then, based on typical solid electrolytes, several approaches for improving the contacts between electrolytes and electrodes for configurations of all-solid-state Na batteries will be discussed, which are beneficial for enhancing electrochemical performances. Finally, a perspective on the future direction for developing high-performance Na-ions solid electrolytes and making intimate interfaces between electrolytes and electrodes for all-solid-state batteries will be proposed. We hope this Review provide the guidance not only for materials design of solid electrolytes, but also for forming interfaces in all-solid-state Na batteries with favorable electrochemical performances for practical applications.

The history of developing Na-ions solid electrolyte was much earlier than that of Li-ions, and the layer structured β-alumina (Na2O·11Al2O3) as an ion conductor was firstly prepared for sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. As the migration of Na ions was restricted by two-dimensional (2D) planes of β-Al2O3, NASICON materials with 3D framework for fast ions transport were introduced [34], [37], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Meanwhile, the sulfides are proposed to offer higher ionic conductivities [32], [33], [35], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Besides inorganic solid electrolytes, the polymer electrolytes have been developed for all-solid-state Na batteries [31], [57], [58], [59]. Until now, inorganic solid electrolytes and polymer electrolytes are main aspects in Na-ions solid electrolytes for improving the safety and electrochemical performance of all-solid-state batteries. Since the primary role is ions transfer, the high ionic conductivity is a predominant parameter for evaluating Na solid electrolyte [27], [28], [29]. In addition, the chemical/electrochemical stability, compatibility to electrodes, and thermal stability are also important for the application of solid electrolyte in all-solid-state Na battery.

The ionic conductivities of typical Na-ion solid electrolytes, such as β-Al2O3, NASICON, sulfides, and polymers, are presented in Fig. 2. It can be seen that inorganic electrolytes such as sulfides (such as Na3PS4), NASICON, sodium borohydride and Na-β′′-alumina electrolytes have relatively high ionic conductivities at room temperature. As ionic conductivities are closely determined by ions transport mechanisms, the understanding of mechanisms is critical for materials design of fast ions conductors. Similar to Li-ions solid electrolytes with analogous framework in crystalline inorganic electrolyte materials, ionic transport generally relies on concentrations of mobile ions and vacancies (non-mobile ions in the framework), and relative sizes between them in crystal structures, which follows the models of Schottky and Frenkel point defects that in connected conduction pathways [34], [45], [47], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]. The more mobile ions, connected vacancies in open structure, and suitable size ratio of ions/vacancies are much beneficial for offering higher ionic conductivities, which have been demonstrated in β-Al2O3 and NASICON. In non-crystalline sulfides with short- and medium-range order amorphous structure, the high concentration of mobile ion carrier species can effectively improve the ionic conductivity [72]. Besides, the size increase of anion sublattice causes high conductivity, which are generated by enlarged size of migration channel and reduced interaction between mobile ions and structural cations [32], [33], [35], [51], [53], [54], [55], [56], [73]. Furthermore, in polymer electrolytes, the ion transports are related to segmental motions of polymer chains, which create free volumes for the hopping of ions that coordinate with polar groups [31], [57], [61], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80]. Depending on dissociation ability of sodium salt in the polymer, the fast ions diffusions can be achieved by hopping large number of free ions from one coordinating site to another, accompanying by segmental motion of polymer chains, and then the long-distance transport can be realized by continuous hopping under an electrical field [51], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. For PEO electrolyte, the generally accepted view is that ionic conductivity caused by ion migration in amorphous regions of polymer hosts, in which the molecular chains can oscillate above its glass transition temperature (Tg) [81].

The electrochemical/chemical stabilities of solid electrolytes are also important factors to be considered for all-solid-state Na batteries. Comparing to stable electrolytes of β-Al2O3 and NASICON, the sulfides are easy to be decomposed to H2S through hydrolysis in the air [32], [53], [60], [73], [82], [83]. It has been demonstrated that the chemical stability of sulfide electrolytes can be improved by several effective modifications, such as adding soft acid to form strong bonding with sulfur, adjusting the composition to isolate PS43-, and adding metal oxides to absorb H2S [84], [85], [86]. The electrochemical stabilities of batteries are involved into electrode/electrolyte interfaces, electrochemical stable windows and electrolyte variations during long cycling. Among these, the intimate contact interface with large surface area and compatibility to electrode are most important factors to enhance battery performances.

β-Al2O3 and β′′-Al2O3 are early developed Na-ions solid electrolytes for rechargeable high-temperature Na-S batteries [44]. The β-Al2O3 with formula of Na2O·(8–11)Al2O3 has a hexagonal structure (P63/mmc; a0 = 0.559, c0 = 2.261 nm), while β′′-Al2O3 of Na2O·(5−7)Al2O3 has a rhombohedral structure (R3m; a0 = 0.560, c0 = 3.395 nm) [44]. As shown in Fig. 3, Na ions transport pathways in both β- and β′′-Al2O3 are 2D planes, while the differences are chemical stoichiometry and stacking sequence of oxygen ions in conduction layers [43]. The basic unit consists of alternating layers with spinel block and conduction plane, in which the spinel block is four layers stack of oxygen ions with Al ions, and the conduction planes consists of packed oxygen and Na ions. As higher concentration of Na ions in conduction plane with different oxygen stacking sequence, the β′′-Al2O3 has a higher ionic conductivity than β-Al2O3.

For ionic conductivity of Na-β′′-Al2O3, the highest value of 100 mS cm−1 can be obtained in single crystal at room temperature, while the commercial β′′-Al2O3 polycrystalline product only reaches 2 mS cm−1 [66], [67]. Generally the ionic conductivity can be increased with elevated temperature. So the ionic conductivity of

β′′-Al2O3 at 300 °C increases to 1 S cm−1 for single crystal, which is much higher than that of polycrystalline β′′-Al2O3 (0.24 S cm−1 at 300 °C) [2], [44]. However, the highest ionic conductivity for polycrystalline can be increased to 19 mS cm−1 at room temperature in solid electrolyte fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS) [87]. It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivity of β′′-Al2O3 can be enhanced by increasing the concentration of Na ions in conduction plane, and substituting Al ions by doping of Mg2+, Nb5+, Zr4+ and Ti4+ [88], [89], [90], [91]. Furthermore, the optimization of β-Al2O3 and β′′-Al2O3 proportions and adjustment of microstructure are also effective ways to increase ionic conductivities [92], [93].

The Na-β′′-Al2O3 solid electrolytes can be prepared by solid-state reaction, co-precipitation technique, sol-gel process, solution combustion way, spray-freeze/freeze-drying method, microwave heating and mechanochemical methods [42], [88], [91], [94], [95], [96], [97]. For conventional solid-state reaction and solution-based chemical methods, the uniform β′′- Al2O3 with high ionic conductivity is not easy to be obtained because of Na loss, grain growth, moisture sensitivity (caused by byproduct of NaAlO2 along grain boundaries), and inhomogeneity mixed with β-Al2O3 impurity. Recently the β′′- Al2O3 ceramics with anisotropic ionic conductivity were prepared by SPS, which is effective for rapid densification of pure β′′-Al2O3 with automatic c-axis orientation alignment and beneficial for enhancing the ionic conductivity [87]. Further improvement is still required to develop favorable methods for fabricating pure β′′-Al2O3 with high yield of production, low cost and well-controlled microstructure.

Different from Na-ions migrations in 2D planes of layer-structured β′′-Al2O3, the NASICON, like Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) as solid solution of NaZr2P3O12 and Na4Zr2Si3O12, was developed by Hong and Goodenough et al. to offer fast Na ions conduction in 3D diffusion pathways [45], [46]. The composition of NASICON is generally summarized as NaMM’P3O12, in which Na site can be substituted, vacant, or filled in excess, while M and M′ sites are usually occupied by divalent (Mg2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+,…), trivalent (Al3+, Cr3+, Sc3+, Y3+, La3+,…), tetravalent (Ti4+, Ge4+, Sn4+, Nb4+,…), or pentavalent (V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+,…) metal ions to ensure the charge balance [98]. For M and M′ substituted ions, the valences and ionic radius should be carefully screened to enlarge ions channels and weaken the interaction between mobile ions and skeleton atoms. The NASICON has a covalent framework structure consisting of interconnected polyhedral, in which M(M′)O6 octahedra are linked by corner-sharing PO4(SiO4) tetrahedra to form a skeleton structure and large number of interstitial sites as 3D interconnected channels for Na ions migrations (Fig. 4). For widely investigated Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) solid solution, the chemical substitutions are variable in a wide range, resulting in low thermal expansion. Therefore, the NASICON with covalent framework has a high thermal and chemical stability that are beneficial for stable operation of solid-state Na batteries.

The ionic conductivities of NASICON are in the range from 10−4 to 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature (Fig. 5). In order to increase the ionic conductivity for operation of all-solid-state batteries at room temperature, both Na concentration and size of M and M′ cations in AMM’P3O12 should be controlled at the optimum value simultaneously: around 3.3 mol of Na per formula unit and the average size of M cations should be close to 0.72 Å (i.e. the ionic radius of Zr) [68]. Thus, the ionic conductivity of NASICON is variable with different substitute ions at ambient temperature. For example, Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 has highest ionic conductivity of 6.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature for x = 2, and 0.2 S cm−1 at 300 °C, respectively [46]. And 90 wt% NASICON-10 wt% 60Na2O-10 Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass-ceramic composite electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [99]. For Na3+xZr2-xLaxSi2PO12, the ionic conductivity can reach to 3.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature when x = 0.35 [36]. And an optimum total Na-ion conductivity of 4.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature is achieved in Na3.4Sc0.4Zr1.6(SiO4)2(PO4) [34]. Accordingly, element doping is effective for improving ionic conductivities, in which the dopants with low solid solubility can result in improving grain boundary conductivity by forming a conducting secondary phase, and the changes in Si:P ratio within bulk transformation from monoclinic to rhombohedral NASICON [47]. Thus, further research needs to be focused on the strategies to improve the conductivity of NASICON by preparing phase pure and high density products, enhancing microstructure of grain size and boundary, and doping by substituted ions.

The NASICON materials can be synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and spray-freeze/freeze-drying methods [26], [36], [45], [46], [47], [102], [103]. Among these, the products from sol-gel and hydrothermal are more uniform and much easier to be controlled with low content of ZrO2 impurity than that of solid-state reaction, and then high-density and high-purity NASICON pellets can be easily generated. Besides, the fully dense ceramic pellet with high ionic conductivity at room temperature was obtained by SPS [104]. Furthermore, a solution-assisted solid-state reaction has been developed for the synthesis of Sc-substituted NASICON, Na3+xScxZr2‑x(SiO4)2(PO4) (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) [34]. In most recently, Na3+xZr2-xLaxSi2PO12 has been fabricated with introduction of larger La3+ cation, while a new Na3La(PO4)2 phase self-formed by extracting charge carrier ions and anions from the starting material [36]. The new phase plays a positive effect on ion conductivity by creating a concentration variation of Na+ in frame structure, increasing the compact density of composite electrolyte, and promoting ion transport along grain boundary. Besides, 90 wt% NASICON and 10 wt% 60Na2O-10 Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass-ceramic composite electrolyte with low electrical resistivity has been fabricated at low sintering temperature (900 °C) with short time (10 min) [99].

The sulfides electrolytes have attracted much attentions because of high ionic conductivities, excellent mechanical properties for intimate contact between electrode and electrolyte, isotropic ionic conductions without grain boundary resistances, simple manufacturing operations for processing into a film at low temperature, and variable compositions in a wide range [28]. However, sulfides electrolytes have low chemical stabilities in air because of the hydrolysis by water molecular with generation of H2S gas, which should be handled in inert gas atmosphere.

Generally, sulfides electrolytes can be divided into glass and glass-ceramic. In detail, glassy electrolytes with equivalent phase, like Na2S-GeS2, Na2S-SiS2 and xNa2S-(100-x)P2S5, have amorphous structures with high disorders and high concentrations of mobile ions in sublattice [60], [105], [106], [107]. The small electronegativity of sulfur with weak binding ions and big ion radius are beneficial for creating larger ions transport channels, which can meet the primary requirements for fast Na ions migrations.

Glass-ceramic electrolytes that prepared by crystallization of glass precursor have been extensively studied in recent years. For instance, Na3PS4 glass-ceramic electrolyte has both cubic phase (Im; a0 = 6.9965 Å) and tetragonal phase (P421c; a0 = 6.9520 Å, c0 = 7.0757 Å) (Fig. 6) [32]. As can be seen in Fig. 6a, there are Na1 and Na2 sites in cubic Na3PS4, in which ionic conduction is closely related to many aspects, such as Na disorder that induced by Na excess, 3D diffusion pathways along Na1 and Na2 sites, and introduction of Na-vacancies [52]. In order to enhance ionic conductivity, a Na3P1-xAsxS4 (partial substitution of P by As) was synthesized, in which the improvement of conductivity stems from longer Na-S bond length in unstable saddle point structure of transition state that regulated by duel effects of alloying [73]. As Na3PS4 is unstable in the air that caused by high affinity between S and O, a stable Na3SbS4 with tetragonal structure (P421c; a0 = 7.15270 Å, c0 = 7.2874 Å) and 3D Na ions diffusion pathways was recently designed to address this issue (Fig. 6b) [33]. The Na3SbS4 exhibits not only superior ionic conductivity at room temperature, but also outstanding air stability and good compatibility to metallic Na anode, which is considered as a promising candidate for all-solid-state Na metal batteries [53], [108]. Most recently, a tetragonal Na4-xSn1-xSbxS4 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.33, space group I41/acd) with fast 3D ionic conduction pathways has been developed, which is different from Na4SnS4 or Na3SbS4 [54]. The new solid electrolytes showed a high ionic conductivity (0.2–0.5 mS cm−1 at 30 °C), excellent dry-air stability, no H2S evolution in contact with water, and reversible precipitation from homogeneously dissolved aqueous solution. As ionic diffusions are effected greatly by size of transfer channels and type of anion substitutions, the cubic Na3PSe4 (I43m; a0 = 7.31359 Å) has been synthesized in order to provide a more appropriate framework for diffusions of Na cations because of bigger atomic radius of Se than S [51]. However, it's more likely that the formation of Na vacancies in Na3PSe4 plays a key role to achieve fast Na-ions diffusions, not the direct linkage with specific polymorph or composition [50], [83]. Recently, Na10SnP2S12 and Na11Sn2PS12 have been obtained, which showed higher ionic conductivity at room temperature and more stable in battery applications than cubic Na3PS4 [35], [55], [56].

The sulfides electrolytes usually exhibit higher ionic conductivity than that of oxides because the electronegativity of sulfur (with larger atomic radius) is smaller than that of oxygen, which leads to a smaller electrostatic force between Na and S in framework [32], [49], [50], [51]. Also the ionic conductivity can be enhanced by precipitation of superionic conducting crystal from glass precursor, and low grain-boundary resistance, in which crystal domains are filled with amorphous phases. Therefore, the ionic conductivity of Na3PS4 (cubic structure) can achieve 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature with low activation energy of 27 kJ mol−1 in the temperature range of 27–270 °C (Fig. 7), which is higher than that of xNa2S-(100-x)P2S5 glass electrolyte (∼ 10−5 S cm−1) [32], [105]. The ionic conductivity of Na3PS4 can be increased effectively by partial substitutions from anions (like Se2-, Cl-, Br- and I-) and cations (including As3+, Ge4+,Ti4+, Si4+, and Sb4+) [109], [110], [111]. Among these, the cubic Na3PSe4 (Se-substitution of S in Na3PS4) has high ionic conductivity of 1.16 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature and low activation energy of 0.21 eV [51]. Also the tetragonal Na2.9375PS3.9375Cl0.0625 that generated by SPS process has ionic conductivity of 1.14 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, while xNaI·(100-x)Na3PS4 showed an ionic conductivity of ~ 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 with x = 29 [82], [109]. Furthermore, Na3P0.62As0.38S4 exhibits high ionic conductivity of 1.46 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature [73]. Moreover, the ionic conductivity of Na3PS4 has been improved to 7.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature by combining 6 mol% Na4SiS4 [112]. The air stable Na3SbS4 has ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature with an active energy of 0.22 eV, and the ionic conductivity of tetragonal Na4-xSn1-xSbxS4 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.33) is 0.2–0.5 mS cm−1 at 30 °C [33], [54]. For Na10SnP2S12 and Na11Sn2PS12, the ionic conductivities are 0.4 × 10−3 and (1.4–4.0) × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively [35], [55], [56].

The typical preparation process of sulfides electrolyte is mechanical ball milling and low-temperature heating treatment of precursors [60], [106]. As the instability of sulfides electrolytes in air, all processes should be protected under inert atmosphere. The glassy electrolytes can be obtained by heating crystalline materials above the melting point and followed by quickly cooling to below Tg, which have chemically distinct from mechanically deformed materials. For example, Na2S-GeS2 and Na2S-P2S5 have been prepared by melt-quenching with mechanical milling followed by alloying, respectively [106], [107]. Differently, glass-ceramic electrolyte needs to be prepared by crystallization of glass precursor. For instance, the cubic and tetragonal Na3PS4 can be fabricated by heating Na2S-P2S5 at 270 °C and 420 °C, respectively [32], [106]. And Na3P1-xAsxS4 has been synthesized by ball milling of Na2S, P2S5 and As2S5 powders, followed by heating the cold pressed pellet at 270 °C for 2 h [73]. Similarly, Na3SbS4 was fabricated by melting Na metal, Sb and S with stoichiometric proportion for sequential solid-state reaction, in which the final product was obtained by ball milling of resultant ingot [33]. Besides, the synthesis of Na3PSe4 from well-mixed Na2Se, red phosphorus and Se powder with stoichiometric ratio can be performed in a boron nitride tube at a synthesis temperature of 300 °C under a continuous flow of dry argon gas [51].

Compared to inorganic solid electrolytes, the solid polymer electrolytes have several advantages, such as mechanical flexibility, light weight, low cost, convenience of fabrication process, and accommodation of volume changes of electrodes during charging/discharging, which have been extensively studied for all-solid-state Na batteries. The early Na-ions polymer electrolyte was started from dissolving Na salt in polyethylene oxide (PEO) solvent to form cations and anions, in which Na cations were solvated by polymer chains and became movable through the connected chains [113]. The ions transportability within electrolyte has been significantly affected by the number of free Na cations and their moving ability along polymer chains. However, the high ionic conductivity at room temperature is still difficult to be achieved for polymer electrolytes, as the sufficiently amorphous chain segments for ion transport can only be obtained above Tg of polymers [114]. So most of polymer electrolytes based solid-state batteries need to be operated at elevated temperature of 60–80 °C, which is close to the melting temperature of Na metal (90 °C) and may cause safety issues of solid-state Na metal batteries. So far, the PEO, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), and poly(ionic liquid) have been explored as host solvent for dissolution of Na salt for polymer electrolytes [57], [74], [114], [115], [116], [117], [118], [119]. As gel polymer electrolytes are prepared by adsorbing liquid electrolyte into polymer frameworks, which are not solid electrolytes and no longer to be discussed here.

Besides single polymer as solvent, the composite electrolytes combining with other organic polymers have been proposed to improve ionic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities. For example, PEO electrolyte blended with succinonitrile (SN), PVP and PANI have been employed as polymer composite electrolytes [77], [120], [121], [122]. Besides, organic-inorganic composite electrolytes have also been prepared by dispersing inorganic fillers into polymer matrix in proportion, in which the fillers can be categorized into inert ceramic powders (AlCl3, BaTiO3, CuO, SiO2, ZrO2, TiO2) and ionic conductors (NASICON) [61], [76], [78], [123], [124], [125], [126]. It has been demonstrated that not only the ionic conductivity, but also the mechanical property and interfacial stability between polymer electrolyte and electrode can be improved greatly by synergistic effect of polymers and inorganic fillers in composite electrolytes [76]. Furthermore, the enhancement of ionic conductivity should be originated from the low crystallinity with decreased Tg of polymer electrolyte (reduced by adding nanosized fillers), high ionic transfer number with decrease of activation energy, and high interfacial ionic conductivity (increased by ions adsorb on high surface of fillers) [31]. Thus, the particle size, surface areas and content of fillers are critical factors to increase the conductivity of composite electrolytes. The mechanical property of composite electrolyte was mainly improved by fillers that acting as a support matrix to retain solid structure, even at high temperatures. Moreover, the electrochemical window and thermal stability of composite electrolytes, and cycling stability of all-solid-state Na batteries can be increased simultaneously [61], [127]. However, there are several problems still need to be solved in composite electrolytes, especially the agglomeration of fillers when the concentration exceeds a critical value, and the reduced flexibility caused by interactions between fillers and polymers [76].

The Na-ions polymer electrolytes have ionic conductivities in the range of 10−5–10−7 S cm−1 at room temperature, which are not sufficient for operating all-solid-state Na batteries (Fig. 8). The earliest PEO-NaClO4 showed ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 60 °C with EO/Na+ molar ratio of 12:1 [115]. Then PEO-NaPF6 has ionic conductivity of 5 × 10−6 S cm−1 with EO/Na+ ≈ 16 [122]. Afterwards, PEO electrolytes with different Na salts, including NaCF3SO3, NaFeF4, NaLaF4, NaAsF6, NaTFSI, and NaFSI have been proposed, while ionic conductivities were still at the low level [31], [75], [79], [113], [128]. Recently, Na[(FSO2)(n-C4F9SO2)N] (NaFNFSI)-PEO with EO/Na+ = 15 exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 3.36 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C and can be applied in all-solid-state Na batteries with sufficient thermal stability and wide electrochemical window (≈ 4.87 V vs. Na+/Na) [59]. Furthermore, a family of fluorine-free Na salts, including sodium pentacyanopropenide (NaPCPI), sodium 2,3,4,5-tetracyanopirolate (NaTCP) and sodium 2,4,5-tricyanoimidazolate (NaTIM) have been investigated, in which PEO-NaTCP shows highest ionic conductivity of 1.24 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 70 °C with high thermal stability and large electrochemical stability window (up to 5 V vs. Na+/Na) [58].

It has been demonstrated that the ionic conductivities can be improved in composite electrolytes. For example, a composite polymer electrolyte comprising of 50%wt PEO-50%wt SN with sodium-triflate (NaCF3SO3) salt exhibits the ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [77]. Furthermore, PEO-PVP with NaF and PEO-PANI with NaClO4 show ionic conductivities of 1.2 × 10−7 and 2.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively [120], [121]. For organic-inorganic composite electrolytes, PEO20-NaClO4–5 wt% TiO2 shows a higher ionic conductivity of 2.62 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C than that of pure PEO-NaClO4 with 1.34 × 10−5 S cm−1 [61]. Also PEO70-(NaHCO3)30-12 wt% SiO2 and PEO20-NaClO4–5% SiO2–70% 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Emim FSI) composite electrolytes have ionic conductivities of 2.04 × 10−5 and 8.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively [129], [130]. Furthermore, the high ionic conductivity of 6.96 × 10−5 S cm−1 for PEO25-NaClO4–5 wt% ZrO2 nanoparticles (4.5 nm) is an order of magnitude higher than pure PEO electrolyte at room temperature [125]. Recently, a hybrid solid electrolyte of PVdF-HFP-Na3Zr2Si2PO12-liquid electrolyte has been prepared with high ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 0 °C, and solvent-free PEO12-NaFSI-Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and PEO12-NaFSI-Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12 composite electrolytes using NASICON nanoparticles as fillers show highest value of 2.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 4.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively [126], [127]. Beside ionic conductivity, the thermal stability, cation transference number, flexibility and mechanical strength can also be enhanced in organic-inorganic composite electrolytes, which are beneficial for operating all-solid-state Na battery at elevated temperature.

Besides PEO based electrolytes, other Na-ions polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivities have also been explored. For instance, the ion conductivity of PAN-24 wt% NaCF3SO3 can be up to 7.13 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature with low activation energy of 0.23 eV [117]. The PVA-30 wt% NaBr has ionic conductivity of 1.362 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 40 °C [131]. And for PVP polymer with different Na salts of NaClO3 and NaClO4, the ionic conductivities at room temperature were not high as that of other polymers [74], [115]. Recently, a hierarchical poly(ionic liquid)-based polymer electrolyte that synthesized via in-situ polymerizing method has high ionic conductivity of 1.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature [119].

The polymer electrolytes are usually fabricated by solution-casting method, in which polymer host and Na salt are dissolved in organic solutions and then poured in PTFE molds for film formation [31], [132]. Also the solvent-free hot pressing technique is effective to make polymer electrolyte film [58]. Furthermore, a cellulose blended NaClO4/PEO polymer electrolyte has been synthesized by combining solution-casting and hot-pressing method, which can improve mechanical properties without hampering ionic conductivity and thermal stability [133]. For poly(ionic liquid) based solid electrolyte, the flexible film has been prepared by in-situ polymerization of precursor solution, which exhibits satisfied thermal and electrochemical stabilities, inherent incombustibility, good mechanical strength and excellent flexibility [119].

As illustrated above, organic polymer electrolytes with high amorphous state can offer high ionic conductivity. However, the crystalline organic solid electrolytes can also be applied as fast Na-ions conductors. For one thing, a co-crystalline NaClO4-(DMF)3 (dimethylformamide) organic electrolyte with hexagonal structure (space group P_62c) can offer linear channels of Na+ and ClO4- in crystallographic c direction and exhibit high ionic conductivity of 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature with low activation barrier of 25 kJ mol−1 (Fig. 9), which was caused by fast ions diffusions through bulk crystal as well as grain boundary [134]. Furthermore, the co-crystalline electrolyte can be melted between 55 and 65 °C with no decomposition, and reversibly returned to solid state after cooling, which are beneficial for penetration of electrolyte into electrodes and improving battery performances, when the battery was treated with liquid NaClO4(DMF)3 at melting state. For another, the plastic crystal electrolytes are also developed by dissolving Na salt into a polar organic molecular solid, which has ordered crystalline structure at low temperature, and occurs solid-solid phase transitions at high temperature because of various rotational/orientational motions and increase in entropy (the solid-state closer to liquid-state with freedom and facile dynamics) [135]. Thus, the plastic crystal solid electrolyte has high ionic conductivity with high thermal and mechanical stabilities. For example, plastic crystal electrolyte of succinonitrile (N≡C(CH2)2CH2-C≡N, SN) with 5 mol% NaPF6 and 5 mol% NaClO4 exhibit high ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature and high electrochemical window up to 4.8 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively [136]. More recently, a new plastic crystal electrolyte of N-methyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium dicyanamide [C1mpyr][N(CN)2]-Na[N(CN)2] shows ionic conductivity of 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C, and N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate [C2mpyr][BF4]/PVDF composite fiber prepared by co-electrospinning has ionic conductivity of 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature [100], [135]. Similarly, a series of trimethylisobutylphosphonium (P111i4) based plastic crystal electrolyte with different Na salts, such as P1i444-NaNTf2 and P1i444-NaFSI have been explored, in which P1i444-20 mol% NaFSI has a high ionic conductivity near 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature [137].

Fig. 9. Temperature-dependent ionic conductivities of crystalline organic solid electrolytes, Na-rich anti-perovskites and Na-borohydrides solid electrolytes. Two lines for Na2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 represent the heating-cooling processes. The ionic conductivities are summarized from Refs. [62], [64], [65], [134], [136], [137], [138], [139].

Besides, other inorganic solid electrolytes, like Na-rich anti-perovskites and Na-borohydrides have also been proposed (Fig. 9). The Na-rich anti-perovskites of Na3OX (X = Cl, Br, I) have large structural tolerance, in which the ionic conductivity can be improved by divalent alkali-earth metal doping, non-stoichiometric mixtures and mismatch substitution, which can be up to 10−3 S cm−1 at about 200 °C [62]. Furthermore, the uniform and high compact Na3OBr solid electrolyte has been obtained by SPS, accompanying by lower amount of pores when compared to cold-pressed sample [140]. Moreover, the interfacial impedance and activation energy can also be reduced. However, the unreacted NaBr impurity still exist in main phase of cubic Na3OBr and thus, the bulk conductivity of Na3OBr is low (10−7 S cm−1 at 180 °C), which needs to be further improved.

The Na-borohydrides composed of Na+ as center and borohydrogen anions as surrounds have also been demonstrated as Na-ions conductors [141], [142]. Based on NaBH4 (Fm-3 m; a0 = 0.61571 Å) and NaNH2 (Fddd; a0 =0.89613 Å, b0 =1.0454 Å, c0 =0.80727 Å), Na(BH4)-Na(NH2)-NaI and Na(BH4)0.5(NH2)0.5 composite electrolytes exhibit the ionic conductivity of 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively, originating from specific anti-perovskite structure with vacancies in Na site [139]. And as structural transition from low-temperature monoclinic to high-temperature cubic phase, the Na2B12H12 has fast Na+ diffusion with superior conductivity of 0.1 S cm−1 around 250 °C (Fig. 9) [143], [144]. Similarly, the disordered Na2B10H10 with fcc phase above 80 °C exhibits a higher ionic conductivity than Na2B12H12 and a favorable air-stability at room temperature [138]. Recently, the pseudobinary (Na2B10H10)0.25-(Na2B12H12)0.75 composite electrolyte obtained by mechanically ball-milling shows partial stability and high ions conductivity up to 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [64]. Also Na2(B12H12)0.5(B10H10)0.5 composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity (close to 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature) demonstrates highly thermal stability, large electrochemical stability window and good compatibility to Na metal anode [64], [65].

As both ionic conductor and separator, the solid electrolyte layer is sandwiched between compressed powder electrode layers (positive and negative electrode) to fabricate bulk-type all-solid-state Na batteries (Fig. 1), in which electrode layers are composed of active materials and solid electrolyte. Accordingly, Na ions diffuse from active material to solid electrolyte by migration across the interface, and electrons transfer from active material to collectors through conduction paths of conductive additive (acetylene black in electrode layers). Based on various solid electrolytes that discussed above, all-solid-state Na batteries can be classified as inorganic solid-electrolyte batteries and organic solid electrolyte batteries. Although inorganic solid electrolytes exhibit high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and high safety and thermal stability, the corresponding all-solid-state batteries still have several challenges: large interfacial resistance between electrode and electrolyte, poor interfacial compatibility of electrode/electrolyte during volume change of electrodes (caused by Na+ insertions/extractions), insufficient contact area with limited ions transport pathways, and low ratio of active material in electrolyte-electrode composite [28]. Differently, organic solid electrolyte batteries have the advantages of favorable contact on the interface, high level of safety, flexibility of shape and size, light weight and simple fabrication. However, all-solid-state batteries are suffered by poor electrochemical performances at room temperature with low ionic conductivity of electrolyte, instability of electrode/electrolyte interface for long cycles, limited operating temperature, and inferior mechanical stability. For composite solid electrolytes by dispersing inorganic fillers into polymer electrolytes, the corresponding batteries can also be seen as organic solid electrolyte batteries, in which the overall performances could be enhanced by improving ionic conductivity, electrochemical window, thermal/mechanical stability and interfacial stability between electrolyte and electrode [36], [126], [145]. Therefore, for all-solid-state Na batteries, besides high ionic conductivities of solid electrolytes, the intimate contact with large area for sufficient ions conduction at electrode-electrolyte interface, and mechanical/structural stability of interfaces are critical factors for improving the electrochemical performances.

The cathode materials that used in all-solid-state Na batteries are similar to that of liquid-electrolyte based batteries, such as sodium layered metal oxides (NaCoO2, Na2/3[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2, Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, NaCu1/9Ni2/9Fe1/3Mn1/3O2), NASICON-related phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3, NaTi2(PO4)3) and sulfide (TiSx). The most common anode materials are Na metal and Na alloy [32], [40], [59], [63], [64], [126], [146], [147], [148], [149], [150], [151]. Thus, the interfaces in all-solid-state Na batteries are involved into cathode/electrolyte interface and metal anode/electrolyte interface. In this section, several approaches for forming interfaces and enhancing contact areas between electrolyte and electrode are discussed, in which the architectures of all-solid-state batteries as well as electrochemical performances are also demonstrated.

As most of cathodes are composed of powder materials for bulk-type solid-state Na batteries, the poor interfacial contact between electrolyte and cathode has negative effect on the performances of solid-state batteries. So far, there are many strategies for forming intimate interfaces, which can be classified into to following aspects.

The common approach to fabricate the interfacial contact is preparing composite cathode that mixed by active material and electrolyte, which have been widely adopted in both inorganic and organic solid electrolytes batteries (Fig. 10a). For inorganic solid electrolyte, the nanocomposite can be obtained by mechanical milling process. For example, the composite cathode consisting of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) has been prepared by ball-milling, and the all-solid-state symmetric NVP-NZSP/NZSP/NVP-NZSP batteries showed favorable discharge capacity at room temperature and high reversibility at elevated temperature (200 °C) [148]. For sulfides electrolytes, the Na3PS4-Na2S-C composite cathode was prepared by mechanical milling of Na3PS4, Na2S and acetylene black in a stainless steel pot under an Ar atmosphere [152]. Using NaSn alloy as negative electrode, the all-solid-state Na-S battery exhibited a high reversible capacity of 869.2 mAh g−1 with an excellent cycling stability and rate capabilities at 60 °C. Also the solid-state battery with well-mixed TiS2/Na3PS4 nano-powders as composite cathode and Na-Sn alloy as anode showed an average discharge voltage of 1.6 V and reversible capacity of 90 mA h g−1 for 10 cycles [32]. Moreover, the composite electrodes prepared for (TiS2-Na3.75Sn0.75Sb0.25S4)/Na3.75Sn0.75Sb0.25S4/Na-Sn all-solid-state Na batteries demonstrate high capacity of 201 mA h g−1 with excellent reversibility. Similar process based on Na3PS4 have been achieved in all-solid-state NaCrO2/Na3PS4/Na15Sn4 battery, which can retain about 60 mA h g−1 for 15 cycles at room temperature [153]. Furthermore, the composite cathodes based on 94Na3PS4–6Na4SiS4, Na3-xPS4-xClx (x = 6.25%) and Na3+xMxP1-xS4 (M = Ge4+, Sn4+) (x = 0, 0.1) solid electrolytes have also been explored for all-solid-sate Na-ion batteries, demonstrating sulfide electrolytes have great merits for decreasing grain boundaries and making favorable solid-solid contacts by cold pressing without hot treatment [109], [111], [112]. Even for Na-borohydrides electrolytes, the composite cathode can be prepared by mixing TiS2 and Na2B10H10-Na2B12H12, and the corresponding all-solid-state battery shows a high initial charge capacity (∼ 237 mA h g−1) with stable cycling stability [64].

For the fabrication of composite electrode, the heterogeneous inorganic solid electrolyte powders and active material are firstly physically/mechanically mixed (may cause the aggregation of each component), followed by cold-pressing, which is not enough to form void-free dense composites with intimate contact, or not sufficient for improving the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state batteries. Fortunately, for organic solid electrolyte, the composite cathode can be prepared by well mixing of active materials and polymer electrolytes in the solvent. For example, by fabricating the cathode sheets with mixing of NaCu1/9Ni2/9Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (65 wt%), super P (10 wt%), NaFNFSI-PEO (EO/Na+ = 15) SPE (20 wt%), and PVDF (5 wt%) in a quantitative acetonitrile under strong agitation, the composite cathode/NaFNFSI-PEO/Na all-solid-state battery can afford high initial reversible capacity (122.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C), good cycling performance (capacity retention of 70% after 150 cycles at 1 C), and excellent rate capability [59].

Besides solid composite electrode, the organic liquid electrolyte and ionic liquid have been applied as wetting agent to enhance the tight contact between cathode and solid electrolyte (Fig. 10b). As liquid electrolyte is unstable at high temperature, the ionic liquid is preferably to be adopted because of nonflammability, nonvolatility, high thermal and electrochemical stability. For instance, a small amount of N-methyl-N-propylpiperidinium-bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (PP13FSI) ionic liquid has been used at cathode side of Na3V2(PO4)3/IL/Na3+xZr2-xLaxSi2PO12/Na all-solid-state battery, which has low interfacial resistance (close to the battery added with liquid electrolyte) and exhibits an initial charge capacity of 116 mA h g−1 under a current of 0.2 C at room temperature, and high capacity of 90 mA h g−1 after 10,000 cycles at 10 C with full reversibility [126]. More recently, a toothpaste-like cathode by using Na0.66Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 and N-Alkyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium-bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PY14FSI) ionic liquid has been synthetized via non-sintered method for improving the contact area (between cathode and Na-β′′-Al2O3 ceramic pellet) and ionic transfer in all-solid-state Na batteries, which deliver a capacity of 80 mA h g−1 in voltage range of 2.5–3.8 V at 0.1 C, superior stability with capacity retention of 90% after 10,000 cycles at 6 C, and thermal stability with capacity of 79 mA h g−1 at 70 °C [147].

Another effective approach for forming intimate interface is surface coating of active material particles by thin films of solid electrolytes (Fig. 10c). For example, the solid-liquid interfaces can be achieved by heating glass electrolytes at around glass transition temperature, followed by favorable contacts after cooled down to room temperature. Furthermore, besides heating-cooling process, the solution-processed solidified Na3SbS4 coating on NaCrO2 nanoparticles have been proposed as cathodes, which provide intimate ionic contact for improving the utilization of active material in all-solid-state batteries over conventional mixed electrodes [33]. With much more uniform distributions of solid electrolytes with active materials, the solid-state battery based on Na3SbS4-coated NaCrO2 shows discharge capacity of 108 mA h g−1, which is almost the same value as that of liquid-electrolyte battery.

It has been demonstrated that the interfacial resistance can be reduced by making interlayer/interphase for ions transports between solid electrolytes and cathodes. For instance, a plastic-crystal electrolyte interphase consisting of SN and NaClO4 has been introduced to enhance the interfacial contact between Na3Zr2(Si2PO12) pellet and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode [63]. As shown in Fig. 10d, like liquid electrolyte, all the active particles of cathode can be surrounded by plastic-crystal electrolyte, in which the stable contact can be kept between cathode and electrolyte, especially for volume changes during Na ions insertions/extractions. Therefore, all-solid-state Na3V2(PO4)3-Na3Zr2(Si2PO12)-NaClO4-SN/Na3Zr2(Si2PO12)/Na battery exhibited charge capacity of 115 mAh g−1 and discharge capacity of 112 mA h g−1 with a slight polarization of about 30 mV, and cycling stability for 100 cycles at 1 C with 98% of initial capacity.

Taking the advantage of both inorganic ceramics and organic polymers, the composite electrolytes have been proposed to provide improved ionic conductivity with high flexibility for reducing the interfacial resistances between solid electrolytes and electrodes (Fig. 10e). For instance, using Na3Zr2Si2PO12-PVdF-HFP-NaFSI-TEGDME hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE), the NaFePO4/HSE/Na all-solid-state battery shows discharge capacity of ∼ 131 mA h g−1 and 2% irreversible charge capacity at initial cycle, and the NaFePO4/HSE/hard carbon full battery has an average voltage of 2.6 V, a discharge capacity of ∼ 120 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and good capacity retention of 96% after 200 cycles [127]. Surprisingly, for the solvent-free Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12-PEO-NaFSI composite polymer electrolyte (CPE), the Na3V2(PO4)3/CPE/Na all-solid-state battery delivers a reversible capacity of 106 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 94.0% at 0.1 C, and a superior cycling stability without obvious capacity loss after 120 cycles [126].

The structural design of electrode and battery are also effective approaches for making intimate interfaces of solid electrolytes and cathodes. For example, the Na3V2(PO4)3 nanofibers with 3D network structure has been fabricated for offering short diffusion pathways of fast ions transport, high surface area for interfacial contact between electrode and electrolyte, structural stability to avoid the agglomeration, and high packing density when compared to particle materials (Fig. 10f) [149]. Thus the Na3V2(PO4)3/PEO-NaClO4-Al2O3/Na all-solid-state battery shows a high reversible capacity of 107 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C and excellent cycling stability with 87.5% capacity retained after 1000 cycles at 2 C. Moreover, an amorphous TiS3 was applied to make TiS3/Na3PS4/Na15Sn4 solid-state battery with high discharge capacity of 300 mAh g−1 because of the amorphous structural flexibility and no volume change during Na ions insertions/extractions [151].

For all-solid-state Na batteries, the anode/electrolyte interfaces are mainly focused on the interfacial contact between Na metal/alloy and solid electrolytes with formation of pathways for fast ions transports, and Na metal should be plated/stripped reversibly without obvious dendrites. It has been demonstrated that the interfaces are more stable and intimate between polymer electrolytes and Na anode than that of inorganic solid electrolytes, where Na dendrite formation is unavoidable and followed by penetrations of grain boundaries. Moreover, the interfacial contact will not intimate after volume changes of Na anode thin film over charge/discharge cycles, which causes the decay of cycling stability. Thus, the interfacial modifications between Na anode and inorganic solid electrolyte are essential to reduce resistance and enhance the performance of all-solid-state Na metal batteries.

For the assembling of all-solid-state Na batteries with electrolyte pellet, Na metal foil was generally pressed on one side of solid electrolyte under a pressure to make interfacial contact (Fig. 11a). However, following this cold pressing process, the interfaces are not intimate and an interval appears between Na anode and solid electrolytes, which are not favorable for keeping the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state Na batteries. Furthermore, Na dendrite formation may be much easier with point contact for interface, where grain boundaries of solid electrolyte pellets will be penetrated easily and the interval will be enlarged. From a comparative study on exploring the stability and viability of solid electrolytes against metallic Na anode, the Na-β′′-Al2O3 based battery showed much more stability and interfacial property, while there was a continuously growing interphase between Na3PS4 and Na metal, which should be caused by interfacial kinetics [154].

Similar to cathode/electrolyte interface, the organic liquid electrolyte can be used as wetting agent to enhance interfacial contact between Na anode and solid electrolyte at room temperature (Fig. 11b). The stability at high temperature is still need to be improved. Besides, it is supposed that liquid Na metal could be an ideal electrode for the complete connection with much lower polarization with solid electrolyte. However, it was not real in the high temperature Na/β′′-Al2O3/S system [155]. Furthermore, the surface of inorganic electrolytes can also be wetted by liquid metallic Na to decrease the interfacial resistance at high temperature, however, the inhibition of dendrite formation during battery cycling are not improved. More worse, the solid electrolytes, like NASICON-type ceramics, have a low stability and element was easy to be reduced when in contact with molten Na [156].

The interlayer can be added or formed for ions transports between Na anode and solid electrolytes to reduce the interfacial resistance and enhance the contact (Fig. 11c). The polymer electrolyte layer with sufficient ions transport pathways has been used to improve solid-state battery performances. For example, a dry Na+ conductive polymer layer of cross-linked poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (CPMEA) has been added between Na metal and solid electrolyte, and all-solid-state NaTi2(PO4)3/CPMEA/NASICON/CPMEA/Na battery shows high capacity of 102 mA h g−1 for 70 cycles at 0.2 C at 65 °C with high coulombic efficiency, indicating that interface interstitial layer has a good capability for dendrite suppression [156]. Furthermore, another interface interstitial layer has been in-situ created by heating Na metal at 380 °C on the surface of NASICON pellets (H-NASICON) [156]. Although the surface of NASICON was partially reduced, the in-situ formed black interlayer was amorphous and can be used as Na+ conductive thin layer. Therefore, from better wetting and adhesion across Na/H-NASICON interface, the resistance of Na/H-NASICON/Na is obviously lowered from 4000 to 400 Ω cm−2, and all-solid-state NaTi2(PO4)3/H-NASICON/Na battery exhibited high capacity of ∼ 110 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C for first 25 cycles and 75 mA h g−1 at 1 C during following 35 cycles. Besides ionic conductor, the electronic additive can also be used as buffer layer to reduce the resistance between anode and solid electrolyte. With addition of nano-carbon material AB to anode, the increase of resistance (caused by Na15Sn4) after charge process can be restricted, and rate performance of solid-state a-TiS3/Na3PS4/Na15Sn4 battery can be improved simultaneously [157].

The surface coating is an effective approach to make intimate contact between cathode and solid electrolyte, which can also be used for Na anode (Fig. 11d). However, there is little report on this aspect in all-solid-state Na battery, which has been applied in liquid-electrolyte batteries and solid-state Li batteries. For example, a deposition of Al2O3 thin layer on Na metal via low-temperature plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) can effectively prevent further reaction of Na metal with electrolyte and suppress dendrite growth, which are favorable for the improvement of electrochemical performance in liquid electrolyte based Na batteries [158]. Furthermore, the molecular layer deposition (MLD) for protection of Na anode in carbonate-based electrolyte was developed to form an inorganic-organic hybrid coating layer on anode surface, which is mechanically flexible and chemically stable for repeated Na plating/stripping on surface of Na anode [159]. Thus, this approach can be adopted for interfacial treatment by combining melting Na in solid-state batteries, in which the electrochemical performances could be improved.

The rechargeable Na based batteries have been proposed as the promising alternative of Li based batteries because of low cost and high abundance of Na resources in Earth's crust. And the all-solid-state Na batteries based on solid electrolytes are more preferable for large-scale energy storage owing to high safety and stability better than the liquid electrolyte with inflammability and explosive. So far, various Na-ions solid electrolytes have been developed, including the β/β′′-Al2O3, NASICON, sulfides, polymers, crystalline organic solid electrolytes, anti-perovskites and borohydrides. Among these, the inorganic solid electrolytes such as Na-β/β′′-Al2O3 and NASICON, show higher ionic conductivities and relative stabilities at room temperature, but are still suffered by the poor compatibility to the electrode materials. Although the sulfides exhibit high ionic conductivity and soft interfaces with electrodes, the poor chemical stabilities in the air are not beneficial for the battery performances. The polymer have the mechanical flexibility and good interfacial compatibility, however, the long cycling stability of all-solid-state Na batteries cannot be achieved as the low ionic conductivities at room temperature, and the poor interfacial and electrochemical stabilities during charging/discharging. Therefore, the applications of all-solid-state Na batteries are still hindered by deficiencies of solid electrolytes and untight contacts with large interfacial resistances between electrodes and solid electrolytes, which play crucial effect on the total battery performances (Fig. 12).

The challenges of low ionic conductivity, weak electrochemical stability and poor mechanical property of solid electrolytes can be overcome by several methods. For one thing, the structural integration for the materials design as an effective way should be firstly taken into attention. For inorganic solid electrolytes, the ionic conductivities and electrochemical stabilities can be improved by substitution or dopants. For example, the ionic conductivities of NASICON can be increased by dual elements doping. Similarly, the ionic conductivities of sulfides can be improved by substituting different anion species and adding Na oxides/sulfur, which can increase the Na concentration and the decrease the activation energy for ions transports. However, increasing the amount of network modifiers with Na compounds may facilitate the crystallization of glass, which are not favorable for the increase of ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the instability of sulfides electrolytes in the air, that is, the H2S gas generation should be suppressed by partial substitution of oxygen for sulfur in sulfides. For polymer electrolytes, the ionic conductivities at room temperature can be increased by blending, copolymerization and cross-linking with molecular chains. Besides, the composite polymer electrolytes by combining organic polymer and inorganic fillers seem to be more effective to improve the ionic conductivities and mechanical properties. For another, the fabricating process of solid electrolytes should be optimized. It has been considered that for the inorganic electrolytes, the SPS technique can make high density ceramic pellet with high ionic conductivity at room temperature. However, mechanical properties of solid electrolytes with low elastic modulus and high ductility to the electrodes are preferred to be achieved by fabrication process. Thus the new technique for the synthesis of solid electrolytes should be proposed in the future. And the in-situ polymerization should be more adopted for preparing the polymer electrolytes, no matter the single or composite electrolytes. Last but not least, the new solid electrolytes with proper structures and superior properties should be designed by combining the theoretical calculations, experimental investigations and advanced characterizations. Thus, not only the intrinsic properties should be increased, but also the understanding of ions transport mechanism should be further explored.

Another big challenge for developing all-solid-state Na batteries is the interfacial issue, especially the large interfacial resistance and poor compatibility between electrode and electrolyte (Fig. 12). Moreover, the electrodes suffer volume change during Na+ insertions/extractions, which cause the insufficient contact area with reduced ions transport pathways and poor cycling stabilities of batteries. The interfacial stability is very important for the configurations and operations of all-solid-state batteries. Thus, the intimate contact, sufficient/fast ions transport pathways, and mechanical/structural stability at the electrode-electrolyte interface are crucial for improving the battery performances. Several approaches are effective to form the favorable interfaces of the cathode/electrolyte, like composite materials from active material and electrolyte, wetting agent on the interface, surface coating by electrolyte, interlayer/interphase, composite electrolyte and structural design of electrode. As the contact is rigid between cathode and inorganic solid electrolytes, a wetting agent and soft thin interlayer/interphase with high ions diffusions and stabilities are preferable to offer high interfacial stability and fast diffuse rate of ions across the interface, which are beneficial for improving the battery performances. Besides, the solid electrolytes with low elastic modulus, the active materials with small volume changes during charge/discharge, the nanosized particles with short ions diffusion pathways are also instructive to improve the battery performances. For the polymer electrolytes batteries, the interfacial issues are much easier to be solved. In addition, for the interfaces between Na anode and electrolytes, the interlayer between them are considered to be more effective to reduce the resistance. However, the formation of Na dendrite are still not fully restrained or eliminated, and the anode protection still needs to be achieved by suitable approaches. Thus, further research is required to make intimate interfaces with high stabilities between electrodes and solid electrolytes to construct the high performance all-solid-state Na batteries.

Besides the electrolytes and interfacial issues that fully discussed in this review, some other aspects, like the fundamental understanding of the ions transports mechanisms in both the interfaces and the bulk batteries during the charge/discharge, and the battery constructions that consisting of composite cathodes, solid electrolytes and Na metal anode, are need to be further explored for all-solid-state Na batteries. The ions transports on the interfaces are much more critical for understanding the interfacial process and enhancing the electrochemical performances of all-solid-state Na batteries. And experimental and theoretical calculation approaches are preferred to be combined for further development. The design of battery construction is also important for optimizing the performances of all-solid-state Na batteries. Besides the conventional techniques, the integration of composite cathodes by SPS and 3D printer, are considered as the advanced fabrication methods to design optimum microstructures for all-solid-state batteries. Thus, much more research on all-solid-state batteries are still needed for the deeper understanding of fundamental mechanism and accelerating its process of the practicality.
