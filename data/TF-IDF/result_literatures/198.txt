Exhalative mineral assemblages from fumaroles of Tolbachik volcano are very rich in anhydrous sulphate minerals of alkali and transition metals. Koryakite, ideally NaKMg2Al2(SO4)6, was found in a Yadovitaya fumarole of the Second scoria cone of the North Breach of the Great Tolbachik Fissure Eruption (1975-1976), Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. Koryakite occurs as a product of fumarolic activity and closely associates with euchlorine and langbeinite. Koryakite is trigonal, a = 8.1124(11), c = 22.704(7) Å, V = 1294.0(5) Å3. The chemical composition determined by electron-microprobe analysis is (wt. %): Na2O 4.27, K2O 5.85, ZnO 0.31, СaO 0.31, CuO 0.76, MgO 10.15, Al2O3 11.47, Fe2O3 2.73, SO3 64.33, SiO2 0.13, total 100.31. The empirical formula calculated on the basis of 24 O apfu is Na1.03K0.93(Mg1.89Cu0.07Ca0.04Zn0.03)(Al1.68Fe3+0.26)(S6.02Si0.02)O24. No natural or synthetic chemical analogues of koryakite are known to date. Topology of [M2+2M3+2(SO4)6]2- heteropolyhedral framework in koryakite is very similar to the one in millosevichite Al2(SO4)3 and mikasaite Fe3+2(SO4)3. Replacement of the part of the trivalent cations in [M3+2(SO4)3]0 framework by divalent cations provides the negative charge of the framework in koryakite and allows the incorporation of the alkali species in the channels. This structural mechanism is reminiscent of the concept of stuffed derivative structures. Koryakite is also structurally related to synthetic NaMgFe3+(SO4)3 and to the broader family of NASICON-related phases.
Anhydrous sulphates of alkali and/or transition metals are very sensitive to moist air. Due to this fact, the number of described to date anhydrous sulphate mineral species with transition and alkali metals is limited. A number of these minerals are known from active volcanic fumaroles with oxidizing environments. Exhalative mineral assemblages from fumaroles of the First and Second scoria cones, Great Fissure Tolbachik eruption (GFTE) 1975-76 (Fedotov and Markhinin, 1983) are very rich in anhydrous sulphate minerals of alkali and transition metals (mostly Cu2+) (Vergasova and Filatov, 2012).
Herein we report on the chemical composition, structure and properties of koryakite (Cyrillic: корякит), NaKMg2Al2(SO4)6. The mineral is named for the Koryaks, ethnic group who are the original inhabitants living on the Kamchatka peninsula. Both the mineral and the mineral name were approved by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the International Mineralogical Association (proposal 2018-013). Type material is deposited at the Mineralogical Museum, St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia (catalogue no. 1/19688).
Koryakite occurs as a product of fumarolic activity. It was found in June 2016 in the Yadovitaya fumarole, Second scoria cone, North Breach, Great Fissure eruption, Tolbachik volcano, Kamchatka, Russia. The Second Scoria Cone is located approximately 18 km SSW of the active shield volcano Ploskiy Tolbachik (Fedotov and Markhinin, 1983). Koryakite closely associates with euchlorine (Fig. 1) and langbeinite. Koryakite is a fumarolic mineral that is deposited directly from volcanic gas emissions as a sublimate. The temperature of gases at the sampling location was approximately 300°C. All the recovered samples were immediately packed and isolated when collected to avoid any contact with the external atmosphere.
Koryakite is colourless (Fig. 1), has a white streak and vitreous lustre. The mineral is brittle with uneven fracture. Cleavage or parting has not been observed. Hardness corresponds to 2 – 3 on the Mohs’ scale. The density could not be measured due to the lack of appropriate sample, but it has been calculated as 2.892 g cm-3 using structural data and the empirical formula. No fluorescence is detected.

One crystal (110×55 μm in size) was mounted in epoxy resin and polished with oil suspension. The mineral has been analysed by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The EDS analyses (N = 8) (Table 1) were obtained using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-Max 20 Energy Dispersive Spectrometer. The electron beam accelerating voltage was 20 kV and the current 1.8 nA; defocused beam (10 m spot size) was used and the X-ray acquisition time was 30 s. The mineral is stable under electron beam; no surface damage was observed after analyses.
The empirical formula calculated on the basis of 24 O apfu is Na1.03K0.93(Mg1.89Cu0.07Ca0.04Zn0.03)(Al1.68Fe3+0.26)(S6.02Si0.02)O24. The simplified formula is NaKMg2Al2(SO4)6, which requires Na2O = 4.18, K2O = 6.36, MgO = 10.88, Al2O3 = 13.76, SO3 = 64.83, total = 100.00 (wt.%).
Koryakite is soluble in warm H2O.
Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku R-AXIS Rapid II single-crystal diffractometer equipped with cylindrical image plate detector using Debye-Scherrer geometry (CoKα radiation, d = 127.4 mm). For the powder-diffraction study, a Gandolfi-like motion was used to randomize the sample. Data (in Å) are given in Table 2. Unit cell parameters refined from the powder data processed using osc2xrd software (Britvin et al. 2017) are as follows: rhombohedral, space group , a = 8.1129(2) Å, c = 22.7064(9) Å, V = 1294.28(8) Å3 and Z = 3. 
A transparent platy crystal fragment of koryakite was mounted on a thin glass fiber for Xray diffraction analysis using a Bruker APEX II DUO X-ray diffractometer with a micro-focus Xray tube operated with MoKα radiation at 50 kV and 40 mA. The data were integrated and corrected for absorption using a multi-scan type model implemented in the Bruker programs APEX and SADABS (Bruker-AXS, 2014). More than a hemisphere of X-ray diffraction data was collected. The structure was solved by direct methods and refinement by means of the SHELX program (Sheldrick, 2015) in the R ̅ space group converged to R1 = 0.072 (Table 3). The twinning matrix [0 -1 0, -1 0 0, 0 0 1] was employed during the crystal structure refinement. The refined twin ratio of the two components was 0.199 (1):0.801 (1). The M2 site was modelled on an Mg scattering curve (Mg being the major component) and the resulting site occupancy factor of 1.07(2) is supporting the proposed mixed composition for M2 site based on the EDS analysis (Table 1). The final model included anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms. The final atomic coordinates and anisotropic displacement parameters are given in Table 4, 5 and selected interatomic distances in Table 6. Bond-valence sums are given in Table 4. All bond-valence parameters were taken from Brese and O’Keeffe (1991). All of the bond-valence sums are in good agreement with the expected oxidation states for all atoms.

 The crystal structure of koryakite contains five symmetrically independent cationic sites (Fig. 2, Table 4). K and Na sites are occupied exclusively by K+ and Na+ cations, respectively. K site is symmetrically coordinated by six bonds K-O4 = 2.819(5) Å and by six K-O1 =3.258(5) Å.KO46 polyhedron is a trigonal antiprism. The similar coordination environments are observed for Na site with six Na-O3 = 2.492(5) Å and six Na-O2 = 3.249(5) Å.
There are two octahedrally coordinated M sites. An octahedral M1 site is occupied exclusively by Al3+ and Fe3+ cations. Refined ratio of Al: Fe (Table 4) is close to the one obtained by microprobe analysis. M2 site is predominantly occupied by Mg2+ cations and its full occupation by various divalent cations was fixed in agreement with microprobe data. M1 - O bonds in M3+1O6 octahedron are shorter than M2-O bonds in M2+2O6 (Table 6). Both of the octahedra are slightly distorted.
 One S site is compatible with occupancy by S6+ and tetrahedrally coordinated by O anions. The distance is 1.472 Å, which is in an excellent agreement with distance of 1.473 Å reported for sulphate minerals by Hawthorne et al. (2000).
M3+1O6 and M2+2O6 octahedra are isolated from each other in the structure of koryakite. The SO4 tetrahedron shares each of its vertices with M3+1O6 and M2+2O6 octahedra and each M3+1O6 and M2+2O6 octahedron is linked to six SO4 tetrahedra. Thus a three-dimensional [M2+2M3+2(SO4)6]2- heteropolyhedral framework is formed (Fig. 3a). The channels run parallel to [001], where Na+ and K+ cations are located (Fig. 3b,c). The channel walls are lined by sulphate tetrahedra both in the case of Na and K. Na+ cations are segregated in the layers containing the smaller M3+1O6 octahedra (Fig. 3b), whereas K+ cations are segregated in the layers with the relatively larger M2+2O6 octahedra (Fig. 3c).
No natural or synthetic chemical analogues of koryakite are known to date. Topology of [M2+2M3+2(SO4)6]2- framework in koryakite is very similar to the one in millosevichite Al2(SO4)3 (Dahmen and Gruehn, 1993) (Fig. 3b, d) and mikasaite Fe3+2(SO4)3 (Christidis and Rentzeperis, 1976) (Table 7). Replacement of the part of the trivalent cations in [M3+2(SO4)3]0 framework (Fig.3b) by divalent cations provides the negative charge of the framework and allows the incorporation of the alkali species in the channels, which are empty in millosevichite and mikasaite. This structural mechanism is reminiscent of the concept of stuffed derivative structures first proposed by Buerger (1954). Thus, the distant analogy of observed millosevichite – koryakite structural relationships can be found in silicates, as e.g. nepheline with crystal structure derived from trydimite (Abbott, 1984). Despite complex substitutions observed in koryakite, its general structural motif and the symmetry remain the same as in a parent Al2(SO4)3 crystal structure (Dahmen and Gruehn, 1993).
 Koryakite is structurally related to NaMgFe3+(SO4)3 (Table 7) (Slater and Greaves, 1994) and, as well as this compound, to the broader family of Nasicon-related phases (Anantharamulu et al., 2011). (Mg0.5Fe3+0.5)O6 octahedra have a mixed occupancy in NaMgFe3+(SO4)3 (Fig. 3f). Na+ cations are located in the channels similar to koryakite.
