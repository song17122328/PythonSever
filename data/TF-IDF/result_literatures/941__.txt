Alfredopetrovite, Al2(Se4þO3)3  6H2O, is a new secondary selenite mineral from the El Drago´n mine, Antonio QuijarroProvince, Potosı´ Department, Bolivia.

 The mineral occurs in vugs in a matrix of Co-rich krut’aite–penroseite, dolomite and goethite.

Associated minerals are: ahlfeldite, allophane, calcite, chalcomenite, favreauite, fels}oba´nyaite, malachite and molybdomenite.

Crystals occur in drusy/scaly coatings and compact balls, the latter to 0.5 mm in diameter.

Individual crystals are up toabout 0.1 mm across.

 The Mohs hardness of alfredopetrovite is 2½; it has no cleavage, curved fracture and a vitreous lustre.

The calculated density based on the empirical formula is 2.504 g cm3. Alfredopetrovite is uniaxial (þ), with o ¼ 1.554(2) ande ¼ 1.566(2) (white light), and exhibits no pleochroism.

Electron microprobe analyses gave the empirical formulaAl1.94Cu0.07Ni0.03Co0.01Se2.95O15H12.16, based on 15 O apfu.

Alfredopetrovite is hexagonal, space group P62c, with the unit-cellparameters: a ¼ 8.818(3) A˚ , c ¼ 10.721(2) A˚ , V ¼ 722.0(5) A˚ 3 and Z ¼ 2.The eight strongest lines in the X-ray powder diffractionpattern are [dobs/A˚ (I) (hkl)]: 7.63(55)(100), 6.22(55)(101), 5.37(26)(002), 4.398(40)(110,102), 3.404(100)(112), 2.783(50)(211),2.606(22)(203), and 1.6609(26)(410,322,314,116).

 The crystal structure was refined to R1 ¼ 0.0268 for 240 observed reflections [Fo. 4sF].

 The structure is comprised of fairly regular AlO6 octahedra and Se4þO3 triangular pyramids.

Three Se4þO3 pyramids linktwo adjacent AlO6 octahedra forming a [Al(H2O)3]2(Se4þO3)3 cluster structural unit.

These structural units are bonded to one anotheronly via hydrogen bonds yielding a structure with relatively large channels along [001].

The configuration of the cluster is similar tothat of the distinctive unit in the NASICON structure, commonly referred to as a lantern unit.

The new mineral alfredopetrovite was first recognizedduring the characterization of the recently describedmineral favreauite, PbBiCu6O4(SeO3)4(OH)  H2O(Mills et al., 2014).

Detailed study of the mineralsassociated with favreauite revealed rather indistinct colourless to blue, scaly crystal aggregates on two of thecotype specimens of favreauite.

Subsequent examinationof additional small pieces turned up several more examples of the new species.

The species is named for Mr.

Alfredo Petrov (born1955).

Mr Petrov is a British-born geologist/mineralogist of Russian and German extraction with a bachelor’s degree in geology (1982) from San Diego StateUniversity (USA) who has lived much of his adult lifein Bolivia.

He is an avid mineral collector andrenowned mineral connoisseur, specializing in rarespecies, especially from Bolivia, many of which hehas self-collected or obtained by visiting mines andminers.

After receiving his degree, he worked as ageologist for the Bolivian government for more thana decade and since then has done free-lance consultingwork for both the Bolivian government and miningcorporations.

 Mr.Petrov was the first person todecipher the origin of the several Alto Chapare danburite–boracite–povondraite–magesioriebeckite occurrences in Bolivia as being leached saltdome caprocks(Zaˇ ´cˇek et al., 1998, 2000), and the Cerro Sapo sodalitedeposit, also in Bolivia, as being a carbonatite dyke,rather than a hydrothermal ankerite vein (Hyrsl &Petrov, 1999; Petrov, 2009).

Mr.Petrov generously gives back to the mineralogicalcommunity, writing articles for numerous publicationsincluding Rocks and Minerals, Mineralogical Record,Mineral News and Lapis, and serving as an active managerfor Mindat.


He also freely provides specimens forscientific research.

The compound name ‘‘alfredopetrovite’’ has been chosen rather than the simpler ‘‘petrovite’’ because of thesimilarity of the latter to petrovicite, which also occurs atthe El Drago´n mine.

The mineral and name were approvedby the IMA–CNMNC (IMA2015–026) prior to publication.

 The description is based upon five small cotype specimens.

Four cotypes are deposited in the collections of theNatural History Museum of Los Angeles County, LosAngeles, USA: catalogue numbers 64111 (also a cotypefor favreauite), 65578, 65579 and 65580.One cotype specimen is housed in the Geosciences collections at MuseumVictoria, Australia, registration number M53004 (also acotype for favreauite).
