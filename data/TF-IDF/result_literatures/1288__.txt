The title compound, with nominal formula Cu2ScZr(PO4)3, has a beige coloration and displays fast Cu+ cation conduction at elevated temperatures. It adopts a NASICON-type structure in the space group R3c. The examined crystal was an obverse–reverse twin with approximately equal twin components. The [ScIIIZrIV(PO4)3]2  framework is composed of corner-sharing Sc/ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The Sc and Zr atoms are disordered on one atomic site on a crystallographic threefold axis. The P atom of the phosphate group lies on a crystallographic twofold axis. Nonframework Cu+ cations occupy three positions. Two of the Cu+ positions generate an approximately circular distribution around a site of 3 symmetry, referred to as the M1 site in the NASICONtype structure. The other Cu+ position is situated close to the twofold symmetric M2 site, displaced into a position with a distorted square-based pyramidal coordination geometry. The structure has been determined at 100, 200 and 300 K. Changes in the reﬁned site-occupancy factors of the Cu+ positions suggest increased mobility of Cu+ around the circular orbit close to the M1 site at room temperature, but no movement into or out of the M2 site. Free reﬁnement of the Cu siteoccupancy factors suggests that the formula of the crystal is Cu1.92(1)ScZr(PO4)3, which is consistent with the low-level presence of Cu2+ exclusively in the M2 site.

In 1976, Hong (1976) and Goodenough et al. (1976) discovered fast sodium cation transport in the solid-solution series Na1+xZr2(SiO4)x(PO4)3 x (0  x  3), which became known by the acronym NASICON (Na+ superionic conductor). This material attracted a great deal of interest at that time for use as a solid electrolyte in rechargeable sodium batteries for vehicle propulsion. Subsequently, many other NASICON-type

compounds have been discovered. For example, Yao & Fray (1983) substituted Cu+ for Na+ in the phosphate end-member, NaZr2(PO4)3, which resulted in the fast Cu+ cation conductor CuZr2(PO3)3 (CUSICON). This material has been used as a high-temperature solid electrolyte in electrochemical sensors designed for industry. Several other copper(I) phosphate analogues have been reported, including CuTi2(PO4)3 (Mbandza et al., 1985), CuxNb1 xTi1+x(PO4)3 (0  x  1) (El Jazouli et al., 1985), Cu1+xCrxTi2 x(PO4)3 (0  x  1) (El Jazouli et al., 1985), CuTiZr(PO4)3 (Berry et al., 1992; Warner et al., 1992), Cu2CrZr(PO4)3 (Boireau et al., 1992), Cu2ScZr(PO4)3 (Warner et al., 1992), CuSn2(PO4)3 (Serghini et al., 1995) and CuHf2(PO4)3 (Ahmamouch et al., 1997). Technologically more desirable copper(I)-rich compounds that promise enhanced ionic conductivity, such as Cu3Sc2(PO4)3, have not yet been prepared. And since there are no known crystalline copper(I) silicates of any kind, it would appear that the existence of a siliceous copper(I)-rich analogue of NASICON, namely Cu1+xZr2(SiO4)x(PO4)3 x (0 < x  3), is improbable. Further details of CUSICON-type compounds are described in the monograph by Warner (2011). Na4Zr2(SiO4)3 is considered as the prototype NASICON structure. The Na+ cations are accommodated within two distinct crystallographic sites, designated M1 and M2, as described by the formula (M1)1(M2)3[Zr2(SiO4)3]. The Cu+ cation has a strong preference for the less numerous M1 site, and it occupies solely this site in both CuZr2(PO4)3 (Bussereau et al., 1992) and CuTi2(PO4)3 (McCarron et al., 1987). An interesting feature of these copper analogues is that the Cu+ cations are distributed over six off-centred equivalent positions around the M1 site, which gives rise to a ‘daisy-like’ feature. Furthermore, as a consequence of the large size of the M1 site, it is possible, at least in CuZr2(PO4)3, to have two Cu+ cations within the same M1 site. Fargin et al. (1992, 1994) used extended X-ray absorption ﬁne structure (EXAFS) to show that about 20% of the M1 sites are occupied by Cu+—Cu+ pairs, about 60% are singly occupied by Cu+ cations and the remaining 20% are empty. The EXAFS results indicate Cu+— Cu+ pairs separated by a remarkably short distance of 2.40 A˚ , which is shorter than the Cu—Cu interatomic distance of 2.56 A˚ in face-centred cubic (fcc) copper metal (Bragg, 1914). The presence of Cu+—Cu+ pairs is considered to be the source of the intense green luminescence (540 nm emission) of CuZr2(PO4)3 under short-wavelength ultraviolet light at room temperature (Maihold & Wulff, 1987; Le Polles et al., 1988). By comparison, Cu+—Cu+ pairs do not exist in CuTi2(PO4)3 on account of the smaller M1 site in this material (Fargin et al., 1994), which may explain why that phase is nonluminescent. The Cu+ cations in both CuZr2(PO4)3 and CuTi2(PO4)3 have a high mobility above 600 K (Warner et al., 1992), and the conduction pathway necessitates their movement through the inﬁnite sequence M1–M2–M1–M2– . . . in three dimensions. This would imply at least a transient occupancy of the M2 site at high temperature. The crystal structure of Cu2CrZr(PO4)3, solved using powder neutron diffraction data (Boireau et al., 1993), indicates that the M2 site is partially occupied by Cu+ cations at room temperature in this more CuI-rich compound,
