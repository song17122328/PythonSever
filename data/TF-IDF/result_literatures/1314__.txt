Raman spectra of a series of orthophosphates M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu) have been recorded in crystalline state. Factor group analysis has been performed for space group P21/c and assignments of the internal modes of the [PO4] tetrahedra and [TiO6] octahedra have been made.

Since the discovery of KTiOPO4 (KTP), many other titanyl orthophosphates ATiOPO4 (A = Na, Rb, K, Cs, Tl, Ag) had been synthesized, they are well known nonlinear optical (NLO) materials of technological importance [1–4]. These compounds exhibit a ⇑ Corresponding author. Tel.: +212 06 68 55 78 19.

high-temperature phase transition from Pnan to Pna21 space group [5–6]. It has been shown that the same type of structure can be obtained by replacing AI ions by MII = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn and Cu ions [7–10], and/or PV atoms by B = As atoms [11–12]. The MO–TiO2–P2O5 (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) ternary diagram have shown the existence of new phase as product of decomposition of the Nasicon compound M0.50Ti2(PO4)3 [13–16]. Its chemical composition was determined as M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu). The synthesis of these compounds was undertaken in order to look for new material analogues to KTiO(PO4). Its structure

has been determined from conventional X-ray powder diffraction data in P21/c space group.

The dominant structural units in M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu) are chains of tilted corner sharing [TiO6] octahedral running parallel to the c axis. Each [TiO6] octahedron is linked to two other octahedra and to four [PO4] tetrahedral. Titanium atoms are displaced from geometrical centre of the octahedra resulting in altering long (2.23 Å) and short (1.70) Ti–O(1) bonds. Chains are linked by phosphate tetrahedral to constitute sheets parallel to (100). Isolated octahedral cavities of these sheets (2a site), between two faces of two [TiO6] octahedra, are occupied by M atoms.

20 mW), and an optical imaging system (magniﬁcation 20, spatial resolution 1 lm). Two holographic notch ﬁlters (Kaiser Optical Systems Inc.) blocked the Rayleigh line. The spectrometer was calibrated by ﬂuorescence lines of the neon lamp. Non-polarized Raman spectra were collected in the back-scattering geometry, in the range 180–2280 cm 1, at a resolution of about 3 cm 1. Accuracy and precision of spectral measurements, as estimated from the wavelength calibration procedure and peak ﬁtting results, were 1.5 cm 1 and 0.1–0.4 cm 1, respectively. The acquisition time varied from 5 to 20 s. Principal layout of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.

All chemicals were obtained from stoichiometric amounts of TiO2 (99%, Aldrich), MO (99.9%, Aldrich) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Merck). The samples were heated in air at 200 °C/6 h, 500 °C/6 h and ﬁnally at 850 °C/18 h, with periodic intermediate regrinding. The purity of the products M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) were veriﬁed by powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8 Focus, CuKa radiation, graphite monochromator).

Raman spectra of the compounds were recorded using a Raman spectroscopic system designed and built at the Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University [17–19]. The key system components include a high-throughput, single stage imaging spectrometer (HoloSpec f/1.8i, Kaiser Optical Systems Inc.) equipped with a holographic transmission grating and thermoelectrically cooled two-dimensional multichannel CCD detector (Newton, Andor Technology, 1600  400 pixels, thermoelectrically cooled down to  60 °C), an argon-ion laser (Spectra-Physics, 514.5 nm,

The infrared spectra were recorded using a Bruker IFS 113 v FT-IR spectrometer. Samples were in the form of KBr (mid-IR) and polyethylene (far-IR) pellets.

The crystal structures of the oxyphosphates M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) have already been accurately determined by X-ray diffraction [7–10]. The structure can be described as a 3-dimensional network of [TiO6] and [MO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra, see Fig. 2. The [TiO6] octahedra form chains with a Ti–Ti distance of 3.716(2) Å along the [001] direction by sharing corners and are additionally linked by [PO4] tetrahedra. Each [TiO6] octahedron is sharing one face with exactly one [MO6] octahedron, while each [MO6] octahedron is sharing faces with two [TiO6] octahedra and corners with four [PO4] tetrahedra. Ti atoms are displaced from the centre of the octahedra, resulting in alternating long (2.23 Å) and short (1.70) Ti–O bonds along the chains. The P–O average distance is (1.54 Å). M2+ has an almost regular octahedral coordination, 2.07 Å 6 d(M–O) 6 2.09 Å. The [MO6] polyhedra are well isolated from each other with a shortest M–M distance of 5.22 Å.

lattice, correlating the point group of the free [PO4]3  ion (Td) with its site group (C1) and the factor group (C2h). The results for the units are shown in Table 1. Internal modes involve the displacement of oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral [PO4]3  anions and present frequencies closely related to those of the free molecule. For [PO4]3 , these are a single (A1) at a frequency m1 = 938 cm 1, a doublet (E) at m2 = 465 cm 1 and two triply degenerate (F2) modes, m3 at 1027 cm 1 and m4 at 567 cm 1. m1 and m3 involve the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching mode of the P–O bonds, whereas m2 and m4 involve mainly O–P–O symmetric and antisymmetric bending mode with a small contribution of P vibration [21]. In a solid, internal modes can split as a consequence of two effects: the site-symmetry effect due to an electric crystal ﬁeld of symmetry lower than tetrahedral acting on the molecule and the correlation effect due to the presence of more than one molecular group in the crystal unit cell. For condensed phosphates, the intensity of P–O stretching Raman bands near 1000 cm 1 are always greater than those near 740 cm 1, assigned to the stretching of P–O–P bridges. In M0.50TiO(PO4) (P21/c space group) the phosphorous atom is in a C1 symmetry site; therefore, we expect eight Raman-active modes for the stretching vibrations; m1(PO4) (Ag + Bg) + m3(PO4) (3Ag + 3Bg). For the bending vibrations 10 Raman-active modes; m2(PO4) (2Ag + 2Bg) + m4(PO4) (3Ag + 3Bg) are predicted (Table 2). The external modes consist of the translational vibrations of the Ti4+, M2+ and [PO4]3  ions and [PO4]3  librations [22]. Raman spectra of the oxyphosphate M0.50TiO(PO4) are plotted in Fig. 4. Generally, for orthophosphates the antisymmetric stretching modes are found between 1290 and 1050 cm 1 and the symmetric stretching modes lay between 1050 and 900 cm 1 (Table 3). The P–O assignments of the oxyphosphate M0.50TiO(PO4) are in good agreement with those found in KTiO(PO4), NaTiO(PO4) and LiTiO(PO4) oxyphosphates [23–24] exhibiting a structure close to that of M0.50TiO(PO4) and the same type of P–O bonds. Such P–O bonds are also found in the compound KTiO(PO4) studied by Bushiri [23]. The Raman spectra of all the samples show bands in the above region (Fig. 4 and Table 3). In M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu), P–O distances varies between 1.51 and 1.57 Å [7–10]. Popovic et al. have formulated the following empirical relation connecting P–O bond lengths and stretching frequencies [25]: v = 224,500 exp( R/28.35); where R is the P–O bond lengths in

The analysis of the spectra is carried out on the basis of vibrations of [TiO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra. The normal vibrations of each of these units can be carried out and we can summarize the results as the followings:

Vibrational modes of tetrahedral XY4 molecules are well known [20] (Fig. 3). In order to facilitate the analysis of the vibrational spectra, we performed a factor group analysis for the internal and external vibrations of the [PO4] groups in orthophosphate

pm. By replacing P–O distance values in the above expression, the obtained values are given in Table 4. These values are relatively comparable with that of the experimentally obtained one and this further conﬁrm the assignments of bands observed in the Raman spectra.

[TiO6] octahedron is one of the important building blocks in the title compounds [7–10]. The [TiO6] octahedra with Oh symmetry in its free ion state has six fundamental modes of vibration (Fig. 5) similar to other metal oxygen octahedral like NbO6, MoO6, SbO6, SnO6 etc. [26–28]. These fundamental modes are symmetric stretching mode m1(A1g), asymmetric stretching modes m2(Eg) and m3(F1u), asymmetric bending mode m4(F1u), symmetric bending mode m5(F2g) and the Raman and IR inactive mode m6(F2u). The m1,

m2, and m5 modes are Raman active, whereas the m3 and m4 modes are IR active [29]. TiO2 is known to exist in three crystalline modiﬁcations: anatase (tetragonal), rutile (tetragonal), and brookite (orthorhombic). Each octahedron in anatase is connected with two edge-sharing octahedra and eight corner-sharing octahedra and in rutile with four edge-sharing octahedra and four cornersharing octahedral. Anatase has a space group D4h (I41/amd) containing two formula units per primitive unit cell. From the group analysis, there are six Raman active modes, (A1g + 2B1g + 3Eg), which are identiﬁed at 144 cm 1 (Eg), 197 cm 1 (Eg), 399 cm 1 (B1g), 513 cm 1 (A1g), 519 cm 1 (B1g) and 639 cm 1 (Eg). Rutile has two molecules in the unit cell with the space group D4h (P42/mnm), implying a total of four Raman active modes: A1g + B1g + B2g + Eg, which were detected at 143 cm 1 (B1g), 447 cm 1 (Eg), 612 cm 1(A1g), and 826 cm 1 (B2g) [30–32]. In compounds having Ti–O–Ti chain m1 mode of [TiO6] octahedra are observed around 700 cm 1 as in KTiOPO4, Na(TiO)PO4 and (TiO)2P2O7 [33– 34]. This is interpreted due to the strong nature of Ti–O bonds [7–10]. The previous Raman studies of the Nasicons titanium

phosphates show that in NaTi2(PO4)3, AFeTi(PO4)3 (A = Ca, Cd) [35–36], in which [PO4] tetrahedra are isolated from each other as well as [TiO6] octahedra, no band is observed around 700 cm 1 (Fig. 6). In the case of M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) the Ti–O–Ti bonds created by corner-shared linkage of octahedra have a short length of 1.70 Å. The stretching frequency is found between the ranges (732–763 cm 1). The assignment was made on the basis of previous literature results for oxyphosphates with inﬁnite chains. The high value of the frequency Ti–O can be explained by the short length of Ti–O bond existing in the [TiO6] octahedral chains, which allows the couplings of the Ti–O vibrations in these chains (Fig. 7). The [TiO6] octahedron is characterized by an off-centered Ti4+ ion resulting in alterning long (2.23 Å) and short (1.70) Ti–O bonds. Off-centre distortions of octahedral containing d0 transition metals like Ti4+ are not unusual. They are driven by a second-order Jahn–Teller effect which destabilises centrosymmetric coordination environments; the magnitude and direction of distortion are inﬂuenced by effects such as bond network, lattice stresses, and cation–cation

repulsion [37,38]. The bond length distortion (BLD) was calculated as BLD ¼ 1 i 1fðdn   hdiÞ=hdig2 [39] where n is the number of bonds and d the cation anion bond distance (Ti–O) and hdi is the average Ti–O distance. The calculation of BLD of oxyphosphates M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu) are higher than the

value found for TiO2 (rutile) (BLD = 6) or M0.5Ti2(PO4)3 Nasicon type (M = Mg, BLD = 36 [40]; M = Co, BLD = 37) [14], reﬂecting the higher instability of Ti4+ cations in M0.5TiO(PO4) oxyphosphates (Table 5, Fig. 8). The difference may be attributed to the strength of O–Ti–O bridges connecting the octahedra into inﬁnite chains in the structure of M0.5TiO(PO4).

The infrared spectra of orthophosphates M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu) compounds are shown in Fig. 9. The measured frequencies and assignments are presented in Table 6. Inspection of the curves reveals that all orthophosphates compounds show a great similarity in the shape of their infrared peaks, which agrees with the results reported in the literature [8–9]. The

infrared spectra features can clearly be divided into two regions, above and below 400 cm 1, that correspond to the domain of appearance of internal and external modes, respectively. For Mg0.50TiO(PO4), in the region where internal modes of the phosphate oxo-anion appear, we identify the totally symmetric (Ag + Bg) mode at 930 and 994 cm 1 assigned to the m1 tetrahedral normal vibration of (PO4)3  anion; the bands at 417, 438 and 468 cm 1 are attributed to the (Ag + Bg) components, i.e., the harmonic bending vibration of P–O–P bonds; the high-wavenumber bands at 1021, 1034, 1064, 1093, 1136 and 1168 cm 1 originate from the m3 mode, and the bands at 596, 611, 625 and 637 cm 1 are from the m4 mode. As expected these internal bands are split due to

tetrahedral units. In the low-wavenumber range, i.e., the region of external modes, we observe nine infrared bands, i.e., located at 112, 129, 152, 173, 194, 232, 250, 326 and 352 cm 1, even though the translational modes of Mg and PO4, plus the vibrations of PO4 are expected. This discrepancy could be due to the missing modes below 100 cm 1 and/or the low activity of some bands. Similar analysis can be done for the M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Zn, Ni, Co, Fe, and Cu) isomorphic oxyphosphate for which some weak bands vanished (Table 6). It is observed that the infrared bands arising from the PO4 vibrational modes are very stable even when the VI ¼ 0:61 Å to Cu transition-metal VI ¼ 0:73 Å) and appear to be independent of the ionic radius (r2þ of divalent M2+ cations. This is the case for the high-frequency modes m1 (984 cm 1) and m3 (1000–1100 cm 1) and for the bands m4 (625, 609 cm 1) in the mid-frequency region. In contrast, the m2 bending modes are affected by the modiﬁcation of the transition-metal ion Fig. 10. For all compounds, the infrared intensity of the symmetric stretching mode in Ti–O bonds in the inﬁnites chains –Ti–O–Ti–O–Ti– at 815 cm 1 is very strong, which is the dominant spectral feature.

We recorded vibrational spectra of the orthophosphates M0.50TiO(PO4) (M = Mg, Zn, Ni, Co, Fe and Cu). By means of a factor group analysis, it is possible to predict the number of Raman and Infrared active modes and to explain some differences in the spectra due to dependence of composition and symmetry in the crystalline units. Whereas it is possible to make assignments for the P–O stretching and bending vibrations of the [PO4] tetrahedra. The [PO4] frequencies and bond lengths were calculated theoretically and the values are in agreement with the experimental values. Also it is possible to make assignments for the Ti–O stretching and bending vibrations of the [TiO6] octahedra, it is very difﬁcult in the case of the external modes, as these do not vary with the changing surroundings of the crystalline units which consist of the different metal ions.
