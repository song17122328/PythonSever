The development of an unconventional synthesis method has alarge potential to drastically advance materials science.
In this research, a newsynthesis method based on a solid-state electrochemical reaction was demonstrated, which can be made available for intercalation and ion substitution.
It was referred to as proton-driven ion introduction (PDII).
The protons generated by the electrolytic dissociation of hydrogen drive other monovalent cations along a high electric field in the solid state.
Utilizing thismechanism, Li+, Na+, K+, Cu+, and Ag+ were intercalated into a layered TaS2single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity.
This liquid-free process ofion introduction allows the application of high voltage around several kilovoltsto the sample.
Such a high electric field strongly accelerates ion substitution.
Actually, compared to conventional solid-state reaction, PDII introduced 15times the amount of K into Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-structuredNa3âˆ’xKxV2(PO4)3. The obtained materials exhibited a thermodynamicallymetastable phase, which has not been reported so far.
This concept and idea for ion introduction is expected to form newfunctional compounds and/or phases.
