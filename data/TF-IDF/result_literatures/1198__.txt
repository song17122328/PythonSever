Solid electrochemical sensors based on sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) and spinel-type oxide  CoCr2-x MnxO4 (x=0, 1, 1.2, 1.4 and 2) sensing electrode were designed for sub-ppm H2S detection. In  comparison with other spinel-type oxides, sensor using CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 showed the maximum response to  H2S at 250 °C, giving a response of 178 mV to 10 ppm H2S. The sensor displayed good stability to H2S  during the testing period. Moreover, the sensor exhibited excellent selectivity toward H2S against the  other interference gases, such as SO2, NO2, CH4, CO, C2H4, H2 and NH3. A sensing mechanism related to  the mixed potential was proposed for the sensor based on NASICON and oxide electrode. The effect of  sintering temperature had also been investigated. 

  The hydrogen sulfide, one of the chemical industry by-products,  is strongly harmful, toxic and flammable  when emitting into air.  Therefore,  high  performance  sensor,  which  should  have  the  characteristics  of  high  sensitivity,  low  detecting  limit,  good  selectivity  and  stability  is  urgently  desired  for  exactly  detecting  hydrothion  in  the  atmosphere  [1,  2].  In  the  past  few  decades,  hydrogen sulfide sensors using metal-oxide semiconductors such  as SnO2-CuO [3-5], Pt-doped α-Fe2O3 [6], and noble metal doped  WO3 [7] etc. have been widely investigated as sensing materials,  owing to their high response to the target gases and simplicity in  synthesis. Though these explorations promoted the development of  H2S  sensor  and  obtained  exciting  results,  developing  new  H2S  sensor strategies are always increasing sensitivity, selectivity and  stability.  Moreover,  the  detection  limit  of  these  semiconductor  sensors are in ppm level, but the acceptable ambient levels of H2S  (recommended  by  the  Scientiﬁc  Advisory  Board  on  Toxic  Air  Pollutants,  USA)  are  in  the  range  of  Sub-ppm  [8].  To  the  solid  electrolyte type gas sensor, it displays the potential for detecting  H2S  in  ppb  level  by  optimizing  the  corresponding  sensitive  electrode material. As well, most researches focused on the sensors  using  yttria  stablized  zirconia  (YSZ)  and  sodium  super  ionic  conductor (NASICON). For instance, our recently work reported a  sub-ppm  H2S  sensor  based  on  YSZ  and  hollow  balls  NiM2O4  （M=Mn, Cr, Fe）sensing electrode, which showed good sensing  properties to H2S at 500°C [9]. However, YSZ-based sensors are  generally  operated  at  high  temperature  (500-700°C),  so  their  power dissipation is high. Compared with sensors based on YSZ,  the NASICON-based sensors can be operated at the intermediate  temperatures  (200-500°C).  Hence  lower  power  consumption and are more suitable for detecting toxic gases in the  atmospheric environment [10-12].        The choice of sensing material which is a key element of solid  electrolyte gas sensor is crucial to the sensor performance. Spinel type  oxides,  well-known  for  their  wide  applications  in  CO  hydrogenation  process  [13],  catalytic  removal  of  NOx  [14],  a  cathode material of lithium ion battery [15] and sensing electrode  of  the  solid  electrolyte  sensors  [16-21],  are  represented  by  the  chemical formula AB2O4, in which A ions are generally divalent  cations occupying tetrahedral sites and B ions are trivalent cations  in octahedral sites. In our previous work, CoCr2O4 was utilized as  sensing  material  to  fabricate  the  mixed  potential  type  Cl2  sensor  showing excellent sensing properties [22]. In order to explore the  spinel  oxides  with  high  catalytic  activity,  CoCrxMn2-xO4  spinel  oxides were prepared as the sensing material in present work.      In  this  work,  H2S  sensors  using  spinel-type  oxides  CoCr2xMnxO4  as  sensing  electrodes  were  fabricated,  and  their  gas  sensing properties were studied. A comparative gas sensing study  between  the  CoCr2O4,  CoMn2O4,  CoCrMnO4,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4,  CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4 was performed. The sensor using CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  displayed highest response to hydrothion among these oxides. The  sensor gave a response of 27 mV to 100 ppb H2S at 250 °C, which  also exhibited good selectivity and stability. The influence of the  sintering  temperature  on  sensing  performance  of  the  sensor  attached with CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 electrode was investigated.  

NASICON was prepared from ZrO(NO3)2, NaNO3, (NH4)2HPO4  and Si(C2H5O)4 by sol–gel process and sintered at 1000°C for 12  h  [23].  The  spinel-type  oxide  CoCrxMn2-xO4  (0,  1,  1.2,  1.4,  2)  served  as  the  sensing  electrodes  were  synthesized  by  autocombustion  of  ethylene  glycol–metal  nitrate  polymerized  gel  precursors. The powders of Co(NO3)2•6H2O, Cr(NO3)2•9H2O, and  Mn(NO3)2•4H2O were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water. Then,  the concentrated nitric acid of 10ml was added to the above mixed  nitrate  solution  and  the  mixed  solution  were  stirred  at  room  temperature. During the stirring process, 80ml ethylene glycol (EG)  was added to above solution to make a gel. The obtained gel was heat treated at 80°C for 16 h, followed by drying at 130°C for 24 h  and sintering at 800°C in air for 3 h [24]. In addition, to study the  effect of sintering temperature on sensor performance, the CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  was  sintered  at  600,  800  and  1000  °C  in  air  for  3h,  respectively.

The structure of the sensor  is shown in Fig. 1. A thick ﬁlm of  NASICON  was  formed  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  alumina  tube  and sintered at 900°C for 6 h. Then two Au electrodes with ring shape were made on the two ends of the NASICON thick ﬁlm by  applying the commercial Au paste and calcining at 800°C for 20  min.  Then,  a  composite  oxide  layer  (CoCr2O4,  CoMn2O4,  CoCrMnO4,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4,  CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4)  as  the  sensing  electrode was formed on one side of the ring-shaped Au electrode,  followed by sintering at 600°C for 3 h. The Ni-Cr coil inserted into  the alumina tube provides the operating temperature for the sensors.  Devices  attached  with  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  sintering  at  600,  800  and  1000  °C  were  numbered  as  S600,  S800  and  S1000.  Gas  sensing  properties of the sensors were  measured by a conventional static  method  in  a  constant  temperature  and  humidity  environment  (26 °C, 30 % RH) [25, 26]. The sample gases containing different  H2S concentration were obtained by diluting 10000 ppm H2S with  air. When the sensor was exposed to clean air or the sample gas,  the  electric potential  difference  (V)  was  measured  with  a  digital  electrometer (Rigol. DM3054) as a sensing signal and the results  obtained  were  registered  with  a  computer  connected  to  the  electrometer.      XRD patterns of the composite oxides were recorded by Rigaku  wide-angle  X-ray  diffractometer  (D/max  rA,  using  Cu  Kα  radiation at wavelength λ=0.1541 nm). The complex impedance of  the sensor in sample gas was measured by means of an impedance  analyzer  (Solartron,  1260  and  Solartron,  1287)  in  the  frequency  range  of  0.1  Hz  –  1  MHz.  The  cyclic  voltammograms  for  the  sensors  were  measured  by  an  electrochemical  interface  and  impedance/gain phase analyzer (Solartron SI 1287 and SI 1260).  2. 3 Characterization of sensing materials      Fig.  2  (a)  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  CoCr2O4,  CoMn2O4,  CoCrMnO4, CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4, CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4, respectively. Fig. 2  (b) shows the XRD patterns of CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 sintered at 600, 800  and  1000°C.  It  can be  seen  that CoCr2O4 and  CoMn2O4  retained  their  crystallographic  phases  (cubic)  corresponding  to  JCPDS  PDFs  (#78-711  and  #77-471,  respectively),  were  testified  to  be  spinel  type  oxides.  And  as-prepared  oxides  (CoCrxMn2-xO4)  retained  their  crystallographic  phases  (cubic)  corresponding  to  JCPDS  PDF  (#70-2465).  Fig.  2  (b)  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 sintered at 600, 800 and 1000°C for 3 h. With increasing the sintering temperature, the peaks of CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  were  strengthened,  which  means  that  the  crystallization  quality  was improved with increasing sintering temperature.  

The  sensing  mechanism  of  this  H2S  sensor  described  above  related to the mixed potential. The present sensor can be expressed  by the following electrochemical cell: 

When  H2S  gas  molecules  arrive  at  the  triple-phase  boundary  (sensing material-gas-electrolyte), the following cathodic (1) and  anodic (2) reactions occur at the TPB simultaneously: 

When the rates of above chemical reactions were equal to each  other,  they  arrived  at  a  dynamic  equilibrium,  and  the  electrode  potential  at  the  sensing  electrode  was  regarded  as  the  mixed  potential  these  semireactions,  either  promoting  semireaction (1) or  restraining semireaction (2) will improve the  potential of SE.  

In  order  to  find  out  the  most  suitable  sensing  material  among  synthetic oxides, the comparison of gas sensing study between the  CoCr2O4, CoMn2O4, CoCrMnO4, CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4, CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4  was carried out. The responses (VH2S–Vair) to 10 ppm H2S for the  sensors  attached  with  different  oxides  (CoCr2O4,  CoMn2O4,  CoCrMnO4,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4,  CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4)  sensing  electrodes  were tested and exhibited in Fig. 3. Among these oxides examined,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 showed the highest respond to 10 ppm H2S.       For  rationalizing  above  results,  the  polarization  curves  were  obtained in air and in the sample gas (10 ppm H2S+air) at 250 °C  using  the  method  reported  previously  [28].  Fig.  4  shows  the  modified polarization curves for the sensors attached with different  sensing materials (CoCr2O4, CoMn2O4, CoCrMnO4, CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  and  CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4).  The  polarization  curves  in  air  in  apparently related to the cathodic reaction (2), and in H2S is for the  anodic reaction (1). As shown in fig. 11, on one hand, the slope of  polarization  curve  for  the  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4-attached  sensor  in  air  was  obviously  lower  than  those  polarization  curves  of  other  devices, which means that the catalytic activity of CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  to O2 was the lowest among these sensing materials. On the other  hand, compared with other sensors, the polarization curve slope of  the sensor attached with CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4-SE was the biggest to H2S,  which means that CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 to H2S has the highest catalytic  activity to H2S. 

CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  showed  the  increased  catalytic  activity  for  electrochemical  reaction  (1)  and  decreased  catalytic  activity  for  reaction  (2),  resulting  in  a  largest  potential  value.  Thus,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 was chosen as the sensing electrode material. The  sensing  properties  of  the  sensor  attached  with  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  electrode defined as SE material were further investigated in detail  as  followings.  Additionally,  the  intersecting-potential  values  (CoCr2O4:  80mV,  CoMn2O4:  100mV,  CoCrMnO4:  160  mV,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4: 180 mV and CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4: 130 mV) are very  similar to those obtained (CoCr2O4: 81 mV, CoMn2O4: 100 mV,  CoCrMnO4:  160  mV,  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4:  179  mV  and  CoCr1.4Mn0.6O4:  127  mV).  This  coincidence  supports  the  H2S  sensing mechanism involving a mixed potential [29].   

To this kind of gas sensor, the property of the sensing electrode  material  is  significantly  influenced  by  the  sintering  temperature.  Fig.  5  shows  the  relationship  between  the  sintering  temperature  and  responses  of  sensors  (S600,  S800  and S1000)  to 10 ppm  H2S  at  250°C. It was found that the sensor using CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 sintered  at 800°C had the largest response to 10 ppm H2S at 250°C.       In  order  to  examine  the  electrocatalytic  properties  of  sensing  materials  sintering  at  different  temperature,  fig.  6  shows  a  comparison of the cyclic voltammograms  for S600, S800 and S1000  cyclic  scanned  between  -5  and  5  V  with  a  scan  rate  10mV/s  respectively in the same  concentration (10 ppm) H2S.

So  the  best  balance  between  TPB  length  and  electrochemical  catalytic  activities  for  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 sintered at 800°C could be formed and generated  the  largest  response  to  H2S.  Thus,  the  sensing  properties  of  the  sensor  attached  with  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 sintered  at  800°C  electrode  have been further investigated in detail. 

Operating  temperature  as  an  important  parameter  of  sensor  performance  was  investigated  in  this  work.  Fig.  9  displays  sensitivity curves to 520ppm H2S for the S800 as sensing electrode  at 200°C, 250°C, 300°C, 350°C and 400°C, respectively. It could  be  observed  that  the  highest  sensitivity  (slope)  to  5-20ppm  H2S  was given at 250°C. The response of this kind of sensor is mainly  influenced by the following two factors: 1. the concentration loss,  which  generated  from  the  oxidation  reaction  in  the  oxide  layer,  affected the sensitivity of the sensor in negative direction; 2. the  rate  of  the  electrochemical  reaction  at  the  triple-phase  boundary  (TPB)  affected  the  sensitivity  in  opposite  direction.  These  two  factors  are  related  to  the  chemical  and  electrochemical  catalytic  activities  of  the  oxides,  respectively.  With  the  increasing  of  the  operating  temperature,  both  the  chemical  and  electrochemical  activities increase, and the response value of the sensor is decided  by  the  competition  of  two  processes.  At  250°C,  the  highest  sensitivity was obtained due to the best balance between the H2S  molecular diffusion and the electrochemical reaction [31].

Fig. 10 shows the dependence of ΔV on the H2S concentration for  the  electrocatalytic  oxidation  of  H2S.  At  the  peak  point,  the  electrochemical  redox  reactions  occurred.  Meanwhile,  a  large  number  of  electrons  lost  and  gained  on  the  surface  of  electrode,  which made a large value of current. Under the same conditions,  the higher peak current means higher electrochemical reaction rate.  Such result reveals that the S800 possesses good catalytic activity  toward the electrochemical reduction of H2S.  

Triple  phase  boundary  (TPB)  is  a  reaction  field  for  the  reactions (1) and (2). It is a one-dimensional three-phase (sensing  materialgas-electrolyte) coexisting region, which is measured by  the  three-phase  boundary  length.  Greater  three-phase  boundary  length  means  more  reactive  sites.  So  microstructure  of  TPB  directly  affects  the  rates  of  above-mentioned  electrochemical  reactions. As reported previously [30], the total resistance of sensor  seems to be affected by the interfacial resistance between the SE  and NASICON, which is affected by many variables including but  not limited to: SE/NASICON interfacial reaction area (namely, the  number of reaction sites on TPB). Nyquist plots measured in the  sample gas (10 ppm H2S + air) at 250°C for sensors S600, S800 and  S100  are  shown  in  the  Fig.  7.  In  the  low  frequency  range,  the  interfacial  resistance  changed  with  the  calcination  temperature  (R1000 > R800 > R600). With the increasing of sintering temperature,  the oxide crystal grain grew and reunited. Therefore, the interface  of particles of SE material and the NASICON increased with the  particles enlarge, but the triple phase boundary reduces as shown  in fig. 8. In this process, the microstructure should be taken into  account:  the  enlarged  crystal  size  reduced  the  area  of  the  triple  phase  boundary,  and  the  reduced  area  brought  the  decreased  response  value.  As  described  above,  the  crystallization  of  the  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  increased  with  the  elevated  temperatures,  which  affected  the  electrochemical  activity.  Therefore,  with  increasing  the  calcined  the  microstructure of the SE material changed, and both of them affect for the sensor attached with CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4. The sensitivity (slope)  was  75  mV  /  decade.  Moreover,  the  low  detection  limit  of  the  sensor  was  100  ppb.  The  inset  in  Fig.  10  exhibits  the  responserecovery transient to 100 ppb H2S. The response and recovery time  of the sensor were less than 100 seconds to 100 ppb H2S.  

Besides,  the  continuous  response-recovery  transients  of  the  sensor  to  1  ppm  H2S  was  examined  as  shown  in  Fig.  11.  Considering  the  interference  of  environment  and  error  in  the  experiment  process,  the  result  indicates  that  the  sensor has  good  repeatability. 

For testifying the long term stability of the present sensor, the  stability of the sensor was investigated by measuring the sensing  signal  in  a  specific  interval  (2  days).  The  measuring  result  is  displayed  in  the  Fig.  12.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  sensing  signal  was very stable during the testing period (20 days), which indicated  that the sensor using CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4 electrode had good stability.  It could be due to the property of electrolyte and sensing material  tended to be stable after high temperature sintering.      Fig. 13 exhibits the cross-sensitivities of the sensor to H2S and  some interference gases at 250°C. It can be seen that the responses  of the sensor to H2S was much larger than other gases, such as SO2,  NO2, CH4, C2H4, H2, CO and NH3 at 250°C. Such result indicated  that  the  sensor  had  excellent  selectivity  to  H2S  and  showed  a  potential possibility in practical application.   

If a single electrochemical reaction occurs on an electrode, the  electrode  potential  is  known  as  equilibrium  potential.  The  difference  in  chemical  potential  of  conducting  ions  for  solid  electrolyte between sensing and reference electrodes generates the  electromotive force (V), which can be expressed by the Nernstian  equation. However, if two or more electrochemical reactions take  place simultaneously on the same electrode, the electrode potential  is determined by the electrochemical reaction rate involved and is  non-Nernstiant. 

Miura et al. have established a sensing mechanism involving  mixed  potentials  for  a  group  of  sensors  combining  stabilized  zirconia  with  oxide  electrodes,  such  as  NOx,  H2  and  CO  sensors  [32–34],  therefore,  a  similar  sensing  mechanism  would  be  attempted  to  apply  to  the present  sensors.  In  addition,  we  would  deal with the local cell more quantitatively.     The electric current densities of the electrochemical oxidation and  reduction reactions (1) and (2) can be represented by the following  equations, E  is  the  electrode  potential,  F  the  Faraday  constant,  R  is  the  gas  constant  and  T  the  temperature.  E0,  i0  and  α  are  the  electrode  potential  at  equilibrium,  the  exchange  current  density,  and  the  transfer  coefﬁcient,  respectively.  For  reactions  (3)  and  (4)  at  the  equilibrium state, the absolute values of the above electric current  densities  are  same,  but  the  directions  are  opposite.  So,  we  can  express the equilibrium state with the following equation: 

We suppose d the exchange current densities to obey the following  kinetic equations, respectively: 

Here, C represents the concentration of H2S or O2, and B1, B2, m  and n are the constants. Let us combine Eqs. (3)–(7), the following equation could be attained:

The present paper reported a compact solid electrochemical H2S  sensor  based  on  NASICON  and  composite  oxide  sensing  electrodes.  CoCr2-xMnxO4  with  spinel  structure  was  prepared  by  sol-gel  process.  The  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  sintered  at  800°C  was  confirmed  to  be  the  best  suited  for  the  sensing  electrode.  The  device  attached  with  CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4  showed  excellent  sensing  characteristics  to  0.1-20  ppm  H2S  in  air  at  250°C.  The  90%  response and recovery times to 100 ppb H2S at 250°C were all less  than 100 s for the CoCr1.2Mn0.8O4-attached device. The ΔV value  of  the  device  was  almost  linear  to  the  logarithm  of  H2S  concentration and the slope between ΔV and the logarithm of H2S  concentration  was  75mV/decade.  The  sensor  exhibited  good  stability during the testing period. Moreover, the sensor exhibited  excellent  selectivity  toward  H2S  against  the  other  interference  gases, such as SO2, NO2, CH4, CO, C2H4, H2 and NH3.  The sensing  mechanism related to the mixed potential could explain the sensing  behaviour  of  the  sensor.  Therefore,  the  sensor  exhibits  great  applicable value for detecting hydrothion in the atmosphere based  on its excellent sensing performances.
