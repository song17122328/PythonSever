Cathode materials with the general stoichiometry Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) were prepared by a sol−gel method followed by annealing at 750 °C in Ar. These samples were investigated by powder X-ray diﬀraction analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance and 59Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy micrographs, and electrochemical lithium intercalation. The NASICON-type structure belongs to the R3̅c space group. Upon substitution of Ti4+, the c/a ratio and cell volume increased as a result of the higher ionic radii of Ca2+(1.14 Å), Fe2+ (0.92 Å), and Fe3+ (0.785 Å) compared to those for Ti4+ (0.745 Å). Although calcium is not electroactive versus lithium, the electrochemical Li insertion was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the presence of calcium ions in the NASICON-type structure. The determination of oxidation state of titanium ions in Ca-substituted orthophosphates showed that tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions in the Li-rich end composition participate in the electrochemical reaction of intercalation of Li+ shifting the potential of reaction from 2.5 to 2.8 V in charge. The role of iron is elucidated with the use of 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The Fe2+ observed in the as-prepared electrode is completely oxidized to Fe3+ in the ﬁrst charge. Successive discharge/charge of lithium test cells evidenced the involvement of the whole iron content in the reaction undergoing at 2.8 V. Stable capacities ranging between 126 and 131 mA·h/ g after 100 cycles and about 120 mA·h/g after 60 cycles are recorded for Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (x = 0.1−0.4) and Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 based electrodes (x = 0.1−0.5), respectively.

There is a persistent search for new electrodes materials for lithium batteries. The cathode materials could lead to batteries with higher capacity, cyclic performance, and thermal stability, while anodes should increase the safety and tune the operational voltage of the eventual battery. To ﬁnd an optimum performance of the best combination of anode, cathode, and electrolyte need to be resolved. The number of papers dealing with diverse composition has been increasing exponentially over the years. Finding novel improvements or new enhanced electrochemical features is a matter of fact nowadays. Phosphate-based materials have attracted much interest as potential cathode materials for batteries. Their competitive energy-density storage and better thermal properties than conventional cathode oxides such asLiMn

One approach to help ﬁnding solutions in the latter regard is to use transition metal compounds with NASICON and LISICONtype structures. In fact, promising electrochemical performances have been demonstrated, hence stimulating the scientiﬁc community to go on in this direction.6−12 These materials with nominal composition of A1+xZ2(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na; Z = V, Fe, Ti) exhibit an open framework able to insert host species as alkaline ions.13−16 There are two diﬀerent types of interstitial sites, normally named as M1 and M2. Here, the parent LiTi2(PO4)3 framework has vacant octahedral sites where Li+ cations are located (M1) while empty spaces are available in the M2 site. The structure is built up by a three-dimensional framework of TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing all the vertices.17,18

In this paper we have focused on the eﬀects of substituting Ti4+ by diﬀerent cations such as Fe3+, Fe2+, and Ca2+ in LiTi2(PO4)3, leading to Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). An organic citrate precursor yields an in situ carbon phase, ensuring proper electrical conducting properties in the ﬁnal product. X-ray diﬀraction analysis, 59Fe Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy data, and cycling performances of lithium cells were collected for electrodes before and after reaction with lithium. The electrochemical results compared with bare LiTi2(PO4)3/C specimens revealed a net improvement of capacity when comparing under diﬀerent rates and a shift of the reaction at higher potential values is presented.

SECTION Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) samples were synthesized by a sol−gel method. Stoichiometric amounts of LiH2PO4 (Aldrich), NH4H2PO4, and Fe(NO3)3 (Aldrich) are dissolved in deionized water. In a separate beaker, CaHPO4 (Panreac) was dissolved in citric acid. The latter was added as a carbon source using the same concentration as that for LiH2PO4. Then a diluted solution of titanium isopropoxide (Merck, 99%) was prepared in ethanol under an Ar atmosphere, and is added dropwise to reach the ﬁnal stoichiometry. A homogeneous precursor was assured by stirring vigorously at room temperature before warming smoothly overnight to evaporate the solvent. Then the solid precursors were ground and annealed at 750 °C for 10 h under an Ar atmosphere. The precise carbon content was determined by using an Elemental CHNS Eurovector EA 3000 analyzer. Mass percentage values of 15% were recorded.

X-ray diﬀraction patterns were recorded in a Siemens D5000 diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The samples were scanned between 10° and 110° (2θ) by step scan using 0.02°/10 s steps. Scanning electron micrographs were obtained with a JEOL-SM6300. 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements are carried out recording the spectra in transmission mode at room temperature on an EG&G constant accelerator spectrometer. The isomer shifts are given relative to the center of pure α-Fe. The experimental spectra are ﬁtted to Lorentzian lines by using a least-squares based method. The goodness of the ﬁtting is controlled by the usual χ2 test. The spectra of samples after reaction with lithium were recorded under an Ar atmosphere using hermetic (RCA-90) plastic bags.

The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded as the ﬁrst derivative of the absorption signal of an ERS-220/Q spectrometer within the temperature range of 90−400 K. The g factors were determined with respect to a Mn2+/ZnS standard. The signal intensity was established by double integration of the experimental EPR spectrum.

For electrochemical testing, the electrode material was composed by a mixture of the corresponding phosphate sample, carbon black, and poly vinylidene ﬂuoride in a weight ratio of 80:15:5. A slurry was prepared by dispersing this mixture in n-methyl pirrolidinone and stirring gently. Eventually, the paste was spread on Al foils and dried at 120 °C for 5 h. A 9 mm lithium pellet was used as a counter electrode and glass ﬁber sheets (GF/A-Whatman) soaked in 1 M LiPF6 (EC:DEC) as a separator. The lithium Swagelok-type cells were assembled inside a glovebox under a controlled argon atmosphere. These cells were cycled at constant

current between 4.3 and 1.5 V. The electrochemical characterizations were monitored with a Bio-Logic MPG2 multichannel potentiostat/ galvanostat. The rate performance used for the electrodes is designed as C/n rate (n = 0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 20 h), where “n” indicates the number of hours necessary for the reaction with 1 lithium per formula unit. ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION All synthesized Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) compounds have a wellcrystallized structure which can be indexed in the R3̅c space group of the trigonal system (indexed in hexagonal axes in Figures SI-1 and SI-2 of the Supporting Information). In the two series, the hexagonal parameter a remained barely constant, while a signiﬁcant increase of parameter c was detected on increasing iron content (Table 1) and calcium content up to x = 0.3 (Table 2). This increase of the c/a ratio is directly related to a

depopulation of the M1 sites when x is increased.19 Also, this tendency together with an increase in unit cell volume may be interpreted in terms of the larger ionic radius of Fe3+(0.785 Å), and Ca2+(1.14 Å) compared to that of Ti4+ (0.745 Å).20 Consequently, the cell volume correspondingly increased from 1306.4 to 1318.3 Å3 when the iron content was augmented. The Ca2+ cations are ordered along the hexagonal c direction.21

the morphology of carbon-coated Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 powders. The SEM image shows large crystals of several micrometers in size and irregular shapes. The rough surface can be indicative of the agglomeration of primary particles as has been reported for electrode materials prepared by the same procedure.12 Also, a large number of light particles are attached to the phosphate crystals. They were identiﬁed as the carbon phase in situ generated by the thermal decomposition of citric acid in an inert atmosphere. As can be seen in these images, the carbon particles act as bridges connecting electrically the particles of the active material. The morphology of Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 powders is shown in Figure 2. They exhibited big particles of about 50−70 μm. The observed diﬀerences occurred basically on the surface of the larger particles. Thus, for x = 0.1 and 0.2, small particles of about 1 μm covering the surface of the larger particles were observed. When the substitution of Ti4+ by Ca2+ is increased, a higher amount of particles covering the surface appeared and reached an average particle size of about 2.5 and 3.5 μm for x = 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. These particles are very small and isolated particles

0.1 was not included. The extremely low iron content prevented the recording of a spectrum with a reasonable signal adsorption to be ﬁtted. The spectra are characterized by a doublet signal at an isomer shift ascribable to Fe2+ with a high quadrupole splitting (Table 3). A second doublet signal appears at an isomer shift ascribable to Fe3+. This second signal is less split as a consequence of the d5 electronic conﬁguration of the trivalent state for iron and hence a more isotropic distribution of charges around the proof atom than for d6 Fe2+ (Table 3). We should ascribe the presence of divalent iron to the thermal decomposition precursors of citric acid in argon which created a reducing atmosphere during the annealing process. Moreover, the presence of large Fe2+ may contribute to the increase of lattice parameters in the rhombohedral unit cell previously discussed. Therefore, the stoichiometry of the NASICON-type structure can be consequently interpreted with Fe2+ accounting in higher amounts than Fe3+.

To examine the eﬀect of iron and calcium substituted samples on the capacity, cyclic performance, and rate capability of the above-mentioned samples, the electrochemical properties are presented in Figures 4−6. The galvanostatic charge and discharge proﬁles recorded for Li1.2Ti1.9Ca0.1(PO4)3 are similar to those previously reported for LiTi2(PO4)3.12 However, the electrochemical intercalation in samples with larger calcium contents (x ≥ 0.2 in Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3) diﬀered signiﬁcantly (Figure 4a): (i) A slightly lower capacity value was observed as a result of the substitution of Ti4+ by electrochemically inactive Ca2+ (see Table 4), and (ii) an enlargement of the pseudoplateau at ca. 2.8 V was evident in the discharge branch. This plateau is commonly attributed to lithium insertion into free vacant M1 sites. The depopulation of M1 sites when the Li+ content increases upon Ca2+ substitution is responsible for the appearance of this feature in the charge and discharge curve. The plateau at 2.5 V is associated with lithium intercalation into M2 cavities with the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+.22−24 A high Coulombic eﬃciency and low polarization between the charge and discharge curves can also be inferred from this plot. These features may conﬁrm that even if calcium is not electroactive in that operational voltage window, it may favor lithium diﬀusion into the structural framework. In addition, the beneﬁts of adding carbon during the preparation of phosphates for their use in Li test cells should be considered.25,26

To elucidate the process occurring therein, derivative curves were calculated and plotted in Figure 4b and Figure SI-3. The contribution of the signal at 2.5 V decreases while a well-deﬁned peak at 2.8 V develops as calcium content increases. In addition, we observe the growth of a broad peak at ca. 2.25 V and a higher peak area of the plateau at 2.8 V during charge. Despite the known success of LFP in lithium-ion batteries, phosphate cathodes have severe limitations in energy density. Diﬀerent approaches have been proposed in the literature to overcome this drawback. A particularly outstanding example is the use of pyrophosphates by Yamada group recently reported.27 As referred to LFP, pyrophosphates increase their potential vs Li from 3.2 to 3.5 V (ca. 9%), which is enough to compensate for the reduction in capacity due to the increase in weight. In our manuscript we show that an increase from 2.5 to 2.8 V (ca. 11%) can be achieved in NASICON materials by metal substitution without a marked increase in weight. Although the voltages are more modest for NASICON than in the pyrophosphate or LFP, this research may open new routes to tune the energy density of other phosphate cathodes by increasing potential without sacriﬁcing capacity.

To understand the origin of this eﬀect, we have cycled the lithium exclusively between 2.5 and 4.3 V (Figure 5). As can be observed, the extent of this plateau decreased when the potential windows were 2.5−4.3 V. This result evidences a relationship between the plateau enlargement and the new peak at 2.25 V observed for high calcium substitution.

titanium ions in Ca-substituted orthophosphates represents an important issue, which can be studied in a detailed way by means of EPR spectroscopy.28 Ti4+ is a diamagnetic ion. The ground state of Ti(III) with the 3d1 conﬁguration is 2D (S = 1/2) and yields a characteristic EPR spectrum, whose EPR parameters strongly depend on the cation local symmetry. When Ti3+ is located in a crystal ﬁeld with tetrahedral or octahedral coordination, the orbital degeneracy is split, leading to a speciﬁc anisotropy of the g-tensors and deviation from the free electron g-value of 2.0023. Figure 7 compares the EPR spectra for Ca-substituted orthophosphate.

especially in the case when the spectra are registered at room temperature. In the range of g-values between 1.8 and 2.0, the EPR signals due to Ti3+ ions grow in intensities at lower registration temperature. The comparison of the EPR spectra show that two types of EPR signals can be distinguished for the end compositions Ti2Ca0.5(PO4)3 and Li2Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3. For the Li-free composition Ti2Ca0.5(PO4)3, the EPR spectrum displays a nearly symmetric signal with an isotropic g-value of 1.945 and a line width of 15.6 mT, while an anisotropic signal with g1 = 1.845, g2 = 1.861, and g3 = 1.973 and line width of 35, 110, and 35 mT, respectively, gives rise to the EPR proﬁle for the Li-rich composition Li2Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3. The two signals have diﬀerent spin−lattice relaxations: while the isotropic signal is still visible at room temperature, the anisotropic signal is accessible only at low temperatures. The intermediate compositions can be described as a superposition of the two types of signals, the intensity of the anisotropic signal being increased with the Li content. It is worth mentioning that for Li1.6Ti1.7Ca0.3(PO4)3 the anisotropic signal becomes very broad and disturbs the observation of the nearly symmetrical signal.

The EPR spectra are registered at room temperature (20 °C) and liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). Two EPR features can be outlined. In the vicinity of the free electron g-value, a narrow Lorentizan signal due to carbon additives dominates in all EPR spectra,

Table 4. Comparison between the Theoretical versus Experimental Capacity of Diﬀerent Calcium and Iron Substituted Phosphates

To assign the origin of the two EPR signals, we have analyzed the EPR spectra of the Ca-substituted orthophosphates on the basis of the available EPR data on Ti(III) compounds. In the literature, there is a wide variation in the g-values reported for Ti3+ compounds. However, some experimentally established relations between local coordination and g-values can be for Ti3+ located in a tetragonally compressed outlined: tetrahedral site the g-value is higher than the g⊥-value, while the opposite relation is valid for octahedrally coordinated Ti3+. Thus, for tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions isomorphously substituted in the framework of AlPO-5,29 the reported g-values are as follows: g1 = 1.898, g2 = 1.918, and g3 = 1.991. A characteristic EPR feature for tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions, is the value of the g

which are tetragonally compressed, component, which is close to the g-value of the free electron. On the basis of the crystal ﬁeld approximation, the g values for Ti3+ in a tetragonally compressed tetrahedral ﬁeld are expressed to the ﬁrst order by30 and

where λ is the Ti spin−orbit coupling constant and Δ T is the splitting between the eg levels due to the tetragonal distortion. For Ti(III) in a tetragonally distorted octahedral symmetry, the g-values calculated to the ﬁrst order are λ 2 /

g e where Δ O is the splitting between the t2g levels due to tetragonal distortion. This equation means that the g

-value is lower than the g⊥-value. In this case the experimentally observed g-values vary between 1.92 > g

 > 1.88 and 1.98 > g⊥ > 1.94.28−31 An octahedrally coordinated Ti3+ giving rise to an isotropic signal with g = 2.009 and line width of 110 G has been recently established in K2Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3.31

The comparative analysis of the g-values for Ca-substituted orthophosphates allows assigning the anisotropic EPR signal to Ti3+ ions in a tetragonally compressed tetrahedral site. The nearly symmetrical signal comes most probably from octahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions. The observation of the broad EPR signals indicates structural inhomogeneities around the Ti3+ ions with respect to the local coordination and crystal ﬁeld symmetry.

is octahedrally coordinated in the structure of Because Ti Li2Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3, the appearance of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions suggests that these Ti3+ occupy some defect sites. The detection of the signals at low registration temperature implies only a weak spin−lattice relaxation for the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions.

It is important that the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions in the Li-rich end composition participate in the electrochemical reaction of intercalation of Li+ (see Figures SI-3 and SI-4). Figure 7 gives the EPR spectra for the pristine composition and the composition obtained after the ﬁrst discharge and subsequent charge to 4.3 V. It is clear that the anisotropic signal disappears completely during the electrochemical deintercalation of Li+, thus indicating an oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ ions in the course of the electrochemical reaction.

Therefore, the electrochemical inactivity of calcium imposes a limitation in the stoichiometric content of this element, despite the beneﬁcial eﬀect on the lithium diﬀusivity. Otherwise, we recently reported the beneﬁts of the partial substitution of Ti by Fe in the Li1+xTi2−xFex(PO4)3 series as electrodes for lithium c e l l s . F o r

1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 series combining optimal ratios of Ca and Fe in the stoichiometry. Figure 6 shows the galvanostatic and derivatives charge and discharge curves recorded at C/10 for the ﬁrst cycles. In general, they exhibit the same electrochemical features as the iron-free sample, but the extent of both plateaus diﬀers signiﬁcantly in relation to the degree of substitution. The electrodes exhibited a ﬁrst discharge capacity of about 115−120 mA·h/g (Figure 6). An increase of capacity is observed for the second discharge. This fact could be attributed to the presence of Fe2+ in the pristine electrodes that is further oxidized during the ﬁrst charge. Then the electrochemically oxidized Fe3+ would positively contribute with an additional capacity in subsequent discharges (see Table 4). To corroborate this assumption, 57Fe

Mössbauer spectra of discharged and charged electrodes will be discussed below.

Indeed, the plateau line at 2.5 V assigned to insertion of Li into M2 sites (referred to as reduction of Ti4+/Ti3+) is almost horizontal for specimen with low iron/calcium content, whereas when the iron/calcium substitution is increased, the 2.5 V zone is steeper. These proﬁles suggest the occurrence of diﬀerent energetic sites for titanium reaction. The Li ions inserted in the large M2 cavities can occupy two diﬀerent distorted tetrahedral subsites.32 Therefore, the slightly diﬀerent energy of vacant subsites at which lithium is inserted could be responsible for the asymmetry in the discharge and charge curves at this voltage region.

The most important feature is detected in the 2.8 V discharge/ charge plateau as compared to the iron-free sample (Figure 4b, Figure SI-3 and SI-4). When the iron content is increased, this plateau enlarges. This fact can be related to the electrochemical reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, which counteracts the capacity loss due to a decrease of Ti4+. Previous reports on the electrochemical insertion in Li1+xTi2−xFex(PO4)3 clearly assign that plateau to the redox contribution of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple.19 Thus, for the experiments under C/10 rate, we observed a contribution to the total capacity in ﬁrst discharge of about 18, 20, 25, and 30 mA·h/ g, respectively, for the samples with x = 0.1 to 0.4. Ex situ 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of discharged and charged Li1.6Ti1.5Fe0.4Ca0.1(PO4)3 electrodes were recorded (Figure 8, Table 5). The spectrum recorded after the insertion of Li+ down to 2.5 V evidenced that the initial Fe3+ is largely reduced to Fe2+. The signal contribution of Fe3+ decreased from 33.2 to 13%. Possibly, the occurrence of kinetic eﬀects makes diﬃcult a complete iron reduction in the 2.8 V region. After full discharge to 1.5 V, the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum exhibited a doublet line, with an isomer shift of 1.11 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting of 2.24 mm/s characteristic of Fe2+ (93.2%), evidencing that the

discharge at 1.5 V, evidenced that all the Fe3+ is electrochemically reduced to Fe2+ (Figure 8, Table 5).

On lithium insertion into Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, it was reported that when part of the M1 sites are occupied by Mn2+ ions, a voltage plateau close to 2.8 V appears, followed by a second plateau at ca. 2.5 V, in which the excess Li+ occupies M2 sites.24 Moreover, it should be noted that EPR spectroscopy reveals some speciﬁc defects in the LISICON structure, which are occupied by Ti3+ ions. The coordination of Ti3+ in defect sites depends on the Li:Ti ratio. In the Li-free phosphate Ti2Ca0.5(PO4)3, Ti3+ is sixcoordinated, while tetracoordinated Ti3+ appears for the Li-rich phosphate Li2.0Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3. Both tetraand six-coordinated Ti3+ ions are stabilized at the intermediate compositions. Ti3+ ions in the Li-rich end composition participate in the intercalation of Li+ shifting the electrochemical reaction of potential of reaction from 2.5 to 2.8 V in charge, which is a way to attune voltage windows of NASICON-related frameworks.

Cycling life study was performed at diﬀerent kinetics (Figures 9 and 10) to evaluate the eﬀect of metal substitution in Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 samples on cell performance. For the sake of comparison, the results of a LiTi2(PO4)3 sample prepared in the same conditions were also included. Capacity values of 138, 120, and 112 mA·h/g were respectively recorded after the ﬁrst discharge at C/20, C/10, and C/5 rates for LiTi2(PO4)3 (Figure 9a−c). An abrupt capacity fading is observed at 1C rate, while a less steep decrease was observed for experiments kept at constant C/20 and C/10 rates. Thus, the LiTi2(PO4)3 sample reached values lower than 110 and 93 mA· h/g at C/20 and C/10, respectively. When the rate decreases from 2C to C/10, the capacity recovery is poor (∼70 mA·h/g after 40 cycles), meaning that the nonsubstituted material does not retain acceptably the capacity under fast and variable kinetics. In contrast, better electrochemical performances were observed for iron and calcium substituted samples. Thus, the achieved capacity for samples with x = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 was respectively 128.6, 131, and 126 mA·h/g after 100 cycles, which are signiﬁcantly higher than those determined for our LiTi2(PO4)3 sample (ca. 80 mA·h/g, Figure 9). An outstanding electrochemical performance is observed in Li1.6Ti1.5Fe0.4Ca0.1(PO4)3, which delivered 140 mA·h/g after 40 cycles at C/20 and 115 mA· h/g after 100 cycles at C/10. These results show that the presence of iron/calcium in NASICON structure, with the arrangement of TiO6 and PO4 polyhedra, may lead to an open structure which allows fast alkali-ion diﬀusion through the bottlenecks deﬁned by eight-member rings.33

The capacity and cyclability of Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 in Li cells were characterized by galvanostatic charge and discharge tests at

initial Fe3+ is electrochemically reduced. After partially charging the electrode at the end of the low voltage plateau (2.6 V), the spectrum showed no evidence of iron oxidation (Figure 8, Table 5). However, just after a full charge up to 4.3 V, the oxidation to the trivalent state is revealed by a low split doublet with an isomer shift value of 0.37 mm/s and a quadrupole splitting value of 0.96 mm/s. Therefore, almost all the Fe2+ ions are oxidized along the pseudoplateau at 2.8 V. It perfectly explains the increase of capacity observed in ﬁrst charge (at 4.3 V) vs ﬁrst discharge (at 1.5 V) in Figure 6a. Moreover, the eﬀective participation of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple on the long cycling is evidenced by the presence of only Fe2+ in the spectrum recorded after the second Table 5.

important role as in the case of the LiyCa0.5Ti2(PO4)3 system.34 A more stable cycling is possible by double substituting the NASICON framework.

After the ﬁrst discharge, large particles with rough surfaces are observed. On the surface of the large particle is observed that some smaller particles are disconnected. Just after ﬁrst charge at 4.3 V the initial morphology of unreacted electrode (Figure 2D) is recovered. This means that upon charge the structural rigidity of the electrode is preserved. Moreover, irrespective of the occurrence of several cracks in the large particles, the basic preservation of the microstructure on the electrode cycled 100 times is shown in Figure 11C, and evidences a convenient structural rigidity upon extended cycling.

Calcium and iron substituted samples (Li1+2xTi2−xCax(PO4)3 and Li1.2+xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3) are successfully obtained by a sol−gel method. They are indexed in R3̅c space group. An estimation of the unit cell parameters “a” and “c” indicated an increase of c/a as well as the cell volume a as a result of the presence of Ca2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ partially substituting Ti4+. The oxidation state of titanium ions in Ca-substituted orthophosphates represents an important issue. The observation of broad EPR signals indicates structural inhomogeneities aﬀecting the local coordination and crystal ﬁeld symmetry of the Ti3+ ions. Because titanium is octahedrally coordinated in the structure of Li2Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3, the appearance of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions suggests that these Ti3+ occupy defect sites. The detection of the signals at low registration temperature implies a weak spin−lattice relaxation for the tetrahedrally coordinated Ti3+ ions. Ti3+ ions in the Li-rich end composition participate in the electrochemical reaction of intercalation of Li+ shifting the potential of reaction from 2.5 to 2.8 V in charge, which is a way to attune voltage windows of NASICON-related frameworks. 57Fe Mössbauer spectra allowed discerning between Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the initial structure. The electrochemical results showed that introduction of such divalent and trivalent ions improved the electrochemical behavior as compared to LiTi2(PO4)3. From galvanostatic discharge/charge curves it was possible to diﬀer-

diﬀerent rates at room temperature (Figure 10, C/10, C/5, and C/2 rates, Table 4). Capacity retention is good in some cases. The best capacity retention is obtained for x = 0.2 and 0.5 as they delivered capacities of ca. 120 mA·h/g after 60 cycles. On the other hand, for x = 0.3 the capacity is around 105 mA·h/g after 60 cycles and for x = 0.1 the electrochemical behavior is poor (85 mA·h/g). One of the interesting characteristics is the increase of capacity after the ﬁrst cycle due to the presence of Ti3+ occupying some defect sites in the structure of Li2Ti1.5Ca0.5(PO4)3 as evidenced previously by EPR measurements, as discussed above. The general behavior shows that kinetic limitations play a very
