Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) represent an attractive choice for stationary energy storage. Its widespread application relies on the development of novel, reliable cathode materials. Herein, we find NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 manifests simultaneous Zn2+/Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation in a single component electrolyte (2.0 M Zn(CF3SO3)2). The Na3V2(PO4)3/rGO microspheres prepared by spray drying deliver a high specific capacity of 114 mAh g−1 with an average discharge platform of 1.23 V at 50 mA g−1. Impressively, a high capacity of 74 mAh g−1 can be obtained after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1. These excellent electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the stable and open NASICON framework, fast ion diffusion, as well as continuous electron transport. This work sheds light on the development of secondary batteries with hybrid ion intercalation/de-intercalation behaviors using a single component electrolyte.

Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), which is comprised of a metallic Zn anode, an aqueous electrolyte, and a cathode for Zn2+ accommodation, have been identified as a promising choice for stationary energy storage. The virtues of Zn anode include low cost, high theoretical capacity (820 mAh g−1), and feasible redox potential (−0.78 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) in aqueous electrolytes [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The cathode materials for aqueous ZIBs can be generally categorized into three families: Mn-based materials [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], Prussian blue [16], [17], and V-based materials [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, the rapid capacity decay of MnO2 and the limited capacity (~ 50 mAh g−1) of Prussian blue analogs hinder their extensive application [16].

V-based materials, such as VO2, V2O5∙xH2O, H2V3O8, Na2V6O16·xH2O, MgxV2O5·nH2O, Zn3V2O7(OH)2·2H2O, LiV3O8, and VS2, have been extensively investigated as ZIB cathode materials [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. For example, Yan et al. reported a water-lubricated intercalation cathode material (V2O5·nH2O) with a specific capacity of 372 mAh g−1 and an average discharge plateau at ~ 0.6 V [18]. Kim et al. designed a layered-type LiV3O8 cathode, which delivered a specific capacity of 172 mAh g−1 with an average voltage platform of ~ 0.72 V [20]. Alshareef et al. prepared a zinc pyrovanadate (Zn3V2O7(OH)2·2H2O) nanowire cathode, which manifested a capacity of 213 mAh g−1 with an average voltage platform of ~ 0.7 V [19]. Although the V-based materials display relatively high specific capacities, they usually suffer from low discharge plateaus, making them less competitive in energy density.

NASICON (Na ion super ionic conductor) structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is a well-known cathode material for alkali/multivalent ion batteries [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Recently, Huang et al. firstly demonstrated that the NVP can be employed as a ZIB cathode material. In aqueous Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte, two Na+ were extracted from the NVP framework during the first charge, after which Zn2+ intercalated into/de-intercalated from the lattice reversibly, leading to a reversible capacity of 97 mAh g−1 and a discharge platform at 1.1 V vs. Zn2+/Zn [21]. When applied in hybrid Zn//NVP batteries with aqueous CH3COONa/Zn(CH3COO)2 electrolyte, the Na+ could be extracted from/insert into the NVP framework reversibly, giving rise to a capacity of 92 mAh g−1 at a high discharge plateau of 1.42 V vs. Zn2+/Zn [37]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous intercalation/de-intercalation of Zn2+/Na+ into/from NVP in a single component electrolyte has not been realized.

Herein, we demonstrate the simultaneous Zn2+/Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation behavior of Na3V2(PO4)3@reduced graphene oxide (NVP@rGO) in a single component 2.0 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte. The NVP@rGO delivers a high specific capacity of 114 mAh g−1 with an average discharge platform of 1.23 V in the potential window of 0.6 – 1.8 V vs. Zn2+/Zn. Long-term cycling ability (75% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1) and superior rate capability (82 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) is also achieved.
In a typical synthesis, 6 mmol of Na2CO3, 4 mmol of V2O5, and 12 mmol of NH4H2PO4 were added into 90 mL of distilled water and stirred at 70 °C for 30 min. Then, 60 mL of rGO (2 mg mL−1) was added and stirred for another 10 min. Then, the suspension was spray-dried by using a BUCHI Mini Spray Dryer B-290 to prepare the NVP@rGO precursor. After annealing the precursor at 750 °C in Ar for 4 h, the NVP@rGO was obtained.
Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments during electrochemical measurement of the Zn//Zn(CF3SO3)2//NVP@rGO aqueous hybrid-ion batteries were performed on a D8 Discover X-ray diffractometer with a nonmonochromated Cu Kα X-ray source (2θ range: 10 – 60°). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were collected using a JSM-7001F microscope at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM images (HRTEM) were recorded with a JSM-2100F STEM/EDS microscope. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu Axis Ultra spectrometer with an Mg Kα = 1253.6 eV excitation source. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was calculated from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms collected at 77 K using a Tristar-3020 instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) curves were conducted by using a Netzsch STA 449 C simultaneous analyzer.
The cathode was fabricated by pressing a slurry containing NVP@rGO (70 wt%), acetylene black (20 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (10 wt%) onto a titanium foil and dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h. Zn foil with a thickness of 0.25 mm was used as the anode. Aqueous zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2) solution was used as the electrolyte. 2016-type coin cells were assembled by sandwiching a filter paper (Whatman grade A) wetted with an electrolyte between the prepared cathode and zinc foil anode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were tested with a electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT 302 N). Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) test was performed at a current density of 16 mA g−1 on a LAND CT2001A multichannel battery testing system.
The NVP@rGO microspheres are synthesized by a facile spray-drying-assisted method. The XRD pattern of obtained NVP@rGO (Fig. 1a) agrees well with the NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 with a  space group (JCPDS 053-0018). SEM images (Fig. 1b, c) show that the NVP@rGO is composed of microspheres with diameters ranging from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. TEM image further confirms the microspherical morphology of NVP@rGO (Fig. 1d). The (113) lattice fringe of NVP with the interplanar spacing of 0.37 nm can be clearly observed under the HRTEM image (Fig. 1e). Besides, a thin amorphous layer, which might be the rGO, can also be observed at the surface (Fig. 1e). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mappings of the as-prepared NVP@rGO show that the Na, V, P, O, and C elements are homogeneously distributed within the sample (Fig. 1f).

To explore the V valence states of NVP@rGO, the V2p XPS spectrum is collected (Fig. 2a). The V2p core level spectrum displays a spin-orbit doublet with binding energies of 517.0 (2p3/2) and 524.2 eV (2p1/2). The binding energies match well with those of Na3V2(PO4)3, Li3V2(PO4)3, and Na3V1.7Fex(PO4)3 [32], [38], [39], [40]. N2 sorption result shows that the NVP@rGO possesses a specific BET surface area of 21 m2 g−1 (Fig. 2b). TGA is used to study the rGO content. The NVP@rGO shows a weight loss of ~ 4.6% below 600 ◦C (Fig. 2 c), which is attributed to the burning-off of rGO. The Raman spectrum of NVP@rGO (Fig. 2d) displays two characteristic bands of D-band (disorder-induced phonon mode) and G-band (graphite), which are located at 1330 cm−1 and 1598 cm−1, respectively. Meanwhile, the ID to IG ratio is 1.08.

The electrochemical properties of the NVP@rGO for ZIBs are investigated by CV and galvanostatic charge-discharge. During the initial anodic scan, a strong oxidation peak can be observed at 1.39 V, which is attributed to the de-intercalation of Na+ from the NVP framework (Fig. 3a). The subsequent cathodic scan displays two reduction peaks at 1.26 and 1.02 V, which are caused by the co-intercalation of Na+ and Zn2+ into the NaxV2(PO4)3 framework, respectively. In the second anodic scan, a new oxidation peak at 1.26 V appears, which is attributable to the Zn2+ de-intercalation from the material. From the second cycle onward, two pairs of reduction/oxidation peaks located at ~ 1.26/1.39 and 1.02/1.26 V can be clearly observed, which are caused by the intercalation/de-intercalation of Na+ and Zn2+, respectively. In addition, the redox peaks associated with Zn2+ intercalation/de-intercalation processes strengthen with cycling, accompanying the gradual weakening of Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation redox peaks (Fig. 3a).

Representative charge-discharge profiles of NVP@rGO at 50 mA g−1 are displayed in Fig. 3b. Agreeing well with the CV results, the first charge process shows only one charge plateaus. For the subsequent discharge processes, two plateaus can be observed at ~ 1.3 and 1.05 V, corresponding to the intercalation of Na+ and Zn2+. The average discharge platform is determined to be ~ 1.23 V. At a current density of 50 mA g−1, the NVP@rGO delivers an initial capacity of 114 mAh g−1, among which 83 mAh g−1 is contributed from the Na+ intercalation and 31 mAh g−1 is from the Zn2+ intercalation (Fig. S1). After 50 cycles at 50 mA g−1, the capacity fades slowly to ~ 95 mAh g−1 (Fig. 3c). At 500 mA g−1, the NVP@rGO shows an initial discharge capacity of 101 mAh g−1 and maintains 75% (~ 76 mAh g−1) after 200 cycles (Fig. 3d). Besides the excellent cycling performance, the NVP@rGO also demonstrates superior rate capability (Fig. 3e). The NVP@rGO delivers high discharge capacities of 107, 102, 99, 96, 88, and 82 mAh g−1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000 mA g−1, respectively (Fig. 3e and S2). When the current density is reduced to 50 mA g−1, around 93% of the initial discharge capacity can be recovered.

To explain the superior rate performance of NVP@rGO, GITT and EIS are employed to explore the ion diffusion coefficient and charge transfer resistance (Fig. S3 and S4). Although the divalent nature of Zn2+, the Zn2+ diffusion coefficient determined by GITT is as high as ca. 10−8 to 10−9 cm2 s−1, even higher than that of Na+ diffusion coefficient (~ 10−10 to 10−9 cm2 s−1). From the Nyquist plots, the charge transfer resistance of the NVP@rGO cathode is determined to be 80 Ω. The GITT and EIS results clearly demonstrate the fast kinetics of ion/electron transport in the NVP@rGO cathode, which is beneficial for the rate performance.

To elucidate the charge storage mechanism, ex-situ XPS and XRD are performed. The XPS spectra of the NVP/rGO in its original state, charged state (charged to 1.8 V), and discharged state (discharged to 0.6 V) are shown in Fig. 4a – b and Fig. S5. In the original state, the Na 1s peak located at 1077 eV can be clearly discerned, while there is no signal of Zn. After charging to 1.8 V, the intensity of the Na 1s peak decreases significantly, indicating the extraction of Na+ from the NVP@rGO; still, there is no signal for Zn. When discharged to 0.6 V, both Na and Zn can be detected in the sample. The ex-situ XPS results unambiguously demonstrate the co-intercalation of Zn2+ and Na+ into the NaxV2(PO4)3 framework during the subsequent discharge process.

The crystalline structure of NVP@rGO during the charge/discharge processes is monitored by ex-situ XRD (Fig. 4c). During the first charge (Na+ extraction) process, the (116) diffraction located at ~ 32.1° shifts towards higher 2θ positions and weakens in intensity. A similar trend can be observed for the (113) diffraction located at ~ 23.8°. Even for the sample under a fully charged state, its XRD pattern resembles that of the original NVP@rGO despite its weak intensity, suggesting the excellent structural stability of the NVP NASICON framework. Upon discharge to 1.2 V, both the (116) and (113) diffractions shift to lower 2θ positions, which is caused by the Na+ intercalation. Upon further discharge to 0.6 V, the (211) and (113) diffractions shift rightward slightly, which is caused by the Zn2+ intercalation. Besides, the diffractions strengthen in intensity during the discharge.

To study the role of de-intercalated Na+ during the subsequent discharge/charge processes, the NVP@rGO is charged to 1.8 V, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and then assembled with a Zn anode and Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte for the electrochemical performance test. Due to the absence of Na+ in the electrolyte, the obtained NaxV2(PO4)3 @rGO exhibits only one discharge platform at ~ 1.15 V, while no discharge platform at ~ 1.3 V can be detected (Fig. S6 and S7). The result clearly demonstrates that the discharge plateau at ~ 1.15 V is caused by Zn2+ intercalation while the discharge plateau at ~ 1.3 V is caused by Na+ intercalation.

Based on the above results and discussions, the electrochemical reactions happen in the NVP@rGO cathode can be described as follows (Fig. 4d):
first charge: Na3V2(PO4)3 → (3-x) Na+ + (3-x) e- + NaxV2(PO4)3 the subsequent discharge/charge: NaxV2(PO4)3 + z Zn2+ + y Na+ + (2z+y) e- ↔ ZnzNa(x+y)V2(PO4)3

When compared to the recently reported aqueous Li/Na/Zn-ion batteries, the Zn//Zn(CF3SO3)2//NVP@rGO battery with Zn2+ and Na+ co-intercalation behavior in this study manifests comparable or even better electrochemical performance in terms of energy density and power density (Fig. S8) [19], [20], [21], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], demonstrating its great potential in stationary energy storage.

In summary, we design a Na3V2(PO4)3/reduced graphene oxide (NVP@rGO) composite cathode material for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. The obtained NVP@rGO demonstrates simultaneous Zn2+/Na+ intercalation/de-intercalation behaviors in a single component electrolyte (2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2). The NVP@rGO manifests a high specific capacity of 114 mAh g−1 with an average discharge plateaus at 1.23 V vs. Zn2+/Zn. Excellent cycling (74 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 500 mA g−1) and rate performances (82 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1) are also obtained. These excellent electrochemical performances can be ascribed to the stable and open NASICON framework, fast ion diffusion, as well as continuous electron transport. This work sheds light on the development of secondary batteries with hybrid ion intercalation/de-intercalation behaviors using a single component electrolyte.
