Eu2+ doped A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors with the NASICON structure were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. Their photoluminescent and structural properties were investigated by photoluminescent spectroscopy and powder X-ray Rietveld analysis, which determined two sites for Eu2+ ions in the host structure, 3a and 3b. The Eu–O bond lengths were increased by changing alkaline earth ions from Ca to Ba, causing Eu2+ emission bands to shift from blue-green to blue. A correlation was observed between the peak wavelength positions and the Eu–O bond length. The photoluminescent properties are discussed in terms of crystal field strength and nephelauxetic effect, and a schematic diagram of Eu2+ emissions is proposed for the Eu2+ doped NASICON phosphor.

Much recent attention has been paid to phosphors suitable for light-emitting diode (LED) based solid-state lighting. White LEDs offer the advantages of high brightness, low power consumption, and longer lifetime compared to conventional light bulbs and fluorescent lamps [1,2]. The most common approach involves combining a blue GaInN LED chip (460 nm) with a yellowemitting phosphor, Y3Al5O12:Ce3+. This system has a low colorrendering index because of its deficiency in the red region of the visible spectrum. One approach to overcome this drawback is to add a red-emitting phosphor to compensate for the deficiency [3–5]. Another approach is to develop a new white LED system consisting of ultraviolet (UV) LEDs (300–410 nm) with red, blue, and green phosphors [6–8]. This system is suitable for white LEDs with an excellent color-rendering index and high color tolerance. To advance this technology, phosphors with desirable color emission and high efficiency under UV excitation must be developed. Eu2+ doped alkaline metal phosphates are one class of desirable phosphors for UV excitation [9]. In this work, we focused on phosphates with the NASICON (sodium silicon conductor) structure, which consists of a three-dimensional network of MO6 (M ¼ Ti, Zr, Hf) octahedra, sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra and containing interstitial A ions (A ¼ alkaline or alkaline earth metal) [10] (Fig. 1). Phosphate NASICONs could offer several conditions suitable for Eu2+ doped phosphor: (i) The covalent M2(PO4)3 framework has high thermal stability. (ii) Eu2+ is expected to substitute for A ion sites, which are separated from each others by distances 45 A˚ [1 1,12]. The location would inhibit concentration quenching of Eu2+ emission intensity. (iii) Crystal field strength and covalency of the Eu–O bond, which are related to the energy of the 4f65d1 level in Eu2+, could be easily controlled by changing the chemical composition of the NASICON structure [13–16]. Although NASICON compounds have attracted significant attention for their diversity of fast-ionic conductivity [16,17] and low thermal expansion [18,19], as well as the dependence of these properties on the framework structure, few studies have focused on their photoluminescent properties. Even though NASICON-type EuII0:5Zr2ðPO4Þ3 has been reported to be an efficient blue phosphor [20], the luminescent characteristics have not been investigated in detail. In the present study, we synthesized Eu2+ doped A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba), and demonstrated continuous changes in emission wavelengths of Eu2+ by alkaline earth ions. The locations of Eu2+ were determined by X-ray Rietveld structural analysis, and effects of the framework structural changes on luminescent properties were discussed in terms of crystal field strength and covalency of the Eu–O bond.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns for A0.5Zr2(PO4)3:0.01Eu2+ (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba). The diffraction peaks can be assigned to the NASICON structure with the R-3 space group [23,24]. The peaks shifted to lower degrees from Ca to Ba systems, resulting from the lattice expansion. Several samples also contained a small amount of ZrP2O7 phase (Pm-3). To evaluate the impurity effect, we synthesized ZrP2O7 and ZrP2O7:Eu under the same conditions as A0.5Zr2(PO4)3:Eu2+. No significant difference in the cell parameter was observed between Eu2+ doped ZrP2O7 (8.2635(5) A˚ ) and undoped ZrP2O7 (8.2640(7) A˚ ). A very weak peak around 460 nm of Eu2+ in EuO [25] was observed in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of ZrP2O7:Eu, while no emission of Eu3+ in ZrP2O7 [26] and Eu2O3 [27] was observed. These results indicates that ZrP2O7:Eu constituted of pure ZrP2O7 and EuO phases. Fig. 3 shows PL excitation (PLE) and PL spectra of A0.5Zr2(PO4)3:0.01Eu2+. The main excitation peaks extended from 300 to 400 nm, indicating that the phosphors are suitable for near-UV excitation. The phosphors exhibited broad emissions around 400–600 nm, corresponding to transitions between the crystal field components of the 4f65d1 excited state and the 4f7 ground state in Eu2+. After changing alkaline earth ions from Ca to Ba, peak wavelengths shift from 484.4 to 435.0 nm with a decrease in full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) values. Fig. 4 shows the PL spectra of (Ca1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 at different Eu concentrations (x ¼ 0.005–0.10). The positions of the emission peaks showed blue-shift behavior with increasing Eu concentrations. These results demonstrate that the chromaticity of the Eu2+ doped NASICON phosphors change with the A cation species. The emission intensity increased continuously with increasing Eu concentration, and no concentration quenching was observed until x ¼ 0.10.

The location of Eu2+ in the NASICON structure was investigated by the structural analysis for Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3:Eu2+ varying Eu concentrations. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of lattice parameter on Eu concentration for (Ca1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (x ¼ 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10). The a parameter decreased and the c parameter increased with increasing Eu concentration, following Vegard’s law. This indicates the incorporation of Eu2+ ions into the NASICON structure. Pet’kov et al. have investigated lattice changes in NASICON-type A00.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A0 ¼ Cd, Ca, Sr, Ba) [28]. The parameter a decreased and the parameter c increased with increasing radius of A0 cations, which occupy half of the interstitial cavities situated between neighboring ZrO6 octahedra along the c axis. The lattice changes of (Ca1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 with increasing Eu concentration indicated the substitution of Eu2+ for interstitial Ca2+, because Eu2+ has larger ion radii (1.2 A˚ ) than Ca2+ ion (1.0 A˚ ) [29]. Therefore, the structure of Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was used as a starting structural model for the Rietveld analysis. Fig. 6a shows a typical Rietveld result for (Ca1?xEux)0.5 Zr2(PO4)3 (x ¼ 0.10). The refined parameters are summarized in Table 1. The Ca and Eu ions occupy both 3a and 3b sites, with a distribution of 89.6% and 10.4%, respectively. No significant change in the distribution of 3a and 3b sites was observed with changing Eu concentration. These sites are located in the elongated antiprism formed by the triangular faces of two ZrO6 octahedra, and therefore have a similar local environment. No peak separation of Eu2+ emissions from each site in the PL spectra seems to be related to the Eu distribution and the similarity of the site environment among 3a and 3b sites. Fig. 6b and c show Rietveld results for (Sr0.99Eu0.01)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and (Ba0.99Eu0.01)0.5Zr2(PO4)3, which were refined using the same structural model as was used for (Ca1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3. Eu ions substituted for Sr2+ (1.2 A˚ ) and Ba2+ (1.3 A˚ ) ions, which both have larger ionic radii than Ca2+ ions (1.0 A˚ ). Table 2 summarizes the lattice parameters, Eu–O bond lengths, and peak energies of Eu2+ emissions for (A1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba; x ¼ 0–0.1). The lengths of the Eu–O bond, which is almost parallel to the c axis (Fig. 1), increased with lattice expansion along the c axis. The long distance between neighboring Eu2+ ions (over 6 A˚ ) m a y enable high concentration-quenching performance of Eu2+-doped NASICON phosphors.

Eu2+ ions exhibit broadband emissions, which are attributed to the transition from the 4f65d1 excited state to the 4f7 ground state. The energy level of the external 5d orbital depends on the host structure, changing the wavelength of the emission bands from near-UV to red [13]. The effects of the host structure have been explained as arising mainly from two factors, crystal field effect and nephelauxetic effect [13–16]. Our Rietveld analysis of A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba) confirmed that the Eu ion occupies interstitial 3a and 3b sites in the covalent Zr2(PO4)3 framework: Eu ions located in relatively ionic environments and created the ionic bonds with ligand oxygen. Therefore, the lowest 4f65d1 state of Eu2+ depends is related to the crystal field strength. In the case that Eu2+ ions have similar bond character to the ligand O2? ions, the crystal field splitting becomes larger with decreasing Eu–O bond length [15], leading to a decrease in the difference between the 4f and 5d energy levels in Eu2+. The emission bands of Eu2+ shift to a higher energy with an increase in crystal field strength. Table 2 summarizes the relationship between the energies of the 4f–5d transition in Eu2+ and the Eu–O bond lengths in (A1?xEux)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba). A clear correlation was experimentally observed between the energies of Eu2+ emissions and the Eu–O bond length. Matsui et al. reported luminescent properties of Eu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 with the NASICON structure [19]. E u0.5Zr2(PO4)3 has lattice parameters similar to Sr0.5Zr2(PO4)3 due to the very similar ion radii of Eu2+ and Sr2+. The peak wavelength of Eu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was appeared around 460 nm, which is very similar to that of (Sr0.99Eu0.01)0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (459.0 nm) shown in the present study. This result indicated that the Eu–O bond length is a key parameter of emission energies of Eu2+ in A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba). Fig. 7 shows a schematic energy level diagram of Eu2+ ions in A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 NASICONs as a function of crystal field strength. These results demonstrate that chromaticity of Eu2+ emissions in the NASICON structure are controlled by changing the Eu–O bond length.

The center of gravity of the crystal-field splitting is affected by the host lattice anion. When the ligand anions share electrons with Eu2+ ion, the 5d level of Eu2+ shifts to lower energy. The ligand O2? ions constitute the framework structure in the NASICON structure, and the bond character of the framework influences the nephelauxetic effect of O2? on the 5d level of Eu2+ at the interstitial sites. For A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba), the Zr2(PO4)3 framework was strictly covalent. Therefore, the nephelauxetic effect of O2? did not change with the substitution of A ions because of the small changes in the Zr2(PO4)3 framework. On the contrary, the nephelauxetic effect of O2? is changed using a different NASICON framework. Recently, we investigated the luminescent properties of Eu-doped sulfate NASICON [30], NaZnAl(SO4)3:Eu2+, which exhibited the Eu2+ emissions at higher energy than phosphate NASICONs (Fig. 8). As sulfur and aluminum have higher electronegativity (2.6 and 1.6) than phosphorus and zirconium (2.2 and 1.3) [31], the framework structure of the sulfate NASICON is more covalent than that of the phosphate. The nephelauxetic effect of O2? in the sulfate NASICONs was smaller than the phosphate. This explains the shift to higher energy in the sulfate compared to the phosphates. A wide chromaticity of Eu2+ doped NASICONs is expected to be obtained by changing the cation and anion species in the framework structure.

Eu2+ doped NASICON structured A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors exhibited the blue and blue-green colored emissions attributed to 4f65d1–4f7 transitions under UV excitation. Eu2+ ions located at two interstitial spaces in the Zr2(PO4)3 framework, which consisted of covalent Zr–O and P–O bonds. The Eu–O bond length increased with the expansion of c axis from the Ca to Ba systems. The emission energies of Eu2+ ions were discussed on crystal field strength and the covalency of the framework structure. The Eu2+ emissions in the ionic environments shifted to higher energy with increasing Eu–O bond lengths due to the small crystal field splitting. The comparison to Eu2+-doped sulfate NASICON indicated that, the framework composition changes center of gravity of the crystal-field splitting in Eu2+. The two significant parameters vary with the elements forming the framework structure, making continuous control of the emissions from Eu2+ doped A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphors.
