In this work, Integrated Mechanical and Thermal Activation(IMTA) process is used to synthesize pure natrium super ionconductor (NaSICON), Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), powderwhich is then utilized to fabricate NaSICON/polymer compositemembranes.
The composite membranes are fabricated via tapecastingof a NaSICON slurry, followed by sintering of the greentape to partial densification and then infiltrating the partiallysintered tape with polyethylene (PE).
The Na-ion conductivities ofIMTA-processed NaSICON membranes are characterized and thetotal conductivity of IMTA-processed membranes without polymeris found to be 3.04 ± 0.1 × 10-4 S/cm, while the sintered bulkdensity is 3.04 g/cm3. Most importantly, this study has achievedand proved the feasibility and mechanical flexibility ofNaSICON/polymer composite membranes.
Although the IMTA parameters presented in this study may not be the most effectiveones to process Na3Zr2Si2PO12 NaSICON, they did result in pure NaSICON phase.
Phasepure NaSICON can be synthesized via the IMTA process, which is faster and moreenergy efficient, and could reduce the manufacturing cost significantly (8-10).
Furthermore, high ionic conductivity of IMTA-processed NaSICON is observed(3.04±0.10 × 10-4 S/cm), and nearly identical to the reported value for those synthesizedvia traditional process (1, 4).
NaSICON/polymer membranes of 30 to 40 μm thicknessare fabricated by tape casting of IMTA-processed NaSICON powders and infiltrationtechniques.
The density of partially sintered thin tapes varies from 80 to 85%.
The PEinfiltrated membranes exhibit great mechanical flexibility.
The membranes aremechanical robust and could be bent by hands easily, while the study of removing thesurface polymer is still on-going.
