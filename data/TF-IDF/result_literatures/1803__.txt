A new copper Nasicon of composition Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 has been prepared and reduced under hydrogen ﬂow at 500 and 675 8C, separately. The unreduced and reduced products are characterized by IR spectra and powder X-ray diffraction. The copper Nasicon and the products obtained by its reduction crystallize in the rhombohedral lattice with space group R 3c. The ESR and Mo¨ssbauer spectral results suggest only partial reduction of both Cu2C , respectively, with simultaneous hydrogen insertion to balance the charge. A reaction in conformity with the obtained results is proposed. 
Sodium (Na) super ionic conductors (Nasicons) with (PO3)4 are a class of structurally general formula AMM isomorphous 3D framework compounds possessing high conductivity, often comparable to that of liquid electrolytes at higher temperatures. The high ionic conductivity of these materials is used in making devices such as membranes, fuel cells and gas sensors. The other potential applications of this class of compounds include host for radioactive waste, catalyst supports, ion exchangers, as low thermal expansion ceramics and in insertion/extraction reactions. The framework of these materials permit a large number of and P sites giving rise to a range substitutions at A, M, M' of compositions. 
The site ‘A’ can be occupied by  Na+, Li+, K+, Ag+, Cu+, NH4+ , H3O+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Sr2+, etc. 
The sites M and M0 can be occupied by tri, tetra or pentavalent ions. The site ‘P’ can be partially substituted by As5+. The framework structure is a rigid, three-dimensional network of PO4 (or SiO4) tetrahedra sharing corners with MO6 (or M'O6) octahedra encapsulating the mobile ‘A’ ions in the interconnected tunnels (Fig. 1). The tunnels may be completely vacant, partially occupied or completely occupied by ‘A’ ions. These features suggest the possibility of inserting metal ions and hydrogen into the channels rendering the possibility of using these materials as catalysts. The prerequisite for metal ion or hydrogen insertion is the existence of empty (or partially empty) channels and the presence of ion with variable oxidation state at A, M or M' sites. In Nasicons containing non-reducible ions, the strategy adopted for hydrogen insertion is to exchange the mobile ‘A’ ion (or with NH+4 ions and subsequent heating).
However, in Nasicons containing reducible ions, hydrogen insertion is carried out by reducing the compound in hydrogen atmosphere at suitable temperatures. We have earlier investigated the hydrogen insertion into Cu0.5NbAlP3O12 and Ca0.5NbFeP3O12. In these compounds, it was observed that both Cu2+ were reduced to Cu0 and Fe2+ giving rise to compositions HNbAlP3O12 and Ca0:5HxNbFe3C (xw0.95), respectively. In both these cases, the number of ions present in the channels did not exceed 1.5. One way of increasing the number of hydrogens in the channels is to have two or more reducible ions in the lattice. Since, copper and iron are easily reducible, stable in different oxidation states and can be easily studied by ESR and Mo¨ssbauer, respectively, we have prepared a new composition containing these ions namely Cu0.5TaFeP3O12. In this paper, we report preparation, powder X-ray diffraction, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), ESR and Mo¨ssbauer studies of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 (hereafter CTFP).
Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 (CTFP): Stoichiometric amounts of Ta2O5, Fe2O3, NH4H2PO4 and Cu2O (all are analytical reagents obtained from SD chemicals) were thoroughly mixed in a mortar with spectral grade acetone (SD chemicals). The resultant powder was sequentially heated at 500 8C (4 h), 750 8C (4 h) and 1075 8C (6 h). This process resulted in a brown compound.
A small amount (about 1 g) of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 was placed in a ceramic boat and reduced at 500 8C (10 h) by passing hydrogen gas in a tube furnace. In another experiment, about one gram of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 was reduced at 675 8C (10 h). The sample reduced at 675 8C was found to be brown black in colour.
Density of CTFP was experimentally determined using xylene as the immersion liquid. Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded on INEL (France) powder X-ray diffractometer with CPS 120 curved position sensitive detector using Co Ka1 radiation. The unit cell parameters are derived by using a computer programme by giving the d and hkl values as input parameters.
Mo¨ssbauer spectra with good statistics were recorded in transmission geometry using a 5 mCi 57Co in Rh source. The Mo¨ssbauer drive (Nucleonics, Hyderabad, India) was used in constant acceleration mode. The g-ray detector was a gas ﬁlled (97% XeC3% CO2 at 2 atm. pressure) proportional counter from LND Corporation, India. The spectra were ﬁtted using 2 or 4 Lorentzians. Room temperature ESR spectra were recorded on a JEOL PE-3X X-band spectrometer equipped with a 100 kHz ﬁeld modulation unit. DPPH was used to calibrate the magnetic ﬁeld. Temperature programmed reduction was carried out on AutoChem 2910 (Micromeritics) instrument using 100 mg of oven dried (at 373 K for 15 h) sample as reported in literature.
The temperature-programmed reduction of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 is shown in Fig. 2. It shows two peaks at 485 and 650 8C and the proﬁle above 700 8C indicates a tendency towards attaining another peak, which could not be recorded due to the limitation of the instrument. To understand the nature of the reduced products, the parent compound is reduced at 500 and 675 8C in a ﬂow of hydrogen for 10 h each as discussed in experimental section.
The powder XRDs recorded at room temperature for unreduced CTFP and the XRDs for those samples, which are reduced at 500 and 675 8C, are presented in Fig. 3. They indicate that CTFP samples are free from impurities. Further, they indicate that CTFP samples are isomorphous with NbTiP3O12. The copper ions occupy the channels. All the reﬂections are indexed in a rhombohedral nasicon lattice with space group, R3C using a least square ﬁt program. The unit cell parameters thus obtained are given in Table 1 along with the unit cell parameters of related copper Nasicon compounds. Using the unit cell parameters obtained, the d-spacings are calculated and are given in Table 2 along with the observed d-spacings.
Though no changes were observed in the XRD proﬁles of reduced products, a negligible change in the lattice parameters was observed. This is expected, as the insertion of hydrogen into the lattice of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 does not alter the skeleton of the parent compound. These results indicate that the hydrogen ions occupy the partially empty channels.
The infrared spectra of CTFP and its reduced product at 675 8C show characteristic PO4 bands in the region 1500– K1. The observed bands in the frequency ranges 400 cm K1 1250–1000 cm (n4) are attributed to asymmetric (nd) and symmetric stretching (ns) of (P–O) and antisymmetric degenerate dd (OPO) bending, respectively. An interesting observation is the K1 in the reduced appearance of bands at 1222 and 549 cm products, which are close to those observed for a similar reduced copper Nasicon of composition Cu0.5Hf2P3O12. These bands are assigned to the vibration modes (H– PO4)2- resulting from the introduction of protons in the compound.
The room temperature Mo¨ssbauer spectra of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 and its reduced products are shown in Fig. 4. Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 gave a simple quadrupole split spectrum characteristic of paramagnetic nature of the sample and absence of any magnetic interactions. The quadrupole splitting and isomer shift values of 0.49 mm s -1 observed for Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 are character0.32 mm s istic of Fe3+ ion in high spin octahedral coordination [Table 3]. The Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 reduced at 500 C for 10 h indicates an asymmetric behaviour, which could be easily ﬁtted into two quadrupole split spectra corresponding to Fe2+ components (Fig. 4). The large quadrupole split and isomer shift values correspond to Fe2+ in high-spin octahedral conﬁguration, while the lower quadrupole splitting and isomer shift values correspond to Fe3+ component (Table 3). This indicates the incomplete reduction of Fe3+ . 
The room temperature Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of the product reduced at 675 C for 10 h was found to be identical with that of the sample reduced at 500 C for 10 h. These results are in contrast to that of Ca0.5NbFeP3O12, which was reduced to about 95% but they are similar to CaTiFeP3O12, where almost half of Fe3+ at the same temperature. 
This may be due to the presence of copper ions present in the channels, which prevent further occupation of hydrogen ions in the channels. Further, at 500 C, Cu2+ and the hydrogen entering into the lattice due to charge compensation (xCu2CCx/2H2 in the channels preventing the complete reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ . To understand the reduction of copper by hydrogen, two experiments were carried out. In the ﬁrst case, the samples reduced at 500 and 675 C were added to nitric acid solution. No blue colour was developed indicating the absence of metallic copper in the reduced product. Powder XRD of this reduced sample also did not show the peaks corresponding to metallic copper. Thus, the reduction of Cu2+ to metallic copper is ruled out. In the second case, the reduced products were subjected to ESR measurements. The results are presented below.
The room temperature ESR spectra of (i) unreduced Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 (ii) the sample reduced at 500 C and (iii) the sample reduced at 675 C are presented in Fig. 5(a)–(c), respectively. The unreduced sample shows a broad signal with a g value of 2.000. It can be seen that the parallel and perpendicular components of the ESR signal are not resolved. It is known that generally, for powder samples of copper (with large concentration of copper) a broad symmetric signal is expected to be observed. The observed ESR signal could be due to (i) Cu2+ alone or (iii) due to the combined effect of Cu2+ . Our earlier ESR results on Ca0.5NbFeP3O12 indicate that no ESR signal is observed at room temperature. Since Ca0.5NbFeP3O12 and Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 are isomorphous with each other, it is reasonable to expect that the ESR signal observed in the present sample, Cu0.5TaFeP3O12, is attributable to Cu2+ alone or (ii) Fe3+ and not to Fe3+ ion.
ESR spectra of the samples reduced at 500 and 675 C are sharp compared to unreduced sample. Further, there is no change in the g value. When the CTFP sample is reduced in the presence of hydrogen, the Cu2+ gets converted to ions. This is Cu equivalent to doping of Cu2+ ion in a diamagnetic lattice, which often gives, sharp ESR signal. The intensity of thesample reduced at 675 C is less compared to the sample reduced at 500 C indicating a further depletion of Cu2+ ions. These results are in contrast to the results obtained in the case of Cu0.5NbAlP3O12, which was reduced to metallic copper and HNbAlP3O12. In the present case the Cu2+ ions are reduced to Cu ions and are retained within the channels. This leads to incomplete reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ as seen in the Mo¨ssbauer results. The proposed scheme of reactions for the reduction of Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 are shown below.
Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 and its reduced product Hx0Cy0Cu2C0:5Kx0 Cu1Cx0 TaFe3C1Ky0Fe2Cy0 P3O12 are isomorphous with NbTiP3O12. The incomplete reduction is probably due to simultaneous reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ and Fe3+ to Fe2+ where, further reduction of Cu+ becomes less probable due to the obstruction caused by hydrogen that is already present in the channels.
