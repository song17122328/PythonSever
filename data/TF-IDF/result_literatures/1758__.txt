Na3AZr(PO4)3 (A ¼ Mg, Ni) phosphates were prepared at 750 1C by coprecipitation route.
Their crystal structures have been refinedat room temperature from X-ray powder diffraction data using Rietveld method.
Li2.6Na0.4NiZr(PO4)3 was synthesized through ionexchange from the sodium analog.
These materials belong to the Nasicon-type structure.
Raman spectra of Na3AZr(PO4)3 (A ¼ Mg, Ni)phosphates present broad peaks in favor of the statistical distribution in the sites around PO4 tetrahedra.
Diffuse reflectance spectraindicate the presence of octahedrally coordinated Ni2+ ions.

Chemical analysisrevealed that the Na+2Li+ ion-exchange was notcomplete: the final product presented the formula Li2.6Na0.4NiZr(PO4)3. 
Its purity and lattice parametersdetermination were carefully monitored by XRD on aPanalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer (CoKa radiation).
Diffraction data of Na3AZr(PO4)3 (A ¼ Mg, Ni) phosphateswere collected at room temperature on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer.
Raman spectra were recorded using a Dilor XY Ramanmicroprobe.
The samples were excited with the 514.5nmline of an argon ion laser (Coherent model Innova 300).

Assuming that Na3MgZr(PO4)3 andNa3NiZr(PO4)3 belong to the Nasicon family, the Zr(A), Pand O atoms are in the (12c), (18e) and (36f) Wyckoffpositions, respectively, of the R¯3c space group.

Na3MgZr(PO4)3 was then used as a model torefine the structure of Na3NiZr(PO4)3. Na atoms wereassumed to occupy the M(1) and M(2) sites.
In the firststep, Na occupy fully the M(1) site and the excess ofsodium (two atoms) was located in the M(2) site (18e).

In the second step, theoccupancies of Na(1) and Na(2) sites were allowed tovary, but the total sodium contents were constrained to 3.
The result of these refinements show clearly a partialoccupancy of M(1) and M(2) sites.

These values indicate a weak crystal field forNi2+ and a covalent character of Ni–O bond in goodagreement with structural results which showed that Ni2+ions are located in the framework [NiZr(PO4)3].
A new phosphates Li2.6Na0.4NiZr(PO4)3 and Na3NiZr(PO4)3 have been obtained, respectively, by ion exchangeand coprecipitation routes.
Structures of Na3AZr(PO4)3(A ¼ Mg, Ni) have been refined from X-ray powderdiffraction using Rietveld method.
The latter phosphatesbelong to the Nasicon family and crystallize in the R¯3cspace group.
A2+ (A ¼ Mg, Ni) and Zr4+ cations arestatistically distributed in the octahedral sites (12c) of theframework.
Na atoms occupy partially M(1) and M(2)sites.
Raman spectra of these phosphates present broadpeaks due to the statistical occupation of the sites (12c,M(1) andM(2)) around PO4 tetrahedra.
Optical studyshows a covalent character of Ni–O bonds.
