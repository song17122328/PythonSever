Sodium batteries have been regarded as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage application, provided cathode hosts with high energy density and long cycle life can be found. Herein, we report NASICON-structured Na3MnZr(PO4)3 as a cathode for sodium batteries that exhibits an electrochemical performance superior to those of other manganese phosphate cathodes reported in the literature. Both the Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples are reversibly accessed in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, providing high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V, respectively. A high discharge capacity of 105 mAh g–1 was obtained from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with a small variation of lattice parameters and a small volume change on extraction of two Na+ ions per formula unit. Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 exhibits an excellent cycling stability, retaining 91% of the initial capacity after 500 charge/discharge cycles at 0.5 C rate. On the basis of structural analysis and density functional theory calculations, we have proposed a detailed desodiation pathway from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 where Mn and Zr are disordered within the structure. We further show that the cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion of Mn3+ is suppressed in the cathode and that Na2MnZr(PO4)3 is a stable phase.

The integration of electric power generated from renewable sunlight and wind energy cannot be used unless it is stored in large-scale rechargeable batteries to smooth the supply of this electric power into the grid. (1,2) The ubiquitous availability of sodium from the oceans makes sodium batteries preferable to lithium batteries provided cathode hosts for Na+ extraction/insertion can be identified with sufficiently high voltage versus Na+/Na, a long cycle life, and fast charge/discharge rates. (3−5) The stored energy density is <V(q)> × Q(Idis) at a constant current Idis = dq/dt, where <V(q)> is the cell voltage averaged over the state of charge q and the capacity Q(Idis) is the number of electrons transferred from the anode to the cathode per unit weight and/or volume in the time Δt for the electrochemical reaction at a desired rate between the two electrodes. (6) Because the electrodes change volume during a charge/discharge cycle, a small volume change of the cathodes during a charge/discharge cycle is preferred even with a liquid electrolyte.

A number of layered transition-metal oxides have been investigated as cathodes for a sodium battery, but they have been plagued by large volume changes and phase instabilities during cycling. (7−9) However, transition-metal cyanides with a Prussian-blue structure provide low-cost, facile synthesis and low activation energies for Na+ insertion/extraction. (10−14) Another important category of Na+ cathode hosts consists of polyanionic transition-metal compounds with open-framework structures. (15−19) The strong binding in the polyanions can offer structural stability and a relatively small volume change during Na+ insertion/extraction over a large solid-solution range. (20,21) Recently, several manganese-based polyanionic compounds have been shown to exhibit an interestingly high voltage versus sodium, (22,23) but an unacceptable performance has been attributed to Jahn–Teller distortions of Mn3+ and/or a disproportionation reaction of surface Mn, 2Mn3+ = Mn2+ + Mn4+, with Mn2+ dissolution into a liquid electrolyte. (24) Moreover, most of the polyanion hosts have used only the Mn3+/Mn2+ couples; the limited number operating on the Mn4+/Mn3+ couple have provided little interest. The Mn4+/Mn3+ couple in Li2MnP2O7 is located at a voltage that oxidizes conventional organic-liquid electrolytes. (25) The Mn4+/Mn3+ couple is only partially (30%) active in Na3MnPO4CO3 and cannot be accessed in Na4MnV(PO4)3 from which the extraction of Na+ ions proceeds in the sequences of the V4+/V3+, Mn3+/Mn2+, and V5+/V4+ redox couples from the low to the high voltage. (26,27) Very little cycle stability was obtained in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 and Na3Co0.5Mn0.5Ti(PO4)3. (28,29)

In order to reduce the concentration of Mn in a polyanion framework structure to where the cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion does not occur with all Mn3+ and the surface disproportionation of the Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Mn4+ might be suppressed, we have investigated as a sodium cathode Na3MnZr(PO4)3 having the rhombohedral NASICON structure. In an early report, the measurement of ionic conductivity of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 revealed that the rhombohedral phase of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 has an activation energy of 0.38 eV, which is similar to the activation energies of rhombohedral phases of Na3V2(PO4)3 (0.34 eV) and Na3Cr2(PO4)3 (0.39 eV) and considerably smaller than the activation energies of the monoclinic phases of Na3V2(PO4)3 (0.87 eV) and Na3Cr2(PO4)3 (0.62 eV), suggesting its potential suitability as a cathode for sodium batteries. (30−33) However, in this early study, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 was not investigated electrochemically as a cathode material of a sodium battery. (30) A subsequent study failed to obtain a reversible extraction of Na+ from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 synthesized by solid-state reaction and uncoated by carbon or any other electronic conductor, which has led to the suggestion that the problem is an instability of the octahedral-site Mn3+ ion. (33) Such an instability could be due to a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion or to a surface disproportionation 2Mn3+ = Mn2+ + Mn4+ with Mn2+ dissolution in the liquid electrolytes. The failure to extract Na+ reversibly was the result of a solid-state synthesis that gives micron-sized crystallites and a failure to coat the active electrode material that is an electronic insulator with a carbon coat, or a coat of another electronic conductor that also allows Na+ cross over. (34−36) In this paper, we have used a sol–gel synthesis to obtain 200 nm particles of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 that were coated in situ with a thin carbon layer. With these particles, we were able to extract/insert Na+ ions reversibly over a large solid-solution range, accessing not only the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple but also the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple at, respectively, 3.5 and 4.0 V versus Na+/Na. Moreover, the cathode showed no cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion down to lowest temperatures and it can be cycled stably over many cycles indicating no evidence of surface disproportionation and Mn2+ dissolution. Moreover, we report a theoretical analysis of the Na+-ion extraction sites in the rhombohedral NASICON-structured cathode Na3MnZr(PO4)3 containing two quite different octahedral-site transition-metal cations whereas earlier theoretical studies have been confined to NASICON structures with only one octahedral-site transition-metal cation. The first-principles calculations also demonstrate the intrinsic stability of the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 structure during desodiation in addition to the changes in the local Mn environment.

A sol–gel method was used to prepare the cathode material Na3MnZr(PO4)3; the resulting material had a particle size of about 200 nm (Figure 1a). A thin layer of carbon was coated on the surface of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 particles during the synthesis procedure to provide electron tunneling to the surface Na+ ions with subsequent oxidation of the Mn2+ to Mn3+ and, eventually, to Mn4+ (Figure 1b); the amount of coated carbon was about 7.1% according to thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S1). The crystalline region of the cathode material exhibited lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of about 0.64 nm, consistent with the (012) atomic planes of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with the rhombohedral structure (Figure 1c).

A Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern further confirmed the formation of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with the rhombohedral NASICON structure in the space group R3̅c (Figure 1d). (30,37) The absence of additional peaks corresponding to long-range ordering between Mn and Zr in the XRD pattern indicates the octahedral sites were randomly occupied by the two kinds of transition metals in the NASICON framework. (38,39) The lattice parameters of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 (a = 8.988 Å, and c = 22.594 Å) are larger than those of the well-documented Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for sodium batteries (a = 8.738 Å, and c = 21.815 Å), (40) which provides sufficient interstitial volume for extraction/insertion of Na+ ions. The Rietveld refinement revealed the occupancy factors of 0.558, 0.596, and 0.066 for Na(1), Na(2), and Na(3) sites, respectively, corresponding to 16.45 (6 × 0.558 + 18 × 0.596 + 36 × 0.066) Na+ ions per unit-cell (Z = 6), consistent with the expected chemical formula Na3MnZr(PO4)3 (Table S1).

The crystal structure of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 is composed of MnO6 and ZrO6 octahedral units bridged by corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedral units to establish a framework structure with interstitial sites accommodating three different types of Na+ ions: (i) the Na(1) sites with 6-fold coordination, (ii) the Na(2) sites with 8-fold coordination, and (iii) the Na(3) sites which are four-coordinate (NaO4) sites situated in-between the Na(1) and Na(2) sites (Figure 1e). An occupancy of Na(1) sites less than unity in the Rietveld refinement suggested that a portion of Na+ ions at Na(1) sites are displaced to the Na(3) sites, which has been observed in similar NASICON structures and suggests that simultaneous occupation of neighboring Na(1) and Na(2) sites by Na+ ions results in a Coulombic repulsion that displaces a Na+ ion from the Na(1) site to a Na(3) site. (41) The electrochemical activities of NASICON-structured materials are typically from extraction/insertion of Na+ ions located at Na(2) sites. (42,43) As is detailed in the following sections, the energies of the Na(1) and Na(2) sites are affected by the local Mn and Zr ordering. A theoretical capacity of 107 mAh g–1 could be obtained for Na3MnZr(PO4)3 through utilization of both the Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples with extraction/insertion of two Na+ ions at Na(2) sites per formula unit.

Two oxidation peaks at 3.6 and 4.1 V are revealed in the cyclic voltammetry profiles of the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 cathode, corresponding to the reversible extraction of two Na+ ions accompanied by the successive two-phase transformations from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 to Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and then to NaMnZr(PO4)3 (Figure 2a). The two reduction peaks located at 4.0 and 3.5 V can be attributed to the successive Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples, accompanied by the transformations from NaMnZr(PO4)3 to Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and then back to Na3MnZr(PO4)3. The charge profile of the cathode exhibits a voltage plateau at 3.6 V corresponding to the extraction of the first Na+ ion through the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple followed by another voltage plateau at 4.1 V corresponding to the extraction of the second Na+ ion through the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple (Figure 2b). Upon discharge, the two plateaus located at 4.0 and 3.5 V represent the insertion of two Na+ ions through the Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples, respectively. As a cathode material for sodium batteries, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 delivers discharge voltage plateaus higher than the well-documented NASICON compounds Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.4 V) and NaTi2(PO4)3 (2.1 V). (44,45) Moreover, the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple in Na3MnZr(PO4)3 provides a discharge voltage (4.0 V) higher than the well-documented Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couple in other manganese phosphate cathodes, such as Na2MnP2O7 (3.6 V) and Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 (3.8 V) for sodium batteries. (46−48)

The discharge capacity of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 was 105 mAh g–1 at 0.1 C rate, which is close to the theoretical capacity (107 mAh g–1) corresponding to extraction/insertion of two Na+ ions per formula unit (Figure 2c). When the rate increased to 1 and 10 C, the discharge capacity of the cathode was 82 and 52 mAh g–1, respectively. The low Coulombic efficiency at the low rate (∼90% at 0.1 C) is most probably from the oxidation of the liquid electrolyte at the high charging voltage (4.3 V); (49−51) however, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 still exhibits an initial Coulombic efficiency (87%), higher than that of other manganese phosphate cathodes for sodium batteries, such as Na2MnP2O7 (69%), Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 (60%), and Na2MnPO4F (80%). (48,52,53) When the current density went back to the initial 0.1 C rate, the discharge capacity of the cathode returned to the value of 104 mAh g–1, demonstrating a useful rate capability of the cathode. In addition, an excellent cycling stability was obtained for Na3MnZr(PO4)3; 91% of the initial capacity could be retained after 500 cycles at 0.5 C rate with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.7% (Figure 2d). In terms of discharge voltage, reversible capacity, and cycling stability, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 gives a performance superior to that of other manganese phosphate cathodes for sodium batteries reported in the literature (Table S2). The XRD pattern and TEM image of the cathode after the charge/discharge cycling tests were almost identical to those of the pristine one (Figure S2), which implies that the crystal structure of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 was well-maintained after repeated extraction/insertion of Na+ ions.

In order to understand further changes in the structure during desodiation, the energies of NaxMnZr(PO4)3 structures from x = 1–3 were computed with DFT. The convex hull shows the formation energy per formula unit (Eform) of NaxMnZr(PO4)3 phases relative to the end member compositions of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 (ENa3) and NaMnZr(PO4)3 (ENa1) according to the formula Eform = ENax – 1/2(x – 1) ENa3 – 1/2(3 – x) ENa1 (Figure 3a). Na2MnZr(PO4)3 is a stable phase on the hull between the end member configurations, and the intermediate configurations at Na1.5MnZr(PO4)3 and Na2.5MnZr(PO4)3 are metastable/unstable. Two-phase reactions between Na3MnZr(PO4)3 and Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and between Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and NaMnZr(PO4)3 are therefore preferred, in accordance with XRD analysis in the following section. From the lowest energy structures, sequential reactions from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 → Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and Na2MnZr(PO4)3 → NaMnZr(PO4)3 were predicted to occur at 3.52 and 4.02 V based on the approach of Aydinol et al., (54) in good agreement with the experimentally observed charge plateaus at 3.6 and 4.1 V. The energy of the NaxMnZr(PO4)3 structures on the hull (x = 1, 2, and 3) were compared to all phases in the Na–Mn–Zr–P–O phase diagram in the Materials Project, (55) and all of the structures were found to be stable with respect to decomposition to neighboring phases of NaMnPO4, NaZr2(PO4)3, Na4P2O7, NaPO3, MnPO4, and ZrO2, highlighting the stability of the desodiated NaxMnZr(PO4)3 structure.

For the end member composition of Na3MnZr(PO4)3, the small energy difference between the structures above the hull predicated with DFT calculations (Ehull = 1–35 meV/atom) suggests that there is significant disorder between the Mn and Zr sites within the structure. At the local scale, the distribution of Mn and Zr sites in Na3MnZr(PO4)3 leads to three possible types of Na(1) site that share faces with either two MnO6, two ZrO6 or one MnO6 and one ZrO6 octahedron along the c-axis. In the lowest energy structure of Na3MnZr(PO4)3, the MnO6–Na(1)–MnO6 and MnO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 sites are occupied, whereas the ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 sites are vacant (Figure 3c). This result suggests that the unfavorable electrostatic interaction between Zr4+ and Na+ may locally destabilize ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 configurations in Na3MnZr(PO4)3. This finding is consistent with the structural refinement in which the occupancy of the Na(1) sites was less than unity. During structural optimization of several low energy structures, Na+ ions initially located in a ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 configurations relaxed to the intermediate four coordinated (NaO4) sites situated between the Na(1) and Na(2) sites (Figure 3b), in accordance with the Rietveld refinement. The formation energy of the structure was only 4 meV/atom above the lowest energy structure, which suggests that these Na(3) sites may act as additional low-energy positions to accommodate Na+ ions in the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 structure.

In the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 structures, the Na+ ions occupy the Na(2) sites that are face sharing with either two Mn2+ or one Mn2+ and one Zr4+ octahedron, as a result of the smaller electrostatic repulsion of Mn2+–Na+ interactions compared with Zr4+–Na+ interactions. The high energy, ZrO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 local configurations are therefore preferential sites for Na(2) vacancies. For a random distribution of Mn/Zr ions, the ZrO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 configurations account for 1/4 of the total Na(2) vacant sites. As approximately 1/3 of the total Na(2) sites are vacant in Na3MnZr(PO4)3, the remaining 1/12 of Na(2) vacancies will preferentially occur in MnO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 configurations rather than in the MnO6–Na(2)–MnO6 configurations, based on the previous electrostatic arguments and analysis of the low energy structures. The energies of the structures are also sensitive to the local Na ordering due to Na+–Na+ interactions. However, the random distribution of Mn/Zr ions and high energy of the ZrO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 sites precludes the formation of long-range Na orderings, such as that observed in the rhombohedral structure of Na3V2(PO4)3. (56)

Analogous to Na3MnZr(PO4)3, there is a weak preference for Mn3+/Zr4+ ordering in Na2MnZr(PO4)3 (Figure 3d). While the lowest energy structure of Na2MnZr(PO4)3 had fully occupied Na(1) sites, the Na(1) sites along ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 or ZrO6–Na(1)–MnO6 configurations are also less stable than MnO6–Na(1)–MnO6 configurations, and Na+ ions in ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 or ZrO6–Na(1)–MnO6 configurations in several structures relaxed to Na(3) sites during the structural optimization, leading to vacant Na(1) sites along either ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 or ZrO6–Na(1)–MnO6 configurations. Na+ ions occupy 1/3 of the Na(2) sites in Na2MnZr(PO4)3, and the site containing a MnO6–Na(2)–MnO6 configuration will be preferentially occupied because of the lower energy than the site containing a Na(2) ion in a MnO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 or ZrO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 configuration.

For the NaMnZr(PO4)3 end member, all of the Mn sites are oxidized to Mn4+. In the lowest energy structure, the Na(1) sites are fully occupied whereas the Na(2) sites are unoccupied. In the small unit cell structures that initially contained vacancies in MnO6–Na(1)–MnO6 or ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 configurations, adjacent Na+ ions in Na(2) sites relaxed to occupy the Na(1) sites. The lowest energy structure containing a ZrO6–Na(1)–MnO6 vacancy was 18 meV/atom above the hull, suggesting that there is a strong preference for full occupancy of the Na(1) sites in NaMnZr(PO4)3.

From these results, a tentative mechanism for the desodiation of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 can be proposed. On initial desodiation from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 to Na2MnZr(PO4)3 at 3.6 V, Na+ ions are preferentially extracted from the partially occupied MnO6–Na(2)–ZrO6 sites while MnO6–Na(2)–MnO6 sites remain fully occupied. The Na+ ions in local MnO6–Na(1)–MnO6 environments remain fully occupied in both Na3MnZr(PO4)3 and Na2MnZr(PO4)3. The occupation of ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 sites increases on desodiation to Na2MnZr(PO4)3, although displacement of Na(1) ions to Na(3) sites may also take place more easily due to the increase in the number of Na(2) vacancies. On further desodiation to NaMnZr(PO4)3 at 4.1 V, the Na(1) sites become fully occupied, while the Na(2) sites are fully unoccupied.

The phase transition of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 during extraction/insertion of Na+ ions was investigated by ex situ XRD analysis (Figure 4a). A two-phase transformation from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 to Na2MnZr(PO4)3 was observed on extraction of the first Na+ ion, followed by another two-phase transformation process from Na2MnZr(PO4)3 to NaMnZr(PO4)3 on extraction of the second Na+ ion. The phase transition of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 is accompanied by the changes in the unit cell parameters (Figure 4b), which are closely linked to the occupation of the Na(1) and Na(2) sites. (57,58)

There is a small overall increase in the c-lattice parameter during desodiation (0.1%), in agreement with the DFT calculation (0.4%) from the supercell containing 8 formula units of NaxMnZr(PO4)3 with disordered Mn and Zr sites (Figure S3). It is known from previous studies that the presence of Na(1) vacancies leads to an expansion of the c-axis. (59) Na3MnZr(PO4)3 contains Na(1) vacancies at the ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 sites. On desodiation to Na2MnZr(PO4)3, one of the Na+ ions remained in a ZrO6–Na(1)–ZrO6 site, while the other Na(1) site was empty as the Na+ ion occupied an adjacent Na(3) site. On desodiation to NaMnZr(PO4)3, the Na(1) sites are filled and there is a small increase in the c-lattice parameter, which has previously been ascribed to an increased repulsion of the transition metals (i.e., Mn4+–Mn4+ vs Mn2+–Mn2+) along the c-axis at higher states of charge. The small overall change in the c-lattice parameter observed experimentally during desodiation is related to the competing effects of transition metal repulsion causing expansion and increasing Na(1) site occupation causing contraction.

The small increase in the c-lattice parameter during desodiation is accompanied by a decrease in the a-lattice parameters and therefore an increase of c/a ratio. The decrease in the a-lattice parameter is commonly ascribed to a decrease in the Na(2) site occupation and a decrease in the effective ionic radius of the transition metal during oxidation, which for the current system are 0.83, 0.645, 0.53 Å for Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+, respectively. (60) The overall decrease in the a-lattice parameter observed experimentally (2.8%) is smaller than predicted from the supercell (5.1%) and the lowest energy structures in the convex hull (5.9%), which may be due to the residual transition-metal ordering in the calculated structures in addition to the lack of temperature effects in the nominally 0 K DFT calculations. Moreover, Na3MnZr(PO4)3 has a smaller volume change (5.5%) on desodiation to NaMnZr(PO4)3 than other cathode materials, such as Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 (∼7%) and Na3V2(PO4)3 (∼8.3%) for sodium batteries, and LiFePO4 (∼6.8%) for lithium batteries (Figure 4c). (52,61,62) In general, the small variation in the a and c lattice parameters and the small volume change of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 is key to the long-term cycling stability.

The oxidation states of Mn and Zr in the Na3MnZr(PO4)3 electrode was probed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at different states of charge (Figure S4). The binding energy of Mn 3p located at 48.8 eV before charging is in agreement with the presence of Mn2+ in the pristine Na3MnZr(PO4)3 electrode. The binding energy of Mn 3p increased to 49.5 eV after charging the electrode to 3.9 V, indicating the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+. At the end of charging the electrode to 4.3 V, the binding energy of Mn 3p further increased to 50.2 eV, implying the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+. (63) The binding energies of Zr 3d remained unchanged in the charging process, which suggests that the extraction/insertion of Na+ ions proceeds through utilization of the Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples, keeping the valence state of Zr4+ unchanged. The change in the oxidation state is further supported by calculation of the magnetic moment on the Mn and Zr sites of the lowest energy structures in the convex hull through a Bader analysis (Table S3). (64) The magnetic moment on Zr remains zero through-out the desodiation process and the charge remains approximately constant at +2.70 e, consistent with a fixed Zr4+ oxidation state with a d-electron configuration of d0. The change in the magnetic moment on Mn is consistent with the oxidation of high-spin Mn2+ (d5) to Mn3+ (d4) from Na3MnZr(PO4)3 → Na2MnZr(PO4)3, followed by the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+ (d3) from Na2MnZr(PO4)3 → NaMnZr(PO4)3.

As all of the manganese ions in the Na2MnZr(PO4)3 structure are in the Mn3+ oxidation state, it may be expected that the octahedral MnO6 centers would undergo a positive (negative) Jahn–Teller distortion in which two (four) of the Mn–O bond are lengthened and four (two) of the Mn–O bonds are shortened, as is observed in other Mn3+ systems. (65−67) There are two distinct O sites in the rhombohedral NASICON structure: O1 and O2 (Figure 5a). The O1 ions are located in between the Mn (or Zr) and Na(1) sites, forming the common faces between the MnO6 and NaO6 octahedra. The O2 sites are on the opposite side of the MnO6 (or ZrO6) octahedra along the c-direction of the rhombohedral cell.

In the lowest energy Na2MnZr(PO4)3 structure, MnO6 centers have two different local environments (Mn1 and Mn2). For the Mn1 configuration, four of the Mn1–O bonds are shortened (S) from the average bond length of 2.08 Å and two Mn1–O bonds are lengthened (L), which is consistent with a positive Jahn–Teller distortion, however, there is significant deviation between the Mn1–O1 and Mn1–O2 bond lengths (Figure 5b). The Mn1–O1(L) bond, which shares a common O1 with two Na(2) sites, is considerably longer (2.37 Å) than the Mn1–O2(L) bond (2.07 Å) on the opposite site of the MnO6 octahedron that shares a common O1 with one Na(2). The Mn1–O1(S) bonds in the plane perpendicular to the Mn1–O(L) bond are also slightly shorter than the Mn1–O2(S) bonds. The distribution of bond lengths is different for the Mn2 site; there are two Mn2–O(S) bonds and four Mn2–O(L) bonds, consistent with a negative Jahn–Teller distortion. As was the case for the Mn1 configuration, the Mn2–O1 bonds are longer than the Mn2–O2 bonds. Comparing the bond distributions of the two Mn sites, it appears that the orientation of the local Jahn–Teller distortion is subtly related to the local Na ordering, in which there is a preference to maximize the number of Jahn–Teller lengthened bonds that share common oxygens with Na(2) sites. Although the MnO6 sites are distorted on the local scale, the lack of long-range ordering of the Na(2) sites suggests that a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion of the Mn3+ centers as observed in other materials will be inhibited, which is beneficial for the long-term cycling stability.

In conclusion, the NASICON-structured Na3MnZr(PO4)3 with three-dimensional channels for reversible extraction/insertion of Na+ ions is able to be cycled through a stable Mn3+ composition Na2MnZr(PO4)3 to give access to both the Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ mixed-valent two-phase states. The octahedral sites at the Mn3+ are distorted by different local environments, not by a cooperative Jahn–Teller distortion that removes an orbital degeneracy. Moreover, a cooperative surface disproportionation reaction of Mn3+ is also suppressed, as there is no evidence of a Mn2+ dissolution into an organic liquid-carbonate electrolyte. On reversible extraction/insertion of two Na+ ions per formula unit, the voltage profile shows two plateaus, one for a two-phase Mn4+/Mn3+ couple at 4.0 V and the other for a two-phase Mn3+/Mn2+ couple at 3.5 V versus Na+/Na with a step change at the Mn3+ composition Na2MnZr(PO4)3. This high-voltage cathode for a sodium battery is superior to other manganese-phosphate cathodes reported in the literature, including an earlier study that failed to extract Na+ ions reversibly from Na3MnZr(PO4)3. The stability of the Mn3+ phase Na2MnZr(PO4)3 and the local occupation of Na+ sites which was similar to that in NASICON structures with a single octahedral-site cation have been reproduced by DFT calculations. Nevertheless, still to be explored is the role of electron tunneling from/to a surface coat to/from surface Na+ ions in both the Na+ extraction/insertion reactions and the penetration of electrons between Mn ions separated by (PO4)3– anions.
