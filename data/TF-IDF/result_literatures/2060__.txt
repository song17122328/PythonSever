For  the  realization  of  the  trivalent  cation  migration  in solids,  it  is  necessary  to  select  the  suitable  structure  for  ion migration,  which  contains  higher  valent  cations  than  trivalent state and possesses the large ion conducting pathway.  By bonding  the  higher  valency  cations  to  counter  oxide  anions  with  a strong electrostatic interaction, the interaction between the conducting  trivalent  cation  and  constituent  oxide  anions  considerably reduces.  Recently, we have newly developed the trivalent Sc3+ cation  conducting  solid  electrolyte  (Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3)1 with NASICON  (Na  Super  Ionic  CONductor)  type  structure.    The Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid contains two kinds of high valency cations such  as  tetravalent  Zr4+ and  pentavalent  P5+,  and  the  lattice structure  holds  the  three-dimensional  network  suitable  for  ion conduction.  We have also clarified a clear relationship between the  trivalent  cation  conductivity  and  the  lattice  size  of R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R: Rare Earths).1,2 As reducing the R3+ radius, the  lattice  contracts  and  the  trivalent  conductivity  enhances. The Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid, which contains the smallest trivalent cation among R3+, shows the highest trivalent cation conductivity because the suitable conducting R3+ size for the lattice volume  (A ratio3)  in  NASICON  type  structure  is  achieved. However, it is still unclear whether the lattice size obtained for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is  an  optimum  one  for  the  conducting  trivalent Sc3+ ion  in  the  NASICON  type  structure  or  not.    In  order  to obtain the corresponding lattice size precisely, one of advantageous methods is to prepare the solid solutions in which the lattice size can be intentionally modified. In  this  letter,  we  prepared  various  types  of  solid  solution, (Sc1–xAlx)1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (0≤x≤0.6),  Sc1/3(Zr1–yHfy)2(PO4)3 (0≤y≤1), and (Sc0.8Y0.2)1/3Zr2(PO4)3, in order to clarify the optimum  lattice  size  for  Sc3+ ion  conduction  and  to  maximize  the trivalent Sc3+ ion conductivity in the NASICON type structure. (Sc1–xAlx)1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and  (Sc0.8Y0.2)1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid solutions were prepared by a sol-gel method from reagent grade of  Sc2O3 (99.9%),  Al(NO3)3·9H2O  (99.9%),  Y2O3 (99.9%), ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (99%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (99%).  A stoichiometric mixture of Al(NO3)3·9H2O or Y2O3, and Sc2O3 was dissolved  in  3%  HNO3 solution,  then  ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O  was  dissolved  in  nitric  acid  solution  afterwards.    By  dropping (NH4)2HPO4 solution (3%) into the HNO3 solution, white pre-

Figure  1  shows  the  A ratio  dependencies  of  the  trivalent ion  conductivities  for  the  (Sc1–xAlx)1/3Zr2(PO4)3,  the Sc1/3(Zr1–yHfy)2(PO4)3 and  the  (Sc0.8Y0.2)1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid solutions. While the conductivity increased with the A ratio up to 1.98 × 10–3, the conductivity reduced with further increase of the A ratio.  The maximum conductivity of 2.18 × 10–5 S·cm–1 was obtained for Sc1/3(Zr0.8Hf0.2)2(PO4)3 (A ratio: 1.98 × 10–3) which was about two times as high as that (1.07 × 10–5 S·cm–1) of pure Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (A ratio: 1.97 × 10-3).1

In order to identify the conducting ion species in the solid solutions, the dc electrolysis of Sc1/3(Zr0.8Hf0.2)2(PO4)3 was performed  by  applying  a  dc  voltage  of  3  V  for  200  h.    The  ball shape deposits were recognized at the cathodic surface after the electrolysis and the amount of elements in the deposit were tabulated in Table 1.  The Sc amount in the deposits was found to increase ca. 9.6 times as high as in the bulk before the dc electrolysis.  The result explicitly means that the predominant conducting  species  in  the  solid  solution  is  trivalent  Sc3+ ions  neither  electron  nor  oxide  anion  similar  to  the  case  for  pure Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3.5

In  conclusion,  the  enhancement  of  the  trivalent  cationic conductivity  in  the  NASICON  type  structure  was  achieved  by adjusting the lattice size with forming solid solutions.  The Sc3+ ion conductivity was successfully improved ca. 2 times as high as that of pure Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and the optimization of the Sc3+ ion conduction in NASICON type structure is successfully realthe ized  for  both  Sc1/3(Zr0.8Hf0.2)2(PO4)3 solid solutions.
