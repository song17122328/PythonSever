The framework is built up from M1O6 (M1 = Cr/Al) octahedra and M2O4 (M2 = Mo/Al) tetrahedra interconnected by corners.
The three-dimensional framework contains cavities in which sodium cations are located.
Two validation models (BVS and CHARDI) were used to conﬁrm the proposed structural model.
The mobility of Na+ ions in the structure has been investigated by theoretical means.
The search for new and better solid electrolyte materials has grown considerably in recent years because of their amazing properties and their diverse applications in the ﬁeld of solidstate chemistry.
Indeed, many new molybdate phases with high ionic conductivity have been synthesized and structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction.
The NASICON family groups together a set of phases of the same structural type with the general formula AM2(XO4)3 (A = alkali, M = Ti, Fe, V, Co, Ni and X = P, As, Mo, W, S; Prabaharan et al., 2004).
Apart from their a number of NASICON compounds have considerable potential for use in laser engineering, optics and electronics owing to their non-linear optical, electrical, magnetic and luminescent properties.
It is in this context that we chose to explore A–Cr–Mo–O systems (A ion).
We present here its crystal structure and its validation by the CHARDI (charge distribution) and BVS (bond-valence-sum) methods.
The charge compensation is provided by Na+ cations (Fig.1).
