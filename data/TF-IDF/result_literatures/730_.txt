To accommodate the decreasing lithium resource and ensure continuousdevelopment of energy storage industry, sodium-based batteries are widelystudied to inherit the next generation of energy storage devices.
In this work,a novel Na super ionic conductor type KTi2(PO4)3/carbon nanocompositeis designed and fabricated as sodium storage electrode materials, whichexhibits considerable reversible capacity (104 mAh g−1 under the rate of 1 Cwith flat voltage plateaus at ≈2.1 V), high-rate cycling stability (74.2% capacityretention after 5000 cycles at 20 C), and ultrahigh rate capability (76 mAh g−1at 100 C) in sodium ion batteries.
Besides, the maximum ability for sodiumstorage is deeply excavated by further investigations about different voltagewindows in half and full sodium ion cells.
Meanwhile, as cathode material insodium-magnesium hybrid batteries, the KTi2(PO4)3/carbon nanocompositealso displays good electrochemical performances (63 mAh g−1 at the 230thcycle under the voltage window of 1.0–1.9 V).
The results demonstrate thatthe KTi2(PO4)3/carbon nanocomposite is a promising electrode material forsodium ion storage, and lay theoretical foundations for the development ofnew type of batteries.
Sample Preparation: For a typical synthesis, KTi2(PO4)3/carbonnanoparticles were synthesized by a co-precipitation method followedby the annealing process.3 mmol phosphoric acid (H3PO4) wasdissolved in a mixture of 30 mL ethanol (C2H5OH) and 30 mL ethyleneglycol followed by stirring for 30 min.
Then, 1 mmol potassium acetate(CH3COOK) and 2 mmol tetrabutyl titanate were sequentially added intothe above solution.
After that, the suspension was stirred vigorouslyover 2 h.
This white precursor was collected by centrifugation andwashed with ethanol for twice, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h in air.
Finally,the precursor was annealed in Ar at 750 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of5 °C min−1 to obtain the black KTi2(PO4)3/carbon nanoparticles (notedas KTP/C).
When the suspension was centrifuged and washed withdeionized water and ethanol for several times, and dried at 70 °C for12 h in air followed by annealing in air at 750 °C for 3 h with a heatingrate of 5 °C min−1, the white KTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (noted as KTP)were obtained.
To obtain the graphene wrapped KTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles (noted asKTP/G), 0.1 g KTP were dispersed in 1 mL of graphene (≈7 mg mL−1)solution by a ultrasonic process and the mixture was stirred vigorouslyfor 6 h.
After that, the mixture was dried directly at 70 °C for 12 h in airto get the gray KTP/G nanoparticles.
The graphene was synthesized by amodified Hummers method.
To obtain the carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 bulk (noted as NVP/C),2 mmol acetylacetonate was dissolved in 30 mL ethanol at 80 °C in waterbath.
After that, 1.5 mmol sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and 3 mmolammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) were sequentiallyadded into the above yellow suspension.
Then, the white mixture wasstirred vigorously for 6 h and dried directly at 70 °C over 12 h in air.
Finally, the black NVP/C bulk was obtained by following annealing in Arat 750 °C for 8 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1.Materials Characterization: XRD was employed to characterizethe crystallographic information using a Bruker D8 Advance X-raydiffractometer with a nonmonochromated Cu Ka X-ray source.
Scanningelectron microscopic (SEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectra(EDS) were collected with a JEOL-7100F SEM/EDS microscope at anacceleration voltage of 20 kV.
TEM and high-resolution transmissionelectron microscopic (HRTEM) images were recorded by using a JEM-2100F STEM/EDS microscope.
BET surface areas were measured usinga Tristar II 3020 instrument by adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K.
XPS measurement was performed using a VG Multi Lab 2000 instrument.TG/DSC was performed using a Netzsch STA 449C simultaneousthermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air.
Measurements of Electrochemical Performances: The electrochemicalproperties were evaluated by assembly of 2016 coin cells in a glovebox filled with pure argon gas.
In sodium half cells, sodium metal wasused as the anode.1 m solution of NaClO4 in ethylene carbon–dimethylcarbonate (1 : 1 w/w) with 5% fluoroethylene caobonate (FEC) was usedas the electrolyte, and a Whatman glass fiber (GF/D) was used as theseparator.
The electrolyte used in SMHBs was prepared on the basis ofthe reported method.
The electrodes were produced from a mixedclay with a weight ratio of 60% KTi2(PO4)3/carbon active material, 30%acetylene black, and 10% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).
The mixed claywas rolled using a roller mill to form a freestanding film and was cut intoslices and dried in an oven for 12 h at 70 °C.
The loading mass of theactive material was ≈2.0–4.0 mg cm−2. Galvanostatic charge–dischargemeasurement was performed using a multichannel battery testingsystem (LAND CT2001A).
CV curves and EIS were recorded with anelectrochemical workstation under the alternating current ranging from0.01 Hz to 10 kHz (Autolab PGSTAT 302).
