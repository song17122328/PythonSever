Structural sites occupied by lithium in the rhombohedral LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series (0 e x e 2) have beeninvestigated by 7Li NMR spectroscopy.
At room temperature, the XRD patterns of the end-members of theseries display rhombohedral R3hc symmetry in LiTi2(PO4)3 and triclinic C1h in LiZr2(PO4)3.
 In the first compound,Li ions occupy M1 sites; however, in the second one Li occupy intermediate M1/2 sites.
As the temperatureincreases, a first-order displacive transformation is detected in the triclinic phase, but a second-order/disordertransition is detected in the rhombohedral phase.
From the temperature dependence of the 7Li NMR quadrupoleconstant (CQ) of the two compounds, the evolution of M1 and M1/2 sites occupancy in the Nasicon conductionnetwork has been deduced.
At high temperatures, analyzed phases tend toward a disordered rhombohedralphase, in which both M1 and M1/2 sites are equally populated and in which lithium mobility is favored by theexistence of vacant M1 sites.
According to this study, this phase can also be obtained by substituting Ti byZr in the LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series.
Interest in lithium ion conducting solids has considerablyincreased because of their potential application as electrolytesin rechargeable lithium batteries.
LiMIV2(PO4)3 compounds withNASICON1 structure (acronym for Na SuperIonic Conductors)have been extensively studied for their good ionic conductivity.
In these compounds, structure is formed by M2(PO4)3 units inwhich each MO6 octahedron shares corners with six PO4tetrahedra and each tetrahedron shares oxygens with fouroctahedra (Figure 1a).
The ideal framework displays therhombohedral symmetry (space group R3hc), but in someparticular cases a triclinic distortion (space group C1h) has beendetected.

The progressive increase of the c/a ratio produces the splitting of (104) and (110) peaks near 20°, and that of the (214) and(300) peaks near 36.5°.
Unit cell parameters deduced from thesepatterns are given in Table 1. In the case of the sample x ) 2,only the XRD pattern of the rhombohedral phase, recorded at70 °C, has been considered.
7Li NMR (I ) 3/2) spectra of the LiR2(PO4)3 samples areformed by a central (-1/2,1/2) and two satellite (-3/2,-1/2and 1/2,3/2) transitions.
14 In previous works, quadrupoleconstants (CQ and è parameters) of lithium located at M1 andM1/2 sites were deduced in LiMIV2(PO4)3 compounds.

The variations of CQvalues of LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3 are given in Figure 3a.
For sake of comparison, CQ values measured in isostructuralLiGe2(PO4)3 and LiHf2(PO4)3 phases are also included.
Intriclinic LiZr2(PO4)3 and LiHf2(PO4)3 phases, CQ and è valuesare more important (180 kHz, 0.6), indicating that sites occupiedby Li display lower symmetry.

In the rhombohedral LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series,quadrupole CQ constants measured at room temperature increasefrom 40 to 120 kHz as the Zr content increases (Figure 3b).
Insamples with x > 1.5, quadrupole constants measured at roomtemperature are near those measured at 340 K in the rhombohedralLiZr2(PO4)3 phase.

A similar effectcan be obtained by substitution of Ti by Zr in LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3series.
In these samples, unit cell expansion associated with Zrincorporation favors the progressive occupation of M1/2 at theexpense of M1 sites.
Along this series, Li mobility increasesand activation energy Ea decreases from 0.46 to 0.3 eV2. 
Thestabilization of the rhombohedral phase in Zr-doped sampleseliminates problems derived from stresses produced at thetriclinic-rhombohedral transition and enlarges the electrochemicalwindow (lower reducibility of Zr) of experimental devices.
Li sites and lithium mobility in LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series havebeen analyzed with 7Li NMR spectroscopy.
From the analysisof quadrupole constants of end members of the series, the preferential occupation of M1 sites in rhombohedral and that ofM1/2 sites in triclinic phases were deduced.
The analysis of the temperature dependence of CQ valuesshowed the progressive occupation of midway M1/2 sites at theexpense of M1 sites when the temperature increases in therhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 sample.
The opposite effect wasdetected in triclinic LiZr2(PO4)3 samples, where M1/2 sites arepreferentially occupied at low temperatures.
Above the triclinicrhombohedraltransition, a full delocation of lithium on M1 andM1/2 sites was detected.
In the case of LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series,a similar effect is produced when Ti is substituted by larger Zrcations.
The stabilization of the rhombohedral phase in Zr-dopedsamples eliminates problems derived from stresses produced atthe triclinic-rhombohedral transition and enlarges the electrochemicalwindow (lower reducibility of Zr) of experimentaldevices.
