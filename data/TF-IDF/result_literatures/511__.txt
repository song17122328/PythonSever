Na3V2(PO4)3 has shown great promise in next-generation cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries owning to its fast Na+ diffusion in the three-dimensional open NASICON framework and high theoretical energy density. However, Na3V2(PO4)3 suffers from undesirable rate performance and unstable cyclability arising from low electronic conductivity. Herein, we propose a facile approach for significantly enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3 by Ti doping at V site and constructing nanoparticle@carbon core–shell nanostructure. This material design provides fast electron conduction network within the whole active particles because of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in bulk and highly conductive carbon shell on the surface. Lattice doping and carbon coating reduce the electrode polarization and facilitate the electrode reaction kinetics, while the nanostructure enhances the ionic conduction by shortening the diffusion distance and offers sufficient contact of active particles with organic electrolyte. The multiple synergetic effects enable a superior electrochemical performance. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C cathode shows a high specific capacity (116.6 mAh g–1 at 1C), an unprecedented rate performance (93.4 mAh g–1 at 400C), and an exceptional long-term high-rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 69.5% after 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle).

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the electrical-energy-storage market in portable electronic devices over the last 2 decades and become the first option for electric vehicle applications in recent years. (1−3) However, severe concerns of finite lithium resources and their sustained rising cost have simulated research works to explore new battery chemistries on the basis of nature-abundant materials. Given the rich reserves and low cost of sodium as well as its similar physicochemical properties to lithium, sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have shown great promise as splendid alternatives to realize reliable and affordable energy-storage systems for large-scale applications. (4−6) However, the sluggish sodium-ion diffusion limits severely the electrode reaction kinetics and challenges the cyclic behavior of the batteries. Exploring high-performance cathode materials is crucial for accelerating commercialization of NIBs.

Recently, a number of transition-metal oxides, (7,8) Prussian blue analogues, (9,10) and NASICON-type phosphates (11−18) have been proposed as cathode host materials for NIBs. Particularly, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has attracted intensive attention owning to its open framework, which provides high Na-ion conduction pathway, stable electrode potential (3.4 V, vs Na/Na+), reliable cycle stability, and high theoretical energy density (400 Wh kg–1). (19,20) Nevertheless, its poor rate capability due to intrinsic low electronic conductivity has significantly retarded the advancement and prevented its practical application. To solve this problem, various strategies have been proposed, including nanostructure engineering, (21,22) special morphology construction, (23,24) conductive component incorporation, (25−29) etc. Duan et al. prepared core@shell NVP nanoparticles with carbon coating, which delivered the specific capacity of 94.9 mAh g–1 at a current density of 5C. (21) The NVP nanofibers fabricated via self-sacrificed template method exhibited super rate capability and long cycle life. (24) The NVP/rGO–CNT composite with NVP nanoparticles encapsulated in interconnected rGO–CNT hybrid carbon matrix showed excellent rate performance and cyclability as both cathode and anode materials for NIBs. (26)

Lattice doping with alien ions is another effective way to tune the charge transport behavior of the active material and therefore improve the electrochemical performance of electrodes. Several strategies have been employed to modify the electronic properties and/or lattice structures of NVP. Doping with aliovalent ions can tune the oxidation states of parent V ions and improve the electrical conductivity of materials. Mg-doped NVP exhibited a high rate capability of up to 30C. (30) Large ion substitution can expand the lattice structure and promote the sodium mobility in the NVP material. The substitution of large K for Na resulted in an improved rate performance of NVP because of the increased c parameter, which provides more space for Na-ion migration and thus accelerates the electrode reaction kinetics. (31) Moreover, lattice doping was sometimes found to be capable of reducing the NVP particle size and therefore improving the electrode performance. (32−34)

Herein, we design and fabricate a lattice-doped NVP@C core/shell nanoparticle that serves as a high-performance cathode for NIBs. In this structure, the NVP core is doped with Ti at V sites, and its particle surface is covered with in situ formed amorphous carbon, forming a core–shell structure (denoted as Ti-NVP@C, Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20)). Ti was selected as the V-site dopant, considering its three advantages. First, Ti ions may take Ti4+/Ti3+ mixed valence in NVP lattice after heat treatment along with carbon in synthesis process, which is able to increase the bulk electrical conductivity. Second, the redox couple of Ti4+/Ti3+ at ∼2.2 V toward Na-ion storage can contribute part of capacity. (35−37) Third, the Ti4+/Ti3+ couple usually shows fast redox kinetics. Therefore, excellent rate performance can be expected for the prepared Ti-NVP@C with highly conductive bulk and shell. The optimized Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C sample shows unprecedented electrochemical properties with a remarkable rate performance of 93.4 mAh g–1 (79% of the theoretical capacity) at 400C and an ultrastable cyclic behavior with 69.5% of capacity retention over 14 000 cycles at a superior high current density of 100C. To the best of our knowledge, these outstanding sodium-storage properties are unprecedented compared to those of the reported NVP-based cathode materials, even better than those of many cathode hosts for LIBs.

Na3V2-xTix(PO4)3@C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) nanocomposites were obtained by solvothermal-assistant reaction combined with subsequent calcination route. Tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was chosen as the titanium source. Typically, 1 mmol TBOT was first dropped into 20 mL of ethanol solution under stirring to get a transparent solution. Stoichiometric ratios of V2O5, TBOT ethanol solution, NH4H2PO4, Na2CO3, citric acid, and oxalic acid were dissolved in deionized water using a reflux condenser at 80 °C. Here, citric acid serves not only as a vanadium chelator but also as a carbon source to produce amorphous carbon layers covering the particle surface. Certain amount of above solution was added into ethylene glycol under continuous stirring, and then the solvothermal reaction at 200 °C for 12 h was carried out. Afterward, the corresponding resultant precursor solution was poured into a porcelain dish and dried in an air oven at 120 °C. At last, the Ti-NVP@C composites were obtained through calcination treatment at 650 °C for 6 h in an argon atmosphere.

Phase identification was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max-A Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). XRD patterns were refined by Rietveld refinement program General Structure Analysis System with the EXPGUI graphical user interface. (38) The particle morphology and size were probed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Germany, SUPRA55) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, Czech, FEI/Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN TMP Model). Thermogravimetric analysis was carried on a TA-Q5000 IR thermo-analyzer in air. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent S730) was used to identify the elemental compositions of the as-prepared composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Escalab 250Xi) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) was employed to investigate the valence states of transition-metal elements in Na3V1.8Ti0.2(PO4)3@C sample.

The electrode slurry was prepared by mixing a 70:15:15 weight ratio of active material/acetylene black/poly(vinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, respectively. The typical active material loading in the electrode film is ∼3–4 mg cm–2 with an Al-foil collector. Sodium metal is used as the counter electrode, 1 M solution of NaClO4 in ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1 v/v ratio) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate as the electrolyte, and glass fiber (GD/D, Whatman) as the separator. The galvanostatic discharge–charge tests were operated in the voltage window of 2.0–4.3 V on a LAND cycler. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of electrodes were recorded at 50% depth of discharge after five cycles at 1C (frequency sweep from 10–2 to 106 Hz, alternating current perturbation of 10 mV) by a Solartron 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer with a 1287 electrochemical interface. The electrical resistivity of samples was evaluated under 12 MPa pressure with a powder RTS-4 liner four-point probe. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was performed by Arbin BT 2000 at different scan rates from 0.05 to 0.5 mV s–1.

The density functional theory calculations were performed to obtain the band-gap energies of undoped and Ti-doped NVP samples using Materials Studio (MS). The exchange-correlation parametrization was decided by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof and spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package functional. Hubbard parameters (GGA + U) were utilized with U = 4 and 7 eV for V and Ti, respectively, to correct the self-interaction error present in GGA. The kinetic energy cutoff of 370 eV was set for the plane-wave basis, and a 2 × 3 × 3 γ grid was used for the k-point sampling of Brillouin-zone integrals. 10–6 eV atom–1 was set as the convergence residual force. The supercell used for calculations consisted of 4 fu of Na3V2(PO4)3. The chemical formula with Ti doping amount x = 0.25 was chosen to simulate the experimental Na3V1.8Ti0.2(PO4)3 component and to simplify the calculation process simultaneously. The supercells with different Ti substitution positions in Na3V1.75Ti0.25(PO4)3 were constructed, and the binding energies were calculated. The lowest-energy structure was selected to estimate the electronic structure of NVP with and without Ti doping.

The particle morphology and detailed microstructure of the as-synthesized Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C composites were characterized by FE-SEM and TEM. Nanosized particle morphological features can be clearly visualized in Figure S1. It can be noted that Ti doping hardly changes the particle size or the particle size distribution. The sizes of the samples are typically in the range of 20–50 nm, as further revealed by TEM observation (Figure 1a). Figure 1b confirms the core–shell structure of NVP@C particles. A thin amorphous carbon layer with ∼3 nm thickness, in situ generated from citric acid pyrolysis, was uniformly coated on the surface of well-crystallized NVP particles. The HR-TEM image (Figure 1c) discloses clear lattice fringes with interplanar spacings of 0.44 and 0.25 nm, which correspond to the (104) and (300) planes of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3, respectively, indicating highly crystalline characteristics of the doped NVP. The elemental mapping images (Figure S2) display homogeneous distribution of Na, V, Ti, P, O, and C in Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C composite. The specific element contents were detected by ICP-OES analysis (Table S1, Supporting Information), which are close to the designed composition. Such uniformly distributed nanosized particles can provide sufficient contact of active particles with the electrolyte and offer short transmission path for sodium-ion diffusion and electron conduction, facilitating the electrode reaction kinetics.

The crystalline structure of NVP is featured with its three-dimensional open framework, which provides fast pathways for Na+ diffusion (Figure 2a). XRD patterns of Ti-NVP@C samples are displayed in Figure 2b. All of the reflections could be well indexed as a rhombohedral unit cell with the R3̅c space group, consistent with a standard diffraction pattern (JCPDS card no. 00-53-0018). No impurity peaks were observed, indicating that Ti has entered the crystal lattice as designed and the partial substitution of Ti for V has no influence on the formation of NASICON structure. Meanwhile, no crystalline carbon diffraction reflexes were detected, suggesting the amorphous feature of the carbon layer.

To further elucidate the lattice structure changes of Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3 with Ti doping, Rietveld refinements were performed using the R3̅c space group for all investigated samples (Figure S3). The low “goodness-of-fit” (Rwp, χ2) clearly demonstrates the validity of selected structure model. Table 1 summarizes the calculated lattice parameters and Na+ occupation. Typically, Tables S2 and S3 display the specific crystallographic data of x = 0 and 0.1 samples, respectively. It can be found that the total Na content decreases progressively with increasing Ti-doping amount, which is the charge compensation result of the Ti4+/3+ substitution for V3+. Besides, the occupancy of Na(2) reduces with Ti doping, which implies that Na(2) ions have more opportunities to move within the Na(2) sublattice of NVP crystalline. This should favor the enhancement of Na ionic conductivity of Ti-doped NVP material. Increasing the doping amount of Ti leads to the slight reduction of the cell volume and the lattice parameters, as expected from the similar ionic radii of Ti4+ (0.605 Å) and Ti3+ (0.670 Å) compared to that of V3+ (0.640 Å) in an octahedral coordination. (39) However, it is worth noting that the parameter change slightly deviates from the Vegard law, which should be associated with the Na occupancy variation and Na deficiency generation.

The existence of carbon in the material is confirmed by Raman examination. As shown in Figure S4, the characteristic carbonaceous D and G peaks located at about 1360 and 1584 cm–1, respectively, can be clearly observed. The high graphitization with calculated ID/IG ratio of 1.07 is indicative of high electronic conductivity of the coating carbon layer. TG analysis was explored to investigate the carbon contents of all of the investigated samples. A similar carbon content (∼10 wt %) was detected in Ti-NVP@C samples (Figure S5). The similar carbon contents and the alike particle morphologies of all of the investigated samples (Figure S1) suggest that the difference in electrochemical performance of these samples comes mainly from Ti-doping effects.

XPS measurements were performed to gain insight into the chemical composition and element valence state of Ti-NVP@C electrodes, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The sample Na3V1.80Ti0.20(PO4)3@C with high Ti concentration was selected to ensure good absorption signals. In Figure 3a, C 1s spectrum can be fitted with four peaks, which correspond to C-relevant functional groups, evidencing the existence of carbon. As shown in Figure 3b, two symmetric bands with binding energies of 516.9 and 524.0 eV can be ascribed to the typical V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 of V3+, respectively. (40,41) The broad bands related to Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 can be deconvoluted into four peaks (Figure 3c). The signals at 458.2 and 463.6 eV are attributed to Ti4+ ions, while the peaks at 457.2 and 461.5 eV are ascribed to Ti3+ ions, (42−44) demonstrating the co-existence of the mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in NVP lattice. The generation of Ti3+ is related to the weakly reductive atmosphere (carbothermal reduction reaction conditions) in synthesis process. Such mixed valence states of Ti ions in Ti-doped NVP are beneficial for enhancing the bulk intrinsic electronic conductivity of NVP material and therefore enhancing the electrode reaction kinetics.

The electrochemical behaviors of the prepared Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C composites were evaluated by charged/discharge profiles galvanostatically in an electrochemical window of 2.0–4.3 V. The initial charge/discharge profiles at a current rate of 0.1C (1C = 117.6 mA g–1) are presented in Figure 4a. All samples exhibit coupled flat voltage plateaus along ∼3.4 V (vs Na/Na+) that correspond to the V3+/V4+ redox reaction. (25,26) Obviously, the Ti-doped NVP materials show higher specific capacity than that of the undoped ones, despite small loss of Na content in the crystal structure caused by aliovalent Ti4+ substituted for V3+. This demonstrates that the Ti substitution allows for a deeper charge of the NVP cathode because of the improved electronic conductivity. Among the Ti-doped samples, Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C delivers the highest capacity of 117.3 mAh g–1, approximately its theoretical value. Not only the reversible capacity but also the cyclability of NVP is significantly enhanced by Ti doping, as demonstrated in Figure 4b (cycling behavior at 0.1C for 100 cycles). The Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C and Na3V1.80Ti0.20(PO4)3@C composites show remarkable improvement in the dynamic electrochemical stability of the sodium storage. The improved cycling stability benefits from the enhanced electronic conductivity and lattice stability caused by the heteroatom doping of Ti4+/Ti3+ for V3+. The mixed valence Ti4+/3+ in the lattice can improve the electronic conductivity from the viewpoint of defect chemistry and semiconductor theory. Meanwhile, Ti doping leads to the lattice contraction (Table 1) and thus favors the enhancement of structural stability of materials.

Note that two extra charge/discharge plateaus around 3.9 and 2.2 V can be found when the Ti doping level ≥0.1 in the NVP crystal (pointed by black arrows in Figure 4a), which are supposed to be due to the V4+/V5+ and Ti4+/Ti3+ redox reactions, respectively. As demonstrated by Song et al., electrochemical oxidation of V4+ to V5+ within pure Na3V2(PO4)3 framework was not available up to 4.5 V versus that of Na. (45) Ti doping triggers the occurrence of redox reaction of V4+/V5+ at relatively low potentials ∼3.9 V, which can provide additional capacity to accommodate Na-ion storage. Similar phenomena were also reported when Al3+, Cr3+, and Fe3+ were doped into NVP materials. (46−48) The mechanism interpretations to explain the enhancement of the V4+/V5+ redox reaction assisted by the lattice doping should be further investigated. On the other hand, the redox couple of Ti4+/Ti3+ at around 2.2 V also provides some extra capacity to the Ti-NVP@C electrodes to compensate the reduction of active component V. The synergetic effect of the two extra redox couples (Ti4+/Ti3+ and V4+/V5+) guarantees the close-to-theory reversible capacity of the Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C electrodes, although a small amount of Na deficiency exists in Ti-doped samples.

More importantly, Ti doping enables a superior rate capability of NVP cathode materials, as revealed in Figure 4c. The specific capacities of the pure NVP electrode decrease severely with increasing C rate, remaining 70.6% at 30C and 6.8% at 100C. On the contrary, the rate capability is significantly improved with Ti doping. Especially, Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode delivers specific capacities of 116.4, 112.6, 111.8, 110.3, 109.7, 108.7, 103.4, and 98.5 mAh g–1 at 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200C, respectively. Even at an ultrafast current density of 400C (charge/discharge within 9 s), the electrode is still capable of delivering 93.4 mAh g–1, retaining 80% of its capacity at 1C, demonstrating an unprecedented rate performance of NVP-based electrodes. Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode also exhibits an excellent recoverability; approximately 100% of the reversible capacity is restored when the current comes back to 1C. Even under an ultrahigh rate condition, the plateaus of charge/discharge profiles of Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode do not disappear, indicating that the sodiation/desodiation processes still occur in the Ti-doped NVP electrode (Figure S6). The outstanding rate capability obviously benefits from the advantageous chemistry features of Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode, which provides fast electronic conduction network as well as facile sodium-ion migration in the crystal structure.

The comparison of the rate capabilities of recently reported NVP electrodes in the literature is illustrated in Figure 4d. (22,24,30,49−51) Obviously, our sample Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C shows an outstanding rate performance, far superior to other NVP cathodes reported for sodium-ion batteries, even to most state-of-the-art electrode materials used in LIBs or supercapacitors. (52−56) The competitive performance demonstrates that our Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C material is an attractive candidate for superior energy-storage applications.

More remarkably, the prepared Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode exhibits ultrastable long-term cyclability. It delivers an initial reversible capacity of 116.6 mAh g–1 and maintains 91.4% of capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C, which corresponds to capacity retentions of 91.4%, as displayed in Figure S7. When the current rates increased to 10C and 30C, 96 and 95% of the initial capacities were retained after 3000 and 10 000 cycles, respectively (Figure 5a,b). Most significantly, our Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C cathode demonstrates an excellent long-term cycling life under ultrahigh current density (Figure 5c). A high reversible capacity of 73 mAh g–1 was achieved over 14 000 cycles at 100C (69.5% capacity retention, corresponding to 0.0002% capacity decay per cycle), indicating an extraordinary structural stability.

To further understand the Ti-doping effects on the electronic structure of NVP, first-principles calculations were employed on the basis of the structural model of Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V1.75Ti0.25(PO4)3 shown in Figure S8. The band structure was computed and is presented in Figure 6a. The calculated band gap of undoped NVP is 1.735 eV, displaying a typical semiconductor feature. The band gap of Na3V1.75Ti0.25(PO4)3 was decreased to 0.014 eV after 0.25 Ti doping, suggesting that partial Ti substitution for V can remarkably reduce the band gap and promote the electron conduction. The electronic conductivity for series of Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C samples was detected by the RST-4 linear four-point probe method. As observed in the left part of Figure 6b, the electronic conduction was significantly enhanced after Ti doping, which verifies the results of first-principles calculations.

The CV results of the investigated Ti-NVP@C electrodes are shown in Figure 6c. The strong redox peaks in the range of 3.1–3.6 V are ascribed to the reversible reaction of V3+/V4+ accompanied with sodium ions extraction/insertion. Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode has the lowest potential interval (ΔV) of 159 mV, indicating the lowest electrochemical polarization compared with that of other samples. In addition, the peak current of Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C is higher than that of the others, demonstrating the higher reversibility and faster kinetics induced by enhanced electronic conduction. The CV curves of Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C cathode at various scan rates from 0.05 to 0.5 mV s–1 indicate the high reversibility of electrode reactions (Figure S9), which supports the outstanding rate performance. The Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa+) was calculated on the basis of the anodic process by applying Randles–Sevcik equation, and the corresponding linear fitting between peak currents and the square root of sweep rates from CV profiles is shown in Figure S10. As illustrated in Figure 6b, Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C exhibits the largest DNa+ of 1.996 × 10–10 cm2 s–1, several times higher than that of the parent NVP electrode (0.2826 × 10–10 cm2 s–1), which enables the possibility to achieve the superior cycling properties at 100C and the high rate performance. Excessive contraction of the unit cell volume with excess Ti doping contents (x = 0.2) is unfavorable for the Na+ diffusion, resulting in inferior electrochemical performances of Na3V1.80Ti0.20(PO4)3@C electrode.

Moreover, as further revealed by ElS (Figure 6d), the superior electrochemical performance of Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C electrode is also ascribed to its fast electrode reaction kinetics. According to the fitted equivalent circuit in the inset of Figure 6d, the simulated charge transfer resistance (Rct) for Na3V1.90Ti0.10(PO4)3@C is 429 Ω, while those for Na3V2(PO4)3@C (666 Ω), Na3V1.95Ti0.05(PO4)3@C (579 Ω), and Na3V1.80Ti0.20(PO4)3@C (549 Ω) are much higher. The results demonstrate that Ti doping is beneficial to improve the charge transfer kinetics. The steep slanting line of Ti-doped samples suggests that Ti doping is also favorable for Na+ diffusion in the NVP lattice. Therefore, the fast charge transfer kinetics and low electrode polarization lead to best electrochemical performance of x = 0.1 sample.

To summarize, an attractive strategy has been reported to remarkably boost the rate performance and cycling behavior of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode through Ti doping and core–shell nanostructure construction with carbon coating. The Ti substitution for V enhances the electronic conductivity and Na+ diffusion coefficient, and reduces the electrode polarization and therefore noticeably improves the rate performance and cyclability of Ti-NVP@C electrodes. The core–shell nanostructure with carbon coating offers short path for sodium-ion diffusion, more sufficient contact with electrolyte, and high electronic conduction network for a fast electrode reaction. The extra redox couples (Ti4+/Ti3+ and V4+/V5+) guarantee the close-to-theory reversible capacity of the Na3V2–xTix(PO4)3@C electrodes. Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C delivers a high discharge capacity (116.6 mAh g–1 at 1C), an exceptional high-rate performance (93.4 mAh g–1 at 400C), and ultrastable long-term cyclability (69.5% of capacity retention over 14 000 cycles at 100C, corresponding to 0.0002% decay per cycle). Such excellent electrochemical behavior of Na3V1.9Ti0.1(PO4)3@C material utilized for Na-ion storage has been reported for the first time. The demonstration of stable and high-rate Na3V2(PO4)3-based electrodes offers new opportunities for electrode materials in construction of high-power and long-lifespan energy-storage devices.
