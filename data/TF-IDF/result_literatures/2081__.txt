Nasicon-type trisodium discandium tris(arsenate), Na3Sc2(AsO4)3, contains a polyhedral network of vertex-sharing octahedral ScO6 and tetrahedral AsO4 units [dav(Sc—O) = 2.089 (2) A˚ and dav(As—O) = 1.672 (2) A˚ ] encapsulating two types of Na+ species. The sodium site occupancies are similar to those of the equivalent species in  12)-Na3Sc2(PO4)3.

Based on the present reﬁnement, Na3Sc2(AsO4)3 adopts a centrosymmetric rhombohedral Nasicon structure (Sljukic et al., 1969; Masquelier et al., 2000), as indicated earlier on the basis of X-ray powder data (Winand et al., 1990). However, a superstructure or other symmetry reduction, perhaps associated with sodium cation ordering, cannot be completely ruled out.

The stretched octahedral Na1 position (Wyckoff site 6b) with site symmetry 3 is fully occupied within experimental error. Its bond valence sum (BVS), calculated by the Brown (1996) formalism, of 0.98 is in good agreement with the expected value of 1.00. Na2 occupies Wyckoff site 18e (symmetry 2) with an occupancy of 0.626 (11). This site is usually described as eight-coordinate (Masquelier et al., 2000) to framework O atoms. In the title compound, two of these links are exceptionally long (d > 3.16 A˚ ) and the Na2 coordination could equally well be described as sixfold. Bond valence sums for Na2 indicate signiﬁcant underbonding if either six-coordinate (BVS = 0.76) and eight-coordinate (BVS = 0.81) is assumed.

The overall sodium unit-cell content of 17.27 (12) based on the reﬁnement is in adequate agreement with the value of 18 required for charge-balancing purposes. Other Nasion phases show a similar apparent reduced cation content, which may be rationalized on the basis of the mobility of these species in the extra-framework channel system (de la Roche` re et al., 1983). The sodium content of 18 can be formally achieved by full occupancy of the Na1 (6b) site and two-thirds occupancy of the Na2 (18e) site (Susman et al., 1983).
