Rechargeable aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are urgently pursued as a low-cost candidate for grid-scale storage of intermittent renewable energies. NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 holds great promises as anode material for aqueous SIBs owing to the high theoretical capacity and low redox potential, but being severely challenged by poor cycling performance and low reaction kinetics. Herein, graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite is prepared with a facile sol-gel approach as anode material for aqueous SIBs. Electrochemical properties of the material in high-concentration aqueous electrolyte (6 M NaClO4) are systematically investigated by using cycling voltammetry, galvanostatic technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It is found that it shows an improved charge/discharge performance with a high practical capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, excellent high-rate capability with a reversible capacity of 88.0 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, and good cycling stability with 92% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergetic contribution of carbon-blending nanostructure and high-concentration electrolyte, which largely enhances structural stability and reaction kinetics of the material. In addition, the redox mechanism is discussed based on experimental results from cyclic voltammetry and X-ray diffraction technique.

Environmentally-friendly sustainable energies such as wind power and solar radiation are highly needed as alternatives to fossil fuels for energy supply in human life and industrial production. However, those energies can't be directly combined into grid for utilization owing to their electricity-generation instability caused by natural factors such as climate, weather and geography. Rechargeable technologies consisting of alkali-ion batteries [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]], magnesium batteries [[6], [7], [8]] and zinc batteries [[9], [10], [11], [12]] are being extensively pursued for effective grid-scale storage of sustainable energies. Especially, aqueous sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) receive extreme interests relying on their advantageous properties such as low cost and wide availability of sodium resources, reversible intercalation chemistry of sodium ions, and reliable safety of aqueous electrolytes [[13], [14], [15]]. Meanwhile, great efforts have been dedicated to investigating electrochemical properties and redox mechanism of polyanionic frameworks [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]], transition-metal oxides [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28]] and Prussian-blue derivatives [[29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]] as Na-storage electrode candidates for aqueous SIBs. However, a large number of them suffer from low specific capacities or poor cycling stability, owing to the limitation of narrow electrochemical stability window and chemical corrosion of aqueous electrolytes. Accordingly, developing electrode materials with large specific capacities and good cycling stability is essentially important for practical application of high-performance aqueous SIBs.

Sodium titanium phosphate with formula of NaTi2(PO4)3 has been widely investigated in field of non-aqueous SIBs due to its favourable NASICON-type framework and reversible Na-intercalation chemistry [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]]. It is also considered as the most attractive anode material for aqueous SIBs because it renders a high specific capacity of 133 mAh g−1 and a low working potential of −0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl, well above that of hydrogen evolution) based on the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple [[43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]]. Different from the application in non-aqueous SIBs, NaTi2(PO4)3 however suffers from poor cycling stability for aqueous SIBs due to the irreversible “dissolution-deposition” behavior in aqueous electrolytes [49,50]. Recently, two strategies have been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing electrochemical performance of NaTi2(PO4)3 anode. The one is partly substituting Ti with inactive elements (such as Mn, Mg and V) to promote the bulk stability [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Typically, Na2Ti3/2Mn1/2(PO4)3 revealed a stable practical capacity of 78.8 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and an impressive capacity retention of 93% after 200 cycles at 1 C [16]. Na3MgTi(PO4)3 delivered a stable capacity of 54 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and rendered a capacity retention of 94.2% within 100 cycles at 0.5 C [19]. Na2VTi(PO4)3 retained 94% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C [18]. Obviously, although significantly improved cycling performance is achieved, the substituting leads to low practical specific capacities of <80 mAh g−1. The other one is constructing a protective carbon-coating layer on the material surface to both enhance the electron conductivity and suppress the chemical corrosion of aqueous electrolytes. For example, hierarchical carbon-decorated NaTi2(PO4)3 exhibited a high specific capacity of 114 mAh g−1 at 2 C, with a capacity retention of 80.7% after 300 cycles [51]. Graphene-anchored NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles revealed an initial discharge capacity of 104.4 mAh g−1 and retained a discharge capacity of 99.9 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 2 C, corresponding to a high capacity retention of 95.7% [45]. In addition, previous studies suggested that high-concentration electrolytes play an important role in stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface and thus improving the cycling performance of Na-storage materials for aqueous SIBs [[52], [53], [54]]. However, the electrochemical properties of NaTi2(PO4)3/C anode in high-concentration electrolytes is lack of being systematically investigated.

In this work, graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite (written as NTP/C-G) is reported as a high-performance anode material for aqueous SIBs. Its structural and electrochemical properties in high-concentration electrolyte (6 M aqueous NaClO4) were investigated by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic technique. Experimental results reveal that the NTP/C-G material delivers an improved electrochemical performance with high reversible capacities of 104.6 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 88.0 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, and remarkable capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles at a low current density of 100 mA g−1.

The graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C (NTP/C-G) material was synthesized by using a facile sol-gel reaction route with the following procedures. Firstly, solution A was prepared by dissolving 265.9 mg sodium acetate (CH3COONa, 99%, Aladdin reagent), 1118.4 mg ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4, 99%, Aladdin reagent) and 234.8 mg citric acid (C6H8O7, 99.5%, Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co., Ltd) into 30 mL distilled water under magnetic stirring. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 2 mL titanium isopropylate (C12H28O4Ti, 95%, Aladdin reagent) in 3 mL ethanol (CH3CH2OH, 99.7%) under magnetic stirring. Secondly, a precursor was formed by slowly dropping Solution B into Solution A, followed by evaporating the solvent 75 °C. The obtained gel was then dried at 100 °C for 12 h in vacuum. After being sufficiently milled with a pestle and mortar, the gel powder was uniformly mixed with 40.1 mg graphene nanosheets (Industry-class, Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd). Thirdly, the mixture was pre-treated at 450 °C for 4 h and 750 °C for 8 h in Ar-fluxing atmosphere, leading to our desired NTP/C-G material. For comparison, pristine NaTi2(PO4)3 was also prepared as similar procedures without adding citric acid and graphene nanosheets.

Crystal structure of the pristine samples and phase evolution of the materials during Na extraction/insertion were identified by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert Powder with a CuKα radiation source) with a scanning rate of 8° min−1 in the range of 10–60°. Microstructural properties were analysed with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Spotlight200, PE) in the wavenumber range of 450–4000 cm−1. The morphology was observed through a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100). The carbon content was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, STA449F3) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in air atmosphere.

Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a three-electrode system with Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl solution) reference electrode, Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] counter electrode, and 6 M NaClO4 aqueous electrolyte. It is particularly mentioned that 6 M NaClO4 electrolyte was used due to the critical role of high-concentration electrolyte in stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface and improving the cycling performance of electrode materials (Fig. S1). Na2Ni[Fe(CN)6] counter electrode was adopted owing to the high-efficiency Na-storage performance with excellent cycling stability (Fig. S2). The working electrode consists of 80 wt% active material, 10 wt% conductive agent (Super P carbon) and 10 wt% binder (PVDF). The loading of active material in the electrode is about 2.5 mg cm−2. The cyclic voltammetry was carried out on electrochemical workstation (CHE 600E) in the voltage range of −1.0 –0 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on Land Text System (CT2001A). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured on electrochemical working station (VERSASTAT4) in frequency range of 10 kHz and 10 mHz at the potential of −0.72 V.

The NTP/C-G material was synthesized with a scale sol-gel approach. In brief, a precursor gel was firstly formed by drying the precursor solution containing NH4H2PO4, CH3COONa, Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, and citric acid with molar ratio of 3.0: 1.0: 2.0: 0.3, and then uniformly mixed with conductive graphene nanosheets. The resultant power was pretreated at 450 °C for 4 h and sintered at 750 °C for 8 h in Ar-fluxing atmosphere to form graphene nanosheets-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite. In the approach, the citric acid serves as dispersant and carbon sources to construct NaTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite, while the graphene nanosheets work as highly conductive network to increase reaction kinetics of the material. For comparison, pristine NaTi2(PO4)3 (denoted as NTP) was also prepared as similar procedures without adding citric acid and graphene nanosheets. Fig. 1a illustrates X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the NTP and NTP/C-G materials, which are well indexed to be a rhombohedral structure with R-3c space group [45]. In the structure, the interconnection of octahedral TiO6 and tetrahedral PO4 units by sharing oxygen atoms constructs a three-dimensional NASICON-type framework with large interstitial sites allowing for fast diffusion of Na+ ions [37]. The lattice parameters are a = b = 8.4630 Å and c = 21.8012 Å The sharp peaks located at 14.5°, 20.3°, 20.9°, 24.3°, 29.3°, 32.4° and 36.6° are respectively assigned to crystallographic plane (012), (104), (110), (113), (024), (116), and (300). The strong intensities suggest the well-crystallized characteristic of the material. The average crystallite size of the NTP/C-G sample is estimated based on the Debye-Scherrer equation to be 58.6 nm, smaller than that of the NTP sample (85.4 nm). Fig. 1b maps the FTIR spectra of the NTP and NTP/C-G samples in the wavenumber range of 400–4500 cm−1. The characteristic peaks located at 658 cm−1 and 1103 cm−1 are assigned to vibration of Tisingle bondO bonds. The absorption bands at 604 cm−1 and 1129 cm−1 are ascribed to the bending vibrations of PO4 group. Furthermore, the morphology of the NTP/C-G material was observed by using transmission electron microscope. As observed from the TEM images (Fig. 2a–c), the material is composed of NaTi2(PO4)3/C aggregates anchored on graphene nanosheets. The spacing of 0.605 nm in the parallel striations corresponds to the crystallographic plane (012), while the spacing of 0.411 nm in the belt-like striations is assigned to the plane (002) of few-layered graphite. TG analysis shown in Fig. 2d indicates that the overall carbon content in the NTP/C-G material is about 4.2 wt%. It is demonstrated that the graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites have been successfully obtained.

Electrochemical redox mechanism of the NTP/C-G material was identified by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic measurement and ex-situ X-ray diffraction. Fig. 3a exhibits cyclic voltammograms tested at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for the first three cycles. There is one couple of symmetric sharp redox peaks around −0.72 V, suggesting that the material possesses a one-step electrochemical reaction process during Na insertion/extraction. The reduction peak is attributed to insertion of Na+ ions into material bulk accompanied with change from Ti4+ to Ti3+, while the oxidation peak is assigned to extraction of Na+ ions from the material bulk with oxidation of Ti3+ into Ti4+ [20]. Fig. 3b shows charge/discharge profiles of the material at a current density of 100 mA g−1. The capacity contribution mainly originates from the potential plateau of −0.72 V, consistent with the results from cyclic voltammetry. At the first cycle, it delivers a discharge capacity of 120.1 mAh g−1 and a charge capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1, reaching an initial Coulombic efficiency of 87.1%. The irreversible capacity loss is mainly ascribed to the side reactions associated with electrolyte decomposition [49,50]. After the first cycle, it shows a stable reversible capacity of with Coulombic efficiency of about 94%. In order to identify the phase-change mechanism of the material during charge/discharge process, the structural evolution was probed by using ex-situ X-ray diffraction technique. As displayed in Fig. 3c, with discharging to lower potentials, the reflection peaks continuously shifts to higher angles due to the insertion of large Na+ ions and change of smaller Ti4+ into Ti3+ ions. The fully discharged state reveals lattice parameters of a = b = 8.4779 Å, c = 21.8240 Å and a lattice volume of 1358.4 Å3. The small volume change (0.45%) relative to the fresh sample would benefit the framework-structure stability and charge/discharge cycling performance of electrode materials [55]. Subsequent charging from −1.0 to 0.0 V, the XRD peaks reversibly move to lower angles, and the fully charged state shows the XRD pattern as same as that of the fresh sample. This suggests that the material undergoes a reversible solid-solution mechanism during the Na insertion/extraction process.

Reaction kinetics of the material was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry. Fig. 4a presents cyclic voltammograms obtained at scanning rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 mV s−1. With increasing the scanning rate, the reduction-peak potential shifts to lower potentials, while the oxidation-peak potential moves to higher potentials. This is the typical character of electrochemical polarization for a diffusion-controlled reaction process. Meanwhile, the peak current increases with raising the scanning rate. The apparent diffusion coefficient of Na+ ions (DNa+) in material bulk can be estimated by mapping the linear relationship between the peak current and the scanning rate (Fig. 4b) according to the Randles–Sevcik equation [56]. As a result, the DNa+ value is calculated to be 10−9 cm2 s−1 order of magnitude, consistent with those of previously reported high-performance NaTi2(PO4)3 materials [57]. The fast reaction kinetics with a large diffusion coefficient would support the high-rate capability of the material.

Charge/discharge performance of the NTP/C-G material were investigated by continuously charging/discharging with extended cycling or at various current densities. Fig. 5a comparatively shows the capacity variations versus cycle number of the NTP and NTP/C-G samples at the current density of 100 mA g−1. The pristine NTP sample exhibits poor electrochemical performance with a low reversible capacity of 21.4 mAh g−1 and a capacity retention of 21.5% after 100 cycles, owing to severe electrochemical polarization caused by the intrinsically low electron conductivity of polyanionic framework. Introducing corrosion-resistant carbon matrix and conductive graphene nanosheets can largely enhance the electron conductivity and the cycling stability. Accordingly, the NTP/C-G shows a much better charge/discharge performance with a reversible capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1 and capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles. Fig. 5b comparatively shows the high-rate capability of the NTP and NTP/C-G samples at current densities of 100 mA g−1, 200 mA g−1, 500 mA g−1, and 2000 mA g−1. Obviously, the NTP sample does not reveal reversible capacities when the polarization current is increased to 500 mA g−1, owing to the sluggish reaction kinetics caused by the low electron conductivity. Surprisedly, the NTP/C-G material delivers excellent high-rate performance with reversible capacities of 90.9 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and 88.0 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1. Compared with previously reported NaTi2(PO4)3/C materials (listed in Table S1), it shows superior electrochemical performance with improved cycling stability and high-rate capability, owing to the synergetic effect of the unique carbon-blending nanostructure and high-concentration electrolyte. The carbon-blending nanostructure both improves the electron conductivity and protects the active NaTi2(PO4)3 material from chemical corrosion of aqueous electrolytes. The high-concentration electrolyte suppresses side reactions from electrolytes and stabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface [[52], [53], [54]]. This indicates that the carbon-blending nanostructure and high-concentration electrolyte enable our NTP/C-G material promising for high-performance aqueous SIBs.

For the sake of confirming the improved reaction kinetics for the NTP/C-G material, Fig. 6 comparatively presents the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) of NTP and NTP/C-G samples at the discharge state of −0.72 V. In the EIS spectra, the semi-circular region at high frequencies (>10 Hz) is assigned to the Na-transfer resistance (Rf) through interfacial interfaces, while the curved region at medium frequencies is attributed to the charge-transfer reaction. As seen from the fitting results (Table S2), the NTP sample possesses a clear interfacial resistance of 19.0 Ω owing to formation of additional resistive components caused by “dissolution-deposition” of NaTi2(PO4)3 in aqueous electrolytes [49], and a large charge-transfer impedance of 244.6 Ω due to the low electron conductivity. In contrast, the NTP/C-G sample shows much smaller interfacial resistance (2.4 Ω) and charge-transfer impedance (4.9 Ω), suggesting much faster reaction kinetics. The improved reaction kinetics is attributed to the unique nanostructure composed of protective carbon matrix and conductive graphene nanosheets, which not only enhances the electron conductivity, but also suppress formation of resistive components.

Graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites have been successfully developed as a high performance anode material for aqueous sodium-ion batteries. The electrochemical properties and redox mechanism of the material in high-concentration electrolyte (6 M NaClO4) have been characterized with X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic measurements. It is found that the material undergoes a one-step solid-solution mechanism during the Na insertion/extraction process based on the reversible electrochemical reaction of Ti4+/Ti3+ couple. It shows an attractive rechargeable performance with a high specific reversible capacity of 104.6 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1, excellent high-rate capability with capacity retention of 88.0 mAh g−1 at 2000 mA g−1, and long-term cycling stability with a capacity retention of 92% after 100 cycles. The superior performance enables the graphene-integrated NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite promising for long-lifespan aqueous sodium-ion batteries.
