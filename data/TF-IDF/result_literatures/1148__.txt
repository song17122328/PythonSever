Subsolidus  phase  ratios  of  the  Na2MoO4–CoMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  system  have  been  studied  by X 2)ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and vibrational spectroscopy. A phase of variable composition Na1 – xCo1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 having NASICON structure (space group R c) and triple molybdate NaCo3Sc(MoO4)5 crystallizing in triclinic system (space group P ) have been obtained. The high conductiv 2) ity of Na1 – xCo1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 allows the phase of variable composition to be regarded as a promising sodium 2)ion conducting solid electrolyte.

A  high  interest  to  representatives  of  oxide  phases that crystallize in NASICON type structure is due to their  unique  properties,  namely,  high  chemical  and thermal  stability,  low  thermal  expansion,  and  high ionic conductivity [1–4]. The specific structural fea 2) ture of these phases is a stable framework of octahedra }∞, where R stands for an and tetrahedra, {[R2(EО4) octahedral cation in phosphate, arsenate, molybdate, tungstate, and sulfate systems and alkali metal atoms populate framework voids [1–9].

The  development  of  alternative  power  sources brings about the increasing demand for novel ion 2)con 2) ductive materials [1–9].

Varying cationic composition within one structure type  offers  a  way  to  perform  targeted  synthesis  of NASICON 2)isostructural phases of variable composi 2) tion M1 – хA1 – хR1 + х(MoO4)3.

The basis of NASICON structure is a three 2)dimen 2) sional  framework  built  of  corner 2)sharing  A(R)О6 octahedra and MoO4 tetrahedra [1, 2]. This structure of  M1 – хA1 – хR1 + х(MoO4)3  phases  is  topologically identical to the rhombohedral structure of corundum [2];  A(R)  atoms  are  positioned  on  triple  axes  and MoO4 groups are on double axes. The vacant octahe 2) dral and tetrahedral voids merge into a three 2)dimen 2) sional network of channels whose bores are filled with alkali  cations  [3].  The  necessary  condition  for  the NASICON structure to exist is that the sizes of two 2) and three 2)charged cations would fall within 0.6–0.9 Å; this condition is satisfied by Co2+ and Sc3+ cations and by Na+ as a extraframework cation, which has a moderate size so as to be accommodated into framework voids.

One goal of this study is to elucidate whether Co2+ and Sc3+ cations can enter the NASICON structure of a phase of  variable  composition  Na1 – хCo1 –  х  Sc1 +  х(MoO4)3, which  is  a  subtraction  solid  solution  based  on  triple molybdate NaCoSc(MoO4)3; another goal is to deter 2) mine  synthesis  parameters  to  prepare  the  phase  of variable  composition,  its  homogeneity  range,  and thermal  stability  and  to  characterize  the  phase  by vibrational  temperature 2)dependent conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and dielectric loss tangent.

Solid 2)phase  reactions  in  the  temperature  range 450–800°C  were  used  to  study  interactions  in  the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3 system.

The  precursor  components  used  in  these  studies were  Na2MoO4,  CoMoO4,  and  Sc2(MoO4)3,  which had been presynthesized in solid 2)phase reactions from Na2CO3,  Co(NO3)2  ⋅  6H2O,  Sc(NO3)3  ⋅  6H2O,  and MoO3  in  the  temperature  range  400–650°C  with grinding  repeating  every  20–30  h.  The  calcination time  at  each  temperature  was  120–150  h.  After annealing,  samples  were  slowly  cooled  with  the  fur 2) nace.  Nonequilibrated  samples  were  annealed  addi 2) tionally;  equilibrium  was  considered  acquired  when the phase composition of a sample became unchanged during two consecutive anneals. Products were identi 2) fied by X 2)ray powder diffraction in an FR 2)552 mono 2) chromator  chamber  (CuKα  radiation,  germanium internal  standard).  X 2)ray  diffraction  patterns  were processed using Rentgen software.

Vibrational  spectra  were  recorded  from  polycrys 2) talline  Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  samples  on  a Bruker  FT 2)IR  spectrometer  and  on  a  Specord  M 2)80 spectrometer using, as an exciter, a laser having 1.06 2)nm radiation in the near 2)IR. The scattering geometry was reflection geometry; the resolution was 3–5 cm–1. Test samples were Nujol mulls on polyethylene substrates and KBr disks. Molybdenum isotope substituted sam 2) ples were prepared using 92MoO3 and 100MoO3.

Differential  thermal  analysis  was  carried  out  on  an MOM OD 2)103 derivatograph; the temperature elevation rate was 10 K/min, and sample sizes were 0.3–0.4 g.

Temperature 2)dependent conductivity σ, dielectric permittivity  ε,  and  dielectric  loss  tangent  tanδ  were studied  using  Vest  and  Tallan’s  polarization  method [6] on ceramic samples compressed into disks 10 mm in diameter and 1–1.5 mm high with platinum elec 2) trodes.  The  electrodes  were  applied  by  burning 2)in platinum paste. Electrophysical measurements were per 2) formed on an E8 2)4 ac bridge at a frequency of 103 Hz with an R 2)5025 capacitance box, which extended the dielectric  loss  tangent  measurement  range  (determi 2) nation  accuracy  was  ±5%).  Direct  current  was recorded by an E6 2)13A teraohmmeter at a set voltage of 30–50 mV.

The  temperature  of  a  test  sample  during  electro 2) physical  measurements  was  monitored  using  a Chromel–Alumel  thermocouple  attached  to  a  V7 2)21A voltmeter accurate to ±2°С.

The  rreproducibility  of  measurement  results  was verified in heating 2)and 2)cooling mode in the range 20– 600°С.

Interactions the  Na2MoO4–CoMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3 system were studied into steps. First, the phase compositions were studied for samples that cor 2) respond  to  the  meeting  points  of  sections  radiating from  the  points  of  compounds  formed  in  the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4,  Na2MoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3,  and CoMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  binary  subsystems.  The  sec 2) ond step involved studying the quasi 2)binary sections to triangulate the system (Fig. 1).

A  new  triple  molybdate  NaCoSc(MoO4)3  was found  to  form  in  CoMoO4–NaSc(MoO4)2  and Na2+2xCo1–x(MoO4)2–Sc2(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) sec 2) tions at 550–600°C. In the plane of the Na2MoO4– CoMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  the NaCoSc(MoO4)3–Sc2(MoO4)3 section, there exists a phase  of  variable  composition  Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х (MoO4)3 (0  ≤  х  ≤  0.5),  which  is  a  subtraction  solid solution based on triple molybdate NaCoSc(MoO4)3. At 600–650°С, triple molybdate NaCo3Sc(MoO4)5 was found  to  form  in  the  NaSc(MoO4)2–NiMoO4  (1  :  3) section.  Single 2)phase  samples  of  Na1 –  хCo1 – хSc1  + х(MoO4)3, which belongs to the NASICON structure type (space group R c, Z = 6), were prepared at 680°C and calcination time of 140–160 h; triple molybdate NaCo3Sc(MoO4)5,  which  crystallizes  in  triclinic  sys 2) tem (space group P  Z = 2), was prepared as a single 2) phase  sample  in  200 2)h  anneal  at  700°C.  The NaCo3Sc(MoO4)5 has the following unit cell parame 2) ters: a = 6.945(2) Å, b = 17.578(5) Å, c = 6.859(1) Å, α = 87.93(2)°, β = 101.44(2)°, γ = 92.28(2)°.

Na–O should be weakened, which is achieved due to  a  deficit  of  extraframework  sodium  and  an increase in framework size, so that the unit cell vol 2) ume  of  Na1 – хCo1 –  хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 increases as the homogeneity range extends (Table 1).

Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 crystallizes in trigonal sys 2) tem as probed by X 2)ray diffraction; this compound is isos 2) tructural to triple molybdate Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 [2].  The  extent  of  the  crystallization  field  of  the NASICON solid solutions (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5) is determined by the possibility of isomorphic substitutions in octa 2) hedra. Octahedral positions (M), which are randomly occupied by Co and Sc atoms, have an excess of scan 2) dium (when х > 0) and a deficit of cobalt. Sodium posi 2) tioning in interstices does not distort the lattice symme 2) try  and  is  also  deficient.  These  structural  features  of Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  and  cation  distribution character  increase  the  contribution  of  Sc–O  bonds into  the  total  electrostatic  bond  balance  of  the structure.  For  the  structure  to  retain  this  balance,

The distinctive  features  of  this  structure  are  fragments comprised of four octahedra that form a planar rectan 2) gle and paired edge 2)sharing octahedra.

The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral voids merge into a three 2)dimensional  network  of  channels  whose  bores are  filled  with  sodium  cations;  the  symmetry  of sodium  cation  sites  is  С3i.  The  existence  of  isolated distorted  tetrahedral  anionic  groups    in  the structure makes it possible to carry out a comparative MoO2 analysis  of  the  internal  vibrations  of  discrete  4 groups and external vibrations, i.e., the vibrations of cation sublattices and МоО4 tetrahedra as a whole [9]. The bands corresponding to   vibrations expe 2) rience an isotope shift upon 92Mo–100Mo substitutions (Tables 2, 3).

The comparatively low symmetry of МоО4 tetrahe 2) dra implies the release of degeneration from their dou 2) bly  and  triply  degenerate  vibrations  and  implies  the activity  of  components  of  full 2)symmetric  stretching vibrations in IR spectra.

Group 2)theory  analysis  suggests  the  following  dis 2) tribution  over  irreducible  representations  of  factor group D3d of the space group of crystals:

The Raman spectrum should feature three lines of vibrations  of  Co2+  and  Sc3+  cations,  and  the  IR absorption  spectrum  should  feature  two  bands  of vibrations of Na+ cations and three bands of vibrations of  Co2+  and  Sc3+.  Six  lines  of  vibrations  of  MoO4 groups should appear in the Raman spectrum and nine absorption bands should appear in the IR absorption spectrum.

Bands  with  frequencies  of  986–769  (stretching vibrations) and those at 408–310 cm–1 (bending vibra 2) tions), experiencing a shift upon molybdenum isotope substitutions and lying in the spectral range character 2) istic of the vibration frequencies of MoO4 tetrahedra, are assigned to the vibrations of МоО4 groups [9].

The full 2)symmetry stretching vibrations of molyb 2) date  groups,  which  reside  in  two  sets  of  crystallo 2) graphic sites, are degenerate, likely because of the sim 2) ilarity of the geometric and dynamic parameters of the relevant polyhedra [4, 9]. The stretching vibration fre 2) quencies of MoO4 groups increase by 20–25 cm–1 as the index х rises, likely, because of the increasing Co–O and  Sc–O  bond  energies  upon  the  generation  of  an additional  considerable  amount  of  vacancies  in  the cationic  sublattice.  The  random  cation  distribution, while not influencing the spectral pattern as a whole, leads to relative line broadening, so that the degree of distortion of MoO4 tetrahedra is reduced and the split 2)

The Raman lines that appear below 300 cm–1 (at 263– 269 cm–1) are assigned to Co2+ and Sc3+. The band at 192 cm–1 is assigned to the vibrations of scandium cat 2) ions. The low 2)frequency sets of Raman lines at 112– 111–87  cm–1  are  assigned  to  the  cobalt  vibrations, since  the  vibrations  of  sodium  cations  are  Raman inactive.  In  IR  absorption  spectra,  the  bands  that appear below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to the vibra 2) tions of sodium cations.

Over  the  impurity conductivity region, the activation energy has a value of  1.03–1.08  eV,  and  over  the  intrinsic  conductivity region,  its  value  is  2.01–2.34  eV.  The  conductivity value  of  10–2  Ω/cm,  which  is  typical  of  the  sodium NASICON phase Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3, is due to the relatively large sizes of framework voids and the associated appreciable reduction in steric hindrances to Na+ transport [7, 8].

In  the  Na1 – хCo1  –  хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  solid  solution series, heterovalent substitutions Na+ + Co2+ → Sc3+ +  1) generate additional vacancies in the sodium sublattice, and  these  additional  vacancies  enhance  the  sodium cation mobility and the electrical conductivity of the phase as the index х increases from 0 to 0.5. A correla 2) tion may be traced between the variations of σ and the unit cell volume in the phase of variable composition.

The absence of extremes on the dielectric permittivity curve and on the dielectric loss tangent curve indicates  the  absence  of  phase  transitions  and  of  ferro 2) electric properties in Na1 – хCo1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3.
