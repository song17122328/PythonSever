A new SO2 sensor based on Ca2z conductor CaO.0.6MgO.6Al2O3 (CMA) with a Na2SO4 auxiliary electrode and Pt/O2 reference electrode has been fabricated and tested. In this design, both the electrodes are exposed to the same test gas thus eliminating the need to separate electrode chambers. Experimental results showed that the sensor response to SO2 is rapid and stable and the 90% response time is about 1 min. The measured emf of the sensor is a linear function of the logarithm of partial pressure of SO2 over a concentration range 1 – 1000 ppm and a temperature range 873 – 1073 K. In this cell, the CMA/Pt interface was sensitive to oxygen, while the Na2SO4/Pt interface was sensitive to SO3. MST/5725
As a result of the increasing concern for environmental protection from various gaseous pollutants generated by industrial processes, there is a need to monitor, control and minimise SOx (SO2, SO3) emissions. Sulphur oxides from the combustion of coal and the metallurgical production of base metals are major contributors of acid rain. In order to minimise the SOx (SO2, SO3) related pollution problems, there is a strong motivation to develop compact sensors capable of monitoring SOx in processes and in ambient atmosphere at process sites.
Solid state electrochemical sensors for SOx have been researched for over a decade. In the early stages, SO2 sensors using alkali – metal sulphates such as K2SO4,1 ,2 Na2SO4 – I,3 or Li2SO4 4 ,5 as electrolytes with a gaseous or a solid reference electrode were developed. However, the sulphate electrolytes suffered from poor sinterability, low electrical conductivity, and cracking due to large volume changes at phase transition temperature. More robust devices were fabricated by using Naz ion conductors such as Nasicon6 and Na – b-Al2O3,7 – 9 which have high ionic conductivity, can be easily sintered, and show no phase transformation with volume changes over a wide range of temperatures.
In order to avoid sealing problems several sensors1 1 – 1 4 have been developed that are constructed as open cells. Rao1 1 proposed a temperature gradient SO2 sensor, which is not of suf cient sensitivity for practical use. Recently SO2 sensors based on sputtered Na2SO4zBaSO4zAg2SO4 as a thin  lm electrolyte with an Ag reference1 3 and a YSZ (yttria stabilised zirconia – oxygen ionic conductor) electrolyte interfaced with silver/silver sulphate auxiliary sensing electrode1 4 have been developed. In both these sensors, the sensing and reference electrodes can be exposed to the same atmosphere during operation. Thus no sealing is required. However, as silver can react with the SO2 atmosphere during operation, sensor lifetime is anticipated to be short. A SO2 sensor based on YSZ interfaced with Nasicon with a Na2SO4 auxiliary electrode has also been developed.
Since YSZ serves to protect Nasicon from reacting with SO2/SO3, the sensor does not need any sealing of the reference side, so that the same test gas is exposed to both electrodes, which greatly simpli es the design and the operation of the sensors in practice.1 6 Oxygen is involved in both the electrode reactions such that it does not affect the  nal relationship between emf and concentration of SO3 gas. Such a sensor was proposed to measure SO3 in a gaseous atmosphere. The sensor has been further modi ed to measure SO2 by providing a Pt/alumina catalyst to convert SO2 into an equilibrium concentration of SO3 at relatively high operating temperatures.
Maruyama et al.1 7 proposed a tip shape sensor for CO2 detection. The cell can be expressed as j Pt, CO2, O2, Na2CO3 CO2, O2, Pt Nasicon or Na{b When the temperature is  xed, the Na2O activity in Na2CO3 on the left hand electrode is  xed by the partial pressure of CO2 and O2; a constant Na2O activity in the electrolyte on the right hand side serves as the reference oxygen electrode because the electrolyte material is chemically stable against CO2. The cell can operate without any sealing. The concept can be readily transferred to SO2 sensors, if a suitable solid state electrolyte can be selected.
Ca – b0-Al2O3, which shares the structural features of Na – b0-Al2O3 is a known ionic conductor of calcium ion. Dunn and Farrington have reported high Ca2 z ionic conductivity in Ca – b0-Al2O3, which was prepared from Na – b0-Al2O3 by an ion exchange process.1 8 ,1 9 Kirchenerova et al.2 0 found that ion exchanged Ca – b0-Al2O3 is thermally unstable at elevated temperature, and transforms to calcium magnetoplumbite, which has a structure similar to that of the Na – b0-Al2O3. Kumar et al. investigated the preparation of Ca – b0-Al2O3 type electrolyte by the solid state ceramic route2 1 and optimal conditions for preparation were obtained. The composition of this solid electrolyte is nominally CaO.0.6 MgO.6Al2O3 (CMA) and has a magnetoplumbite type of structure. At temperatures higher than 873 K the material has suf ciently high Ca2 z ionic conductivity for use in sensors.2 2 
Such a material has been successfully employed in galvanic cells for the measurement of thermodynamic data in the CaO – Al2O3 system2 1 as well as the Ca – Pb system.2 3 Further, Kumar et al.2 4 studied the thermodynamicstability of CMA by determining the activity. Gog et al.2 5 used CaSO4 as the auxiliary phase in contact with Ca – b0-Al2O3 solid electrolyte to develop SO2 sensors.
In this work, Ca – b0-Al2O3 type solid electrolyte (CMA) has been interfaced with a Na2SO4 auxiliary electrode in order to develop a new SOx sensor. The sensor mechanism is based on the hyphothesis that due to ion exchange reaction between Ca – b0-Al2O3 type solid electrolyte (CMA) and Na2SO4, a stable CaSO4 phase is formed.
MATERIALS CMA powder was prepared using a conventional calcination sintering route2 1 from precursors of magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, and alumina. These powders were mixed according to required ratio (CaO/MgO/Al2O3~1 : 0.6 : 6) and ball milled in acetone for a total of 12 h. The powder slurry was dried, placed in an alumina crucible and then calcined at 1173 K for 6 h in air. After milling and drying, tubes 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick were prepared, and then the tubes were sintered in the alumina crucible at 1923 K for 4 h. The phases present after sintering were identi ed by X-ray powder diffraction.
PREPARATION OF SO2 SENSOR Pt ink electrode was coated on the outside of the sintered CMA tube and then  ne Na2SO4 powder was used to  ll a tube containing Pt wire and  red at 1173 K for 30 min. In order to obtain in situ SO2 conversion into SO3, alumina powder loaded with 1% Pt catalyst was used to  ll to the top the auxiliary Na2SO4 electrode. The construction of the sensor device is shown in Fig. 2.
Using the literature data on activity of CaO in solid electrolyte, the stability region for the solid electrolyte can be calculated using equation (5). Figure 1 shows the calculated results for the material. The region below the line is the stable region for the electrolyte against SO3. As seen in Fig. 1, the CaSO4 will not form on the surface of the electrolyte at normal operating temperatures and concentration ranges.
EMF MEASUREMENT The SO2 sensors were tested in controlled conditions at different SO2 levels and operating temperatures. Measurements were carried out in a conventional gas  ow apparatus equipped with a heating furnace. Premixed sample gases were prepared by diluting a parent gas (5000 ppm SO2 in air/N2), with synthetic air using a gas blender, and were allowed to  ow through the quartz tube in which the sensor was positioned, at a controlled  ow rate of typically 100 cm3 min2 1. The SO2 concentration in the gas mixture was varied from 1 ppm to 1000 ppm. Operating temperatures from 873 to 1073 K were investigated. The partial pressure of oxygen in the gas was independently controlled. Electromotive forces (emfs) were measured with a high impedance electrometer (>101 2 ohm), and the data transferred to a PC based data collecting system (Pico ADC-16).
The slope of the response curve calculated from the experimental data is 125.3 mV/decade at 1073 K. From the slope, using the Nernst equation, the number of electrons transferred in the electrochemical reactions is calculated to be 1.7, approaching the expected value of 2.0.
In order to evaluate the effect of the temperature on the emf values of the sensor, the sensor was tested at different  xed temperatures. Figure 5 shows the dependence of the emf response of the sensor on the logarithm of SO2 concentration (logPS O 2 ), measured at 939, 1031, 1003, and 1073 K. The emf response of the sensor was linear, with positive slope, with the logarithm of SO2 concentration (logPS O 2 ) at each temperature tested. The calculated number of transferred electrons, derived from the Nernstian equation applied to the best linear  t, is 2.0, 1.74, 1.60 and 1.7, all approaching 2, at the corresponding temperatures of 939, 1031, 1003, and 1073 K. The deviation from 2 in the number of transferred electrons can be explained by looking at the scatter of the data around the  t line. If the scattered data is ignored, the calculated number of transferred electrons closely approaches 2.
Reproducibility of the sensors was investigated by testing the same experimental three different conditions. The results are presented in Fig. 7. If the number of transferred electrons Z~2 is assumed, the theoretical Nernstian slope is 106.5 mV/decade at 1074 K, while the experimental slopes for the three sensors are 123.9,125.3, and 131.1 mV/decade respectively. If the relationship between emf and the logarithm of SO2 partial pressure is expressed as emf ~azb log PSO2 the values of the constant a and b for the three sensors are somewhat different. The difference may be accounted for by the effects of an exchange reaction between the CMA electrolyte and the Na2SO4 auxiliary electrode, resulting in variations in aC a S O 4 in the auxiliary phase.
DG0 is the standard free energy of reaction (12); R, T and F have the normal meaning; aCaO and aCaSO4 are the activities of CaO in CMA and CaSO4 in Na2SO4 respectively. Thus the overall emf is independent of oxygen partial pressure for a SO3 sensor. It is dependent upon oxygen partial pressure for a SO2 sensor through the SO2/SO3 equilibrium. For a  xed value of partial pressure of change from 0.21 atm to SO2 (48 ppm), the values of Demf as PO2 200 ppm can be calculated using equation (14) and compared with the experimental results, as shown in Table 1.
In this sensor, the presence of a heterojunction between the sodium auxiliary phase and CMA calcium ion conductor is critical for stabilising the auxiliary phase.
