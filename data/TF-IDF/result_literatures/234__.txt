The unclear Li+ local environment and Li+ conduction mechanism in solid polymer electrolytes, especially in  a ceramic/polymer composite electrolyte, hinder the design and development of a new composite electrolyte. Moreover,  both  the  low  room–temperature  Li+  conductivity  and  large  interfacial  resistance  with  a  metallic  lithium  anode  of  a  polymer membrane limit its application below a relatively high temperature. Here we have identified the Li+ distribution  and Li+ transport mechanism in a composite polymer electrolyte by investigating a new solid poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)– based NASICON–LiZr2(PO4)3 composite with 7Li relaxation time and 6Li→7Li trace–exchange NMR measurements. The Li+  population  of  the  two  local  environments  in  the  composite  electrolytes  depends  on  the  Li-salt  concentration  and  the  amount  of  ceramic  filler.  A  composite  electrolyte  with  a  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  n  =  10  and  25  wt%  LZP  filler  has  a  high  Li+  conductivity  of  1.2  ×  10–4  S  cm–1  at  30  oC  and  a  low  activation  energy  owing  to  the  additional  Li+  in  the  mobile  A2  environment. Moreover, an in–situ–formed solid electrolyte interphase layer from the reaction between LiZr2(PO4)3 and a  metallic  lithium  anode  stabilized  the  Li/composite–electrolyte  interface  and  reduced  the  interfacial  resistance,  which  provided a symmetric Li/Li cell, and all–solid–state Li/LiFePO4 and Li/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells a good cycling performance  at 40 oC. 

Solid  electrolytes  with  a  high  Li+  conductivity,  a  small  resistance across the electrolyte/electrode interface, and a  large electrochemical window may improve the safety and  energy  density  of  all–solid–state  Li–metal  batteries.1,2  Some oxides (e.g., garnet Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12)3-5 and sulfide  electrolytes  (e.g.,  argyrodite  Li6PS5Cl)6-8  have  high  Li+  conductivities above 10–3 S cm–1 at 25  oC. However, these  electrolytes are either unstable on contact with a metallic  lithium  anode  or  have  a  large  interfacial  resistance  with  different  electrodes,  and  the  all–solid–state  Li–metal  batteries with these electrolytes are short–circuited at an  applied  current  density  above  0.3  mA  cm–2  because  of  their poor wettability by lithium metal.9,10 Compared with  the inorganic solid electrolytes, the flexible poly(ethylene  oxide)  (PEO)–based  polymer  electrolytes  show  better  contact  and  stability  with  a  Li–metal  anode,  which  reduces  interfacial the resistance.11-14  However,  these  solid  polymer  electrolytes  have a low Li+ conductivity of 10–6 S cm–1 at 25  oC, which  increases  the  operating  temperature  of  PEO–based  all– solid–state  Li–metal  batteries  to  above  60  oC.  Moreover,  the  small  Li+  transference  number  tLi+  ≈  0.2  in  a  PEO– based  electrolyte  also  results  in  a  large  concentration  overpotential  polarization  during  cell  charge/discharge;  the capacity of the cell decreases to zero at higher current  densities.15-17 PEO and PEO–lithium salts (LiX) crystallize  in the form of spherulites at temperatures below 50 oC to  form PEO and Li+–rich phases (e.g., PEO6–LiX); some Li+– conducting  PEO–LiX  electrolytes  remain  amorphous  because  of  the  plasticizing  effect  of  the  lithium  salts.18,19  The compositional inhomogeneity of PEO–LiX electrolyte  causes  a  large  local  current  density  at  a  Li–metal– anode/PEO  interface,  which  short  circuits  the  cell  at  current  densities  above  0.2  mA  cm–2;  lithium  dendrite  growth cannot be suppressed by the PEO–LiX membrane, even  at  working  temperatures  above  50  oC  owing  to  its  degraded mechanical strength.


LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2  cathodes  showed  a  high  coulombic  efficiency and a long cycle life at 40 oC. 

Adding a second ceramic phase, including Li+ insulating  and  oxide/sulfide  Li+  oxides  conductors  (e.g.,  garnet  Li7La3Zr2O12  and  perovskite  Li0.33La0.56TiO3)22-27, as a filler to the polymer membrane is  a  useful  strategy  to  improve  Li+  conductivity  of  the  composite  polymer  electrolyte  by  (1)  the  reduction  of  polymer  crystallization,  (2)  a  possible  increase  of  Li+  transport  on  the  polymer/filler  interface,  (3)  a  possible  participation  of  Li  ions  from  the  Li+–conducting  fillers.  Moreover,  the  introduction  of  these  ceramic  fillers  increases  the  mechanical  strength  and  the  thermal  stability  of  the  polymer  electrolytes.  The  Li+–insulating  ceramic  fillers  such  as  nano–sized  Al2O3/TiO2  powders  with  large  surface  area  increased  Li+  conductivity  of  the  PEO  membrane  by  one  order  of  magnitude;  however,  a  low  Li+  conductivity  and  small  Li+  transference  number  limit  the  commercialization  of  the  polymer  electrolyte.  The Li+–conducting garnet is not stable in air and is prone  to  forming  Li2CO3/LiOH  on  its  surface,  which  blocks  Li+  transfer  across  the  PEO/garnet  interphase;  perovskite  Li0.33La0.56TiO3  is  easily  reduced  below  2  V  vs.  Li+/Li0.28,29  Although the conductivity and cycling performance of the  all–solid–state Li–metal batteries with different composite  electrolytes  have  been  investigated  by  many  research  groups,30,31  the  Li+  local  environment  and  Li+  conduction  mechanism of the solid polymer electrolytes has yet to be  thoroughly  investigated,  especially  for  the  polymer/Li+– conducting  filler  composite  electrolytes.  Therefore,  it’s  still urgent to explore (1) new ceramic fillers that have a  strong  interaction  with  the  polymer–LiX  to  improve  the  Li+  conductivity  and  can  form  a  uniform  interface  with  the  metallic  lithium  anode  to  homogenize  the  current  density  at  the  interface,  and  (2)  the  Li+  conduction  mechanism of the composite polymer electrolyte. 

Here  we  employed  7Li  relaxation  time  and  6Li → 7Li  trace–exchange  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  measurements  to  investigate  the  Li+  distribution  and  Li+  conduction  mechanism  of  a  composite  polymer  electrolyte  by  comparing  three  different  PEO–LiTFSI  composite  electrolytes:  without  any  filler  (CPE),  PEO– LiTFSI–Al2O3  composite  electrolyte  (CPE–Al2O3),  and  a  new  (CPE–LZP).  LiZr2(PO4)3  (LZP)  is  stable  above  5  V  and  has  a  bulk  Li+  conductivity of 3.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 25  oC; the strong P–O  bond of the phosphate group in LiZr2(PO4)3 increases its  chemical stability in air.32 Three different Li+ positions are  found in all composite polymers, and the Li+ distribution  in the composites depends on the ceramic fillers and the  lithium salt concentration. The LZP filler improves the Li+  conductivity of the polymer electrolyte to 1.2× 10−4 S cm−1  at 30  oC by increasing the concentration and disorder of  more mobile Li+ ions. Moreover, the reaction product Li3P  phase of CPE–LZP on contact with lithium metal is wet by  the  metallic  lithium  anode,  which  reduces  the  Li–metal  anode/polymer  membrane  interfacial  resistance  and  improves  the  cycling  stability  of  a  symmetric  Li/Li  cell.  All–solid–state  Li–metal  batteries  with  LiFePO4  and  2

Li+ transport of the CPE–LZP electrolyte NASICON  LiZr2(PO4)3  (LZP)  prepared  by  solid–state  reaction  has  a  rhombohedral  structure  and  a  bulk  Li+  conductivity of 3.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 oC (Fig. S1a). Raman  spectroscopy  of  the  LiZr2(PO4)3  (Fig.  S1b)  does  not  indicate  any  presence  of  a  Li2CO3  Li+–blocking  layer,  which  would  normally  manifest  itself  as  a  peak  at  1080  cm–1  in  the  spectrum.  This  observation  confirms  the  stability  of  LiZr2(PO4)3  in  air  with  the  strong  P–O  bond  enhancing its chemical stability in comparison with other  solid  electrolytes.  The  flexible  composite  LZP  in  PEO  membrane  prepared  by  a  solution–cast  method  is  very  dense, and the LiZr2(PO4)3 particles with an average size  of 15 μm are uniformly distributed in the membrane (Fig.  S3a).  Fig.  1a  and  Fig.  S2a  show  the  XRD  results  of  the  composite  CPE–LZP  membrane  with  and  without  LiZr2(PO4)3.  The  two  peaks  at  20  and  25  degrees  in  the  PEO–LiTFSI  membrane  (CPE)  are  from  crystalline  PEO,  and the broad peak from 15 to 30 degrees originates from  an  amorphous  CPE  phase;  two  small  PEO  peaks  still  remain  in  the  CPE–LZP  membrane  with  15  and  20  wt%  LZP.  The  XRD  result  of  CPE–LZP  confirms  that  LiZr2(PO4)3  the  disappearance  of  the  crystalline  PEO  peak  in  the  CPE– xLZP (x ≥ 25) membrane indicated that LiZr2(PO4)3 acts as  a solid plasticizer to increase the amorphous component  of  the  polymer,  which  improves  the  Li+  transfer  in  the  PEO  by  releasing  more  free  segments  of  the  polymer  chains. 


The  non-linear  Arrhenius  plots  of ionic  conductivities of the CPE–LZP membranes with different  amounts  of  LZP  powders  (CPE–xLZP,  x  is  the  weight  percent  of  LZP  powders)  are  shown  in  Fig.  1b;  all  the  curves  follow  a  Vogel–Tamman–Fulcher  (VTF)  behavior  from 30 to 80  oC, indicating the major component of the  CPE–LZP  membrane  is  amorphous.33  The  composite  membranes  with  more  segmental  motion  at  high  temperatures  showed  higher  Li+  conductivities.  The  membrane  with  25  wt%  LiZr2(PO4)3  (CPE–25LZP)  has  a  low  electronic  conductivity  of  9.0  ×  10−10  S  cm–1  at  25  oC  (Fig.  S2b)  and  the  highest  Li+–conductivity  of  1.2  ×  10−4  and  2.1  ×  10−3  S  cm–1  at  30  and  60  oC,  respectively.  The  composite  membranes  with  15–35  wt%  LiZr2(PO4)3  showed  higher  Li+  conductivities  than  a  PEO–LiTFSI  membrane with nano Al2O3 particles (CPE–15Al2O3) even  at  temperatures  above  the  melting  point  of  PEO  where  the  polymer  membrane  is  100%  amorphous.  The  CPE– 25LZP  membrane  has  a  much  higher  Li+  transference  number  tLi+  ≈  0.36  (Fig.  S4a)  than  a  CPE–15Al2O3  membrane  and  a  PEO–based  polymer  membrane  with  garnet ceramic fillers.16,34,35 These results and the residual  crystalline  PEO  phase  in  the  CPE–25LZP  membrane  indicate that the degree of PEO crystallization as well as  the  interaction  between  the  LiZr2(PO4)3  particle  surface  and  PEO–LiTFSI  influence  the  Li+  transfer  inside  the composite  polymer;  the  Li+  in  the  bulk  LiZr2(PO4)3  may  also  contribute  to  the  Li+  transfer  of  the  polymer.  Moreover,  a  CPE–25LZP  membrane  showed  better  electrochemical  stability  than  that  of  CPE  at  higher  voltages  (Fig.  1c).  The  interaction  between  LZP  and  the  polar PEO can influence the electron energy level of PEO  to  hinder  its  decomposition  above  4  V.36  Moreover,  the  Li–salt was reported to decompose before the oxidation of  PEO;35 the stability of the composite electrolyte should be  related  to  the  stability  of  the  LiTFSI  salt.  The  higher  Li+  transference  number  in  the  composite  electrolyte  also  indicates  that  LZP  stabilizes  the  TFSI−  anions  at  high  voltages.35 The FTIR spectra of the composite electrolytes  with  and  without  LZP  powders  further  confirmed  the  LZP–polymer electrolyte interaction (Fig. S4b). The peak  at 745 cm−1 in the FTIR spectra corresponding to the ion– paired  signal37  reduced  by  5.6  %  when  25  wt%  LZP  was  added  into  the  polymer  electrolyte  (CPE  (10:1)).  The  interaction  between  LZP  and  TFSI−  anions  limits  the  movement  of  TFSI−  anions  and  frees  more  Li+  for  Li+  transport,  which  can  increase  the  stability  of  LiTFSI  at  high voltage. Additionally, since LZP is stable above 5 V,32  adding  25  wt%  of  LZP  to  the  composite  increases  the  stability of the composite electrolyte.  The composite electrolytes with different [EO]/[Li+] ratios  (8:1,  10:1,  13:1,  and  20:1)  and  25  wt%  LZP  were  tested  to  study the influence of the LiTFSI concentration on the Li+ concentration.  The conductivity of the composite electrolytes. The XRD and  EIS  results  of  these  composite  membranes  are  shown  in  Fig. S5. The Li+ conductivity of the composite electrolyte  increases  and  the  mechanical  strength  decreases  with  increasing  composite  electrolyte  with  a  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  of  20:1  has  a  low  Li+  conductivity  of  3.0  ×  10−6  S  cm−1  at  30  oC  owing  to  the  crystallization  of  PEO  and  the  low  concentration  of  Li  salt. The membrane with an [EO]/[Li+] ratio of 8:1 showed  an improvement in Li+ conductivity (1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 30  oC,  but  poor  mechanical  strength  compared  to  the  membrane  with  a  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  of  10:1.  Moreover,  a  crystalline  phase  with  a  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  of  6:1  formed  because of the high Li–salt concentration (Fig. S5a). The  peak  at  745  cm−1  related  to  the  ion-pairing  in  the  FTIR  spectrum  (Fig.  S6b)  increased  by  10  %  when  the  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  is  increased  from  10:1  to  8:1.  This  result  indicates the excess of LiTFSI exists in an ion–paired form  rather than being disassociated. As a result, the CPE(8:1)– 25LZP  and  the  CPE(10:1)–25LZP  membranes  present  comparable  Li+  conductivity.  Additionally,  the  activation  energy  of  the  composite  electrolyte  decreases  as  the  [EO]/[Li+]  ratio  increases  from  20:1  to  10:1  (Table  S1).  Based on its balance of having good conductivity as well  as  suitable  mechanical  strength  for  battery  fabrication,  the composite polymer electrolyte with [EO]/[Li+] ratio of  10:1 was selected for battery testing.

In  order  to  test  this  hypothesis,  three  composites  (without  inorganic  filler,  with  Al2O3,  and  with  LZP)  having a high concentration of LiTFSI, i.e., [EO]/[Li] ratio  n = 10, were prepared; and their 6Li MAS NMR spectra are  shown  in  Fig.  2(b).  Two  obvious  changes  are  observed.  First, the fraction of the disordered Li+ environment (left  peak)  has  notably  increased.  Second,  narrower  line– shapes are formed in P(EO)10–LiTFSI and P(EO)10–LiTFSI– 15Al2O3  composites  compared  to  the  composites  with  an  [EO]/[Li] ratio n = 13. The left peak increases in P(EO)10– LiTFSI with no fillers by 6 % of the total integral over the  composite  with  no  filler  and  an  [EO]/[Li]  ratio  n  =  13,  suggesting  the  tendency  to  form  a  disordered  Li+  environment  increases  with  the  concentration  of  LiTFSI.  This trend of an increased percentage of total integral for  disordered  Li+  environments  is  retained  after  Al2O3  is  added (12.1 % increase). The disordered Li+ environments  amount for 60.2 % of the total integral when LZP serves  as  the  inorganic  filler  in  P(EO)10–LiTFSI.  The  6Li  MAS  NMR spectrum of the CPE-25LZP with a [EO]/[Li+] ratio n  = 8 is shown in Fig. S6a; the higher dose of LiTFSI results  in  a  higher  fraction  of  Li+  in  the  more  mobile  A2  environment  (Fig.  S6a).  Approximate  18  %  more  Li+  is observed  in  A2  for  the  CPE(10:1)–25LZP  and  CPE(8:1)– 25LZP  membranes  than  the  CPE(13:1)–25LZP.  Thus,  the  improvement  in  Li+  conductivity  (Fig.  S5b)  for  both  the  CPE(10:1)–25LZP and CPE(8:1)–25LZP is attributed to the  higher Li+ population of A2. The shorter 7Li T1 time (Table  S2) of the composite electrolytes with a [EO]/[Li+] ratio n  = 8 and n = 10 than that of the composite electrolyte with  a [EO]/[Li+] ratio n = 13 indicates that Li+ motion is faster  if  more  LiTFSI  is  present.  These  results  reconcile  the  observed  narrower  line–shape  with  the  improvement  in  Li+ conductivity.

Based  on  the  difference  in  chemical  shifts  between  A1  and A2 environments as well as published results,41,42 Li+  in A1 can be viewed as solvated Li+, which is spatially close  to HEO in the −CH2CH2− carbon chain in PEO. Li+ in A2,  however,  is  presumably  linked  to  a  less  restricted,  i.e.,  weaker  Columbic  interaction,  space  that  promotes  a  higher  degree  of  freedom  for  dissociated  Li+  to  move.  Therefore,  a  further  Li+−HEO  distance  is  expected  in  A2.  This  assumption  1H−6Li  cross−polarization  (CP),  which  explores  the  strength  of  1H−6Li dipolar coupling that is dependent on the distance  between  two  nuclei.  In  addition,  variable−temperature  (−30 to 80 °C) 7Li NMR can offer another insight into ion  dynamics  by  detecting  the  change  in  line−shape.  This  information  which  Li+−environment  is  the  contributing  factor  to  increasing  the  overall  ionic  conductivity  in  composite  polymer  electrolytes.  These  proposed  measurements,  which  are  out  of  scope  in  this  work,  can  be  pursued  in  future  research.

The higher Li+ conductivity of CPE–25LZP than that of  CPE agrees well with the higher fraction of the A2 signal,  which may be related to the surface of the LZP particles.  The coordinated unsaturated Li+ on the micro-sized LZP  particle  surface  (Fig.  S7a)  with  an  exposed  (012)  crystal  plane  can  coordinate  with  the  oxygen  of  PEO  to  form  localized  amorphous  regions  in  the  vicinity  of  LZP  particles,  which  reduces  the  association  between  Li+  in  the  polymer  and  the  oxygen  of  PEO.  This  phenomenon  results  lithium  at  the  LZP/polymer  interface  by  breaking  the  weak  transient  Li+–OPEO  bonds  which  adds  a  new  contribution  to  the  overall ionic conductivity of the composite along with the  low activation energy of the NASICON LZP (0.4 eV)43 and  the  transport  channel  in  the  bulk  ceramic  for  fast  Li+  conduction in the (012) plane (Fig. S7b).

The  Li+  transport  pathway  in  the  CPE(10:1)–25LZP  composite  was  determined  with  6Li  →   7Li  tracer– exchange  NMR23  on  a  CPE(10:1)–25LZP  membrane  that  was cycled in a 6Li/CPE(10:1)–25LZP/6Li symmetric cell for  100  h.  Fig.  2(c)  shows  6Li  ions  preferentially  transport  through  the  disordered  Li+  environment  (A2;  the  mobile  Li+)  as  the  6Li  signal  is  enriched  by  6.4  %,  whereas  the  right peak (A1; the Li+ closely bound to EO units in PEO)  decreases  from  39.8  %  to  33.4  %.  When  the  6Li → 7Li  tracer–exchange NMR is performed at 40 oC, the fraction  of mobile Li+ (A2) is further enriched by 6Li. The intensity  variation  between  the  two  6Li  signals  (A1  and  A2)  indicates that the disordered Li+ local environment (A2) is  prone to 6Li–enrichment; thus showing that occupation of  the disordered A2 is beneficial for ionic conductivity. The  6Li MAS NMR spectra were acquired twice in a row within  a  timeframe  of  12  hours.  The  6Li  lineshape  of  both  acquisitions  are  identical  (Fig.  S6c).  This  similarity  in  lineshape  rules  out  the  possibility  of  chemical  exchange  between  A1  and  A2.  More  importantly,  this  result  holds  true  when  the  CPE(10:1)–25LZP  is  polarized  with  biased  potential;  otherwise,  the  intensity  of  A1  and  A2  peaks  would have gradually equalized and merged. As a result,  Li+  does  not  migrate  between  environments  (i.e.,  A1  ↔  A2)  and  the  ion  transport  through  the  membrane  is  primarily  attributed  to  the  movement  of  Li+  in  A2.  Furthermore, the Li+ mobility is sensitive to the fractions  among  all  Li+  environments.  Cycling  P(EO)10–LiTFSI– 25LZP with 6Li metals at 40 oC results in a slight increase  in  7Li T1 time from 0.38 s to 0.43 s, while the  7Li T1 time  (0.40 s) stays almost the same when the 6Li →7Li tracer– exchange is executed at room temperature. 

A symmetric  Li/CPE–25LZP/Li  cell  was  cycled  to  evaluate  the  compatibility  of  the  composite  membrane  with  a  metallic  lithium  anode  and  to  check  whether  the  composite  membrane  can  suppress  lithium–dendrite  formation.  The  impedance  plots  of  the  symmetric  Li/CPE–25LZP/Li cell and the cell after 100 cycles at 40 oC  are  shown  in  Fig.  3(a);  the  Li/CPE–25LZP  interfacial  resistances  before  and  after  cyling  the  cell  were  175  and  208 Ω cm2, respectively. Compared with values found in  the  literature  (Table  S3),  the  small  Li/CPE–25LZP  interfacial  resistance  reduces  the  temperature  necessary  for cycling the cells. The symmetric cell showed a stable  cycling from 0.05 to 0.3 mA cm–2 (Fig. 3c) for 400 h with a  small  overpotential.  The  charge/discharge  curves  of  Li/CPE–25LZP/Li  and  Li/CPE–15Al2O3/Li  at  0.05  and  0.1  mA cm–2 are shown in Fig. S8. Variations in the voltage of  Li/CPE–25LZP/Li  cell  during  charge  and  discharge  were  much  smaller  than  those  of  the  Li/CPE–15Al2O3/Li  cell  because  the  larger  Li+  transference  number  of  the  CPE– 25LZP  membrane  than  that  of  CPE–15Al2O3  reduced  the  concentration  overpotential  during  battery  cycling.  Micron–sized  lithium  particles  formed  on  the  surface  of  lithium  metal  during  charge  (Fig.  3b);  the  symmetric  Li/PEO–LITFSI/Li cell was short–circuited at 0.1 mA cm–2  after  a  short  time  (Fig.  S9).  PEO  is  unstable  against  a  Li-metal  anode;  however,  the  formed  solid  electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing LiF, Li3N, and  Li2CO3  the  Li/PEO  interface.44  The  introduction  of  LZP  increases  the  ability  of  the  polymer  to  suppress  lithium–dendrite  formation  and growth to provide a symmetric cell with a long cycle  life.

The  use  of  NASICON  LiZr2(PO4)3  as  a  filler  in  a  PEO  polymer  composite  electrolyte  has  allowed  for  the  investigation  of  the  Li+  conduction  mechanism  in  this  composite  type  system.  Li+  transfer  within  the  polymer  phase  dominates  the  total  Li+  conductivity  when  the  ceramic  NASICON  particles  are  isolated  within  the  polymer  matrix.  However,  the  interaction  between  the  surface of the LZP particles and the polymer component  of  the  matric  increases  the  Li+  transference  number  and  redistributes  local  environments. A large portion of the Li+ is reallocated to a  disordered  local  environment  (A2)  that  provides  the  Li+  ions  greater  mobility  and  improves  the  conductivity  of  the  polymer  composite  as  a  whole.  Additionally,  the  NASICON  LiZr2(PO4)3  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  in–situ  formation  of  an  interphase  layer  between  the  composite  electrolyte and the lithium metal anode. This interphase  layer  with  components  filler  increases the ability of the lithium metal anode to wet the  composite  electrolyte  and  stabilizes  the  Li/electrolyte  interface, allowing for an all–solid–state Li–metal battery  with  a  low  cycling  temperature.
