Fast sodium ion conducting Na11Sn2PSe12 solid electrolyte was prepared by a mechanochemical method. This is the first tin  based selenide prepared by room temperature ball milling instead of conventional synthesis in a sealed quartz tube under  vacuum. Our approach is safe and easy to scale up. Samples were synthesized systematically using various intervals of ball  milling  and  annealing  time  to  maximise  phase  purity  and  ionic  conductivity.  The  highest  room  temperature  bulk  ionic  conductivity of the mechanochemically synthesized Na11Sn2PSe12 was 1.0 mScm-1 observed for a sample prepared by ball  milling for 15 h followed by 6 h annealing at 550 ˚C. This fast-ion conducting Na11Sn2PSe12 allowed to demonstrate the first  Na-Se all-solid-state batteries Na/Na11Sn2PSe12/C-Se and Na3Sn/Na11Sn2PSe12/C-Se with specific initial discharge capacities  of 430 mAhg-1  or 400 mAh/g, respectively at a current density 0.08 mA⋅cm-2 . The Na3Sn/Na11Sn2PSe12/C-Se battery could  be cycled 500 times with a capacity that decreased gradually to 50 mAhg-1. 

The vast abundance and as a consequence low cost of sodium  along with a standard potential that is almost as low as that of  lithium  is  currently  causing  a  paradigm  change  in  energy  storage  research  from  indiscriminately  focusing  on  Li-based  technologies to considering a wider portfolio of energy storage  chemistries  tailored  to  the  key  performance  requirements  of  specific  applications.  Sodium-based  batteries  are  thereby  receiving  increasing  attention  for  low  cost  stationary  grid  support  to  render  high  quality  sustainable  power  grids  based  on renewable energy sources economically viable. At the same  time  sodium-based  batteries  are  also  attractive  for  portable  applications  where  low  cost  or  volumetric  (rather  than  gravimetric) energy density are of major concern.     At the same time the use of organic flammable electrolytes  in  Li-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  leads  to  serious  safety  hazards  that  become  the  more  imminent  with  the  scale-up  of  energy  storage  systems.  While  in  terms  of  chemical  stabilities  a  number  of  ion-conducting  oxides  such  as  doped  garnets,1,2  perovskites,3  NaSICONS,4,5,6  LiSICONs7  may  appear  attractive,  they are often difficult to process into dense ceramics and as a  consequence  grain  boundaries  or  side  reactions  at  accessible  surfaces limit the practical performance.8  

Preparation and characterisation of electrolyte  The  solid  electrolyte,  Na11Sn2PSe12,  was  prepared  by  ball  milling.  As  precursors  we  used  Na  (Aldrich,  99.9%),  Sn  (Aldrich), red P (Cerac, 99%) and Se (Cerac, 100%). Due to the  highly  reactive  nature  of  this  precursor  mixture  the  amounts  used  should  be  limited  in  lab  experiments.  Ball  milling  of  the  samples discussed further below was conducted using a Fritsch  P7 high energy planetary ball mill at 450 rpm for 2h, 5h, 10h or  15h. To this end precursors were transferred under argon into  a 45 ml zirconia vial along with 12 zirconia balls (diameter 10  mm).  The  ball  milled  samples  were  pressed  under  argon  into  pellets  and  kept  in  alumina  crucibles  covered  by  a  lid,  transferred to a vacuum oven and annealed under vacuum for  different annealing times. To understand the effect of time of  annealing the ball milled samples were annealed at 500 ˚C, 550  ˚C  or  600  ˚C  for  3h,  6h,  12h  and  18h  to  optimise  the  crystallinity  and  conductivity  of  the  products.  The  15h  ball  milled sample was annealed at 150 ⁰C, 200 ⁰C, 400 ⁰C, 500 ⁰C,  500 ⁰C, 550 ⁰C and 600 ⁰C for 6 h.  


The annealed samples were characterized by X-ray powder  diffractometry using Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical X’Pert PRO).  XRD  data  were  collected  in  the  2θ°  range  10-90°  with  a  nominal scan rate of 120 s step-1 and a step size of 0.019° at  room temperature for all samples. To investigate the variation  of  temperature  dependent  X-Ray  data  was  collected  for  a  precursor  mixture  that had been ball milled for 10h followed by annealing at 550  ˚C for 6h in the temperature range of 50 ˚C to 400 ˚C at 50 ˚C  interval.  Annealing  and  XRD  data  collection  was  done  under  vacuum.  Rietveld  refinements  of  XRD  powder  patterns  were  performed  with  the  Generalized  Structure  Analysis  System  (GSAS) along with the graphical user interface EXPGUI.  

Room temperature ionic conductivity measurements of all  the prepared solid electrolytes were carried out by impedance  spectroscopy  the  frequency  range  of  1  Hz  to  15  MHz  using  indium  plates  as  electrodes. The samples were transferred into a Swagelok cell  in an argon filled glove box. The Nyquist plots (Z′ vs.−Z″) were  derived and analysed using Z plot and Z view software (Version  2.2,  Scribner  Associates  Inc.,  USA).  Differential  scanning  calorimetry (DSC) of the samples ball-milled for 10 h, 15 h as  well as the 15 ball milled sample after annealing at 550˚C were  collected  in  the  temperature  range  of  40  ˚C  to  600  ˚C  at  5  Kmin-1  heating  rate  under  air.  The  DSC  cells  were  crimped  in  argon filled glove box.  

Mechanochemical synthesis and characterisation of electrolyte  XRD patterns of electrolyte ball milled for 2 h, 5 h, 10 h and 15  h  ball  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  All  the  ball-milled  samples  indicated  the  formation  of  targeted  Na11Sn2PSe12  with  space  group  I41/acd  along  with  various  percentages  of  cubic  Na2Se  (S.G. Fm-3m) before heat treatment. Sample balls milled for 2h  and 5h  also  contain  a significant fraction of X-ray  amorphous  phase(s) in addition to the targeted crystalline compound. XRD  of  the  10h  and  15  h  ball-milled  samples  indicate  a  reduced  fraction (and different nature) of amorphous phase.
