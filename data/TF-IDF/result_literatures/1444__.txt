Trivalent cation conduction has been successfully demonstrated by two strategies. One is crystal structure selection, and the other is the selection of the constituent ions in solids. Since the trivalent cations possess certain ionic volume, a suitable mobile ion pathway should appear in the structure. One candidate structure we selected is a two-dimensional layered structure and the other is a three-dimensional network crystal structure. The selection of the constituent ions in solids is performed by considering the electrostatic interaction between cations and anions in the structure.

It has been long known that the mobile species in solids is electrons or holes as can be easily seen in metals and semiconductors. In contrast, there are unique solids in which the mobile species are only ions and these are called ionic conducting solids (Solid electrolytes).

As early as the end of the 19th century, the relationship between electric current and chemical change in solids was found to obey Faraday’s law.1 Stabilized zirconia, one of the most well-known solid electrolytes (ionic conducting solids), was ﬁrst realized as a light source in 1897, by the application of resistive-heating, and was known as a Nernst glower (Here, zirconia means zirconium dioxide and “stabilized” indicates the high-temperature phase is stabilized by replacing that tetravalent zirconium ion site with aliovalent cation.). Nernst was the inventor of the glower and he suggested that the electric current in the device came by the ﬂow of oxide anions in stabilized zirconia. At present, stabilized zirconia has been widely applied as a component of oxygen sensors. A more comprehensive understanding of electrical conduction in such ionic conducting solids was devoloped in a thesis by Wagner in 1943.

In the course of research on solid electrolytes, there are three outstanding representative milestones. First is the extraordinary high ion conductivity found in silver iodide (AgI) by Tubandt et al. in 1921.3 The Ag+ ion conductivity in the ¡-phase that forms at temperatures higher than 149 °C approaches that of molten salts and the ion conductivity exceeds the conductivity of aqueous NaCl solution at room temperature. Second is ¢-alumina (Na2O¢11Al2O3) possessing layered structure with Na+ ion conduction appearing between the layers. Third is the development of NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductors; Na1+xZr2P3¹xSixO12), which was designed and prepared by Goodenough et al. in 1976 in order to obtain high ionic conduction in solids.4 NASICON is formed by tetrahedral SiO4 and PO4, and also hexagonal ZrO6 polyhedra, by linking the oxide ions to form three-dimensional network structure, which is suitable for ion migration.

As can be seen in the chronology of solid-state ionics described above, the mobile ion species are mainly monovalent or divalent ions and it is clear that the ion conduction in solids mainly depends on the valence of the conducting ionic species. In the case of trivalent or higher valent ions, they have been long believed to be extremely poor migrants in solids due to high electrostatic interaction between the conducting ion and the counter ion species in the solids. Therefore, the migrating ion species in solids was believed to be limited to certain monoand divalent ions until 1995.

By consideration of the following three key issues, multivalent ion conduction in solids has been realized.

1) Substitute trivalent cation sites partially with tetra-, penta-, and/or hexavalent cations: Since electrostatic interaction depends on the constituent elements, is expected to reduce the interaction between trivalent cation and the constituent counter anion such as oxide anion, by partially replacing the trivalent sites with tetra-, penta-, or hexavalent cations. By reduction of interaction, trivalent cations are able to migrate more smoothly than before substitution (In the case of alumina (Al2O3), composed of trivalent aluminum cations and oxide anions, the cations and the anions strongly bind by electrostatic interaction, hence the trivalent aluminum ions cannot migrate in the solid at all.).

2) Select structures where bulky multivalent cations can migrate inside the crystal structure: One is layered twodimensional structures such as ¢-alumina and the other is threedimensional network structures, like NASICON as described above.

3) Avoid the inclusion of monoor divalent cations in solids: It is essential to carry out experiments that rigorously exclude monoor divalent cations when trivalent cations are the target ion species for migration. Crucibles, mortars, and boats used for the syntheses, and also the ceramic tubes for preparation should be used only for the trivalent ion conducting solid preparation. If monoor divalent cations are included by chance, the monoor divalent cations will appear in solids and will conduct.

By strictly obeying the above issues, multivalentconduction in solids has been systematically accomplished.

The tungstates, M2(WO4)3, which show trivalent cation conducting behavior, are known to possess two crystal structures depending on the trivalent cation size, as depicted in Figure 1.67 One is an orthorhombic Sc2(WO4)3 structure, and is a Eu2(WO4)3-type structure with monoclinic the other symmetry. The Sc2(WO4)3-type is accepted as a quasi-layered structure with a large space between the layers where M3+ ions can migrate, as shown in Figure 2a. In this structure, hexavalent tungsten ion (W6+) binds to four oxide anions to 2¹ tetrahedral unit, which can eﬀectively form a rigid WO4 reduce the electrostatic interaction between M3+ and O2¹, and thereby allows M3+ ion to diﬀuse in the structure. Although the Eu2(WO4)3-type solid contains W6+, the trivalent cation in the structure is surrounded by 8O2¹ (M3+ in the Sc2(WO4)3-type lattice has 6-fold coordination); M3+ cation migration is hampered because of the stronger electrostatic interaction with oxide anions (Figure 2b) compared with the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure.

Figure 3 presents the electrical conductivities at 600 °C and activation energies for M3+ ion conduction in M2(WO4)3 with the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure.12 Both the M3+ ion conductivity and the activation energy of M2(WO4)3 drastically change with the variation of ionic radius and Sc2(WO4)3 exhibits the highest conductivity and the lowest activation energy among the M2(WO4)3 series. In solids with trivalent M3+ ions larger than Sc3+, the conductivity decreases due to the comparative shrinkage of the conducting pathway. On the other hand, for Al3+ which has a smaller ionic radius (0.0675 nm)68 than Sc3+ (0.0885 nm),68 the conductivity is also lower, presumably due to the larger decrease in volume of the migrating trivalent ion (from Sc3+ to Al3+) compared with that of the crystal lattice (from Sc2(WO4)3 crystal to Al2(WO4)3 crystal).

Trivalent M3+ cation conduction in the Sc2(WO4)3-type solids was clearly demonstrated by measurements of the electrical conductivity under various oxygen pressure, polarization measurement, and DC electrolysis. From these measurements, it was clariﬁed that the ion transference number (tion) was higher than 0.99. Furthermore, for Sc2(WO4)3, EMF measurements of the O2 concentration cell using Sc2(WO4)3 were also conducted at various temperatures; the measured EMF was very close to the theoretical value calculated from the Nernst equation, which indicates that tion in the Sc2(WO4)3 solid was estimated to be unity. Details are described in Ref. 12.

For the purpose of identifying the mobile cationic species in Sc2(WO4)3, DC electrolysis was conducted by applying a DC voltage of 10 V, which is higher than the decomposition voltage of Sc2(WO4)3 (ca. 1.2 V) with Pt ion-blocking electrodes. Figure 4 depicts the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cathodic and anodic surfaces, and the results of the EPMA line analysis for the Sc2(WO4)3 solid electrolyte after the electrolysis. Needle-shaped crystallites where Sc content was 9 times higher than in the bulk Sc2(WO4)3 were these were identiﬁed as observed at Sc6WO12 by micro-area X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD). On the other hand, the anodic surface change to yellow and plateshape WO3 was detected. These results clearly indicate that the following reaction occurred during the DC electrolysis, implying the macroscopic migration of Sc3+:
ðAnodic surfaceÞ Sc2ðWO4Þ3! 2Sc3þ þ 3WO3 þ ð3=2ÞO2 þ 6e  migrates to cathodic direction ½inside the sample: Sc3þ ðCathodic surfaceÞ 2Sc3þ þ 6e  ! 2Sc.

The detail trivalent Al3+ ion transport in Al2(WO4)3 with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure was also investigated using a large single crystal (15 mm in diameter and up to 35 mm in length) grown by a modiﬁed Czochralski (CZ) method (Figure 5).13 Since the Al2(WO4)3 has orthorhombic symmetry in which the Al3+ sites in the solid are ordered along the b axis, the ion conductivity behavior is considered to be anisotropic (Figure 6). From a crystallographic point of view, Al3+ ion should migrate easily in the b axis direction in the solid. It was found that the highest ion conductivity was obtained along the b axis, while the conductivity along the c axis was approximately two orders of magnitude lower as depicted in Figure 7. To clarify the relationship between trivalent cation conductivity and the lattice volume of the tungstate, various solid solutions with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure have also been extensively investigated. Figure 8 shows the electrical conductivities of (1 ¹ x)Sc2(WO4)3­xR2(WO4)3 (R = Gd10 and the Sc­Lu system, discontinuity in Lu18) at 600 °C. For conductivity is recognized between x = 0.5 and 0.6. From DC electrolysis, it was clearly demonstrated that the predominant charge carriers changed from Sc3+ at x < 0.5 to Lu3+ at higher x (x > 0.6). On the other hand, the electrical conductivity of the Gd-containing system drastically decreased at around x = 0.7.

This decrease occurs because of the structural change from conductive Sc2(WO4)3-type to the insulating Eu2(WO4)3-type structure.

Trivalent cation conduction in molybdates with the same Sc2(WO4)3-type structure, M2(MoO4)3, was also investigated. The trivalent M3+ ion conductivity in molybdates was higher than that in tungstates (Figure 9) because of the smaller ionic radius of Mo6+ (0.055 nm)68 than that of W6+ (0.056 nm),68 resulting in smaller volume of the corresponding lattice suitable for trivalent ion conduction in the structure. Also, the strong bonding by the reduction of the bond distance between Mo6+ and O2¹ contributes to the reduction of electrostatic interaction between M3+ and surrounding O2¹. Although the M2(MoO4)3 solids were also demonstrated to be M3+ ion conductors by DC electrolysis, molybdates tend to be easily reduced compared with tungstates; e.g., Sc2(WO4)3 is still stable even at PO2 of 10¹17 Pa, while Sc2(MoO4)3 is already reduced at PO2 = 10¹13 Pa at 700 °C (Figure 10). Note that the increase in conductivity at low PO2 indicates an appearance of electronic conduction caused by the reduction of Mo6+.

In the case of DC electrolysis of M2(MoO4)3, the following reactions should occur.

ð6Þ ð7Þ temperatures above 750 °C where MoO3 vaporizes in At ambient atmosphere, DC electrolysis can be continued due to the anodic surface, the appearance of fresh M2(MoO4)3 at which is quite diﬀerent from tungstates; tungsten oxide (WO3) always remains at the anodic surface during DC electrolysis, resulting in increasing electrical resistance of the sample. This unique behavior implies that continuous M2O3 formation can be realized at the cathodic surface. Furthermore, since we have demonstrated that Al2O3 deposited at the cathodic surface by the DC electrolysis of Al2(MoO4)3 is a single crystal form, we proposed a novel technique for growing Al2O3 single crystals by using the DC electrolysis of the Al3+ ion conducting Al2(MoO4)3 solid electrolyte.57,58,62

Figure 11 shows the SEM image of the cathodic surface of an Al2(MoO4)3 pellet after DC electrolysis by applying 11 V for 3 days at 900 °C.58 The selected area electron diﬀraction (SAED) pattern of a particle appearing at the cathodic surface is also inserted. The cathodic surface was covered with welldeﬁned polyhedral particles (1.0­5.0 ¯m) and they were identiﬁed to be ¤-Al2O3 from the SAED pattern. While Al2O3 has various metastable phases such as £, ¤, and ª, in addition to the thermodynamically stable ¡-Al2O3, is signiﬁcantly diﬃcult to grow each phase of single crystal by conventional techniques because the formation temperature  range of these metastable phases is very close and the intermediate phase formed depends on the particle sizes. In contrast, since the DC electrolysis method we applied can easily control the particle size by simply adjusting the electrolysis conditions, especially the operating temperature the ¤-Al2O3 single crystal was and the voltage applied, obtained for the ﬁrst time.

We also applied the same DC electrolysis method to Tb2(MoO4)3 solid to grow single crystals of terbium oxide. Although terbium oxide (TbO2¹x) has various nonstoichiometric compositions such as Tb7O12, Tb11O20, Tb16O30, Tb24O44, and Tb48O88, we have succeeded in growing a single phase of Tb16O30 (11 V, 900 °C)60 and Tb24O44 (3 V, 900 °C)64 by adjusting the electrolysis conditions. Furthermore, this single crystal growth by DC electrolysis of M2(MoO4)3 is also useful for other M2O3 solids with extremely high melting points, because the electrolysis can be carried out at moderate temperatures below 1000 °C. For Sc2O3 (mp: 2550 °C) and In2O3 (mp: 2000 °C), we successfully obtained a ﬁne single crystal particle at as low as 950 (Sc2O3)54 and 750 °C (In2O3),56 respectively.

NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor) is a highly Na+ conducting solid electrolyte as stated in the Introduction section, which was artiﬁcially designed by Goodenough et al. in 1976.4 Its structure has a three-dimensional network, where PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra are linked by shared oxygen, and various solid electrolytes with the NASICON-type structure have been developed. Although Talbi et al. reported that Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (Ln: lanthanoids) (The crystal structure is illustrated in Figure 12.) with the NASICON-type structure could be prepared by a sol­gel method in 1994,84 Ln3+ cations in these solids are limited to several lanthanoids and their ionic conductivity has not been investigated at all. In 1999, we successfully prepared Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 with NASICON-type structure and investigated the Sc3+ transport.

In our previous studies on the M3+ ion conduction in it became clear that high trivalent cation conduction was realized by strictly controlling the lattice volume. Therefore, we introduced the concept of the mobile ion size/crystal lattice size ratio (Vion/Vlattice: hereafter, we denote as A-ratio.) in order to optimize diﬀusion pathway size.71 By investigating the A-ratio in R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R= Sc, Eu, Gd, Er, and Lu), it was found that the A-ratio monotonically decreased with decreasing R3+ radius, indicating that the R3+ conduction pathway expanded in this order. Since the electrostatic interaction depends on the distance between ions and their valences, the electrostatic interaction between the trivalent cation and surrounding oxide anions is stronger compared to lower valence cation if the distance Mn+­O2¹ is the same. Therefore, for higher valence R3+, it is important to enlarge the relative crystal lattice size to mobile R3+ size in order to reduce the interaction, and a high conductivity is expected for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 in the R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 series. Figure 13 illustrates the A-ratio dependence of the electrical conductivity in R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared by a sol­gel method at 600 °C.47 As expected, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 shows the highest conductivity; the DC electrolysis demonstrated Sc3+ ion transport in Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, similar to Sc2(WO4)3.

The Al3+ ion is considered to be a more suitable trivalent cation species in NASICON-type phases because of the smaller ionic radius of Al3+ (0.0675 nm)68 than Sc3+ (0.0885 nm),68expecting a smaller A-ratio for Al1/3Zr2(PO4)3. However, the Al1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid cannot be obtained due to stereological limitations. In order to realize the formation of NASICON-type structure with the target Al3+ ion, smaller lattice size is required for the solid. In 2002, we prepared (AlxZr1¹x)4/(4¹x)Nb(PO4)3 solids75 in which the NASICON-type lattice was successfully shrunk by partially substituting the Zr4+ (0.086 nm)68 sites with smaller pentavalent Nb5+ (0.078 nm).68 In addition, the higher valence state of Nb5+ than Zr4+ leads to eﬀective reduction of electrostatic interaction between Al3+ ions and O2¹ anions and also contributes to the enhancement of the bonding between Nb5+ and O2¹, resulting in the improvement of the thermal stability (even at 1200 °C) of the (AlxZr1¹x)4/(4¹x)Nb(PO4)3 solids. Among the (AlxZr1¹x)4/(4¹x)Nb(PO4)3 series, only samples with x ¯ 0.2 could form a single phase with the NASICON-type structure; the highest Al3+ ion conductivity was obtained for the solubility limit composition of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3. Figure 14 displays the trivalent Al3+ ion conductivity of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 solid and the corresponding data for Al2(WO4)3 and Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3. The trivalent ionic conductivity (4.5 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 600 °C) of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 is two orders of magnitude higher than that of Al2(WO4)3; its value reaches the practical application range of · >10¹4 S cm¹1 (shaded area in Figure 14).

This suggests that there is a suitable crystal lattice size for each trivalent cation species and the crystal lattice can be obtained by the partial replacement of constituent ions in the NASICON-type compounds. The suitable sizes for rare earth ion conduction were also extensively investigated for (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 by introducing an A-ratio similar to those for the R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 series.83 Figure 15 shows R3+ ionic radius dependence of the A-ratio for the (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 series. The A-ratios monotonically decrease with reducing the trivalent ionic radius, and the values are almost the same as those for R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 which is depicted as a dashed line in the same ﬁgure, indicating that similar lattice volume change occurs for both series by changing the R3+ ionic size. These phenomena appear by the countervailing eﬀect of the lattice shrinkage by substituting the Zr4+ (0.086 nm; 6coordinate)68 site with smaller Nb5+ (0.078 nm; 6-coordinate)68 in the solids and the lattice expansion due to the decrease of R­O bonding that is caused by the reduction of R3+ cation concentration. Figure 16 depicts the A-ratio dependencies of the trivalent R3+ conductivity at 600 °C and the activation energy for R3+ migration in (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 and R1/3Zr2(PO4)3. Since the (Dy0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 solid possesses both the highest ion conductivity and the lowest activation energy in the (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 series, the Dy3+ ion is in such a circumstance to migrate most smoothly in solids. This also supports the idea that the optimum ion conducting pathway in the (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 series was obtained for R = Dy. Although in the case for R1/3Zr2(PO4)3, the highest trivalent ion conductivity was obtained for the smallest Sc3+ due to the small bottleneck which is caused by the strong R­O bonding in the structure, R­O bonding in the (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 solids should be weakened by introducing the pentavalent Nb5+ into the structure. As a result, a suitable lattice size for R3+ migration was successfully obtained for R = Dy in the (R0.05Zr0.95)80/79Nb(PO4)3 series, whose ionic radius is larger than Sc3+.

We have been investigating trivalent cation conduction in since 1995, and have successfully rigid crystal developed various trivalent cation conducting solid electrolytes from the above-mentioned strategies.

For Sc2(WO4)3-type solids with quasi-layered two-dimensional structure, we have successfully demonstrated trivalent cation conduction in solid for the ﬁrst time, and anisotropic ion migration behavior has also been demonstrated by using an Al2(WO4)3 single crystal which was grown by a modiﬁed Czochralski method. Furthermore, we have also successfully grown single crystals of ¤-Al2O3, nonstoichiometric TbO2¹x, and high-melting compounds of Sc2O3 and In2O3 by a novel DC electrolysis method under moderate conditions. These phenomena explicitly indicate the macroscopic trivalent ion migration in the solids.

For the three-dimensional NASICON-type solids, we have clearly demonstrated the relationship between the trivalent R3+ ion conductivity and the lattice volume of the NASICON-type structure by introducing the concept of A-ratio (Vion/Vlattice). In the NASICON-type trivalent cation conductors, we have succeeded in developing the Al3+ ion conducting solid, (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3, whose trivalent Al3+ ion conductivity enters a practically applicable range of >10¹4 S cm¹1 above 600 °C.

From our continuous investigations on trivalent cation conducting solids, at present, it is clariﬁed that 18 trivalent cations join the migrating ion group in solids in addition to the well-known monoand divalent ions (highlighted in Figure 17).

M2(WO4)3 (M = Al, In, Sc, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. A stoichiometric amount of Al(OH)3 or R2O3 (R = Sc, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) and WO3 was mixed in a mortar and the mixture was calcined at 1000 °C for 12 h in air. Then, the sample was calcined repeatedly at 1200­1400 °C for 12 h in air until a single phase of the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure was obtained. The resulting powder was made into pellets and sintered at 1200­1400 °C for 12 h in air. For the heavy rare earths, Er­Lu, the sample powders were dried in vacuum at 100­150 °C before sintering due to their hygroscopic nature. M2(MoO4)3 (M = Al, In, Sc, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) was synthesized by heating a stoichiometric mixture of Al(OH)3 or R2O3 (R = Sc, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) and MoO3 at 700­1000 °C for 6­12 h in air. The calcined powder was ground and reheated at 800­1100 °C for 12 h in air several times. For the heavy rare earths, Er­Lu, the sample powders were dried before sintering the same as the tungstates.

Single crystals of Al2(WO4)3 were grown from reagent grade Al2O3 and WO3 by the Czochralski method.20 The axis directions and lattice parameters were determined by using a fourcircle single-crystal diﬀractometer. For the electrical conductivity measurements, the single crystals were cut into a cylinder shape with the cylinder axes parallel to a-, b-, and c-axes.

NASICON-type R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R = Sc, Eu, Gd, Er, and Lu) was prepared by a sol­gel method. R2O3 and ZrO(NO3)2¢2H2O were separately dissolved in nitric acid solution (3 M), then the solutions were mixed together. By adding the (NH4)2HPO4 solution (3%) into mixed nitric acid solution, precipitations were obtained. The precipitations were dried 130 °C for 6 h, and then the powders were calcined at 850 °C for 12 h in air. The sample powder obtained was pelletized and sintered at 850 °C for 12 h in air.

(MxZr1¹x)4/(4¹x)Nb(PO4)3 series with NASICON-type structure were obtained by ball milling. Appropriate amount of starting materials, Al(OH)3 or R2O3 (R = Sc, Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, and Lu), ZrO2, Nb2O5, and (NH4)2HPO4, were mixed in an agate mortar at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 6 h. The samples obtained were calcined at 1000 °C for 12 h in air. Then, the sample was calcined at 1000­1300 °C for 12 h in air several times. After grinding the sample obtained, the sample powder was made into pellets and sintered at 1000­1300 °C for 12 h in air.

AC conductivity of samples were measured by complex impedance in various atmospheres with oxygen pressure controlled by using O2, synthetic air, N2, He, and CO­CO2 mixtures. The DC conductivity measurement of the sample was carried out by monitoring the voltage generated by passing a constant current of 0.1 ¯A into the sample.

DC electrolysis (including the single crystal growth by using M2(MoO4)3) of the sample was conducted by applying a DC voltage to the sample which was sandwiched by Pt plate electrodes. The DC voltage applied for the sample was higher than the decomposition voltage of the sample which was directly determined by the preliminary investigation of the I­V relationship. After DC electrolysis, the sample was investigated by XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron probe micro analysis (EPMA).
