The synthesis conditions for variable-composition phase Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4, crystallizing in the nasicon structure type (R3c) were examined. For this phase, the crystallographic parameters were calculated, vibrational spectra were interpreted, and temperature dependence of electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss tangent were examined.

Much interest generated by representatives of oxide phases crystallizing in the nasicon structure type stems from their unique properties: high chemical and thermal stability, low thermal expansion, and high ionic conductivity [1–4]. Their structure is distinguished by a stable skeleton comprised of octahedra and tetrahedra, [R2(EО4)]3p–}∞, where R is the octahedral cation in phosphate, arsenate, molybdate, tungstate, and sulfate systems, with alkali-metal atoms occupying the skeleton voids [1–9 ]. The nasicon structure is distinguished by a large isomorphic capacity with respect to cations of different nature, size, and degree of oxidation, which can, both individually and in combinations, occupy crystallographic sites and cavities in the skeleton [1–3]. Earlier studies [4] were dedicated to phase formation in Na2MoO4–Mg(Ni)MoO4–Cr(Fe)2(MoO4)3 systems and preparation of variable-composition phase Na1–xMg(Ni)1–xCr(Fe)1+x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4–0.5, with conductivity of 10–3–10–2 Ω–1 cm–1. It was found that an increase in the cation radius at octahedral sites causes the mobility of alkali-metal cations in tunnels and large cavities in the structure thereby increasing the conductivity of the phases. Here, we synthesized and carried out X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopic, and electrophysical examinations of the variable-composition phase Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4.

Phase relationships in the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4– Fe2(MoO4)3 system were examined by solid-phase reaction method at temperatures within 450–750°C. The initial system components Na2MoO4, CoMoO4, and Fe2(MoO4)3 were presynthesized by solid-phase technique from Na2CO3, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3· 9H2O, and MoO3. The examination procedure was implemented in two stages. The first stage consisted in X-ray analysis of the phase composition at the intersection points of all the sections existing in the ternary system, which allowed triangulation of the system (Fig. 1). The second stage involved examination of the quasibinary sections identified. Formation of NaCoFe(MoO4)3 ternary molybdate was revealed in the NaFe(MoO4)2–CoMoO4 and Na2+2xCo1–x(MoO4)2–Fe2(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, sections. The variable-composition phase Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4, a NaCoFe(MoO4)3-based subtraction solid solution, is formed in the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4– Fe2(MoO4)3 triangle plane and along the Na2Co(MoO4)2– Fe2(MoO4)3 section. The quasibinary section samples were prepared in 2.5–5 mol% steps, as well as in 1 mol % steps for more precisely determining the composition of the resulting ternary molybdate NaCoFe(MoO4)3 and identifying the homogeneity range for the Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 variable-composition phase. The samples were annealed at 450, 550, 600, 650, and 750°C with multiple regrinding steps (every 20–30 h). Upon calcination for 150–250 h the samples were slowly furnace-cooled. The nonequilibrium samples were additionally annealed. We judged that the system had reached equilibrium, when the phase composition of the samples remained unchanged in two successive annealing steps. The synthesis products were identified by X-ray diffraction analysis techniques. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were taken in a FR-552 monochromator camera (CuKα radiation, internal standard Ge). These powder diffraction patterns were measured with the use of an IZA-2 comparator. The diffraction patterns were processed using Rentgen standard program package (Table 1). The vibrational spectra of polycrystalline Na1–xCo1–x· Fe1+x(MoO4)3 samples were recorded on Bruker FT-IR and Specord M-80 spectrometers (1.06 nm wavelength of near-infrared laser excitation; reflection scattering geometry; resolution 3–5 cm–1). The samples were prepared as Nujol suspensions on polyethylene substrates and as KBr pellets. The molybdenum isotopesubstituted samples were obtained with the use of 92MoO3 and 100MoO3. The vibrational frequencies are listed in Tables 2, 3. Differential thermal analysis was carried out on an OD-103 MOM derivatograph (heating rate 10 deg min–1, weighed portion 0.3–0.4 g). The temperature dependence of conductivity σ, dielectric permittivity ε, and dielectric loss tangent tan δ was examined by the Vest–Tallan polarization technique [6] on densely sintered ceramic samples (1– 1.5-mm-thick pellets; diameter 10 mm) with platinum electrodes. The electrophysical properties were measured (accurately to within 5%) with an E8-4 alternating current bridge at a frequency of 103 Hz, balanced with an R-5025 capacitance box. Direct current was measured with an E6-13A teraommeter with the voltage set at 30–50 mV. The reproducibility of the measured data was controlled in the heating and cooling mode at temperatures within 20–600°C. The temperature of the samples during the electrophysical examinations was measured accurately to within 2°C using a chromel-alumel thermocouple and a V7-21A voltmeter. Study of the phase relationships in the subsolidus region of the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3 system revealed formation of a new ternary molybdate NaCoFe(MoO4)3 in CoMoO4–NaFe(MoO4)2 and Na2+2xCo1–x(MoO4)2–Fe2(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, sections at 500–550°С. A variable-composition phase Na1–xCo1–x· Fe1+x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4, was formed in the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3 triangle plane and along the NaCoFe(MoO4)3–Fe2(MoO4)3 section. This phase is a subtraction solid solution based on NaCoFe (MoO4)3 ternary molybdate. Along with the variablecomposition phase, at temperatures within 580–650°C we revealed NaCo3Fe(MoO4)5 ternary molybdate in the NaFe(MoO4)2–CoMoO4 section (1 : 3 ratio). Singlephase Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 samples belonging to the nasicon structure type (R3c¯, Z = 6) were formed at 600°C and calcination time of 140–160 h; NaCo3· Fe(MoO4)5 ternary molybdate crystallizing in triclinic syngony (P1¯, Z = 2) was synthesized as a single-phase product at 650°C and annealing time of 200 h. The unit cell parameters of NaCo3Fe(MoO4)5 are as follows: a = 6.938(2), b = 17.573(5), c = 6.851(1) Å; α = 87.94(2)°, β = 101.46(2)°, γ = 92.29(2)°. The Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 and NaCo3Fe(MoO4)5 molybdates melt incongruently at 835 and 870°C, respectively, without polymorphic transformations.

An X-ray diffraction examination of Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x· (MoO4)3 samples showed that they are isostructural with one another and with Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 ternary molybdate (R3c, Z = 6) [2]. The X-ray diffraction patterns of Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 were indexed on the basis of a trigonal unit cell of Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 single crystal. The size of the crystallization field for solid solutions (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) with the nasicon structure is determined by the possibility of isomorphic substitutions in the octahedra. The octahedral sites (M) are randomly filled with Co and Fe atoms and are characterized by iron excess (at x > 0) and cobalt deficiency. Sodium fills the skeleton cavities; its deficiency does not distort the lattice symmetry. These structural features of Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 and the specific cation distribution pattern lead to increased contribution from the Fe–O bonds to the overall electrostatic balance of the structure. Maintaining the balance in the structure requires Na–O bond weakening, which is achieved via sodium deficiency in the skeleton cavities and increase in skeleton size. This causes an increase in the Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 unit cell volume with extension of the homogeneity range (Table 1). The NaCo3Fe(MoO4)5 molybdate is isostructural with NaMg3In(MoO4)5 [4]. The latter has a crystal structure based on a three-dimensional skeleton comprised of МоО4 tetrahedra and Mg(In)O6 octahedra. The closed cavities in the skeleton are occupied with sodium atoms. A prominent feature of this structure is that it contains planar-rectangular units of four octahedra and twinned edge-sharing octahedra. The structure of Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 is a topologic analog of corundum: The Co(Fe) atoms are randomly distributed over two sets of crystallographic sites with octahedral coordination by oxygen on threefold axes (C3 symmetry), and МоО4 groups, on twofold axes (C2 symmetry). Vacant octahedral and tetrahedral voids merge into a three-dimensional network of channels filled with sodium cations (С3i symmetry for the sodium cations). The structure contains isolated distorted tetrahedral MoO42– anion groups, which allows a comparative analysis of the internal vibrations of isolated MoO42– groups and external vibrations, i.e., vibrations of cationic sublattices and MoO4 tetrahedra as a single whole [9]. The 92Mo–100Mo isotope substitution causes an isotope shift of the bands associated with MoO42– vibrations (Tables 2, 3). A relatively low symmetry of the MoO4 tetrahedra suggests degeneracy removal for their double- and triple-degenerate vibrations, as well as the activity of the components of the fully symmetric stretching mode in the IR spectra.

A group-theoretic analysis suggests the following irreducible representations for the factor group of the D3d space group of the crystals: ГNa=A1u(i.a.)+А2u(Raman)+Еu(Raman), ГCo+Fe=A1g+A2g(i.a.)+2Еg(IR)+A1u(i.a.)+А2u(Raman) +2Еu(Raman), ГМо=3A2g(i.a.)+3Еg(IR)+3А2u(Raman)+3Еu(Raman). The Raman spectrum should contain three lines associated with vibrations of Co2+ and Fe3+ cations, and the IR spectrum, two bands due to vibrations of Na+ cations and three bands, to vibrations of Co2+ and Fe3+ cations. Six bands associated with MoO42– vibrations should be observed in the Raman spectrum, and 9 bands, in the IR spectrum. The bands at 986–769 cm–1 (stretching vibrations) and 408–310 cm–1 (bending vibrations), that undergo an isotope shift upon molybdenum isotope substitution and occur in the spectral region characteristic for MoO42– tetrahedra, were assigned to internal vibrations of MoO42– groups. The fully symmetric stretching modes of the molybdate groups, distributed over two sets of crystallographic sites, are degenerate, probably because of close geometries and dynamic characteristics of these polyhedra [4, 9]. The stretching vibration frequencies for the MoO42– groups increase by 20–25 cm–1 with increasing x. This is evidently due to an increase in the Co–O and Fe–O bond energies, associated with formation of an additional (significant) number of vacancies in the cation sublattice. The cation distribution pattern leaves unaffected the shape of the spectrum as a whole but causes relative line broadening. This decreases both the tetrahedral distortion for MoO42– and splitting into components for triple-degenerate stretching vibration mode. In the Raman spectrum, the lines below 300 cm–1 (265–268 cm–1) were assigned to Co2+ and Fe3+ cations, and the band at 192 cm–1, to Fe cations. A low-frequency group of Raman lines at 112–111–87 cm–1 corresponds to vibrations of nickel, because vibrations of the sodium cations are Raman-inactive. In the IR spectra, bands below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to vibrations of the sodium cations. Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of the conductivity for Na1–xCo1–x Fe1+x(MoO4)3, plotted in the Arrhenius equation coordinates log σ–103/Т. The conductivity of the variable-composition phase ranges from 10–8 to 10–2 Ω–1 cm–1; Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 is characterized by predominantly ionic conductivity (ti = 0.71–0.79) (Table 4). Above 300°C, the temperature dependences of conductivity exhibit an inflection, and the conduction activation energy increases probably due to a change from extrinsic to intrinsic conduction mechanism. The extrinsic and intrinsic conduction regions were characterized by the activation energy Еa of 1.05–1.11 and 2.01–2.19 eV, respectively. The conductivity of 10–2 Ω–1 cm–1 characteristic for the sodium phase of Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 with the nasicon structure is associated with sufficiently large voids in the skeleton, which causes significantly decreases in steric hindrance for Na+ transport [7, 8]. The Na+ + Co2+ → Fe3+ + ? heterovalent substitution in the series of solid solutions leads to additional vacancies in the sodium sublattice, which affect the mobility of the sodium cations and electrical conductivity of the phase with x increasing from 0 to 0.4. There exists a correlation between σ and the unit cell volume of the variable-composition phase. At temperatures within 20–600°C the dielectric permittivity varies from 150 to 750, and the dielectric loss tangent, from 2.7 to 15.5 (Fig. 3). The curves have no extrema, which suggests the lack of both phase transitions and ferroelectric properties for Na1–xCo1–x· Fe1+x(MoO4)3. A high ionic conductivity makes the variable-composition phase Na1–xCo1–xFe1+x(MoO4)3 as potential sodium ion conducting solid electrolyte candidate.
