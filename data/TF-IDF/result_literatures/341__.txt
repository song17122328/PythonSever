Phosphates ZnxMg0.5+xE2–x(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr) have been synthesized by the sol-gel method with further thermal treatment and studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe analysis, and IR spectroscopy. It has been established that the ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x(PO4)3 solid solution (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5, space group R ) 3 crystallizes  in  the  NaZr2(PO4)3  structural  type  and  is  stable  up  to  1050°C.  The  structure  of Zn0.2Mg0.7Ti1.8(PO4)3 has been refined. It is based on the framework of PO4 tetrahedra with shared apices and (Mg,Ti)O6 octahedra. The framework cavities accommodate Mg2+ and Zn2+ cations with octahedral oxygen coordination. The ZnxMg0.5 + xZr2 – x(PO4)3 solid solution (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5, space group P21/n) crystallizing in the Sc2(WO4)3 structural type is thermally unstable above 1000°C. The number of bands for the 4PO − stretching and bending vibrations of the   ion in the IR spectra of these orthophosphates agrees with the group factor analysis for space groups R  and P21/n. The thermal expansion of the ZnxMg0.5 + xE2 – x(PO4)3 3 solid solutions has been studied within a temperature range of 25–800°C. The control over the composition of these moderately and highly expansive materials provides the possibility to change the thermal expansion characteristics in the desired direction.


The structural type of sodium dizirconium triphosphate (NASICON, NZP) is of interest in regard to the design of new compounds [1]. Kosnarite KZr2(PO4)3, a natural mineral, belongs to this structural type [2]. The  NZP  family  incorporates  compounds  and  solid solutions,  which  can  be  described  by  the  crystallochemical formula (M1)0 → 1(M2)0 → 3{[L2(PO4)3]p–}3∞, where  {[L2(PO4)3]p–}3∞  is  the  structural  framework (р is the framework charge), and (M1)0 → 1, (M2)0 → 3 are the types of extraframework cation positions with the notation of position occupations in each type [3]. The occupation of the same crystallographic positions by atoms in the oxidation states from +1 to +5 alongside with the broad variations of isoand heterovalent isomorphism  predetermine  the  unique  properties  of these  materials,  i.e.,  their  resistibility  to  thermal shocks, superionic conductivity, and catalytic activity [3–9].

Double phosphates M0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (M is a cation in the oxidation state +2) belong to the NZP structural type, crystallize in orthorhombic system, and cations M populate a half of the extraframework (M1) cavities [10].  Phosphates  M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 with framework zirconium  cations  having  a  greater  size  in  comparison with titanium and large ions M (Cd, Pb, Sr, Ba) in cavities crystallize in an NZP structure and, if ions M are of  smaller  size,  in  a  Sc2(WO4)3  (SW)  structure  [10]. Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  exists  in  the  form  of  SW  and  NZP polymorphs [10].

The  analysis  of  the  literature  data  on  the  phosphates of NZP and SW structural types with cations M only  in  their  framework,  such  as  [M1/3Nb5/3(PO4)3] (M  =  Mg,  Mn,  Co,  Ni,  Cu,  Zn)  [11], Na1 + 2x[MgxZr2 – x(PO4)3]  (0  ≤  x  ≤  1)  [12],  and Na3[MZr(PO4)3]  (M  =  Mn,  Mg)  [13],  has  demonstrated that some framework positions may be populated by relatively small cations, such as Mg, Mn, Co, Ni,  Cu,  or  Zn.  The  attempt  synthesize Na3[ZnZr(PO4)3] has failed [13].


The information about the phosphates containing elements in the oxidation state +2 both in the framework  and  in  the  structural  cavities  are  confined  to M0.5 + E2 – x(PO4)3 solid solutions (M, M' = Mg, Co, Mn, Cd, Ca, Sr, Pb, Ba; E = Ti, Zr) [14]. The nature and size of the cations combined in the framework and the cavities have an effect on the stability of such  phosphates  and  the  change  of  their  structural type. It may be presumed that the NZP structural type is stable, if the framework positions are populated by E4+ and M2+ cations, whose radius is smaller than for Cd2+, and the cavity positions are populated by cations with a radius equal or greater than for cadmium. The SW  structural  type  is  preferable  for  the  phosphates, whose  cavities  accommodate  small  cations,  which slightly differ from the framework-forming cations by their size.

Some  impact  on  the  isomorphic  substitutions  of atoms in the described phosphates is also made by the stereochemistry  of  transitional  elements.  Thus,  the potential crystallochemical relatives of titanium free of d  electrons  in  the  Ti4+  state  may  include  zinc.  The Zn–O  chemical  bonds  in  crystal  structures  have  a covalent character, first of all, due to the spherical zinc d10 configuration, which does not introduce the specifics inherent in the other d states. However, the Zn2+ cation, which has a relatively large radius (0.74 Å), has the trend to tetrahedral coordination in contrast to the octahedral coordination of Ti4+ (which has almost no alternatives) with broad isomorphic relations to Zr4+ [15].

The  objective  of  this  work  was  to  experimentally verify  the  possibility  to  incorporate  zinc  into  the framework and extraframework crystallographic positions of phosphates described by the general formula ZnxMg0.5 + xE2 – x(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr), study the formation of their phases, elucidate the concentrational and thermal stability fields of expected solid solutions, and to determine the thermal expansion parameters.


ZnxMg0.5 + xE2 – x(PO4)3 samples (E = Ti, Zr) with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 were synthesized by the sol–gel methods with further thermal  treatment.  The  initial  reagents  for  synthesis were  chemicals  of  chemically  pure  grade,  namely, MgO, ZnO, and TiOCl2  (synthesized  from  TiCl3  by oxidation in the air with a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids), ZrOCl2 · 8H2O, and H3PO4. The stoichiometric  amounts  of  zinc  and  magnesium  oxides dissolved in hydrochloric acid and a 1 M titanium or zirconium  oxychloride  aqueous  solution  were  mixed together at room temperature. Afterwards, an orthophosphoric  acid  solution  taken  also  in  compliance with the stoichiometry was added under stirring. The reaction mixtures were dried at 90°C and heat treated in air at 600–1100°C for 24 h at each stage. Stagewise heating was alternated with dispersion to homogenize the  mixtures.  The  synthesized  samples  represented white polycrystalline powders.

The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  these  samples were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å, range of angles 2θ = 10°–60°). X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine the phase composition of the samples in the process of their synthesis after each isothermic calcination stage. The X-ray diffraction patterns were indexed by the method of structural analogy using the crystallographic data for the compounds described in the literature.  The  unit  cell  parameters  of  the  synthesized phosphates were refined by the least-squares technique. The errors of estimating the parameters were less than Δ a = ±0.006 Å, Δ b = ±0.004 Å, Δ c = ±0.006 Å, and Δβ = ±0.04°.


The chemical composition and homogeneity of the samples were monitored on a JEOL JSM-7600F scanning electron microscope equipped with a field-emission  electron  gun  (Schottky  cathode)  with  a  spatial resolution  of  up  to  1  nm.  The  microscope  was equipped with a microanalysis system, i.e., a Premium OXFORD X-Max 80 energy-dispersive spectrometer with a semiconductor silicon drift detector with nitrogen-free cooling. X-ray of Zn0.2Mg0.7Ti1.8(PO4)3 (x = 0.2) for the structural study was recorded within the range 2θ = 10°–110° with a scan step of 0.02° and an exposure of 15 s per point. The processing of the X-ray diffraction pattern and the refinement of the phosphate structure were performed by  the  Rietveld  method  [16]  using  the  RIETAN-97 software [17]. The profiles of peaks were approximate by the modified pseudo-Voigt function (Mod-TCH pV [18]).  The  basic  model  used  to  refine  the  crystal structure of phosphate was the atomic coordinates of NaGeTi(PO4)3 [19]. 

The  functional  composition  of  samples  was  confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The IR absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S Fouriertransform  IR  spectrometer  within  a  wavenumber range of 400–1400 cm–1.

High-temperature  experiments  were  performed within the range 25–800°C using a Shimadzu HA-1001 attachment.  The  heating  rate  was  10  K/min.  Before recording, the sample was allowed to stand at the specified temperature for 10 min.



When  the  phase  formation  processes  in  the ZnxMg0.5 + xE2 – x(PO4)3  systems  were  studied,  the samples  were  subjected  to  isothermal  calcination  at 600, 800, 900, 1000, 1050, and 1100°C in the process of their synthesis. The exposure time at each temperature was 24 h. At the end of each calcination stage, a part  of  the  sample  was  air-quenched  and  analyzed.

The remaining part was heated further, and this procedure  was  performed  throughout  the  entire  period  of stagewise calcination.

In  the  ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x(PO4)3  system,  a  limited solid solution is formed within the composition range 0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5. Single-phase products with an NZP structure crystallize at 800°C.

The effect of the temperature on the formation of the Zn0.5Mg1.0Ti1.5(PO4)3 phase (x = 0.5) is illustrated in Fig. 1. At 600°C, X-ray diffraction detects a mixture of  phases,  such  as  the  target  product,  Mg2P2O7, ZnP4O11,  and  Mg3(PO4)2.  When  the  temperature increases, the content of admixture phases decreases, and the crystallinity of the target phase rises. The triple  phosphate  is  stable  up  to  1050°C,  but  a  further increase in temperature leads to its decomposition.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x (PO4)3  solid  solution  samples  contain  the  intense reflections of NZP phases (Fig. 2). According to electron microscopy data, the samples are homogeneous, and their chemical composition corresponds to theoretical  values  as  confirmed  by  microprobe  analysis. The unit cell parameters of the solid solution samples monotonically  change  with  increasing  x  (Fig.  3).  At х > 0.5, the ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – xP3O12 samples represent mixtures of phases (Fig. 1).

The  IR  spectra  of  the  studied  ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x (PO4)3 samples (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5) have the pattern typical for NZP orthophosphates and space group R  (Fig. 4a). In the IR spectra of phosphates with space group R  the selection  rules  admit  six  bands  of  antisymmetric stretching vibrations νas and six bands of antisymmet-


To confirm the structure of the ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x (PO4)3  solid  solution,  its  structure  (x  =  0.2)  was refined at room temperature by the Rietveld method. The conditions of recording, unit cell parameters, and selected structure refinement data are given in Table 1. The  experimental,  calculated,  stroke,  and  difference X-ray diffraction patterns of Zn0.2Mg0.7Ti1.8(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 5. The atomic coordinates and isotropic thermal  parameters  and  the  basal  atom  populations are listed in Table 2.

A structural fragment of the Zn0.2Mg0.7Ti1.8(PO4)3 phosphate crystallizing in the NZP structural type is shown in Fig. 6. It is based on the {Mg0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3}3∞ framework  built  of  isolated  (Mg,Ti)O6  octahedra linked to PO4 tetrahedra. Each octahedron shares its vertices  with  six  PO4  tetrahedra,  which  in  turn  are bonded to four different octahedra. Two (Mg,Ti) octahedra and three tetrahedra populated by phosphorus atoms  form  a  characteristic  framework  fragment— “lantern”—by sharing their vertices. These groups are linked  into  a  three-dimensional  lattice.  The  framework  cavities  between  the  edges  of  two  octahedra accommodate the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions, which have an octahedral  oxygen  coordination  (Fig.  6).  The Mg(Ti)–O interatomic distances in two independent mixed-type (Mg,Ti)O6 octahedra are within a range of 1.87–1.99  and  1.85–1.99  Å,  whereas  the  average Mg(Ti)–O  distances  in  the  coordination  polyhedra are 1.93 and 1.92 Å. The proportion between the bond lengths and the bond angles in PO4 tetrahedra is typical for this anion. The tetrahedra are distorted, and the

In  the  [MgxZr2 – x(PO4)3]3  structural  framework of the ZnxMg0.5 + xZr2 – x(PO4)3 solid solution, magnesium and zirconium populate the positions with CN = 6, and the extraframework positions are occupied by Zn and Mg with CN = 4. The calculated unit cell parameters monotonically change with increasing content of the cation in the oxidation state +2 in the solid solution (Fig. 9).

P–O bond lengths in the PO4 polyhedra variate within 1.49–1.72  Å.  In  the  extraframework  positions,  the Zn–O and Mg–O distances to the six closest O atoms are 2.32 and 2.42 Å, respectively. The extraframework positions in the ZnxMg0.5 + xTi2 – x(PO4)3 solid solution are populated by zinc cation with increasing x. Moreover,  the  content  of  magnesium  ions  of  greater  size increases  in  the  (Mg,Ti)O6  framework  coordination polyhedra. The arrangement of ZnO6 and (Mg,Ti)O6 coordination polyhedra along unit cell axis c (Fig. 6) leads to the expansion of the structure along this axis and  the  increase  of  the  unit  cell  parameter  с  with increasing x (Fig. 3). In this case, РО4 tetrahedra are distorted. The ОРО interior angle increases along axis с, thus  reducing  the  distance  between  the  parallel  columns and the parameter а.

As  follows  from  the  presented  data,  the  crystallochemical solid solution formula is Mg0.5Znx[MgxTi2 – x(PO4)3]3∞, where [MgxTi2 – x(PO4)3]3∞  is  the  structure framework, in which Mg and Ti populate the positions with  CN  =  6,  and  the  extraframework  positions  are partially filled by Znx and Mg0.5 (CN = 6).

In the ZnxMg0.5 + xZr2 – x(PO4)3 phosphate series, a limited solid solution is formed at 900°C. The analysis of X-ray diffraction patterns for the ZnxMg0.5 + xZr2 – x(PO4)3 samples in the region of compositions 0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5 provided the possibility to establish that they are single phases crystallizing in the Sc2(WO4)3 (SW) structural type (Fig. 7).

The effect of the temperature on the formation of the  Zn0.5Mg1.0Zr1.5(PO4)3  solid  solution  is  illustrated in Fig. 8. At 600°C, X-ray diffraction detects a mixture of  phases,  such  as  the  target  product,  ZrP2O7,  and Zn2Mg(PO4)2. When the temperature grows, the content of admixture phases is decreased, but the crystallinity of the target phase increases. The target product is stable up to 1000°C.


The formation of phases in the ZnxMg0.5 + xE2 – x(PO4)3  systems  (E  =  Ti,  Zr)  has  been  studied.  The Mg0.5Znx[MgxE2 – x(PO4)3] solid solutions (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) with NZP and SW structures have been synthesized.
