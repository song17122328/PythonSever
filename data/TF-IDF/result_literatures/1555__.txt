The family of titanium Nasicon-phosphates of generic formula M0.5IITi2(PO4)3 has been revisited using hydrothermal techniques. Two phases have been synthesized: Mn0.5IITi2(PO4)3 (MnTiP) and Co0.5IITi2(PO4)3 (CoTiP). Single crystal diffraction studies show that they exhibit two different structural types. Mn0.5IITi2(PO4)3 phosphate crystallizes in the R-3 space group, with the cell parameters a = 8.51300(10) Aånd c = 21.0083(3) A˚ (V = 1318.52(3) A˚ 3 and Z = 6). The Co0.5IITi2(PO4)3 phosphate crystallizes in the R-3c space group, with a = 8.4608(9) Aånd c = 21.174(2) A˚ (V = 1312.7(2) A˚ 3 and Z = 6). These two compounds are clearly related to the parent Nasicon-type rhombohedral structure, which can be described using [Ti2(PO4)3] framework composed of two [TiO6] octahedral interlinked via three [PO4] tetrahedra. 31P magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) data are presented as supporting data. Curie–Weiss-type behavior is observed in the magnetic susceptibility. The phases are also characterized by IR spectroscopy and UV–visible.

Orthophosphates remain of great interest since they have found applications in the industrial and scientific fields [1–7]. The great stability of the tetrahedral oxyanions (PO4)3? gives phosphates a remarkable structural diversity in the case of monophosphates (Nasicon, Alluaudite, and Langbeinite). In general, these structures have the same type of framework and different types of cavities for accommodating cations. Physical and chemical properties of all these types of monophosphates depend on their structure resulting from the Coulomb attraction between independent cations and oxyanions. The general formula of Nasicon materials is MxBy(PO4)3, where M can be monovalent cation (Na+, L i+, C u+, . . ..) or bivalent cation (Ca2+, B a2+, C u2+, . . ..) and B is one or more ions in tri-, tetra-, or penta-valent state (Fe3+, C r3+, . . .Ti4+, Z r4+, . . ..Nb5+, S b5+, . . ..). The Nasicon materials are built up of By(PO4)3 units in which two [BO6] octahedra are linked to three [PO4] tetrahedra by shared oxygens. Each [BO6] octahedron is surrounded by six [PO4] tetrahedra forming fragments (so-called lanterns) along the c axis, while [PO4] tetrahedrons are surrounded by four [BO6] octahedra (Fig. 1). The infinite ribbons resulting from this linkage are connected together, perpendicular to the c has a distorted coordination inside and between the ribbons, direction, by [PO4] tetrahedra to form the Nasicon framework. The M+ ions can occupy two positions in the conduction channels: the MI site (one per formula) is coordinated by a trigonal antiprism of oxygens, and the MII site (three per formula) has a distorted coordination inside and between the ribbons, respectively. The crystallographic formula can by written (MI)(MII)3By(PO4)3. During the past few years, particular attention has been paid to combining titanium and divalent 3d transition metals M2+. Most investigations on M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co, Fe, Cu) [8–11] have employed powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) techniques to probe the global structure of the materials using the Rietveld analysis. Consequently, an uncertainty exists about exact symmetry of these materials. For example, Co0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (CoTiP) was investigated by El Bouari et al. [9], the authors suggested the R-3c (no. 167) space group. Five years later, the same authors reinvestigated this orthophosphate using optical and magnetic properties [12]. According to the later study, It turns out that the crystal field parameters calculated from the structure are in fair agreement with the experimental ones and permit the authors to assign instead the space group R32 (No. 155). Barth et al. and Koji Makino et al. [13,14] proposed R-3c (No. 167) as the space group for the magnesium titanium phosphate Mg0.50Ti2(PO4)3. Moreover, in their works on divalent manganese or iron titanium M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Fe) phosphates, istopical to Ca0.50IITi2(PO4)3 [15], Fakrane et al. [8] and Benmokhtar et al. [10] suggested the proposed space group R-3 (No. 148). It has been reported that the synthesis of Nasicon M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 as pure phases is very difficult, especially when performed by solid-state reactions [10,13]. The Nasicon phase can be accompanied by oxyphosphate phase M0.50IITiO(PO4) [16–18] and dissolved TiP2O7, T i O2 rutile [19] and M2P2O7 [18]. Owing to these problems, researchers looked into new compounds, which are pure phosphates and are almost free from the Nasicon problems. Alternative synthetic procedures have been explored to obtain Nasicon as pure phases (single crystals) by chemical transport synthesis [20] and hydrothermal procedures. During the last few years, several methods of synthesis were employed to obtain compounds with the general formula M0.50IITi2(PO4)3. These are solid-state reaction, hydrothermal syntheses, sol–gel reactions and even single crystal growth from a flux. For example Fakrane et al. [8] obtained MnTiP as polycrystalline powder by a solid-state reaction. CoTiP was synthesised as polycrystalline powder using both solid-state and sol gel method by ElBouari et al. [9]. F e0.50IITi2(PO4)3 has successfully been synthesised as polycrystalline powder by an exchange reaction Cu2+/Fe2+ method [10] in sealed quartz tube by Benmokhtar et al. M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Co) were synthesised as single crystals by Glaum et al. via Chemical vapour transport [19,20]. To our knowledge the first hydrothermal syntheses of Nasicon have been reported since the 1990 [21–23]. Since then several studies have been published aimed toward the development of synthetic procedures that would reduce the separation of undesired compounds and produce pure phases with optimal properties. To contribute to a better investigation and characterization of this type of compound, we have undertaken the hydrothermal synthesis of single crystals of titanium Nasicon phosphate M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Fe, Cu) in the system MO–TiO2– H3PO4–H2O, using relatively low concentrations of phosphoric acid under hydrothermal conditions. In this paper we report on the synthesis of M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co), and its characterization by single-crystal X-ray structure refinement, 31P MAS NMR, magnetic susceptibility, UV– visible and infrared spectroscopy.

The title compounds have been prepared using an hydrothermal method as follow: TiCl4 (2 g, 10 mmol) is mixed with 0.55 g of metal [respectively Mn: 10 mmol (MnTiP), Co: 9 mmol (CoTiP)], then H3PO4 (2.456 g, 2.5 mmol) is drop wise added to the clear solution. Finally, H2O2 (7 g, 2.06 mmol) is added as mineralizing agent. The resulting white gel, derived from a composition of TiCl4: metal (Mn, Co): H3PO4: H2O2 in a molar ratio of 0.01: 0.01/0.009: 0.025: 0.206, was homogenized with stirring for 30 min. The final mixture was sealed in autoclave (23 ml) and heated at 250 8C for 20 days, then cooled down to room temperature. Crystals were obtained by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried in air at room temperature. Fig. 2 shows crystals of the phosphates M0.50Ti2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cu) obtained by hydrothermal technique.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were obtained with a Gemini four circle diffractometer manufactured by Oxford Diffraction equipped with an Atlas CCD detector, using graphite a monochromator and Mo Ka radiation (l = 0.71073 A˚ ). The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum at magic angle was performed at room temperature and was recorded with a Bruker DSX 400 spectrometer. The 31P spectrum was taken at a spinning rate of 25,000 Hz using a single pulse sequence. Chemical shifts were determined using 85% H3PO4 as a reference (0 ppm). Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS magnetometer. Data were recorded at a constant applied magnetic field (0 < H < 3T) in the temperature range 4.2–340 K. The diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded at 300 K between 200 and 2000 nm using a double monochromator SPECORD-40 M spectrometer. The infrared spectrum in the spectral range between 1400 and 400 cm?1was recorded using a Biorad FT-IR spectrometer FTS-40A using KBr (mid-IR) and polyethylene (far-IR) pellets.

Data of both compounds were recorded at room temperature with the Gemini diffractometer (see above). The data were integrated and corrected with the program Crysalis RED [24]. Absorption correction based on the indexed crystal shape was combined with the multi-scan correction. The complete data set was used to refine the respective cell parameters (Table 1). Structure determination and refinement were performed with the crystallographic computing system JANA2006 [25]. Both samples exhibited merohedric twinning. The Laue symmetry of the diffraction pattern of Mn0.50IITi2(PO4)3 was 3m1 but the structure could only be solved in the subgroup R-3 using the lost symmetry operation y, x, ?z of R-3m as twinning operation. The volume fraction of the second twin domain was refined as 0.499(3) giving thus an explanation why the false higher Laue symmetry was exactly simulated by twinning. Taking into the account the merohedric twinning was essential for structure solution: the final structure model has R factor 20% without twinning and 1.63% with twinning. The Laue symmetry of the diffraction pattern of Co0.50IITi2(PO4)3 was 6/mmm. Again, the structure was finally solved in a subgroup R-3c using the lost symmetry operation—x,?y, z as a twinning operation. The volume twin fraction was refined as 0.446(8), the R factor without twinning would be 11.5% instead of 3.46%. Both structures were solved by charge flipping using the program Superflip [26]. The final refinement of atomic coordinates for all atoms, with anisotropic displacement parameters for all atoms, led to reliability factors R = 1.63% and Rw = 6.63% for Mn0.50IITi2(PO4)3 and R = 3.46% and Rw = 9.88% for Co0.50IITi2(PO4)3. Details of data collection and crystal structure are presented in Table 1. The corresponding atomic coordinates, equivalent isotropic thermal parameters and their estimated standard deviations are listed in Tables 2–5. Supplementary data for crystal structures and refinements, especially full bond lengths and angles and anisotropic thermal parameters, have been deposited [CCDC 419418 for MnTiP and 419417 for CoTiP, these data can be obtained free of charge using link: www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk or from the CCDC, 12 Union Road Cambridge, CB2 1EZ, UK; fax: +44 1223 336033.

The known M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mg, Co, Fe, . . ..) [8–13,15,27– 29] compounds generally crystallise in two hexagonal space groups (R-3, R-3c) (Table 6). As shown in Fig. 3, the significant increase in the c/a ratio of M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 titanium phosphates given in Table 6 correlates with the ionic radius [30] of the M2+ cations, a correlation that can be qualitatively understood as follows. The increasing of ionic radius of the M2+ cation indicates an elongation of the octahedral MI site of the Nasicon structure, resulting in an increased c axis. The variations in the M–O bond distances are related to the displacement of the M2+ atoms at this crystallographic site. Consequently, these variations of bond distances affect the unit-cell parameters (increases the c-parameter and decreases the a-parameter). The two studied compounds adopt also the Nasicon structure, with the respective space groups R-3 (MnTiP) and R-3c (CoTiP). The new crystal data are in good agreement with the previous one obtained from powders studies [8,9]. I n M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co) the 3D skeleton, described by the formula [Ti2(PO4)3]?, [PO4] tetrahedra are linked by their corners to [TiO6] octahedra. The metal ions (M = Mn, Co) can be placed in a distorted octahedral oxygen environment at the intersection of the three conduction channels (MI site). It should be noted that the frameworks of both structures are practically identical, in spite of the fact that they crystallize in different space groups (R-3 and R-3c) (Fig. 4). The loss in symmetry on going from the space group R-3c for CoTiP to R-3 for MnTiP induces a splitting of the unique Titanium site of CoTiP to two independent titanium sites, Ti(1) and Ti(2), that still lie on the 3-fold axis. There is still one unique crystallographic site for P and 2 oxygen sites. The MI site of CoTiP also splits into two M(1a) and M(1b) sites.

The structure drawings were made using the ATOMS program [31]. Figs. 4 and 7 shows sections of the crystal structure of MnTiP. Selected interatomic distances, together with their standard uncertainties, are listed in Table 7. The P atom is four-fold coordinated with average = 1.53(10) A˚ is in good agreement with the result reported in the powder study, 1.543 A˚ [8]. These values are also to compares to the ones reported in similar phosphates: NbTi(PO4)3 ( = 1.523(3) A˚ ) [32], NaTi2(PO4)3 ( = 1.543(1) A˚ ) [33], and K2Mn0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 ( = 1.526(2) A˚ ) [34] and 1.53 A˚ given as average P–O bond distance by Corbridge [35]. For O(1), one quite short distance d(P– O) = 1.507 A˚ is found, even the same coordination scheme as O(3) and O(4), all coordinated by phosphorus and one metal only [TiO6]. In contrast, O(2) is coordinated to phosphorus and to one [MnO6] and one [TiO6] (Fig. 5). The Ti4+ atoms are in distorted octahedral coordination. These values are also comparable to those reported for octahedrally coordinated Ti in other phosphate: NbTi(PO4)3 ( = 1.951 [32], M n0.50IITi2(PO4)3 ( = 1.943; = 1.861 A˚ ) [8], and K2Mn0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 ( = 1.987; = 1.970 A˚ ) [34]. Manganese ions Occupy fully alternatively one of the two positions of MI (3b), leaving MI (3a) free. The Mn–O(2) distance(2.245(2) A˚ ) is mainly the result of the coulombic attraction and close to that of calculated (2.22 A˚ ) from ionic radius [30] and to that of orthophosphate Mn3(PO4)2 ( = 2.224A˚ (1)) [36]. 3.2.3. Structure description of Co0.50Ti2(PO4)3 The P–O distances in the tetrahedron in a general position correspond to usual values and vary between 1.518(3)–1.520(4) A˚ (average 1.519 A˚ ). The O-P-O bond angles range from 107(2) to 111.8(2) (see Table 8). The [PO4] tetrahedra strengthen the framework [Ti2(PO4)3]? by sharing all corners with Ti polyhedra (Figs. 6 and 7). Average is of the same range as in the MnTiP and as reported by Corbridge for orthopshosphates, 1.53 A˚ [35].

However, due to the symmetry restrictions, [PO4] polyhedron is less distorted as in MnTiP. Worthy to notice shorter P-O distances for O(1) which is coordinating both [CoO6] and [TiO6] octahedra while distances d(P-O(2)) are a bite longer (1.520(4) A˚ ) with O(2) ‘‘liguating’’ only to [TiO6] octahedra (Fig. 8). There is one crystallographically unique Ti4+ cation in the CoTiP structure. The Ti4+ cation is in an octahedral environment bonded to six oxygen atoms resulting in [TiO6] polyhedra. The Ti–O bond distances range from 1.878(3) to 1.962(3) A˚ . The O–Ti–O bond angles range from 83.70(2) to 172.64(17)8. The Co2+ cation is in six coordination environments. It is worth noting that the [CoO6] octahedron is rather irregular with a large Co–O(1) = 2.332(3) A˚ distance. This is a consequence of the location of Co in the structure. Taking on account the ionic sizes in the respective phosphates, r(P5+[4])/r(O2?[4]) = 0.17/1.38 and r(Ti4+[6])/r(O2?[6]) = 0.605/ 1.40, one can predict the interatomic distances P–O = 1.55 Aånd Ti–O = 2.005 A˚ . The ionic radii have been taken from Shannon [30]. These predicted values fit very well with the crystal data (see Tables 7 and 8).

In the M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 Nasicon structure, [PO4] tetrahedra share oxygens with four octahedra [TiO6]. On the basis of a distribution of tetravalent cations (Ti4+), a possible environment for P atoms can be envisaged in the M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 phases: P(OTi)4. Tetrahedral phosphorous in MnTiP shows a broad signal at around (?5)– (?8) ppm (with respect to H3PO4) in the 31P MAS NMR spectrum (Fig. 9), the broadening of the NMR signals is due to a dipolar part of the hyperfine interactions of Mn2+ ions. The only single 31P resonance line clearly indicates that all Phosphorus atoms are crystallographically equivalent, as expected from the space group R-3 with the phosphorus atoms of the 18f position of the rhombohedral space group. The situation is almost identical with the Nasicon phosphate Ca0.5IITi2(PO4)3 (R-3) and LiTi2(PO4)3 (R-3c) in which the 31P chemical shift are ?3 and ?2 ppm respectively [37]. Note that similar results have been reported for the rhombohedral Nasicon phase MnTiP [37].

The results of magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 1.8–300 K for CoTiP are plotted in Fig. 10. The inverse magnetic susceptibility shows deviations from an ideal Curie-Weiss behaviour, and an additional temperature independent contribution x0 was taken into account to fit the observed data by x(T) = C/(T ? u) + x0 Two fits are shown in Fig. 10: the curve with the larger deviation at high temperature results from a least-squares fit (with a dominant weight of the lowtemperature data), the other one from a minimization of the maximum in the relative difference between observed and calculated data. The fit parameters are compared with each other in Table 9 and are in good agreement with the expected magnetic moment for a Co2+-ion in high-spin configuration teg5eg2 [38]. The nearest Co-Co distance is 6.06 A˚ , and the very low value of the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature u confirms the nearly neglectable interactions between the magnetic moments.

Electronic spectra for M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co) (Figs. 11 and 12) present the characteristic bands of the octahedral environment of manganese/cobalt ions. They showed a very strong absorption band in the 210–300 nm wavelength region due to the electronic transition from O2?(2p) to Ti4+ (3d) orbitals: O2?ð2p6Þ þ Ti4þð3d0Þ ! O?ð2p5Þ þ Ti3þð3d1Þ The detailed description is that the electron transfer from the 2p state of the O2? to the 3d0 state of the Ti4+ ion, and O2?, T i4+ became O?, T i3+ respectively. A similar metal–oxygen charge transfer with high energy absorption edge has been observed for TiO2 rutile (24,192 cm?1) [39] and in some titanium phosphate materials NaTi2(PO4)3 (28,546 cm?1) [40] Nasicon, KTiO(PO4) oxyphosphate (28,546 cm?1) [41] this band can be attributed to the octahedral coordination of Ti in the [TiO6] network. According to the previous literature [12,17] the local environment of Ti plays a crucial role in the shift of the absorption band. The environment with six—O-P attached to Ti in titanium Nasicon phosphates M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 instead of four—O-P in titanium oxyphosphate M0.50IITiO(PO4) may be responsible for this shift. The marked covalence of the P-O bond makes the electronic transfer from oxygen to titanium difficult and explains the high values obtained for the titanium Nasicon phosphates. The second intense band at 37880 cm?1 observed in MnTiP is due to the electronic transfers: O2? ! Mn2+ and Mn2+ ! Ti4+.

According to the high spin 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, the fundamental state is 6A1g(S) and the observed transitions correspond to: n1: 6A1g(S) ! 4T1g(G), n2: 6A1g(S) ! 4T2g(G), n3: 6A1g(S) ! 4A1g(G), 4E2g(G) (that are indistinguishable in energy), and which appear at 750–1394 nm; 518 nm and 414 nm respectively. The absorption bands of CoTiP are observed around wavelengths of 984–1400 nm and 436–710 nm. All these bands can be attributed to Co2+ in octahedral coordination and particularly to the crystal field transitions: 4T1g(4F) ! 4T2g(4F), 4T1g(4F) ! 4A2g(4F) and 4T1g(4F) ! 4T1g(4P) respectively.

The [PO4] group has Td symmetry and nine internal modes are distributed as Gd = A1 + E + 2 F2. The free [PO4] tetrahedra belongs to the Td group. The vibrations of this group are symmetric stretching vibration n1(A1) = 938 cm?1, symmetric deformation n2(E) = 420 cm?1, antisymmetric stretching vibration n3(F) = 1020 cm?1 and antisymmetic deformation vibration n4(F2) = 567 cm?1 [42]. All the fundamentals are Raman active but only n3 and n4 are active in the infrared. Table 10 gives the correlation scheme for the stretching modes of the [PO4] groups through their site symmetry in the R-3 and R-3c crystalline cells. The number of predicted frequencies is also presented (Table 11). Fig. 13 shows the infrared spectra of M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co). The high frequency part (900–1200 cm?1) of these spectra corresponds to the stretching vibrations of the [PO4] tetrahedra and exhibits six bands for the two compounds in good agreement with results of the factor group analysis of R-3 and R-3c. The bands observed between 600 and 300 cm?1 are assigned to the P–O bending vibrations we find 6 and 10 bands, respectively, the predicted ones are ten. The peaks situated below 400 cm?1 are attributed to the external modes and consist of the translation modes of the M2+(Mn2+, C o2+), Ti4+ and (PO4)3? ions [43].

In the present work, M0.50IITi2(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Co) have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and their structures have been determined by the single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. They crystallize in a rhombohedral cell (MnTiP (R-3), CoTiP (R-3c)) and belong to a class of Nasicon phosphates. These two phosphates possess the same three-dimensional [Ti2(PO4)3]? anionic frameworks that are built of [TiO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra, and the metal cations (Mn2+, C o2+) are distributed in extraframework positions MI. The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of MnTiP has only a single 31P resonance line in good agreement with the crystallographic data (18f). The oxidation state of metal (Mn2+, C o2+) was clearly identified by magnetic measurement and UV–visible spectra. The infrared vibrational study shows a good agreement between the factor group analysis results and the vibrational spectrum assignment.
