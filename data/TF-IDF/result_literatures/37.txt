P2-type manganese-based layered oxides are considered as promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, most of them suffer from sluggish kinetics and unfavorable structural stability, severely impeding their practical applications. Herein, Nasicon-type NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) nanoshell is coated on the surface of P2-type Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 (NCM) to boost its performance as a novel cathode for SIBs. The as-prepared NCM@NTP7 exhibits smooth electrochemical charge/discharge profiles, with a specific capacity of 70.7 mAh/g at 20C, and 86.7% capacity retained at 0.5C after 150 cycles at room temperature. Impressively, the bulk structure can be stabilized via the absolute solid-solution reaction at low temperature (-20℃), which shows 120.9 mAh/g discharge capacity at 0.2 C with 92.3% retention and fast Na+ transport kinetic, wherein the D value is 16 times as large as that of pristine NCM. Our study provides a simple and efficient strategy to design and optimize promising layer-structural cathodes for SIBs.
Grid-scale energy storage devices are urgently demanded for efficient usage of clean energy, and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) outperforms other systems in abundance and cost-efficiency[1-5]. As one of the important cathode materials, P2-type manganese-based layered oxides (P2-NaxMnO2, 0.44 < x < 0.8) deliver high theoretical capacity (~ 230 mAh/g) and close-packed structure [6, 12]. Nevertheless, the  P2-NaxMnO2 suffer from a series of side reactions at cathode-electrolyte interface, which could induce the reduction of transition metals (Mn4+→ Mn3+/Mn2+) and  form an ionically insulating layer. The reduction of transition metals would then trigger the Jahn-Teller distortion of the resultant Mn3+ (t2g3eg1, high spin) which tends to cause volumetric change, structural disintegration as well as metal dissolution.  Subsequently the dissolved metal cations migrate to the electrolyte and interfere the formation of stable cathode-electrolyte interface, ulteriorly leading to rapid capacity fading during cycling[13, 16]. In addition, the formation of ionically insulating layers on the cathode surface would block up the sodium diffusion channels, increasing the sodium diffusion barrier and charge transfer resistance as well as restraining the rate property [17- 21]. Therefore, the undesired particle surface will cause a series of domino effect that finally debase the cathode satiability. Rational surface reconstruction of the material is demanded to efficiently change the interaction way between the electrode and its surrounding environment.
Various materials have been applied as coating layers to modify the surface of of bulk P2-type layered oxides, including carbon [22,23], metal oxides [24-27] metal phosphates[28,29] etc. These coating layers all demonstrate some efficiency in alleviating the unfavorable phase transition, avoiding volumetric changes, preventing the corrosion of organic electrolytes as well as buffering the inherent stress and strain between the binder, cathode and current collector. For instance, Sun et. al. [27] disclosed that the metal oxide overlayer could reduce charge transfer resistance from 1421 to 760.2 Ω thus increasing the cyclic stability of electrode. Nevertheless, significant performance improvement of the cathode materials demands enhancement on both electronic conductivity and ion conductivity. In this aspect, Nasicon-type materials with three-dimensional phosphate open framework and high mechanical toughness, not only possess high electronic conductivity and fast ion conductivity but also offer well protection towards cathode, and are considered as superior coating candidates which have been widely applied in LIBs [30-34]. Pan et. al.[30] attempted to generate a core-shell nanostructure of Li(NixMnyCoz)O2 which consisted of crystal-orientated LiFePO4, making an array of interconnected aligned Li+ tunnels at the interface. Following these leads, herein, we design a new Nasicon-type NaTi2(PO4)3  (denoted as NTP) nanoshell coated on the surface of the Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 (NCM) host. The as-synthesized cathode, with an optimal thickness of 7wt% of the NTP coating layer (NCM@NTP7) demonstrates significantly boosted Na+ transfer kinetics and structural stability as compared to pure NCM. Consequently superior Na-storage specific capacity, long cycle durability and rate capacity are achieved for NCM@NTP7 at both room temperature and low temperature (-20℃).
All the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. To synthesize the P2-type Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 (NCM), the stoichiometric ratio of CH3COONa, Mn(CH3COO)2 and Co(CH3COO)2 in a total amount of 0.017 mol is added according to the proportion of different amounts of substances. The detailed synthetic process has been finished according to our previous works[35, 37].
C16H36O4Ti, Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4 were dispersed in 30 ml deionized water which mixed with 25wt% Citric acid in turn under continuous stirring at 80℃. Then, the oxides, obtained through calcining the precursor of NCM at 500℃ for 12h, were added to the as-prepared pulped mixture for further mixing. After that, the dried powder was grounded and then heated at 900℃ for 10h in the air to obtain the NCM@NTP sample. The designed amount of NaTi2(PO4)3 was 3wt%, 7wt% and 10wt% of the NCM powder, labeled as NCM@NTP3, NCM@NTP7, and NCM@ NTP10, respectively. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu Labx XRD-7000) with Cu-Kα radiation (k = 1.5406 Å) is identified to the as-synthesized NCM@NTP samples. The morphology of the synthesized materials is observed via field-emission Scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-7610F). The transmission electron microscopic (TEM) was applied to examine their coating thickness through a JEM-2100F. The coating layer and compositions were examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F) and EDX (JEM2100F, JEOL) measurements. The surface chemistry states were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system (PHI QUANTERA-II SXM ). The cathode electrodes consist of 80 wt% of active material, 10 wt% of super-P, 10 wt% of poly-vinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Sodium metal was employed as an anode electrode. 1M NaPF6 in a EC/DEC(1:1 v/v) was used as electrolyte. A glass fiber (GF/D) was used as a separator. The mass loading of active material was 1.2mg/cm2. The CR2032 cell was assembled in Ar-filled glove box and tested on LAND CT2001A). Electrochemical tests were performed with constant current (CC) between 1.5 and 4.2 V and the cycle property at 25℃ and -20℃ is evaluated at 0.5C (1C = 170 mA/g) after one cycle at 0.2C to activate electrode. The rate capacity was evaluated through the same charge of 0.5C and a gradual increase in the discharge rate after the initial five dis/charge cycles at 0.2C. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (100 kHz to 10 mHz) were analyzed on a Chen Hua CHI650 electrochemical workstation in a potential range of 1.5-4.2 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mVs-1. For the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique(GITT) measurement, the cells were charged in the same voltage window at 0.1C for 30min, followed by a 2h relaxation. 
Typical XRD diffraction patterns for the as-prepared NCM and NCM@NTP samples are compared as in Fig 1a, which indicates that both the pristine and the Nasicon-type NTP coated materials show a hexagonal P2-type structure with the space group of P63/mmc. As displayed in Fig 1b, the peak intensity decreases slowly and the Nasicon-type NTP emerges at 18°-35° with the content reaching 10%, without other distinct peaks visually detected. This observation strongly verifies the existence of solely stable interface interaction in the NCM@NTP3 and NCM@NTP7, exclusion of second phase composite. In addition, there is a slight shift of the (002) diffraction peak for NCM@NTP3 and NCM@NTP10 compared to the NCM (Fig 1c). The absence of such shift of NCM@NTP7 samples owing to no obvious change in the interslab distance according to Bragg equation ((nλ=2d sin θ), further confirming the fact that the NTP is coated on the bulk NCM surface [38]. 
In order to further confirm the purity of the coating layer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements are characterized, which also examine the valence states of elements in host materials. Fig 2a shows the survey spectrum of NCM@NTP7, the peak of P 2p, Ti 2p, Mn 2p, Co 2p, Na 1s, and O 1s could be clearly detected, without binding energy peak of other elements. The P 2p peak is shown in Fig 2b whose binding energy is 132.7eV. In the Fig 2c, the Ti 2p spectra for the NCM@NTP7 shows typical a double-peak feature for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 at 458.89 eV and 464.59 eV, respectively, forcefully demonstrating tetravalence of titanium in the NCM@NTP7 [39]. The Co 2p also exhibits four peaks in total (Fig 2d), among which two peaks are located at 780.22 eV and 795.20 eV, indicating Co3+, and the other two located at 782.33 eV and 797.10 eV are attributed to Co4+, which are consistent with NCM host[40]. Similarly, the Mn 2p spectra for the NCM and NCM@NTP7 as displayed in Fig 2e show four peaks, i. e., 641.41 eV and 653.50 eV ascribed to Mn3+, and the other two peaks at 643.0 eV and 654.5 eV related to Mn4+[41]. Noticeably, compared with the pristine sample, it is found that the Mn3+ in NCM@NTP7 is reduced by a certain extent during the coating process, which may be beneficial for suppressing the Jahn-Teller distortion. Previous literature verified that the Mn3d-O2p hybridization on the surface of host materials is the origin of the Mn4+ reduction (Mn4+→Mn3+/Mn2+) and oxygen loss, thus leading to metal dissolution and oxidizing electrolyte[16]. Therein, it is necessary and helpful to hinder the direct contact between electrolyte and host materials. In the O 1s spectrum of Fig 2f, besides two similar peaks at about 529.5 eV and 530.7 eV which correspond to the lattice oxygen and surface oxygen, an additional peak at 533.9 eV exits which belongs to P=O bonds in the NTP [42]. 
The FESEM images of the NCM and NCM@NTP7samples are shown in Fig 3a-d. In Fig 3a and 3d, the morphologies of all the particles are irregular yet the coated samples exhibit better dispersibility and more uniform particle size. As shown in Fig 3a and 3b, obvious physical cracks are witnessed for the NCM particles, which results in negative effects such as expansion of the contact area with HF, increase of the side effects, transition metal ions dissolving and even adverseness of P2-O2 phase transition during charging and discharging process. However, such physical cracks are exclusive in the Fig 3c and 3d, which might owe to the ´zero-stress´ framework of the Nasicon-type NTP and the designed sintering process. As comparatively shown in Fig 3e-l, the element mapping images of a well-dispersed NCM@NTP7 by TEM further verify the uniform distribution of the host Co, Mn, O elements, as well as the homogeneous NTP coating layer elements, i.e., Na, P, Ti, and O.
To further directly probe the detailed characterizations of surface/interfacial structure, the HRTEM images for the NCM@NTP7 are characterized in Fig 4. Clearly, the thin and legible coating layer, with the thickness of 20 nm (Fig 4a and 4b), strongly adheres to the host NCM material. Meanwhile, the host NCM, as displayed in Fig 4c, exhibits a representative hexagonal P2-type structure, where its (104) plane of lattice spacing is 0.208 nm. Moreover, the outer coating layer with an interplanar spacing of 0.257 nm is clearly visible and it corresponds to the (300) of Nascion-type NTP, which guarantees the broad Na+ diffusion channel, as visual modeled in Fig 4d.
Aiming to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared specimens at room temperature (1C = 170 mAh/g), the initial charge/discharge curves of these samples, i. e., NCM, NCM@NTP3, NCM@NTP7, and NCM@NTP10, are performed in the voltage window of 1.5-4.2V (inset of Fig 5a-d). Apparently, the electrochemical charge/ discharge profiles of these coated materials inherit the basic characteristics of pristine material which shows smooth curves without affecting the capacity, and this can be attributed to a solid-solution reaction without a Na+/vacancy-ordered superstructure or other multiphase transformation. The initial charge/discharge capacities indicate that the NCM@NTP7 (72.1/152.4 mAh/g) surpasses others, say, NCM (46.1/143.3 mAh/g), NCM@NTP3 (56.8/129.5 mAh/g), and NCM@NTP10 (42.9/107.5 mAh/g) at 0.2C. Further cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, as illustrated in the Fig 5e, shows minor peak at low voltage (below 3.0V vs Na/Na+) which can be attributed to the redox reactions of the Mn3+/Mn4+ [43]. By contrast, additional peak at 3.8/3.6V is observed in NCM@NTP7, which is consistent with Na+/vacancy or Co3+/Co4+ [40,43](Fig 5f). After 150 cycles at 0.5C, the discharge specific capacities are 47.3 mAh/g, 114.2 mAh/g, 117.7 mAh/g, 100.3 mAh/g, and the capacity retention rates are 34.3%, 93.5%, 86.7%, 83.4%, respectively, for NCM, NCM@NTP3, NCM@NTP7, and NCM@NTP10 (inset of Fig 6b). The overall trends are outstanding, even though the capacity retention rate of NCM@NTP7 is slightly inferior to that of NCM@NTP3. Subsequently, the rate property profiles at 0.2C-20C are also displayed (Fig 6a). At a high rate of 10C and 20C, the discharge capacities of NCM@NTP7 are 86.3mAh/g and 70.7mAh/g, better than that of NCM which is only 68.8mAh/g and 46.1mAh/g. Meanwhile, NCM@NTP7 also outperforms other coated samples at the whole rate ranges. The well-performed behavior underlines that an optimal thick of the coating shell can provide both superior rate and stable cycle performance, in that coating layer certainly suppresses side reaction, especially Mn reduction. In addition, excessive amount of NTP prove detrimental to the diffusion of electrons and ions and subsequently lead to compromises in energy storage and cycling stability. 
The excellent cycle and rate property of NCM@NTP7 samples at room temperature inspired us to operate at low temperature (-20℃). As shown in the Fig 6c, from 0.2C to 1C, the NCM and NCM@NTP7 rate discharge capacities have remained generally consistent, i. e., 122.7 mAh/g and 120.9 mAh/g at 0.2C, 110.8 mAh/g and 115.1 mAh/g at 0.5C, 104.8 mAh/g and 84.5 mAh/g at 1C, respectively. With the increase of discharge rate, NCM@NTP7 is dazzling with 72.7 mAh/g at 5C, 56.1 mAh/g at 10C whereas that is only 58.9 mAh/g and 42.2 mAh/g for NCM. The cycle performance of NCM and NCM@NTP7, as displayed in Fig 6d, are also investigated. After 150 cycles at 0.5C, the NCM@NTP7 revealed excellent cycling stability corresponding to 93.6 mAh/g and 92.3% capacity retention. The NCM sample also performs well within 100 cycles for specific charge capacity, yet the cells are broken after the 117th cycle (inset of Fig 6e). The origin can be ascribed to the continuous and complicate reactions in the interface between the electrolyte and the uncoated NCM, which disrupts the normal sodium ion de/intercalation reaction. On the contrary, the coated material, which exhibits sloping lines without discharge voltage plateaus, (inset of Fig 6f), shows a typical solid-solution reaction process where the variation of volume and lattice parameters is negligible, and excellent kinetics upon sodium ion de/intercalation [44,45]. 
To gain more insight into the electrochemical and kinetic information, EIS (inset of Fig 7a) measurement, as a reliable electrochemical technique to evaluate transport kinetics, is implemented. Combined with EIS and Zview software analysis, the ohmic resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) are listed in table 1. It is clearly seen that NCM@NTP7 shows a minimum Rs, which indicates a thinner solid electrolyte interface. Meanwhile, the Rct of NCM@NTP7 is also minimal, demonstrating more electro-activities generated after coating process. Furthermore, the Na+ diffusion coefficient (DE) (Table 1) is evaluated by the following formula:Where R is gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday constant, A is the surface area of the electrode, n is the number of electrons during the process of Na+ transportation, C is the concentration of Na in the lattice, and σ is the Warburg factor and can be obtained from the line of Z′ ~ ω-1/2 (Fig 7b).To further examine the detailed transport kinetic properties, as displayed in Fig 7c-d, the Na+ diffusion coefficients with the voltage of NCM and NCM@NTP7 samples are measured by GITT. The Na+ diffusion coefficient (DG) (Table 1) calculation formula is where τ is the time for an applied galvanostatic current. MB and mB are the molecular weight and the mass of active material, respectively. Vm is the molar volume, S is the surface area of the electrode, ΔEs and ΔEτ are steady-state (equilibrium) voltage and the total change of the cell voltage E during the current pulse, respectively. The mode of NCM and NCM@NTP7 are about 2.48 × 10-11 and 4.04 × 10-10cm2·s-1, respectively. The  DG value for NCM@NTP7 is 16 times that of pure NCM, which is consistent with EIS, further confirm that the Nasicon-type NTP coating layer effectively facilitates Na+ transport kinetics of host material. In total, a new superb room/low-temperature rate capacity and long cycle stability cathode material has been successfully designed by optimal Coating modification.
In summary, Nasicon-type NaTi2(PO4)3 coated Na0.67Co0.2Mn0.8O2 cathode with the optimized coating thickness(7wt%) are successfully synthesized via conventional wet coating combined with solid-state reaction. The optimal coating layer can effectively restrain the side reaction and the amount of Mn3+, which greatly improves the cycle stability. Meanwhile, the Nasicon-type NTP can efficiently facilitate Na+ transport kinetics of host material which provides excellent Na+ diffusion channels and more electronic conductivity (Rct = 26.4 Ω, DG = 4.04 × 10-10 cm2 s-1). Moreover, the existence of an absolute solid-solution reaction upon Na+ de/intercalation guarantees superior retention capacity even at low temperatures than room temperature. Therefore, the NCM@NTP7 exhibits ideal electrochemical performance, not only at room or low temperature. Our findings provide an inspiring indicator of the great potential in the practical application of P2-type manganese-based layered oxides at both room and low temperature.
