In addition, in view of the instability between LATP and metallic lithium, we introduce an artiﬁcial Li3PO4 SEI (solid electrolyte interphase) layer to block the contacts between them. The results of galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement show that the as-assembled battery delivers an excellent capacity retention ratio of 95. 

The results of galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement show that the as-assembled battery delivers an excellent capacity retention ratio of 95.2% at 0.2% at 0.1C rate after 50 cycles, which is much higher than untreated samples. We conclude that adding an artiﬁcial Li3PO4 SEI layer is an eﬀective way to improve the electrochemical property of solid state lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with LATP as an electrolyte.

Since the commercialization of lithium ion batteries, LIBs have been widely used as power sources for portable electronic devices due to their attractive energy density, light weight and long cycle life.1–6 However, conventional LIBs with organic liquid electrolytes suﬀer from the problem of leakage and ammability, which limits their large-scale applications.7–11 Thus, seeking new electrolyte materials with high safety to replace the traditional electrolyte is necessary.

In the past two decades, several types of inorganic solid-state electrolyte materials, such as NASICON-type Li1+xAlxM2 x(PO4)3 (M ¼ Ti, Ge),12 perovskite-type Li3xLa2/3 xTiO3,13 Li2S-based sulde glasses14,15 and garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12,16,17 have been extensively synthesized and used as the electrolyte materials for LIBs.Among the above-mentioned solid electrolytes, NASICONtype ceramics, Li1+xAlxTi2 x(PO4)3, have attracted increasingSchool of Chemical and Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, PR China.

 However, these techniques oen require high temperature or complex production process, which limits the mass production of LATP. 

Therefore, developing an easier and more convenient method becomes an urgent task for researchers. In addition, it is well known that LATP is unstable in presence of metallic lithium due to the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox reaction. This problem can be solved by adopting a barrier layer between electrolyte and metallic lithium to block contact between them and prevent unfavorable chemical reactions.However, in a previous study, this buﬀer layer was prepared by radiofrequency (RF) reactive magnetron sputtering,23 which is notsuitable for large scale production because of its complex and expensive preparation process.

In this study, we use CO(NH2)2 as a molten to prepare Li1.In this study, we use CO(NH2)2 as a molten  to prepare Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, which is to the molten salt method.24–26 The molten ux as reaction media can provide a liquid environment to speed up the ion transmission and would reduce the synthesis temperature and reaction time. Compared to conventional methods, this route is convenient to achieve the mass production of LATP. Moreover, in order to solve the problem of redox reaction between the LATP solid electrolyte and lithium metal, we introduce an articial Li3PO4 SEI layer27 to block the contact between them, which will prevent unfavorable chemical reactions. This is the rst time such a method is reported. The results of galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement indicate that the cyclic performance has been improved signicantly, which was not observed in previous studies.

The Li1.The Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 solid electrolyte was synthesized with CO(NH2)2 as a molten  Stoichiometric amount of LiNO3, Al2O3, TiO2, NH4H2PO4 (the molar ratio of Li : Al : Ti : P ¼ 1. 

Stoichiometric amount of LiNO3, Al2O3, TiO2, NH4H2PO4 (the molar ratio of Li : Al : Ti : P ¼ 1.3 : 0.3 : 0.3 : 1.3 : 1.7 : 3) were rst placed in an alumina crucible. Subsequently, diﬀerent contents of CO(NH2)2 (D) were added into the above reactants in which D was dened as the molar ratio of NH4H2PO4/CO(NH2)2, and D varies between 1/0 and 1/3. 

Subsequently, diﬀerent contents of CO(NH2)2 (D) were added into the above reactants in which D was dened as the molar ratio of NH4H2PO4/CO(NH2)2, and D varies between 1/0 and 1/3. Then, stirring was continued until they were mixed homogenously. Following this, the obtained mixture was pre-heated at 150 C for 4 h in  1 to obtain the LATP powders. air at a heating rate of 4 The CO(NH2)2 decomposes in the high temperature calcination. The resultant powders were ground at a rotation speed of 150 rpm for 2 h using a high energy mechanical ball mill at room temperature. The milled powders were pressed into pellets of 16 mm in diameter with a pressure of 8 MPa, followed by sintering at 700–900 C for 12 h in a muﬄe furnace. Aer calcination, the prepared pellets were disc shaped with the thickness of about 1. Aer calcination, the prepared pellets were disc shaped with the thickness of about 1.1 mm and the diameter of about 14 mm, which were denser than those before calcination.

Structure characterization of Li1.Structure characterization of Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 powders was carried out by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB+/PC instrument with Cu K(alpha) radiation at a scan  1 ranging from 10 rate of 4 .7(PO4)3 powders was carried out by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2550 VB+/PC instrument with Cu K(alpha) radiation at a scan  1 ranging from 10 rate of 4 .

 High-resolution transmission electron microscopy JEOL JEM2100F) was also used to conrm the crystal structure of the sample. The shape of LATP powders and the morphology of fracture surfaces in the LATP pellets were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, HITACHI S-4800 instrument). 

The accelerating voltages of TEM and SEM were 200 kV and 10 kV respectively. The equation s ¼ d/RS was used to calculate the lithium ion conductivity of the pellet where s, d, R and S are the ionic conductivity, thickness, resistance and the area of LATP electrolyte, respectively. 

Before testing the impedance, silver was  sputtered onto both sides of the pellet to form lithium ion blocking electrodes.Then, the ACIn order to solve the instability between LATP and metal lithium, we introduced an articial Li3PO4 SEI layer to block their contact through the special treatment of lithium according to the method reported by Guo et al.27 In a typical process, the polished metallic lithium foil was immersed in the solution (0.27 In a typical process, the polished metallic lithium foil was immersed in the solution (0.4 wt% polyphosphoric acid (PPA) in DMSO solution) for 2 minutes to form an articial Li3PO4 SEI layer with a thickness of about 200 nm. Then, the lithium was dried at 25 C for 2 h under vacuum aer the excess liquid was removed. The obtained lithium anode was denoted as PPA-Li. We assembled half-cells and symmetric coin cells to verify the eﬀectiveness of this method. The half-cells were prepared as follows: the commercialized active material LiFePO4, conductive additive super P and polyvinylidene uoride (PVDF) were mixed in a weight ratio of 70 : 20 : 10 in N-methyl-2pyrrolidinone (NMP) under magnetic stirring to form a homogeneous slurry. Then, the slurry was coated on aluminum foil and vacuum dried at 100 C for 12 h to obtain the cathode. 

LATP served as an electrolyte and the thickness of the LATP solid electrolyte is about 1 mm. The positive electrode material was wetted with a small amount of 335C liquid electrolyte (a product code of electrolyte, 1 M LiPF6 in a solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1 : 1 : 1 in volume)) to reduce the interfacial impedance between the positive electrode material and the solid electrolyte. The liquid electrolyte used was approximately 0. The liquid electrolyte used was approximately 0.02 mL. Finally, 2430type coin cells were assembled in a glove box lled with argon. As a comparison, we investigated three types of half-cells: LiFePO4/ LATP/Li-0335C cell, LiFePO4/LATP/Li-1335C cell and LiFePO4/ LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell, in which 1335C represents the addition of a small amount of liquid electrolyte at the interface between the LATP and the metallic lithium and 0335C indicates that no liquid electrolyte was added. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a LAND CT2001A cell test system in the voltage range of 2. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed on a LAND CT2001A cell test system in the voltage range of 2.0–4.0–4.2 V (vs. Li/Li+).

Symmetric cells were assembled by stacking LATP between two lithium foils in a 2430-type coin cell and a spring was added to improve the contact between the LATP and lithium foils. Princeton electrochemical workstation was used to measure the resistance values of symmetric cells in a frequency range of 1 MHz– 1 Hz. The stability of these symmetrical batteries was tested by  2 using subjecting them at a constant direct-current of 50 mA cm a LAND CT2001A cell test system at room temperature.

First, the eﬀects of the molar ratio of CO(NH2)2 to reaction precursor on the properties of LATP samples were examined. 

Fig.1a illustrates the AC impedance spectra for the LATP samples with diﬀerent content of CO(NH2)2 and an equivalentcircuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 1a. The diﬀerence observed for the four samples is only the D value. 

The calcination temperature for the LATP powders is 700 C and the sintering  temperature for the LATP pellets is 800 C. All impedance proles consist of a semicircle in high frequency range and a straight tail in low frequency range. The straight tail can be ascribed to Warburg-type impedance, which originates from the diﬀusion of lithium ions in the silver blocking electrodes.28 The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at low frequencies represents the total resistance of LATP electrolyte. Aer calculation, LATP electrolyte with D ¼ 1/2 possesses the highest total conductivity of 7. Aer calculation, LATP electrolyte with D ¼ 1/2 possesses the highest total conductivity of 7.02  10  1, which is higher than the sample prepared with no CO(NH2)2 added (4.02  10  1, which is higher than the sample prepared with no CO(NH2)2 added (4.93  10  1). In order to investigate the reasons for the increase in conductivity, we measured the XRD of the samples and the results are shown in Fig. 1b (the XRD data looked at in more detail was shown at Fig. S1†). 

The main peaks in all XRD patterns can be indexed to the LiTi2(PO4)3 NASICON-type structure (JCPDS card 35-0754). The impurity phase is reduced aer the addition of CO(NH2)2 due to the suﬃcient contact of the reactants, which is benecial to improve the conductivity.29 In addition, the density of LATP pellets with diﬀerent content of molten CO(NH2)2 was measured by Archimedes drainage method and the results are summarized in Table S1.29 In addition, the density of LATP pellets with diﬀerent content of molten CO(NH2)2 was measured by Archimedes drainage method and the results are summarized in Table S1.

In addition, SEM images were recorded to investigate the morphologies of LATP powders calcined at 700 C for 4 h with D ¼ 1/2 (Fig. 1c). It can be observed that the particles are distributed homogeneously. 

The well-distributed particles would enable the formation of a compact pellet and then, contribute to reduce the grain boundary impedance.30 As shown in Fig. 1d, the lattice fringe of LATP powders with D ¼ 1/2 can be clearly observed, implying that the product has a good crystallinity. The lattice spacing is 0. 

The lattice spacing is 0.4 nm, which is attributed to the lattice distance between two [104] crystal planes of LATP.30In order to acquire the optimum calcination temperature of the LATP powders, we examined the eﬀects of calcination temperature ranging from 600 C under the condition of D ¼ 1/2.30In order to acquire the optimum calcination temperature of the LATP powders, we examined the eﬀects of calcination temperature ranging from 600 C under the condition of D ¼ 1/2. Impedance of the LATP powders at diﬀerent calcination temperature was measured by pressing them into a pellet and then, calcined at 800 C for 12 h. Fig. 2a presents XRD patterns of LATP powders calcined at diﬀerent temperatures. The XRD data, in more detail, is shown in Fig. S2. S2.

The intensity of the diﬀraction peaks increased as the temperature elevated, indicating that the crystallinity of LATP samples was enhanced gradually. However, when the calcination temperature was 600 C, some TiP2O7 impurity phases appear. In contrast, no impurity phases could be observed at the temperature of 700 C. From the impedance proles shown in Fig. 2b, it is observed that the impedance value varies signicantly at diﬀerent temperatures and the LATP powder calcined at 700 C possesses the least resistance. Combining the results of density test summarized in Table S2,† the pellets for the LATP powders calcined at 700 C possess the highest density.Therefore, the optimal calcination temperature of the powder was xed at 700(a) AC impedance proﬁles; (b) XRD patterns of the LATP powders with diﬀerent content of molten CO(NH2)2 and (c) SEM and (d) HR-TEMFig. 1 images of the LATP powders with D ¼ 1/2. 1 images of the LATP powders with D ¼ 1/2.

The powders used before sintering are the LATP powders under the calcination temperC with D ¼ 1/2. The powders used before sintering are the LATP powders under the calcination temperC with D ¼ 1/2. With the increase of sintering ature of 700 temperature, the total resistance decreased rst and then increased, which was mainly caused by the changes in grain boundary impedance. As shown in Fig. 4, the fracture surfaces of LATP pellets were strongly dependent on sintering temperature. Some voids and cracks were observed for the sample sintered at 750 C, which would increase the grain boundary impedance31 and then, reduce the ionic conductivity. However, for the pellet sintered at 800 C, the particles closely connect to each other and the grain boundaries could not be clearly distinguished. Therefore, it can be observed that a suitable sintering temperature is central to the grain boundary impedance of LATP pellet.

The activation energy was obtained by testing a sample with the highest lithium ion conductivity. Fig.5a presents the ACFig. 3 The AC impedance proﬁles for the LATP pellets sintered at various temperatures for 12 h.

Subsequently, the eﬀects of sintering temperature on LATP pellets were also investigated via the AC impedance and SEM technique. Fig.3 shows the impedance proles for the LATPFig.4 SEM images of the fracture surfaces in the LATP pellets sintered at various temperatures: (a) 750impedance spectra of LATP sample measured in the range of 40–120 C. It can be observed that the conductivity gradually increases as the temperature moves to a higher value. Subsequently, as shown in Fig. 5b, the chart was drawn with log sT as the ordinate, 1000/T as the abscissa. There is an excellent linear relationship between them, implying that the conductivity ts the Arrhenius equation sT ¼ A( Ea/KT) well, where s is the conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, A is a preexponential factor, K is the Boltzmann's constant and Ea is activation energy for conduction. The activation energy calculated from the slope of the straight line is 0. The activation energy calculated from the slope of the straight line is 0.29 eV, which is much lower than few of those reported in literature.32,333.32,333.2 Enhanced cyclic performance of solid state lithium ion battery with LATP as an electrolyteAs indicated by Guo et al.

The reason for this change is likely due to the interface impedance and lower ionic conductivity of Li3PO4, which is only 2.3  10  1 at room temperature.34 At the same time, this diﬀerence can also conrm the existence of Li3PO4 articial SEI layer. However, such a huge impedance will hinder the normal charge and discharge of the battery, so adding a small amount of liquid electrolyte to reduce the impedance is necessary. The impedance diagram of the symmetrical battery with the liquid electrolyte added is shown in Fig. 6c and d. Clearly, the addition of a small amount of liquid electrolyte signicantly reduced the impedance. Inset of Fig. 6c shows the equivalent circuit of the symmetrical battery with the liquid electrolyte. Each sample consists of two distinct arcs. The rst arc represents grain boundary impedances of the LATP pellet and the second arc shows interfacial impedance between lithium metal and LATP. Thus, by dividing the diameter of the second arc by two, we can obtain the interfacial resistane on either side of the symmetric cells. Ultimately, we found that the interfacial resistance of one side of the symmetric PPA-Li/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell is  2 obtained for the 57. Ultimately, we found that the interfacial resistance of one side of the symmetric PPA-Li/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell is  2 obtained for the 57.82 U cm symmetric Li/LATP/Li-1335C cell.

which is less than 69.2, which is less than 69.93 U cmIn addition to the impedance of symmetrical battery, we also have measured the stability of these symmetrical batteries by  2.93 U cmIn addition to the impedance of symmetrical battery, we also have measured the stability of these symmetrical batteries by  2. subjecting them to a constant direct-current of 50 mA cm Fig. 6e presents the voltage prole of the battery cycled continuously for 200 h (2 h per cycle) at room temperature. We can observe that there is a rapid polarization for the Li/LATP/Li0335C symmetrical battery, which indicates uneven ion transport through the interface caused by side reactions. With the addition of a small amount of liquid electrolyte, the polarization of Li/LATP/Li-1335C symmetrical battery is reduced, but still keeps increasing. This phenomenon could be possibly attributed to the following reasons: due to the reaction between lithium metal and organic electrolyte, a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer could be formed on the lithium surface. To a certain extent, this layer of SEI could inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. However, the repeated breakage and repair of SEI layer35 would consume the liquid electrolyte gradually, leading to the drying up of the organic electrolyte, which results in the contact of LATP and metal lithium. Therefore, the addition of a little organic electrolyte could not prevent the occurrence of side reactions completely. Conversely, PPA-Li/LATP/ PPA-Li-1335C symmetrical cell is much more stable. This is due to the articial Li3PO4 SEI layer being stable during cycling without a breakage/repair mechanism, which has been proved by Guo et al.27 through their experiments.

In addition, we assembled half-cells to further verify the eﬀectiveness of this articial Li3PO4 SEI layer.Herein, we investigated three types of half-cells: LiFePO4/LATP/Li-0335C cell, LiFePO4/LATP/Li-1335C cell and LiFePO4/LATP/PPA-Li-Fig. 6 The AC impedance spectra of the assembled symmetric coin cell (a) Li/LATP/Li-0335C (b) PPA-Li/LATP/PPA-Li-0335C (c) Li/LATP/Li 2 at room temperature.1335C (d) PPA-Li/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C and (e) cyclability of the symmetric cells for 200 h with a current of 50 mA cm1335C cell. The architecture of LiFePO4/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell was designed as shown in Fig. 7. 7. An articial Li3PO4 SEI layer was formed on the surface of lithium metal to block contact between the LATP and the lithium metal, which would restrain the unfavorable reaction. The results of the galvanostatic charge/discharge tests are shown in Fig. 8a–d. Fig. 8a illustrates the charge and discharge curves of rst three cycles for LiFePO4/ LATP/Li-0335C battery. The polarization of the initial cycle reached about 150 mV and with the progress of the cycle, the discharge curve moved to lower potentials, displaying a signicant polarization eﬀect. When the organic electrolyte is added to modify the interface impedance, the polarization of the rst circle for LiFePO4/LATP/Li-1335C battery decreased to 100 mV. This change is attributed to reduction of the interfacial impedance, which can be observed from Fig. 6. 6. However, as the number of cycles increases, the polarization still increases gradually. Surprisingly, this trend is exactly opposite for LiFePO4/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C battery. As shown in Fig.8c, withthe progress of cycle, the polarization gradually reduced and stabilized at about 60 mV, which is much lower than the former polarization. The above-mentioned cell performance clearly shows the unique advantages of this special design.

Fig. 8d shows a comparison of cycling stability of aforementioned half-cells at the rate of 0. 8d shows a comparison of cycling stability of aforementioned half-cells at the rate of 0.1C for 50 cycles.There isFig. 7 Schematic of the architecture of LiFePO4/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell.

which is a common phenomenon for lithium ion battery. As for LiFePO4/LATP/Li-0335C, the specic discharge capacity fades  1 aer 50 cycles and the from 156. 

As for LiFePO4/LATP/Li-0335C, the specic discharge capacity fades  1 aer 50 cycles and the from 156.1 mA h g capacity retention based on the maximum discharge capacity is only 7.1 mA h g capacity retention based on the maximum discharge capacity is only 7.0%. 

In summary, pure Li1.In summary, pure Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) ceramic powders have been successfully synthesized with CO(NH2)2 as a molten ux at a relatively lower temperature and were then used as the solid electrolyte material in lithium ion battery. Under the optimum preparation conditions (D ¼ 1/2, the calcination temperature for LATP powder was 700 C, the sintering temperature for LATP pellet was 800 C), the sample possesses the highest total conductivity of 7. Under the optimum preparation conditions (D ¼ 1/2, the calcination temperature for LATP powder was 700 C, the sintering temperature for LATP pellet was 800 C), the sample possesses the highest total conductivity of 7.02  10  1 at room temperature and  4 S cm a lower activation energy of 0.02  10  1 at room temperature and  4 S cm a lower activation energy of 0.29 eV. Simultaneously, we introduced an articial Li3PO4 SEI layer to enhance the stability between LATP and metallic lithium. Symmetrical battery tests showed that the stability has been signicantly improved and the assembled LiFePO4/LATP/PPA-Li-1335C cell showed excellent cycling stability. Aer 50 charge–discharge cycles, the capacity retention reaches 95. Aer 50 charge–discharge cycles, the capacity retention reaches 95.2%, which is much higher than that for the untreated samples. These results conrm that the addition of an articial Li3PO4 SEI layer is an eﬀective way to improve the stability of LATP against lithium anode and will promote the development of solid state LIBs with LATP as an electrolyte.
