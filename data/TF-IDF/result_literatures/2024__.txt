On the structure of Li3Ti2(PO4)3

The structure of the Nasicon-type phase Li3Ti2(PO4)3, obtained by chemical lithiation of LiTi2(PO4)3, has been characterised using neutron diffraction for the long range structure and 7Li NMR for more local information. The lithium atoms were precisely located from the neutron diffraction data, using nuclear difference Fourier maps. The lithium ions, which were known to be in the large M2 cavity, occupy two M3 and M’3 subsites (distorted tetrahedra) with occupation factors of 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. From these two intermediate sites, it was shown that the diffusion pathway between two M1 sites in these Nasicon-type structures consists of a set of seven face-sharing tetrahedra. A variable temperature 7Li MAS NMR study showed a set of signals due to a distribution of environments for a given Li1 ion, in terms of occupied or vacant M3/M’3 sites in its vicinity. Elevation of the temperature to 353 K leads to a reversible exchange of these signals, due to fast hopping of Li between the two sites within a given M2 cavity.

Since the discovery of the high conductivity of Nasicon-type materials by Hong1 and Goodenough et al.,2 a lot of studies have been devoted to these compounds.3–12 Sodium-based compounds have been thoroughly investigated from both the structural and the electrical points of view.1–3,7–9,12–16

framework and allows

The crystal structure of Nasicon-type phases AxB2(PO4)3 for exhibits a three-dimensional numerous ionic substitutions at various lattice sites. This framework is formed of corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 octahedra, leaving large interconnected channels which can be occupied by various A cations. Two main types of cavities, denoted M1 and M2, are generally considered. Within the Nasicon structure, each M1 cavity is situated between two BO6 octahedra along the c-axis. Six M2 cavities with eightfold coordination are located between the [O3BO3M1O3BO3%O3BO3M1]‘ ribbons and surround the M1 cavity.

Previous reports have shown that the Nasicon-type materials look promising as positive electrode materials for lithium batteries.8,16–22 A long time ago (1987), some of us showed for the ﬁrst time that lithium or sodium could be reversibly intercalated in the Nasicon framework by chemical and electrointercalation in LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3, chemical respectively.8,20 In the case of an Li//Li(1 1 y)Ti2(PO4)3 battery, the OCV curve V(V) ~ f(y) shows a two-phase plateau at 2.5 V, which is attributed to the ﬁlling of the M2 cavity associated with cooperative migration of Li1 ions from the M1 to the M2 site.21 Interest also focused on voltage monitoring, as shown by the work of Quarton, Goodenough and Masquelier.9–11,16–19 For a long time, it has been considered that the potential of these materials for application was limited due to their very low electronic conductivity, which somewhat impedes a high intercalation rate. Nevertheless, LiFePO4 has recently been proposed as a material for positive electrode in lithium-ion batteries.23 The limitations resulting from low intercalation–deintercalation kinetics have been solved using

nanocomposite materials, that are characterised by a high exchange surface with the current collector.such as LiFePO4/C,

A few years ago, we undertook a general study of the Mn-Nasicon-type materials;22–23,27–28 a comparative study of lithium intercalation in LiTi2(PO4)3, LiMn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3, Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 and Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 clearly illustrates that only the M2 cavities are involved in the intercalation for Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 and LiMn0.5TiCr(PO4)3. In the case of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the ﬁlling of half the initially empty M1 sites {[Mn0.5%0.5]M1Ti2(PO4)3} leads to a potential plateau in the vicinity of 2.8–3.0 V. Note that when the [Li0.5Mn0.5]M1Ti2(PO4)3 composition is exceeded, the additional lithium ions are intercalated in the M2 cavity and a 2.5–2.2 V voltage range is obtained. This difference in cell voltage related to lithium intercalation in the M1 and M2 sites was also found in the LiyMn(0.5 1 x)Ti(2 2 2x)Cr2x(PO4)3 (0 ¡ x ¡ 0.50) system, where the number of lithium ions which can be intercalated in the vicinity of 3 V is equal to the number of vacancies (0.5 2 x) in the M1 site.29 The presence of a jump in the OCV curve around the composition corresponding to complete occupation of the M1 site of Li//Mn(0.5 1 x)Ti(2 2 2x)Cr2x(PO4)3 (0 ¡ x ¡ 0.50) systems shows how electrochemical intercalation can be used as a complementary structural characterisation for relevant structures, especially when other techniques lead to ambiguous results.21–22,28–29 In all these studies, the ‘‘M2 site’’ is generally considered; however, its size is very large in comparison to the Li1 ion radius, so that the exact position of the Li1 ions is unknown.

By using neutron diffraction data, Boireau et al. showed that the lithium and copper atoms in Li3.5Cu0.5Ti2(PO4)3 are distributed in the M2 cavity in two different positions denoted M1(2) and M2(2), these two sites being strongly distorted oxygenated tetrahedra connected through common corners and giving rise to six-membered rings around the M1 sites.30 Later, in the Nasicon-type material with rhombohedral formula

This M3 site gives rise to one signal in the 6Li NMR spectrum at room temperature.18,19 Note that for Li3Fe2(PO4)3, the suspicion of a mobility effect due to Li1 hopping was mentioned by the authors.18

In our group, a preliminary X-ray diffraction study showed a strong modiﬁcation of the diffraction patterns upon lithium intercalation in LiTi2(PO4)3, suggesting a strong modiﬁcation of the Li1 ion distribution in the structure.20 By using neutron diffraction data, a preliminary structural reﬁnement showed that the lithium atoms in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 are within the M2 cavity of the Nasicon structure.20 A comparative 7Li MAS NMR study for the two end members of the LiTi2(PO4)3– Li3Ti2(PO4)3 system, described in the second part of this paper, shows the presence of several signals for Li3Ti2(PO4)3, which suggest different Li environments within the structure. Therefore, in order to precisely locate the positions of the lithium ions within the [Ti2(PO4)3] framework, the structural characterisation by X-ray and neutron diffraction has been reconsidered, as well as the NMR characterisation in the 296– 253 K range, in order to obtain complementary information about the short range structure of both LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3.

Experimental

LiTi2(PO4)3 was obtained by solid state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, TiO2 and NH4H2PO4. The starting materials were ﬁnely ground and then heated progressively between 200 and 1000 uC in air.

Li3Ti2(PO4)3 can be obtained, at room temperature, by chemical or electrochemical lithium intercalation. For chemical intercalation, n-butyllithium (in excess) was initially diluted in dry hexane and then added under stirring to LiTi2(PO4)3 dispersed in hexane, within an argon ﬁlled glove box. The product was then washed with dry hexane and ﬁnally dried under vacuum. Electrochemical intercalation was carried out in lithium cells with the following electrochemical chain: Li/LiClO4 (1 M) (in propylene carbonate)/Nasicon (70 wt%) 1 graphite (28 wt%) 1 polytetraﬂuoroethylene (2 wt%). The cells, assembled in an argon ﬁlled dry box, were discharged at room temperature under low current density (C/40) via a home-made cycling system managed by an HP 1000 computer.32 For the OCV experiments, in order to be as close as possible to the equilibrium conditions, the relaxation was interrupted when the slope of the V ~ f(t) curve was less than 1 mV h21.

The X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature with a Philips PW 1820 diffractometer (Cu-Ka) equipped with a diffracted beam monochromator. The data were collected in the 5–120u (2h) range with a step width of 0.02u (2h) and a step time of 40 s. The neutron powder diffraction data were collected on the high-resolution powder diffractometer D2B of the Institut Laue-Langevin. The samples were contained in vanadium cans of 8 mm diameter and 5 cm height. The diffraction patterns (l ~ 1.59417 A˚ ) were collected at room temperature and at 350 K, respectively, from 0 to

162u (2h) with an 0.05u (2h) step. All the diffraction data were analyzed using the Rietveld reﬁnement method.33

NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker MSL 200 spectrometer operating at 77.7 MHz for 7Li and 81 MHz for 31P. The samples were packed in a 4 mm zirconia rotor and spinning speeds up to 15 kHz were used. Single (90u) pulse sequences around 3.5 ms duration were employed with a delay of 10 s between pulses. The spectra were recorded between 296 and 353 K. The chemical shift values are given with respect to an 85% H3PO4 solution for 31P NMR spectra and a 1 M LiCl solution for 7Li NMR spectra.

Results

The electrochemical intercalation study was carried out using an Li//LiTi2(PO4)3 cell. As already reported by some of us, the OCV curve shows a two-phase plateau at 2.50 V [Fig. 1(a)] which is attributed to the formation of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 and, therefore, associated with lithium intercalation in the M2 cavity of LiTi2(PO4)3.8,20–22

The lithium electrochemical

intercalation–deintercalation study of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 was carried out in two steps. After a ﬁrst charge up to 3.5 V, a cycling experiment was performed for an Li//Li3Ti2(PO4)3 cell at low rate (C/40) between 2.2 and 3.5 V [Fig. 1(b)]. During the ﬁrst charge, 1.7 lithium atoms per formula unit are deintercalated from the structure. The observed charge–discharge reversibility clearly shows that the structural integrity of the Ti2(PO4)3 Nasicon skeleton is maintained. In the second experiment, a continuous discharge of the Li//Li3Ti2(PO4)3 cell was attempted. In this case, a rapid jump in the V ~ f(y) curve is observed, from 2.5 to 1 V, showing that no further lithium can be intercalated in this phase.

A preliminary structural characterisation of both end members, LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3, showed a large

Structural reﬁnement

The reﬁnement of the LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 structures was done using the Rietveld analysis of their X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns. The localisation of Li atoms using the X-ray diffraction technique is not efﬁcient due to their low X-ray scattering factor. Therefore, from the X-ray data, only the atomic positions of Ti, P and O atoms within the framework can be reﬁned, whereas the neutron diffraction technique can also give accurate information about the lithium atomic positions.

LiTi2(PO4)3. The X-ray powder diffraction data show that LiTi2(PO4)3 crystallises in the rhombohedral system (space group R3¯c), with ahex ~ 8.5110(1) and chex ~ 20.843(4) A˚ . Assuming that LiTi2(PO4)3 is isostructural with NaZr2(PO4)3,13 the Ti, P and O atoms are in the (12c), (18e) and (36f) Wyckoff positions, respectively, of the R3¯c space group. Li was assumed to occupy the M1 site [i.e. the (6b) position]. This reﬁnement led to a rather good agreement between the experimental and the calculated XRD patterns (Fig. 2) and to low reliability factors (Rwp ~ 13%; RB ~ 4.2%). It appears, thus, that this structural model describes the structure of LiTi2(PO4)3 rather well. Nevertheless, in order to conﬁrm the position of lithium atoms in the structure, the LiTi2(PO4)3 neutron diffraction pattern was also recorded at room temperature. The Rietveld analysis of these neutron diffraction data was performed in three steps. In the ﬁrst step, only the Ti2(PO4)3 framework was considered. Then, the Fourier difference technique was used to localise the lithium atoms in the structure: it reveals only signiﬁcant residual nuclear densities at the M1 site [(6b) position], conﬁrming that

only the M1 site is occupied by the lithium ions in LiTi2(PO4)3. Finally, the isotropic atomic displacement factors were reﬁned. The cell parameters and the atomic positions determined are given in Table 1, they are in very close agreement with those calculated from the XRD data. This structural hypothesis also leads to a good agreement between the experimental and calculated neutron diffraction patterns and to low reliability factors (Rwp ~ 9.8%; RB ~ 4.0%). Note that due to the large size of the M1 site, a large Biso value is, as expected, obtained for the Li atoms (4.8 A˚ 2) (Table 1).

The Li–O2 distance [2.266(5) A˚ ] is signiﬁcantly larger than expected from the sum of the ionic radii,34 but similar, as expected, to that found in LiGe2(PO4)3 [2.21(1) A˚ ]35 and much smaller than that found in LiZr2(PO4)3 [2.49(1) A˚ ].12 Indeed, it is well known that in LiB2(PO4)3 (B ~ Ge, Ti, Zr), when the size of the B cation increases (rGe41 ~ 0.53, rTi41 ~ 0.605 and rZr41 ~ 0.72 A˚ in octahedral environments), the volume of the M1 site increases and, therefore, the Li–O distances increase. The P–O distances (y1.5 A˚ ) are regular and close to those typically observed in Nasicon phosphates. The Ti–O distances [1.88(1), 1.98(1) A˚ ] show a [3 1 3] distortion of the TiO6 octahedra.

Li3Ti2(PO4)3. The X-ray powder diffraction data show that Li3Ti2(PO4)3 crystallises in the rhombohedral system with ahex ~ 8.3828(6) and chex ~ 22.873(2) A˚ .

The extinction rules observed are not consistent with the R3¯c space group, commonly used to describe the Nasicon-type structures. Indeed, the (003) and (101) diffraction lines in the XRD pattern is incompatible with a c-axis glide plane. Three space groups appear to be consistent with the observed XRD data: R32, R3¯ or R3.


A preliminary structural reﬁnement of the X-ray powder diffraction data in the three possible space groups showed that the best agreement is obtained in the R3¯ space group. Using the XRD data, only the Ti2(PO4)3 framework was reﬁned, with the Ti atoms in the (6c) position and the P and O atoms in (18f). The structural parameters calculated previously for LiTi2(PO4)3 were used as starting parameters. This reﬁnement leads to low reliability factors (Rwp ~ 13%; RB ~ 4.5%) and good minimisation of the difference between the experimental and the calculated XRD patterns. Then, a Rietveld analysis of the neutron diffraction data was performed in order to localise the Li atoms in the structure. The Fourier difference technique revealed that residual nuclear densities remain at two different 18f positions; they correspond to the M1(2) (or M3) and M2(2) sites discussed in the introduction: we denote them M3 and M’3, respectively. Lithium was thus introduced in the structure at these positions, and the atomic coordinates and occupation factors associated with these positions were reﬁned. It appeared that convergence was achieved for occupancy factors close to 2/3 and 1/3 for M3 and M’3, respectively. Note that the occupation ratios converge to these values, whether the total Li amount in the material is constrained or not to be equal to 3. As shown in Fig. 3 and in Table 2, a good agreement is

The LiM3O4 units are linked through corners, by O(4) oxygen atoms, to form [Li6]M3O18 six-membered rings which lie in the (a, b) plane and surround only the empty M1(3a) site [Fig. 6(a)]. The shortest LiM3–LiM3 distances within an [Li6]M3O18 ring are 3.288(2) A˚ , in good agreement with the possible occupancy of two neighbouring tetrahedral sites belonging to the same ring. Each LiM3O4 tetrahedron shares one corner with a Ti(1)O6 octahedron [via an O(1) oxygen], an edge [O(2)–O(4)] with a Ti(2)O6 octahedron and a corner [via the second O(4)] with another Ti(2)O6 octahedron [Fig. 6(b)]. Thus, the LiM3 ions have different interactions with the three TiO6 octahedra to which they are connected. Note that this point is important to explain the NMR results presented in the following.

tetrahedral environments, as shown by the Li–O distances and O–Li–O angles reported in Table 3. Note that these LiO4 tetrahedra are almost ﬂat. The LiM’3O4 units are also linked through corners, by O(3) oxygen atoms, to form [Li6]M’3O18 six-membered rings in the (a, b) plane and surround only the M1(3b) site [Fig. 6(a)]. The shortest LiM’3–LiM’3 distances within the [Li6]M’3O18 ring are 3.306(2) A˚ . Each LiM’3O4 tetrahedron shares one corner with a Ti(2)O6 octahedron [via an O(2) oxygen], an edge [O(1)–O(3)] with a Ti(1)O6 octahedron and a corner [via the second O(3)] with another Ti(1)O6 octahedron [Fig. 6(b)]. From a general point of view, the same behavior as for LiM3 is observed, with different interactions with the three TiO6 octahedra to which they are connected.

Close examination of the atomic positions and interatomic distances the main difference between the LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 structures is in the ribbons parallel to the c-axis. The large increase in the chex parameter upon lithium intercalation in LiTi2(PO4)3 is due to the removal of the lithium ions from the M1 site. Indeed, they no longer play the role of screening ions between the oxygen layers that are on either side of the M1 cavity. As shown in Fig. 6(b), three Ti–Ti distances [Ti(1)–Ti(1), Ti(1)–Ti(2) and Ti(2)–Ti(2)] are observed in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 within a given ribbon along the c-axis. Note that the Ti(2)–Ti(2) interatomic distances [6.94(1) A˚ ] are much longer than the Ti(1)–Ti(1) ones [6.61(1) A˚ ] [Fig. 6(b)]. The corresponding Ti–Ti distance in LiTi2(PO4)3 is only 5.91 A˚ , due to the large screening power of the lithium ions in the M1 site. The Ti(1)–Ti(2) distance between adjacent octahedra varies to a smaller extent between LiTi2(PO4)3 [4.51(1) A˚ ] and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 [4.66(1) A˚ ]; indeed, both TiO6 octahedra belong to the same Ti2(PO4)3 lantern. The size modiﬁcation of the M1 site in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 is accompanied by oxygen displacements perpendicular to the c-axis, which give rise to a rotation of the PO4 tetrahedra and thus lead to a distortion of the [Ti2(PO4)3] framework.

It is well known that in the Nasicon structure, the long distance migration of alkali metal ions must follow the path M1 A M2 A M1 A M2, etc. The M3 and M’3 sites being included within the M2 cavity (slightly shifted vs. its centre of y ¡0.9 A˚ along the c-axis direction), they necessarily play an important role in the diffusion process. Considering the structure, it appears that the lithium ions can diffuse between the M1(3a), M3, M’3 and M1(3b) sites via a set of seven face-sharing tetrahedra (Fig. 7). In the following diffusion pathway, the faces shared between two adjacent tetrahedra are given in brackets: M1(3a) (ABC) ADCB (ACD) ACDE (CDE) CFED(M3) (CEF) CFEH (CFH) CHFG(M’3) (FGH) FGHJ (FGJ) IGFJ (FIJ) M1(3b). Such a diffusion path allows the

Fig. 8 31P MAS NMR spectrum (a) and 7Li MAS NMR spectrum (b) of LiTi2(PO4)3.

The 7Li MAS NMR spectrum of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 at room temperature shown in Fig. 9 is considerably broader than that of LiTi2(PO4)3. This results mostly from a hyperﬁne interaction due to the paramagnetic Ti31 ions, which leads to a strong electron–nucleus dipolar interaction. Furthermore, the second aspect of the hyperﬁne interaction is the transfer of some density of a single electron from the Ti31 t2g orbital to the site (2 s orbital) of the Li nucleus, which leads to a Fermi contact shift of the NMR signal vs. LiTi2(PO4)3. However, the most striking feature of the spectrum is the presence of a whole set of signals, which can be better observed in Fig. 10, where only the isotropic signals are shown. Since the structural characterisation described above shows two crystallographic sites (M3 and M’3), occupied by Li1 with 2/3 and 1/3 occupation ratios, respectively, one would have expected two 7Li NMR signals. Indeed, the oxygen and titanium environments are different for the two cases, which must lead to different geometries for the orbital overlaps and, therefore, to different Fermi contact shifts for the two types of lithium. The set of NMR signals observed must, therefore,

formation of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 from LiTi2(PO4)3 upon electrochemical intercalation at room temperature to be explained . The distortion of the lithium environments (M3 and M’3) in this structure must make Li ions rather unstable in these sites and must, therefore, promote their mobility at high temperature. Indeed, high mobility between the M3 and M’3 sites was shown by 7Li NMR, as discussed in the following section. This diffusion pathway is likely to be general for all Nasicon structures.

In order to obtain more short-range structural information about the distribution of Li atoms, a 7Li and 31P MAS NMR study of the LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 compounds was undertaken.

MAS NMR Study

The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of LiTi2(PO4)3 shows only one narrow signal in the chemical shift range of diamagnetic phosphates [Fig. 8(a)]. So does the 7Li MAS NMR spectrum, with a spinning side band pattern characteristic of a quadrupolar interaction due to the non-spherical symmetry of the electrical ﬁeld gradient at the Li site [Fig. 8(b)]. These data are consistent with the presence of Li ions only in the M1 site.

In order to characterise the effect of the same temperature change on the diffraction patterns, we have also recorded the neutron diffraction pattern of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 at 350 K, which shows no signiﬁcant change as compared to the room temperature one. In contrast to NMR, the time scale of neutron diffraction is extremely short and, during signal accumulation, a very large number of instantaneous pictures are added, in which Li1 ions are mostly in their sites, in-between two hops, which leads to observation of an averaged situation with the 2/3 and 1/3 occupation ratios in the M3 and M’3 sites. The slight change in the Li hopping rate between room temperature and 350 K should not, therefore, alter this observation. A much larger change in the hopping rate would probably be necessary for the diffraction to observe a signiﬁcant number of Li1 ions during their hop, that is in-between their two crystallographic sites.

The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 shown in Fig. 11 exhibits a very complex set of signals, again resulting from hyperﬁne interactions due to Ti31. Since a single crystallographic type of phosphorus exists in the structure, this also supports the hypothesis that the Ti and/or P atoms are inﬂuenced by the distribution in the occupation of the M3/M’3 sites by the neighbouring Li ions, which alters the contact shift on 31P.

We have also recorded the 7Li MAS NMR signal of Li2.80Mn0.10Ti2(PO4)3 (chemically synthesised from Li0.80Mn0.10Ti2(PO4)3 with excess n-butyllithium), which is shown in Fig. 12 for comparison with that of Li3Ti2(PO4)3. It is striking that this spectrum exhibits a set of individual signals very similar to that for Li3Ti2(PO4)3, although with additional bandwidth due to the presence of the paramagnetic Mn21 ions. It therefore seems that the relative occupancy of the M3 and M’3 sites in the two materials obeys very similar ordering schemes.

arise from the additional effect, on a given lithium ion, of the nature of the sites (i.e. M3 or M’3) occupied by lithium in the neighbouring M2 cavities. The occupation of M3 or of M’3 can indeed entail slight but signiﬁcant changes in the position of the Ti31 ions in the neighbouring TiO6 octahedra (one shares an edge, and two others a corner with the tetrahedral M3 or M’3 site), which will alter the contact shift caused by these Ti31 ions on their adjacent Li ions (each TiO6 shares edges with three M3 or M’3 sites, and corners with three others). Therefore, a distribution of NMR signals for each type of Li ion (in M3 and in M’3) should correspond to the expected distribution in the occupation of the M3 or M’3 sites in the M2 cavities ‘‘sharing’’ a TiO6 octahedron with the Li site considered. Although the mechanism of electron spin density transfer is not known, it is tempting to draw a very crude scheme of the situation expected. It is ﬁrst reasonable to consider that each Li1 ion is most inﬂuenced by the Ti31 ion with which it shares an edge, since this allows a proper geometry for a direct Ti(t2g)–Li(2 s) overlap through the common edge. In turn, this Ti31 ion shares edges with two other M3 or M’3 sites, which can be occupied or empty, leading to four possible situations. Considering that each of these situations leads to a slightly different atomic position for this Ti31 ion, and therefore to a different contact shift on the original Li, we have a set of four NMR signals. Since this should hold, but with a different shift, for Li in both the M3 and the M’3 site, a total of 8 lines could be assumed, which is not far from the observation.

Fig. 10 shows that a slight increase in temperature leads to a perfectly reversible merging of these signals. This is a classical exchange phenomenon, assigned to a mobility of the Li1 ions, within a given M2 cavity, between the M3 and M’3 sites through the intermediate CFEH tetrahedral site, as discussed earlier and shown in Fig. 7. When the Li hopping rate between the two positions becomes faster than the difference in NMR shifts of the individual signals, expressed in Hz (i.e. y5 kHz), there is not enough time for the FID (free induction decay) of each individual signal to be recorded. This is the NMR exchange phenomenon, which leads to the
Conclusion

This study shows a satisfactory agreement between neutron and XRD data on the one hand and 7Li NMR data on the other hand for Li3Ti2(PO4)3, showing that Li occupies the M3 and M’3 sites within the M2 cavity. This leads to a distribution of 7Li NMR signals, due to the effect of the relative number of M3 and M’3 sites occupied around a given M3 or M’3 site. Hopping between the two positions is evidenced and leads to an exchanged 7Li NMR signal at 353 K, whereas diffraction sees a statistical occupation of the two sites both at RT and at 350 K, due to its fast time scale.

It is however important to note that relatively satisfactory Rietveld reﬁnements of the X-Ray and neutron diffraction patterns were also obtained with a single position for Li1 ions (M3). However, this is not compatible with the observed distribution of 7Li NMR signals, so that the neutron diffraction analysis was carefully reconsidered, and led to occupation by lithium of the two available M3 and M’3 sites. It is also worth noting that a slightly faster exchange between the two sites might have led to an exchanged NMR signal at room temperature, thus providing no evidence for the occupation of several sites.
