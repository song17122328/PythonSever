This  work  reports structural and  lithium-ion  mobility  studies  in  NASICON  single or  multiple  phase  Li1+xMxGe2x(PO4)3  (M  =  Ga3+,  Sc3+,  Y3+)  glass-ceramics  using  solid-state  NMR  techniques,  X-ray  powder  diffraction,  and  impedance spectroscopy. X-ray powder diffraction data show the successful incorporation of Ga3+ and Sc3+ into the  Ge4+ octahedral sites of the NASICON structure at the levels of x = 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. The glass-to-crystal  transition  was  further  characterized  by  multinuclear  NMR  and  electrical  conductivity  measurements.  Among  the  studied samples, the gallium-containing glass-ceramic presented the highest DC conductivity, 1.1 × 10-4 S/cm at room

Lithium-ion batteries played such an important role in the technological revolution that took place in the past  two  decades  that  their  developers  received  the  2019  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry1.  To  date,  commercial  lithium-ion  batteries employ liquid-organic electrolytes which present both operational drawbacks like restricted cyclability (due  to electrode corrosion) and health hazards caused by leakage of the electrode2-5. All-solid-state batteries are believed  to  be  the  next  step  in  the  evolution  of  batteries  as  they  avoid  such  drawbacks2-5.  Therefore,  optimized  solid-state  electrolytes with high ionic conductivity are required. One of the most promising solid electrolyte systems found in  the  literature  is  based  on  glass-ceramics  in  the  Na-Super  Ionic  Conductor  (NASICON)  phase  field2,3.  The  first  NASICON  glass-ceramic  systems  were  reported  and  patented  by  J.  Fu  in  19976-9.  Typical  compositions  are  Li1+xAlxM2-x(PO4)3, and Li1+x+yAlyM2-ySixP3-xO12 systems where M = Ti and Ge. In the NASICON structure, tetravalent  M  ions  are  octahedrally  bonded  by  corner-sharing  oxygens  to  phosphate  tetrahedra.  Li+  ions  can  occupy  two  sites  named M1 (6-fold coordinated located between MO6 octahedra) and M2 (8-fold coordinated and located between two  MO6 columns). In the parent LiGe2(PO4)3 compound the M1 sites are fully occupied while the M2 sites are vacant,  and  at  elevated  temperatures,  ionic  transport  occurs  by  hopping  between  these  sites2,3,10.  To  improve  the  ionic  conduction,  aliovalent  substitution  of  M4+  by  M’3+  ions  having  a  slightly  larger  ionic  radius  than  M4+  can  be  employed. This procedure widens the bottleneck window between the two sites and introduces additional Li+ ions in  the NASICON structure for charge compensation, which can be accommodated by the M2 sites. At higher x contents,  a redistribution of populations takes place.2,3

In the last years, a large number of studies have focused on the Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 system characterizing  structural  aspects  and  lithium-ion  mobility  12-17  as  well  as  technological  applications18-20.  Further  compositional  optimization has been attempted by combining isovalent (Sn4+ and Ti4+) and aliovalent substitution (Al3+ and Cr3+)  approaches21-23  in  an  effort  to  decrease  the  activation  energy  of  M1  →  M2  hopping.  Aliovalent  substitution  by  trivalent ions that are substantially larger than Ge4+ has been rarely reported in LiGe2(PO4)3 glass-ceramics, apart from  the most recent work of by Z. Zhang et.al.24 reporting successful substitution of Ge4+ by Ga3+. Here we are reporting  the results of our recent efforts of substituting Ge4+ by Ga3+, Sc3+ and Y3+ in LiGe2(PO4)3 – based NASICON glassceramics probed by X-ray powder diffraction, impedance spectroscopy, and solid-state NMR. Such substitutions have  been  recently  studied  for  the  analogous  LiTi2(PO4)3  glass-ceramics25  and  (unsuccessful)  yttrium  substitution  was  attempted in LiGe2(PO4)3 by solid-state reaction26.

Stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3 (Vetec, 99%), GeO2 (Sigma, 99.99%), NH4H2PO4 (Sigma, ≥ 98%), Ga2O3  (ABCR, 99.99%), Sc2O3 (ABCR, 99.9%), and Y2O3 (REEtec, 99,9941%) were used to synthesize the glass precursors.  Raw materials were heated at 700°C for 2 h to eliminate water, CO2, and to decompose the ammonium dihydrogen  phosphate. The mixtures were then melted at 1200°C for 2 h in a platinum-gold crucible, quenched in a cylindrical  mold and annealed at 450 °C for 2 h to relieve thermal stress. The resulting glasses were sliced into 3.0 mm thick 

X-ray powder diffraction patterns at room temperature were taken for all synthesized samples in a Rigaku  Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer operating with Cu Kα radiation between 5° and 100° in steps of 0.02°. An integrator  time of 1 s was used. Rietveld refinements of the experimental powder patterns were done using the software MAUD  to  acquire  the  lattice  parameters,  the  volume  of  the  unit  cell,  and  the  ratios  of  the  crystallized  phases27.  The  refinements assume a space group.

Impedance  spectroscopy  was  performed  in  a  Novocontrol  Alpha  Analyzer  coupled  with  a  Novotherm  furnace, operating at temperatures between 30 °C and 140 °C (accuracy: ± 0.1 °C) in the 107 – 0.1 Hz frequency  range.  Voltage  amplitudes  of  300  mV  were  applied.  For  these  electrical  measurements,  parallel  surfaces  of  glassceramics were previously sputtered with gold during 300 s. Total ionic conductivity data (σ) was calculated from where L is the sample thickness (around 3 mm) and A is the area of the electrode in contact with the sample. R is the  total resistance acquired from the Zꞌ vs. Zꞌꞌ impedance plots using the WinFIT software. 


High-resolution  31P,  71Ga,  and  45Sc  NMR  spectra  were  measured  in  a  Bruker  Avance  600  spectrometer  operating at 14.1 T under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) conditions. Single-pulse  31P (resonance frequency: 243.04  MHz) MAS NMR experiments were taken for all samples in a commercial triple channel 3.2 mm probe operating at a  spinning speed of 20.0 kHz. A 3.0 µs pulse length and a recycle delay of 90 s were employed. Chemical shift values  were referenced against 85% H3PO4 using powdered BPO4 (-29.27 ppm) as a secondary standard. Single-pulse 45Sc  (resonance  frequency:  145.  84  MHz)  and  71Ga  (resonance  frequency:  183.15  MHz)  MAS  NMR  experiments  were  performed in a commercial triple channel 2.5 mm probe with spinning speeds of 20.0 kHz for 45Sc and 10.0 kHz and  45.0 kHz for 71Ga (in the latter case a 1.3 mm probe was used). A pulse length of 0.6 µs and a recycle delay of 4 s  were used for 45Sc experiments while pulse lengths of 0.5 µs and 0.775 µs with recycle delays of 20 s and 1 s were  used for the 10.0 kHz and 45.0 kHz 71Ga NMR experiments respectively. 71Ga QCPMG (Quadrupolar Carr-PurcellMeiboom-Gill) experiments were done for LGGP precursor glass and its glass-ceramic (sample LGGP-C-606) using  the  pulse  sequence  of  Larsen  et  al28.  Pulse  widths  of  0.75  µs  and  1.5  µs  (30°  and  60°  flip  angles  respectively),  a  nutation  frequency  of  111  kHz,  and  a  recycle  delay  of  0.1  s  were  used.  For  these  experiments,  150  echoes  were  acquired  with  5  ×  105  scans.  Chemical  shifts  were  referenced  to  powdered  ScPO4  (-48.2  ppm29  against  1M  ScCl3  solution) and GaP (307 ppm30 against 1M Ga(NO3)3 solution) respectively.

X-ray powder patterns of precursor glasses (Figure 2) present no sharp diffraction peaks while the patterns  for the crystallized samples (Figure 3) present peaks related to crystalline LiGe2(PO4)3 (PDF2 card number 80-1922)  indicating  the  crystallization  of  a  NASICON  phase.  Phase-pure  NASICON  materials  were  only  obtained  for  the  gallium-substituted  compound,  except  for  a  small  unidentified  peak  near  2θ  =  17°  in  sample  LGGP-C-606.  For  crystallized samples containing scandium, X-ray diffraction patterns showed that sample LSGP-C-600 (Figure 3) is  still in the glassy state. Sample LSGP-C-690 showed dominantly crystallized NASICON phase while sample LSGPC-832 showed multiple phases, including LiScP2O7 (PDF2 card number 47-931) and GeO2 (PDF2 card number 851515). Finally, peaks assigned to YPO4 (PFD2 card number 83-658) and Li4P2O7 (PDF2 card number 3-222) were  identified in the X-ray powder pattern of sample LYGP-C-728. Table 2 lists the lattice constants, unit cell volumes,  and percentages of  the  crystalline  NASICON phases determined by Rietveld refinements (Figure 3) as  well as  for  pristine LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON31. Approximate mass fractions of the other crystalline phases as deduced from XRD  are (30.7 ± 0.2) % for LiScP2O7; (5.7 ± 0.2) % for GeO2; (23.0± 0.2) % for YPO4 and (2.8± 0.2) % for Li4P2O7. The  data  shown  in  Table  2  for  sample  LYGP-C-728  is  in  good  agreement  with  those  reported  for  nominal  Li1.4Y0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 synthesized by solid-state reaction26.

31P MAS NMR spectra of samples LGGP and LGGP-C-606 are displayed in Figure 4. For the glass, a broad  resonance line around -25 ppm is observed, reflecting phosphorus environments dominated by two bridging oxygen  species in the glass phase (P2 units). For the crystallized samples, however, the spectra are characterized by sharp  resonance  lines.  Table  3  summarizes  the  results  of  the  spectral  deconvolutions  conducted.  Sample  LGGP-C-606  exhibits a typical spectrum expected for statistical substitution of Ge4+ by Ga3+ with partially resolved contributions  from P4 1Ge,3Ga units24. In contrast to reference 24, no GaPO4 impurities are observed at  the x = 0.5 substitution level.

From  the  X-ray  powder  patterns,  one  can  see  that  substitution  of  Ge4+  by  Ga3+  and  Sc3+  was  successful,  although a multi-phase crystallization pattern was observed in the DSC analysis for LSGP precursor glass and some  extra peaks were also observed in the diffraction pattern. As previously shown, the exact degree of Ge substitution x in  the NASICON phase can be obtained from the 31P MAS-NMR using the expression2, where In refers to the fractional area of each P4 (4-n)Ge,nM signal component. Using the data shown in Table 3, values of x  = 0.53 and x = 0.38 are calculated for LGGP-C-606 and LSGP-C-690, respectively. For samples LSGP-C-832 and  LYGP-C-728,  the  situation  is  unclear  from  the  solid-state  NMR  spectra,  even  though  the  small  unit  cell  volume  expansion of the NASICON structure observed by XRD (as shown in Table 2) suggests a substitution level of x well  below  0.1.  Overall,  our  data  indicate  successful  substitution  of  Ge4+  by  Ga3+  and  Sc3+,  although  the  gallium  substitution appears to be more efficient since all of the batched gallium content enters the NASICON structure in our  samples.  For  the  scandium-containing  samples,  higher  crystallization  temperatures  appear  to  promote  the 

The success of the gallium substitution is also shown by  71Ga MAS NMR, where almost 94% of the  71Ga  MAS NMR spectral area is due to six-coordinated gallium on the Ge site. The other 6% are found in four-coordinated  sites that might be due to substitution of phosphorus by gallium in the tetrahedral site (formation of GaO4 ions in the  anionic sublattice) or crystallization of GaPO4. The first type of substitution was proposed in the case of some samples  in the Li1+xAlxM2-x(PO4)3 (M = Ti and Ge) system, where the authors had no evidence of crystallization of AlPO4 40,41.  The latter, on the other hand, was reported for Li1+xGaxGe2-x(PO4)3 for x ≥ 0.4 where the crystallization of GaPO4 was  observed  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction,  31P  MAS  NMR,  and  71Ga  MAS  NMR24.  As  we  found  no  evidence  of  the  crystallization  of  GaPO4  in  our  data,  the  only  explanation  may  be  the  existence  of  GaO4  units  substituting  in  the  anionic sublattice. This could also explain why the chemical shift value of the four-coordinated gallium resonance in  Figure 7 is more positive (142.8 ppm for LGGP-C-606) than the chemical shifts reported for both GaPO4 structures  (100.3 ppm for GaPO4 in the quartz and 118.0 ppm for GaPO4 in the cristobalite polymorphs)42.

The  interpretation  of  the  45Sc  MAS  NMR  spectra  in  terms  of  coordination  number  is  more  complicated  because  in  the  case  of  six-coordinated  Sc  the  chemical  shift  values  can  vary  by  more  than  100  ppm29.  However,  literature data indicate a tendency of six-coordinated scandium towards positive chemical shift values and of eightcoordinated scandium towards negative chemical shift values29,43. Based on the correlation suggested by Bräuniger et.  al.43 for a limited set of Sc compounds (ScPO4, Sc2O3, ScOF, CaSc2O4, and Li3Sc(BO3)2) with coordination numbers  of 6, 7, and 8, the most intense resonance labeled Sc1in LSGP-C-832 may be assigned to seven-coordinated scandium.  For sample LSGP-C-690, the Czjzek analysis indicates an average chemical shift of 43.3 ppm which is consistent with  octahedrally coordinated Sc. The distribution width of 20.9 ppm reflects the intrinsic disorder in the NASICON phase,  which is expected based on the random substitution of Ge by Sc. 

The  highest  overall  room  temperature  conductivity  achieved  for  our  samples  is  1.1  ×  10-4  S/cm  for  the  essentially  phase-pure  sample  LGGP-C-606.  The  corresponding  activation  energy  determined  from  an  Arrhenius  analysis of temperature-dependent conductivity measurement is 0.37 eV, which is comparable to the value of 0.41 eV  reported by Zhang et al. for a sample with nominal Gallium content of x = 0.624.


From this expression, activation energies were estimated as (0.33 ± 0.01) eV for sample LSGP-C-690, (0.36  ± 0.01) eV for sample LSGP-C-832, and (0.43 ± 0.01) eV for sample LYGP-C-728. It was not possible to estimate the  activation energy for sample LGGP-C-606 since Tonset could not be determined for this sample, as the low-temperature  plateau could not be reached due to hardware limitations (Figure 12). As frequently reported, the activation energies  deduced  from  NMR  lineshape  analysis  are  significantly  lower  than  those  determined  by  electrical  conductivity  measurements, even though the compositional trends are the same.47 The discrepancy most likely arises because the  two techniques probe ionic motion on different length scales.

Substitution of Ge4+ by Ga3+, Sc3+, and Y3+ in the LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON phase was attempted using the  glass-ceramic  route.  The  results  show  that  phase-pure  Li1.5Ga0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3  could  be  obtained  as  also  reported  recently24. Substitution by Sc3+ was achieved for the samples heat-treated at 690 °C for 1h (LSGP-C-690), although no  phase-pure samples were obtained.  No indication of any substitution of Ge4+ by Y3+ was observed in the NMR data.  The different degrees of substitution can be explained on the basis of the differences in the ionic radii. While the Ga3+  ions (r = 62 pm) can still be accommodated substituting for Ge4+ (r =53 pm), those of Sc3+(r = 74.5 pm) and Y3+ (90  pm)  are  significantly  larger.
