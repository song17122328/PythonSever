LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolytes are synthesized by a simply LiF assisted solid state reaction.
The electrolytesprepared with LiF assist exhibit much larger particle size, less voids and higher crystallinity than that of the sample without LiF assist.
The LiTi2(PO4)3 sample synthesized with LiF additive (the molar ratio ofLiTi2(PO4)3:LiF =1:0.5) delivers lithium ion conductivity of 2.318 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature withan activation energy as low as 0.28 eV; while the electrolyte prepared without LiF assist exhibits conductivity of7.181 ×10−6 S cm−1 and activation energy of 0.48 eV.
The significantly enlarged conductivity and reduced activation energy suggest LiF assist is an effective and simple method to improve the performance of LiTi2(PO4)3solid electrolytes for all solid state lithium batteries.
In this study, high lithium ionic conductivity of NASICON-typeLiTi2(PO4)3 solid state electrolyte is successfully synthesized by LiFassisted solid state reaction.
The additive LiF in the synthetic processcould enlarge the particle size, improve the crystallinity and reduce the voids of LiTi2(PO4)3. The F5 sample with LiF assist delivers conductivity2.318 S cm−1, which is much higher than that of the sample withoutLiF assist.
The greatly improved performance is mainly due to the enhanceddensity and reduced grain boundaries of the LiTi2(PO4)3 solidelectrolyte.
