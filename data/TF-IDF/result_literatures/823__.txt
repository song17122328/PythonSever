Energy is a very important in modern life and need  innovations to develop it. 

One  innovation  is  the  application  of  energyfor  storage  devices,  such  as  batteries,  capacitors,  fuel  cells,  etc.  

For  30  years,  the  application  of  the  NASICON  (Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12)  into  the  NASICON gas sensor material was successfully prepared by using solid-state method. 

The raw  materials  such  as  SiO2,  Na2CO3,  ZrO2,  and  NaH2PO4  with  a  little  methanol  were  mixed  in  Ballmill equipment. The silica powder was made by the extraction of bagasse ash by using solgel  method.  The  x-ray  diffraction  patternshowedthat  the  result  of  silica  extraction  was  amorphous  and  the  NASICON  structure  wassynthesizedto  bemonoclinic.  The  scanning  electron  microscopy results indicated that silica had non-uniform surface morphology and the  NASICON  had  good  surface  morphology  only  on  the  form  of  Na3Zr2Si2PO12.

NASICON is an acronym for sodium (Na) Super ionic Conductor, which usually refers to a family of  solids with the chemical formula of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12, 0 < x < 3.NASICON is an acronym for sodium (Na) Super ionic Conductor, which usually refers to a family of  solids with the chemical formula of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12, 0 < x < 3. In a broader sense, it is also used for  similar compounds where Na, Zr, and/or Si are replaced by isovalent elements. NASICON compounds  have high ionic conductivities, on the order of 10−3 S/cm, which is a rival of those liquid electrolytes.  They are caused by hopping of Na ions among interstitial sites of the NASICON crystal lattice [1].

The main application that envisaged for NASICON materials is as a solid electrolyte in a sodiumion  battery.  Some  NASICON  exhibits  a  low  thermal  expansion  coefficient  (<  10−6  K−1),  which  is  useful  for  precision  instruments  and  household  ovenware.  NASICONs  can  be  doped  with  rare-earth  elements, such as Eu, and used as phosphors. Their electrical conductivity is sensitive to molecules in  the ambient atmosphere, a phenomenon that can be used to detect CO2, SO2, NO, NO2, NH3, and H2S  gases.  Other  NASICON  applications  include  as  catalysis,  immobilization  of  radioactive  waste,  and  sodium removal from water [1].

This research concerned to analyze the effect of silica (SiO2) addition from an extraction of bagasseash by sol-gel/alkali method on the formation of NASICON.

The  chemical  materials  used  in  the  experiment  were  Chloride  Acid  (99%,  Merck),  Sodium  Oxide  (99%,  Merck),  Sodium  Dihydrogen  Phosphate  (99%,  Sigma  Aldrich),  Zirconium  Oxide  (99%,  Merck), Sodium Carbonate (99%, Sigma aldrich), and Methanol (99%, Merck). All chemical materials  were used without further purification.

In this paper, two-step synthesis method was applied to synthesize  the silica powder. The first step of the method was extraction. 10 gram of bagasse ash was added into  60  mL  NaOH  2  M  and  then  stirred  and  heated  under  boiling  temperature  for  1  hour.  Then  the  extraction result was filtered to separate the extract and ash residue. Secondly, the extract was titrated  by HCL for gelation. Next, the silica gel was aged for 18 hours and washed by demineralized water  until the salt resulted from the titration procces was not present. The pure silica gel was subsequently  heated to degradate the water in an oven for 24 hours [4].

The  NASICON  material  was  produced  by  preparing SiO2, ZrO2, NaH2PO4, and Na2CO3 with proper compositions which were then mixed on a  Ballmill  with  methanol  sufficienly.  The  mol  silica  was  varied  to  x=1.  The  mol  silica  was  varied  to  x=1.5,  2,  and  2.5,  2,  and  2.5  to  make  the  NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12). The ball mill was rotated at a speed of 800 rpm for 4 hours. Then the  result of  pre-NASICON  was calcined on horizontal furnace for 4 hours at 850 оC and was sintered by  the same tool for 5 hours at 1000 оC [5].    2.    2.3 General Characterization.   The  samples  were  characterized  by  X-ray  Diffraction  (X’Pert  PRO  PANalytical)  to  know  the  phase  and purity of the composing  materials and NASICON. Scanning Electron  Microscophy (FEI  Inspect  S50)  was  employed  to  know  the  morphology  of  the  particle  surface  of  silica  and  surface  pellet  of  NASICON, and LCR meter was used to know the ionic conductivity of the  super ionic conductor of   NASICON.
