Synthesis and ionic conductivity of Li3 – 2xNbxFe2 – x(PO4)3 complex phosphates were studied by X-ray powder diffraction and impedance spectroscopy. These phosphates are formed only at 900–1000°C. V ariations in their thermal expansivity and unit cell parameters induced by aliovalent doping were characterized. The conductivity of these materials increases monotonically in the series Li0.5Nb1.25Fe0.75(PO4)3–LiNbFe(PO4)3 and Li1.2Nb0.9Fe1.1(PO4)3–Li3Fe2(PO4)3, which is explained by consecutive occupation of the Li(1) and Li(2) positions in their structures.

High-ionic-conductivity materials are widely used in current sources, gas and liquid pickups, solid fuel cells, and other electrochemical devices. NASICON compounds of composition A x å 2 (êO 4 ) 3 (where M is a ter-, tetra-, or pentavalent element) have been actively studied in recent years. They have several practically important properties, such as high thermal stability, low heat conductivity, and low thermal expansivity [1–3]. The NASICON structure consists of PO 4 tetrahedra sharing corners with MO 6 octahedra, being a threedimensional network. Ions A + can occupy two nonequivalent positions in this structure: the surrounding of the position A(1) is a distorted octahedron, whereas the position A(2) is in an interstice formed by 10 oxygen atoms [4]. A number of A x å 2 (êO 4 ) 3 compounds containing In 3+ , Sc 3+ , Fe 3+ , Zr 4+ , Hf 4+ , Ti 4+ , and Sn 4+ cations in the position M have been studied [5]. Heterovalent partial substitution in these positions considerably changes properties of the material [4]. For example, Li 3 Fe 2 (PO 4 ) 3 has a high ionic conductivity at temperatures above 300°ë . Upon cooling, however, its conductivity decreases considerably because of phase transition from the hexagonal to monoclinic phase [5]. The substitution of niobium ions for one-half iron ions in Li 3 Fe 2 (PO 4 ) 3 generates a material that crystallizes in hexagonal crystal system even at room temperature [6]. From this, we can suggest that LiNbFe(PO 4 ) 3 at lower temperatures has higher conductivity than Li 3 Fe 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . An additional change in conductivity can be achieved via varying the ratio Nb : Fe. Here, we study the synthesis of Li 3 – 2 x Nb x Fe 2 – x (PO 4 ) 3 complex phosphates and characterize them by powder X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy.

Materials with the composition Li 3 – 2 x Nb x Fe 2 – x (PO 4 ) 3 , where the lithium index n Li = 3 – 2 ı = 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0, were synthesized in a two-stage protocol by the solid-phase reaction (3 – 2 x )Li 2 CO 3 + x Nb 2 O 5 + (2 – x )Fe 2 O 3 + 6(NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 2Li 3 – 2 x Nb x Fe 2 – x (PO 4 ) 3 + 12NH 3 + 9H 2 O + (3 – 2 x )CO 2 .

First, Li 2 CO 3 , (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 , Nb 2 O 5 , and Fe 2 O 3 weighed samples in stoichiometric proportions were carefully ground with an agate mortar and pestle until a homogeneous blend was obtained. Then, the blend was transferred into platinum crucibles and annealed at 700°ë for 2 h. The resulting reaction mass was again triturated with ethanol with a mortar and pestle and then compacted into disks at 510 MPa to improve particle interaction. After this, samples were again annealed for 12 h, encapsulated with a powder of the same composition containing a 10% excess of lithium carbonate at 1000°ë for compositions with n Li < 1.4 and 900°ë for compositions with n Li ≥ 1.4 . This differentiation was due to the easier melting of n Li > 1.4 compositions. Encapsulation was necessary for inhibiting lithium vaporization, which could spoil the set composition [7]. X-ray powder diffraction was measured on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer using Cu K α radiation. Unit cell parameters were refined by the least-squares technique using the POWDER software. Conductivity was measured in cylinder-shaped disks (5 mm in diameter and 2 mm high) from 25 to 700 ° C in 10–20°ë steps on a 2V -1 impedance meter/analyzer at frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz with platinum electrodes. Conductivity was found by extrapolation of bulk conductance curves to the resistance axis.

To highlight phase transformations that occur during LiNbFe(PO4)3 synthesis, we carried out X-ray powder diffraction of the reagent mixtures annealed at various temperatures (Fig. 1). A considerable decrease in intensity was noticed for lithium carbonate and ammonium phosphate lines even in the mixtures annealed at low temperatures. Within 200–400°ë, the X-ray diffraction patterns of annealing products changed insignificantly. At 450°ë, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and LiFeP2O7 reflections appeared. Unreacted niobium oxide was also present. The target product phase appeared starting at 600°ë; above 700°ë, the starting reagents completely disappeared. Unlike for lithium zirconium phosphate [7], in our experiments the product was not completely formed even at 950°ë; there were admixtures of lithium iron pyrophosphate and lithium iron phosphate. The likely main reason for product contamination during the staged process was uncontrolled lithium loss. In two-stage synthesis and high-temperature annealing of encapsulated tablets at 950°ë, the impurity level was considerably lower (Fig. 2, curve 1); at 1000°ë, the product is virtually pure LiNbFe(PO4)3(Fig. 2, curve 2). When the synthesis temperature increased further to 1100°ë, the compound melts. Powder X-ray diffraction showed that compounds with nLi = 05–1.1 crystallized in hexagonal crystal system; those with nLi ≥ 1.2 are monoclinic. For composi tions crystallizing in the hexagonal phase, the unit cell parameter ‡ varied from 8.624 to 8.633 Å with increasing iron proportion; this variation is within the determination error (table). The parameter Ò decreased monotonically with increasing iron proportion, from 21.667 to 21.438 Å.

For LiNbFe(PO4)3, heating to 700°ë only weakly altered its X-ray diffraction pattern. Reflections experienced some shifts, including relative to one another. The reflection with 2θ ≈ 36° was split into a pair of reflections upon heating, whereas lines within 2θ = 32°–33° merged (Fig. 3). The compound did not undergo phase transitions over the indicated range of temperatures. However, evolution of its X-ray diffraction pattern signified that its thermal expansion was not uniform with respect to crystallographic directions. For example, the parameter ‡ increased insignificantly, unlike the parameter Ò (Fig. 4). The thermal expansivity along axis a was (5 ± 2) × 10–7 ä–1, and that along axis c was (2.21 ± 0.05) × 10–5 ä–1. While Li2Nb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3 was heated to 700°ë, its X-ray diffraction patterns featured a small shift of reflections toward small angles; reflections over the range 2θ = 24°–25° merged. The unit cell parameters increased insignificantly. The parameter ‡ changed from 8.606(5) to 8.644(5) Å; the parameter b, from 12.106(4) to 12.182(4) Å; and the parameter Ò, from 8.602(5) to 8.652(6) Å. The thermals expansivity along axis a was (6.4 ± 0.9) × 10–6 ä–1; along axis b, its value was (9.2 ± 0.2) × 10–6 ä–1; and along axis c, (8.6 ± 0.9) × 10–6 ä–1. Low thermal expansivity is a characteristic feature of many NASICON materials [3, 8]. Figure 5 makes it clear that the conductivity increases monotonically in the Li0.5Nb1.25Fe0.75(PO4)3– LiNbFe(PO4)3 and Li1.2Nb0.9Fe1.1(PO4)3–Li3Fe2(PO4)3series. When there is more than 1.0 Li ion per formula unit, however, the conductivity drops drastically until the composition is Li1.2Nb0.9Fe1.1(PO4)3. These conductivity variations can be interpreted on the basis of structural data. Lithium ions in the NASICON structure can occupy two structurally nonequivalent positions: Li(1) and Li(2). The Li(1) positions, having a distorted octahedral surrounding, can accommodate one lithium ion per formula unit. These positions are, as a rule, pre ferred by small cations, including lithium and sodium cations [4]. Most likely, the conductivity up to the composition LiNbFe(PO4)3 is mainly due to lithium ion transport via the Li(1) positions and increases with increasing occupancy of these positions.

A progressive increase in lithium concentration results in the complete occupation of the Li(1) positions. With this, the vacancy concentration in the Li(1) positions decreases with increasing iron concentration, and they are gradually excluded from ion transport. For the Li1.2Nb0.9Fe1.1(PO4)3–Li3Fe2(PO4)3 series, lithium transport via Li(2) positions dominates. The limiting lithium concentration in these positions is three ions per formula unit, and their occupancy is as low as 2/3 even for Li3Fe2(PO4)3. Therefore, a monotonic rise in conductivity is observed in the second region. Notably, the activation energy of conductivity decreases systematically to reach 37 kJ/mol in compositions containing 0.8–1 lithium ion per formula unit (Fig. 6). The change in the majority carrier type in materials containing more than 1.2 lithium ions per formula unit gives rise to a dramatic increase (to 59 kJ/mol) in activation energy of conductivity. With a further increase in lithium content, the conductivity drops back to 38 kJ/mol. Thus, the trend of the activation energy of conductivity indirectly supports the hypothesis of different majority carrier types in different compositions. To summarize, we determined that Li3 – 2xNbxFe2 – x(PO4)3 materials are generated only at 900–1000°ë. To obtain a single-phase material, uncontrolled lithium loss during heating should be inhibited. Taking LiNbFe(PO4)3 and Li2Nb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3 as examples, we demonstrated that the materials under consideration are characterized by low thermal expansivity. Their conductivity increases monotonically in the series Li0.5Nb1.25Fe0.75(PO4)3–LiNb Fe(PO4)3 and Li1.2Nb0.9Fe1.1(PO4)3–Li3Fe2(PO4)3, which is explained by the consecutive occupation of the Li(1) and Li(2) positions in complex phosphates.
