Intercalation of lithium into the vacant sites in the host framework structure of sodium silicon conductor ~NASICON! with various transition metal phosphates can be achieved electrochemically at room temperature. The framework compounds M2(PO4) 3 with M 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr!, were electrochemically characterized in a cylindrically 5 ~Ti, Nb!, ~Mn, Nb!, and M0.5 shaped cell made in our laboratory. To understand the role of trivalent cation ~Mn, Fe, Cr! on the position of the octahedral Nb51/Nb41, Nb41/Nb31 ~niobium! redox couple in the framework compounds having the same polyanion, (PO4) 32, we have investigated various transition metal phosphates. The three trivalent cation substitutions vary in electrochemical behavior in the manner in which the (PO4) tetrahedron stabilizes the redox couples in the octahedral sites. 
The position of the Nb51/Nb41 redox couple for M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr! lies at 1.9, 2.1, and 2.3 V and the position of the Nb41/Nb31 redox couple for all trivalent cations lies at 1.6 V. For the parent compound, TiNb~PO4) 3 , the ﬁrst two equivalents of Li appear to be inserted at an average voltage of around 2.2 V. The reason for this difference in the position of the redox energies is related to changes in the stability of the octahedral sites in the structure.
Rechargeable lithium batteries are attractive for their potential as lightweight, compact energy storage devices in applications ranging from portable electronics ~such as laptop computers and cellular phones! to electric vehicles.1 The economic success has created enormous interest in the development of cheaper and environmentally benign lithium batteries.2 The focus of this article is on the transition metal phosphate as an insertion compound, which constitutes the active component of the cathode. Previously, research on transition-metal oxides featured the interesting possibility of the incorporation of foreign metal atoms into the host lattice which results in the emergence of LiMn2O4 ,3 LiCoO2 ,4 and LiNiO2 5 as promising cathode materials in rechargeable lithium batteries. All three of these oxides are pursued as 4.0 V cathode materials and the voltage corresponds to the M41/M31 ~M 5 Ni, Co, or Mn! redox couple. 
These materials, although relatively expensive to produce, generally offer high electrochemical performance. However their thermal instability and confrontation with capacity fading particularly at elevated temperature have posed some difﬁculties in their development.6 In addition, there is a growing concern of the most widely used active material, LiCoO2 , due to environmental and toxic hazards associated with cobalt. After two decades following the discovery of oxide-based battery insertion materials, a technological breakthrough has occurred using phosphate as the cathode material in rechargeable batteries. There is an alternative framework host that has been explored recently, namely, sodium silicon conductor ~NASICON!-type compounds. Like their oxide-based counterparts, these materials are insertion-type compounds. The physical and chemical properties of phosphates are considered to be both thermally and chemically stable. 
In this regard, we explored NASICON, which belongs to the class of NZP (NaZr2P3O12) phases with 41P3O12 possessing a hexagonal symmethe general formula A11M2 try, for their potential use as a cathode material without any lithium initially present in the A site.7 The NZP structure is versatile in that chemical substitution by various elements is possible at Na, Zr, and P sites, giving rise to an isostructural phase, including a vacancy at the A site, leading to the formation of Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 , transition metal phosphate, containing no lithium in its structure. 
We showed that Li has been inserted electrochemically into the vacant A site in the NZP phase at room temperature.8 As lithium batteries dominate the battery market, rechargeability is of utmost concern among researchers. Hence, we out microstructural modiﬁcations,9 which enhanced the rechargeable capacity with the optimum amount of acetylene black as an additive in lithium batteries. We have also investigated the practical usefulness of Cr2(SO4) 3 frameworks10 and showed improved capacity retention for cells containg the Nb-substituted polyanion, Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 , on the basis of repeated lithium insertion and extraction processes.
In this paper, the framework compounds M2(PO4) 3 with metal 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 atom substitution M 5 ~Ti, Nb!, ~Mn, Nb! and M0.5 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr! were investigated for our studies. The objective of this work is to examine the transition metal phosphate as a cathode for lithium secondary batteries and its role on the position of the octahedral Nb51/Nb41, Nb41/Nb31 redox couple. Hence, we make an attempt here to understand the choice of transition metal that has a signiﬁcant effect on the cell voltage, as it is primarily dependent on the redox couple of the metal atom present in the structure. Materials having the general formula M2(PO4) 3 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, with M 5 ~Mn, Nb!, ~Ti, Nb! and M0.5 Fe, Cr! were chosen and their electrochemical behavior is discussed in terms of their difference in redox energies.
The preparation of the transition metal phosphates with cation 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr!, has been substitution, M0.5 reported.8 Phase identiﬁcation and evaluation of lattice parameters of the product were carried out by powder X-ray diffraction ~XRD! using Cu Ka radiation. Electrochemical performance was evaluated with cylindrically shaped test cells made in our laboratory. The electrode active material, the transition metal phosphate, was mixed with 15 wt % of acetylene black ~A-black; Denka Black!9 and with 10 wt % of PVDF ~poly~vinylidene ﬂuoride!; Aldrich! as a binder,11 and then pressed. The mixture was ground and then pressed into a disk with a diameter of 10 mm at 78 MPa. Each disk was 1 mm thick and about 60 mg. Each disk was dried at 80°C for 30 min. The role of A-black as an additive in lithium batteries is to provide porosity rather than electronic conductivity. 
The amount of porosity in the cathode active material with 15 wt % A-black is most effective for the diffusion of Li1 from the particle and leads to a high rechargeable capacity.9
An electrochemical testing cell was constructed with the disk as the cathode, the lithium foil as the anode, and ﬁlter paper as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M LiClO4 in ethylene carbonate ~EC!/propylene carbonate ~PC!, 3:1 vol. ~Tomiyama Chemicals!. Cell performance was evaluated galvanostatically at a current density of 0.25 mA/cm2 with the aid of a charge-discharge unit ~Hokuto Denko HJ-201B!. The cells were ﬁrst discharged and then charged at constant current density between the potential limits of 1.5 V for discharge and 3.2 V for charge. All electrochemical measurements were carried out in a glove box ﬁlled with argon at room temperature. The surface of the electrodes was observed with a scanning electron microscope ~SEM; JEOL, T220A, Nihon Denshi!.
The XRD pattern of TiNb~PO4) 3 prepared by solid-state reaction in air at 1200°C is shown in Fig. 1. The lattice parameters of the compound matched those of the hexagonally structured TiNb~PO4) 3 powder diffraction ﬁle ~JCPDS! 25-0984. The data reveals that the sample is a single-phase compound with a small amount of niobium phosphate (NbPO5) as impurity. Figure 2 shows the SEM images of the TiNb~PO4) 3 sample calcined at various temperatures and ﬁnally sintered at 1200°C in air. It can be seen that the sample sintered at higher temperature showed well-deﬁned boundaries with the particle size in the range of 2-5 mm. For cation substitution M 5 ~Mn, Nb! the structure of the framework remained intact. The phases were stable on exposure to air and moisture at room temperature.
Figure 4 shows the variation of the cell voltage vs. composition and capacity during the ﬁrst discharge cycle for a cell using MnNb~PO4) 3 as starting material. The discharge curve of this material, Fig. 4, shows surprisingly, that there is no distinguishable plateau-like curve between the same cutoff voltage 3.2-1.5 V as for TiNb~PO4) 3 . The abrupt drop of voltage corresponding to a discharge capacity of 29 mAh/g of the voltage vs. X curves signals that we could not initiate access to any of the Mn31/Mn21, Nb51/Nb31 redox couples in these compounds. As described by Aydinol et al.14 if the transition metal in the structure were not stable it would have a low intercalation voltage. The MO6 units, in the NASICON structure, form strongly bonded sandwiches between the intercalated lithium ions. It is believed that this structure allows for the easy removal or incorporation of lithium ions. 
The presence of manganese ~Mn! in the site makes the structure unable to insert/extract lithium ions. Hence, transition metal M has a signiﬁcant effect on the cell voltage as it depends on the redox couple of the metal atom present in the structure.
To investigate the role of trivalent cation on the position of the octahedral Nb51/Nb41; Nb41/Nb31 redox energies with respect to the Fermi level energy of lithium, we tried to insert lithium electrochemically into the compounds with a variety of transition metals M 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr!. in the general formula M0.5 Figure 5 shows the variation of the cell voltage vs. composition and capacity during the ﬁrst discharge cycle for a cell using 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr!. Figure 5a shows a disM0.5 charge curve for the cation substitution Mn0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 . The shape of the discharge curve is characterized by a downward sloping potential at 1.9 V region corresponding to Nb51/Nb41 redox couple followed by a downward sloping potential with a sharp drop in voltage at 1.5 V. For the substitution, Mn0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 , 1.6 lithium atoms have been inserted corresponding to a discharge capacity of 97 mAh/g. Figure 5b shows a discharge curve for the cation substitution, Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 . 
The shape of the discharge curve is characterized by an immediate sharp drop in voltage to 2.5 V, followed by a downward sloping potential to 2.1 V corresponding to the Nb51/Nb41 redox couple; then there was a drop in voltage until 1.7 V. Finally, a plateau-like curve in the 1.6 V region, resulting from the insertion of a second lithium atom, corresponds to the Nb41/Nb31 redox couple. As seen in Fig. 6, the redox energy for the Nb51/Nb41 couple of the Fe material lies between the Mn and Cr analogues. These effects are not due to kinetic effects as the electrochemical process continues over subsequent cycles as shown in Fig. 7.
For the Fe-substituted polyanion Nb51/Nb41 was not distinct; however, the results are better than for the Mn-substituted polyanion (Mn0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3) with 2.1 lithium atoms inserted into the structure corresponding to 120 mAh/g. In contrast, with Cr substitution (Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3), Fig. 5c represents that the discharge process has two separate intercalation plateau-like regions at 2.3 and 1.8 V for 0 < x < 1 and 1 < x < 2.3, respectively. It is possible to electrochemically insert 2.3 lithium atoms into the structure with a discharge capacity of 142 mAh/g, Fig. 5c, between 3.2 and 1.5 V voltage range at a current density 0.25 mA/cm2. Since the position of the Nb51/Nb41 redox couple was located in the 2.3 V region in TiNb~PO4) 3 , we may identify the part of the discharge curve in the 2.1 V region in Fig. 5c as corresponding to the insertion of the ﬁrst lithium atom into the formula unit of Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 . 
Although the compound Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 contains chromium phosphate and niobium phosphate as impurities,8 the XRD pattern obtained after charging, is similar to that of the uncycled cathode, except for a peak shift that does not return to its initial value. Here, we have not presented the amount of impurities present in the Mn and Fe compounds and further investigation of the synthesis of both these phosphate materials is underway.
During the subsequent ﬁrst charge, Fig. 6, reversible lithium intercalation occurs for the Cr cation substitution as the cell voltage gradually increases and the plateau is seen in the 2.5 V region, Nb41/Nb51 oxidation, until it reaches the cutoff voltage of 3.2 V. The plateau in the 1.6 V region in the discharge curve corresponding to the Nb31/Nb41 oxidation process is not seen in the charge curve; this may be due to the polarization-related electronic conductors in the cathode material. The total reversible capacity during the ﬁrst charge, Fig. 6c, yields a stoichiometry of Li1.8Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 . The lower stoichiometry obtained here may be due to the thicker electrode used in our experiment. The reversibility obtained for Mn and Fe cation substitution, Fig. 6a and b, shows a comparatively low capacity compared to that of Cr substitution, Fig. 6c.
From these observations, we conclude that the Nb51/Nb41 and Nb41/Nb31 redox couples are operative at 2.2 and 1.6 V with respect to lithium for the Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 and the parent compound TiNb~PO4) 3 . The energy of the redox couple Nb51/Nb41 from over 2.2 V ~in Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3) to 1.9 V ~in Mn0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3) shows that the presence of manganese destabilized the octahedral sites in the structure reﬂecting the Mn21-O-Nb51 interaction. The competition of bonding with oxygen in both Cr0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 and Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4) 3 , which form strong covalent bonds within the same (PO4) 3 complex, so the difference in the Nb51/Nb41 redox energy from 2.3 to 2.1 V of these two compounds must not be due to an inductive effect but rather to an ionic component of the bonding. Figure 7 shows the cycling performance in terms of voltage obtained between the cutoff voltage limits 3.2 and 1.5 V for the frame8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr! vs. discharge work LixM0.5 capacity for the series of trivalent cations. 
The available capacity decreases for the Mn31-substituted (PO4) 32. However, electrodes with Fe31-substituted (PO4) 32 show signiﬁcantly improved capacity retention during cycling, although this is still less than that of Cr31-substituted (PO4) 32. For example, Cr-substituted cells show an initial capacity of 142 mAh/g that decreases to 117 mAh/g after ﬁve cycles, reﬂecting a 16% loss, whereas Fe-substituted cells shows an initial capacity of 120 mAh/g that decreases to 73 mAh/g over the same number of cycles ~40% loss!. The available capacity for Mn-substituted cells decreases from 97 to 60 mAh/g for the ﬁfth cycle reﬂecting a 38% loss of capacity. Apparently, Cr-substituted samples were more tolerant to repeated lithium insertion and extraction than Fe and Mn cationic substitution.
Intercalation of lithium into various transition metal phosphates with NASICON framework has been achieved. By intercalating lithium into materials with a NASICON framework of M2(PO4) 3 M 8 Nb1.5(PO4) 3 with M8 5 ~Mn, Fe, Cr! 5 ~Ti,Nb!, ~Mn,Nb! and M0.5 having different transition metal cations, the position of the redox couples Nb51/Nb41, Nb41/Nb31 with respect to the lithium and the average voltage of metal phosphate cathodes were determined for lithium batteries.
To conﬁrm the validity of the position of the Nb51/Nb41, Nb41/Nb31 redox couples, lithium intercalation was performed on the same (PO4) 3 structure which allows us to gain insight into the factors that relate chemistry and intercalation voltage. The position of the Nb51/Nb41 and Nb41/Nb31 redox couples at 2.3 and 1.6 V were more distinguishable for Cr-substituted (PO4) 32 than the Mn and Fe analogues. From this study it can be seen that even with the same polyanion, (PO4) 32, the variation in trivalent cations can have a profound effect on the position of a given redox couple. These results open up the possibility of many different metals for intercalation cathodes, if they can be synthesized in the correct structure. Cyclic performance was improved by the substitution of Cr for Mn and Fe and this can be explained by the fact that Nb cations in the Cr-substituted (PO4) 32 enhance the stability of the octahedral sites in the structure.
Our work conﬁrms that a transition metal phosphate is technically attractive as a cathode material for lithium batteries. This material is considered to be environmentally friendly and safe to handle, since lithium is only held as the host material. However, with improvement in capacity, materials such as this could improve the overall performance of secondary lithium intercalation cells.
