The NASICON-type doped LiTi(PO4)3 has high lithium-ion conductivity and is stable in aqueous solution with a high lithium-ion content, but is unstable in contact with lithium metal. Therefore, these electrolytes should be protected by a lithium-stable lithium-ion conductor for a cell with a lithium metal electrode. Here we propose a composite solid electrolyte of a high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte film, Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP), coated with a thin polyethylene oxide (PEO) based polymer electrolyte layer. LAGTP coated with PEO containing an ionic liquid and an oxide filler of BaTiO3 (or SiO2) was stable in contact with lithium metal and the interface between the lithium metal and composite electrolyte exhibited low polarization during the lithium deposition and stripping processes.

Solid lithium-ion conductors with high lithium-ion conductivity are promising materials for the development of next-generation rechargeable batteries such as all-solid-state batteries [1], aqueous lithium-air batteries [2], and aqueous lithium batteries [3]. These batteries are respected as high specific energy and power density systems beyond recent that of conventional lithium-ion batteries for electrical vehicles [4,5]. In the last several decades, many types of high lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolytes have been reported, such as Li3N [6], a Li2S-based glass electrolyte [7], perovskite-type La2/3−xLi3xTiO3 (LLTO) [8], NASICON-type Li1−xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (LATP) [9], garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) [10], thio-LiSICON-type Li10GeP2S12 [11], and the Li7S3P11 glass ceramic [12]. The lithium-ion conductivities of these compounds are greater than 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. More recently, Kanno and co-workers [13] have reported a lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolyte of Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3, the conductivity of which is 2.5 × 10−2S cm−1 at 25 °C. The lithium ion conductivity is higher than that of the conventional non-aqueous electrolyte used in lithium-ion batteries. The sulfide based lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes exhibit high lithium ion conductivity; however, they are difficult to handle in the atmosphere because they are quite hydroscopic [14]. LLZ exhibits a high conductivity of around 10−3S cm−1 at room temperature and is stable in contact with lithium metal [10]; however, lithium dendrites are produced during the room temperature lithium deposition process at high current density. An abrupt voltage drop was observed for the Li/0.5 wt% Al2O3−doped LLZ/ Li cell after 1000 s of polarization at 0.5 mA cm2 [15]. The NASICON-type lithium-ion conductor LATP is relatively stable in the atmosphere and a film of LATP can be prepared by conventional tapecasting methods [16]. A thin film with excellent mechanical properties is an important requirement for the electrolyte in batteries to obtain high specific energy density because the weight of the solid electrolyte contributes to a large part of the total cell weight [17]. Zhang et al. [16] reported a lithium-ion conductivity of 1.2 × 10−3S cm−1 at 25 °C for a Li1.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP) film of around 0.2 mm thickness prepared by the tape-casting method. The specific area resistance of the film was as low as 17 Ω cm2 at 25 °C. NASICON-type LAGTP is stable in saturated LiCl aqueous solution [18] and an LAGTP thin film is the best candidate for the separator between a lithium metal anode and an aqueous electrolyte (or aqueous cathode) in aqueous lithium-air [2,19] and aqueous lithium [3,20] batteries. However, solid electrolytes containing Ti4+ and Ge4+, such as LATP, LAGTP and LLTO are unstable in contact with lithium metal because Ti4+ and Ge4+ are reduced to Ti3+ and Ge3+ by lithium metal, which results in the formation of an insulating reduction product [21]. To avoid the direct contact of these electrolytes, a lithium-stable lithium-ion interlayer electrolyte should be used. Visco et al. [22] and Stevens et al. [23] reported Li3N and LiP(N,O) (Lipon), respectively, as candidate interlayer materials. However, they used a sputtering method to prepare the thin films, which is not a practical method to prepare large size electrolyte films. Sunahiro et al.

The NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting LAGTP solid electrolyte film was prepared by a previously reported method [16]. Briefly, LAGTP powder was prepared by the sol-gel method using citric acid. The obtained power was grounded by wet milling with isopropanol using a planetary mill (Fritch Model 7) for 7 h. Fine LAGTP powders were dispersed in a mixed solution of ethanol and toluene (1:1 v/v) with Menhaden fish oil (2 wt% to LAGTP), polyvinyl alcohol (8 wt% to LAGTP) as a binder, and butyl benzyl phthalate (7 wt% to LAGTP) as a plasticizer. After ball-milling for another 24 h using the planetary mill, the slurry was de-aired using a vacuum mixer (Thinky, Japan) before casting to remove air bubbles. Tape-casting was performed on a siliconcoated polyethylene substrate foil using double blades. The green sheets were slowly dried at 5 °C for 24 h. Several green sheets were hot pressed together at 90 °C and then sintered at 900 °C for 7 h.
