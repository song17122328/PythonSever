Sodium-ion conductive glass-ceramics of Na5FeSi4O12 were successfully synthesized through the crystallization of glasses with the composition Na5FeSi4O12. The optimum crystallization conditions and the kinetics of the glasses were examined by diﬀerential thermal analysis. The characterization of crystallization and conduction properties were performed on thus obtained glass-ceramic Na5FeSi4O12 by a non-isothermal modiﬁed Kissinger and complex impedance methods, respectively. The activation energy for crystallization was 279 kJ mol−1 and the sodium-ion conductivity was obtained as 1.33 × 10−3 Scm−1 at 300 °C. To improve the conductivity with a small amount of Si-substitutes, Na5FeSi4O12-isostructural derivatives containing such as B, Al, and Ga were also prepared according to the same crystallization process of glasses with the composition Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 (M = B, Al, Ga). Without phase separation, the ionic conductivities of glass-ceramics were enhanced up to 1.69 × 10−3 at 300 °C on Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12, whereas decreased down to 1.30 × 10−3 and 1.12 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 300 °C on Na5.1FeAl0.1Si3.9O12, and Na5.1FeGa0.1Si3.9O12, respectively.
Oxide-based ceramic materials have been the focus of research be-cause of their high ionic conductivity, in addition to excellent stability [1–13]. Conventional ceramic oxide Na+ conductors such as NASICON (Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12) and β- and β"-alumina (e.g., NaAl11O17 and NaAl5O8) are generally produced by sintering at high temperatures [14–16]. Considering the advantage of manufacturing electrolytes with various shapes through the glass-making process, we have developed glass-ceramics using Na+ conductors. The developed glass-ceramics are phosphorus-containing Na5RSi4O12 (N5)-type (R=rare earth) (Fig. 1)[17,18]Na+-superionic conductors [19,20], according to the compo-sition Na3+3x-yR1-xPySi3-yO9 [21–28]. The conduction properties of N5-type materials are comparable to those conventional polycrystalline Na+-conductors of NASICON and β- and β"-alumina's. Glass-ceramics are produced by crystallizing glasses at temperatures below the melting point, and the conduction properties of glass-ceramics can be rather easily controlled by varying conditions for both melting and crystal-lization [20,23,26]. To date, we have obtained a single phase of N5 using Sc, Y, Gd, and Sm as the R element [28].On the conduction mechanism in the mother Na5RSi4O12 crystalline structure, Na ions are considered from structural analyses to diﬀuse via the vacant sites along c-axis. According to the precedent studies, there are 6 kinds of lattice sites allowed for Na ions, namely, Na (1), Na (2), Na (3), Na (4), Na (5), and Na (6) (20–23). Na (1) to Na (3) (48/90) of those are fully occupied with Na ions inside the rings (Fig. 1), and the other 3 kinds of lattice sites (42/90) are partially ﬁlled to act as the vacancies to form conduction paths.The purpose of the present study is to synthesize compositions of the N5-type family without using rare R elements. Instead, we used Fe, which is abundant and at low cost, by the melt quenching and glass-crystallization method. In N5-type structure, the octahedrally co-ordinated R ions with the non-bridging oxide ions of the 12-membered rings of silica tetrahedra expand the conduction paths for Na+ ions along the c-axis [22]. Considering the role of those ions, we also pre-pared glass-ceramics of B, Al, and Ga-substituted N5-type Na+-super-ionic conductors from glasses with the Na5+xFeMxSi4-xO12 (M = B, Al, Ga; x ≤ 0.1) composition, because the B, Al, and Ga elements with the tetrahedral conﬁguration in the glass can substitute for the Si elements. For improvement of conductivity of the present material, the eﬀects of B, Al, and Ga-substitution on the glass-ceramics, and the micro-structural eﬀects on their conduction properties, were studied.
Because of the limited solubility of solid solutions, glass-ceramics with the composition formula of Na5+xFeMxSi4-xO12 (M = B, Al, Ga; x ≤ 0.1) were used in this study. The precursor glasses were made by melting stoichiometric mixtures of reagent-grade powders of anhydrous Na2CO3,Fe2O3,(H3BO3,Al2O3, or Ga2O3) and SiO2 at 1350 °C for 1 h after calcination at 900 °C. The obtained glasses were grinding and preformed, then subject to uniaxial pressing and cold isostatic pressing, and pellets were obtained. The glass transition temperature (Tg) was determined in advance by diﬀerential thermal analysis (DTA; Rigaku Thermoplus EVO2 TG8121). The pellets were heated at a temperature higher than Tg to produce glass-ceramics. Crystallization was conducted according to a previous report [21]; bulk glasses were heated to a temperature ca. 50 °C of above Tg. This pre-treatment was conducted to obtain homogeneous nucleation. The annealed specimens were heated up to 700−800 °C for 5 h for crystallization.Crystallized bulky specimens were crushed into powders and then subjected to X-ray diﬀraction (XRD; Rigaku MiniFlex II) analysis for the calculation of the hexagonal lattice constants and phase conﬁrmation. The microstructures were investigated with scanning electron micro-scopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-6701F). Ionic conductivities were measured using the alternate current (AC) two-probe method on cylindrical glass-ceramics with a diameter and thickness of 12 mm and 2 mm, respec-tively. Electrodes were prepared by sputtering gold on the polished surfaces. The ionic conductivities were measured by impedance spec-troscopy (Solartron Analytical 1260A Impedance Analyzer and 1296A Dielectric Interface system). The applied AC ﬁeld had a frequency range from 40 to 100 MHz, with a voltage amplitude of 300 mV. The tem-perature dependence of the conductivity was measured similarly at several temperatures ranging from room temperature to 350 °C. The Na+ ion transference numbers of the glass-ceramics were determined by the Wagner polarization method. Electronic conductivities were measured by the direct current (DC) two-probe method using a po-tentiostat (Hokuto Denko HABF5001). The ionic conductivity was es-timated as the total conductivity minus the electronic conductivity.
Because of the solubility limit of solid solution (x = 0.1), we fo-cused hereafter on the Na5.1FeM0.1Si4.9O12 (M = B, Al, Ga) with x = 0.1. The XRD patterns of the produced precursor Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si4.9O12 glass are shown in Fig. 2. According to the XRD patterns, all the produced precursor glasses exhibited an amorphous halo, speciﬁc to the glass. Fig. 3 shows the DTA curve of the produced precursor glass. Table 1 shows the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the crystallization temperature (Tc) and crystal melting tempera-ture (Tm) read from the DTA curve. Regarding the crystallization temperature, it was decided in the previous research [27]. The nu-cleation temperature was chosen as Tg+50 °C, and the nucleus growth temperature was set to the crystal melting temperature from the crys-tallization temperature (Tc2) on the high-temperature side. From the XRD analysis on the thermally treated specimens after at Tc1 and Tc2, we conﬁrmed the crystallization of Na2SiO3 and the Na5FeSi4O12-type phases at those lower and higher temperatures, respectively.
Apparent activation energies for crystallization (crystal growth) were determined by employing the non-isothermal modiﬁed Kissinger methods [29–31], in which certain characteristics of the crystallization peak that were determined by DTA were monitored as a function of heating rate or temperature. The following relationship was then ap-plied.where α is the heating rate (°C s−1), T0 is the peak temperature of crystallization (°C) at a given heating rate, E is the apparent activation energy (kJ mol−1), R is the gas constant, and m and n are the numerical factors which depend on the crystallization mechanism; m depends on the dimensionality of crystal growth. When bulk crystallization occurs with an increasing number of nuclei, i.e., the number of nuclei is in-versely proportional to the heating rate, and the combination of m =3 and n = 4 indicates three-dimensional growth of crystals. In this study,a reasonable assumption was made that parameters of m and n were equal to 3 and 4, respectively, because bulk glasses were heated to a temperature ca. 50 °C of above Tg. Although the molar ratio of Na2O/SiO2 was calculated as 0.65, a little higher than ortho-sodium silicates from the composition of 2.55Na2O-0.5Fe2O3-0.05M2O3-3.9SiO2,we applied the non-isothermal modiﬁed Kissinger method of three-di-mensional growth of crystals to the present materials according to the previous report [28]. This application based on the consideration that Fe2O3 generally takes the same role as modiﬁers as rare-earth ions in the glasses with the composition of Na5RSi4O12.Representative DTA curves with a heating rate of 10−40 °C s−1 for the prepared glasses with Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si4.9O12 are given in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the modiﬁed Kissinger plots for those glasses. Table 2 and Fig. 6 summarize the DTA peak temperatures, which are assigned to crystallization temperature (Tc2) and activation energies of crystal growth obtained from the modiﬁed Kissinger-equa-tion under non-isothermal conditions for the Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si4.9O12 glasses. Because N5-type crystallization proceeds at the higher temperature, the Tc2 peak was used as the crystallization temperature used for calculation of the activation energies for crystal-lization. The activation energies of crystal growth are 363, 491, 355, and 279 kJ mol−1 for Na5FeSi4O12,Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12, Na5.1FeAl0.1Si3.9O12, and Na5.1FeGa0.1Si3.9O12, respectively. The acti-vation energy of crystal growth for the glass-ceramics decreased with increasing Si-substitution element ionic radius, indicating that a small amount of substituting tetrahedra may result in a weakening of the stable silica-tetrahedra-network.An activation energy for crystallization can be attributed to the structural diﬀerence between embryo amorphous and resultant crys-talline substances. Concerning a glass structure, the binding energy of polyhedral M-O bonding dominates the structural rigidity. As Ga be-haves as a modiﬁer in the network structure, Ga-O bonding is com-paratively weaker bonding than Si-O. While Al has an intermediate role in glasses, and the tetrahedral bonding energy of Al is reportedly 421−329 kJ mol−1, somehow smaller than that allowed for Si of 443 kJ mol−1. Those considerations give an explain the decrease in the activation energies of crystallization by doping of Al and Ga to Na5FeSi4O12. Concerning the coordination of B with O, there can be trigonal and tetrahedral coordination; the former gives 487 kJ mol−1, much higher bonding energy than 372 kJ mol−1 for the latter. Additionally, as mentioned above, M ions distribute as tetra-co-ordinated MO4 through Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 structure forming the ske-letal 12-MO4-membered rings. This implies the rearrangement of tri-hedral of BO to tetrahedral coordination during crystallization. Based on those considerations, incorporation of B was deduced to have the higher activation for crystallization than Si.
The crystallization of glasses successfully produced N5-type glass-ceramics with compositions of Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12. The XRD patterns of the N5-type glass-ceramics are shown in Fig. 7, while Table 3 and Fig. 8 summarize the lattice constants of these glass-ceramics. The lattice constants of the glass-ceramics of Na5FeSi4O12 decreased by substitution with smaller B, while those values increased in Na5.1FeAl0.1Si3.9O12 and Na5.1FeGa0.1Si3.9O12 with larger Si-sub-stituting Al and Ga (Fig. 8).The microstructure of glass-ceramics plays a vital role in the con-duction properties, as in the case of polycrystalline ceramics, where conductivity through grain boundaries dominates the whole con-ductivity of glass-ceramics [23,27], improving low-temperature con-duction properties. SEM micrographs of the Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 glass-ceramics are shown in Fig. 9. The glass-ceramics had a very dense microstructure with no pores or cracks and the grain sizes of these glass-ceramic specimens were approximately 4−5 μm. To improve the eﬀects of microstructure on conductivity, our future eﬀorts will focus on investigating the crystallization conditions present for grain growth of more than 10 μm in diameter. Complex impedance diagrams for the Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 glass-ceramics specimens are shown in Fig. 10. The observed complex impedances of all the measured glass-ceramic spe-cimens consisted of two semi-circles at lower temperatures in all spe-cimens. The two intercepting points on the real axis were employed for the calculation of the resistances of crystallized grains (RG) and grain-boundaries (RGB), respectively. The geometrical ratios of thickness to the surface area of GB were used with the same values of G for con-venience because of the undeﬁnable shapes of GB. Thus measured conductivities of the total bulk (σT), σG, and σGB at temperatures of 25, 150, and 300 °C are summarized in Table 4. The values of σT were almost same as or similar to those of σG at higher temperatures of 300 °C, while the conductivities σT were far diﬀerent from those of σGB, but very close to σGB at lower temperatures of 25 °C. This tendency can be clearly seen in the Arrhenius plot of the results obtained on glass-ceramic Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 (Fig. 11): The line of σT is almost coincident with that of σG at higher temperature, while it is very close to that of σGB at lower temperatures. The activation energy of σT (EaT) was therefore close to those of σG (EaG)orσGB (EaGB) in ac-cordance with the correlation of σT with σG or σGB (Fig. 11). The same tendency is seen in all of Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12. The above results suggest that the conduction through grains dominates in the applications such as Na/S batteries at higher temperatures, while the control of grain boundary-conduction is imperative in all-solid-state batteries. To con-ﬁrm the ionic carriers, we here conducted Wagner polarization tech-nique on all specimens, and the V-I result of glass-ceramic Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 is shown as an example in Fig. 12. The electronic conductivities (σe) calculated from the slope of the I-V plots of Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 were of the order of 10−5 Scm−1 at 300 °C, giving the Na+ transference number of more than 0.99 (Table 5). Thus Na5FeSi4O12 and all Na5.1FeM0.1Si3.9O12 glass-ceramics have been conﬁrmed as pure sodium ion conductors.To evaluate the eﬀects of Si-substitutive elements on conductivity for more conductive Na5FeSi4O12-type glass-ceramics, we summarized the results of the correlations of ionic radii (rR) with conductivities (σT, σG, σGB) and activation energies (EaT, EaG, EaGB)in Fig. 13. The eﬀects of Si-substitutive elements on conduction properties of the glass-cera-mics are exhibited in the plots; the conductivity of grains (Fig. 13a and b) with activation energies of G (Fig. 13c) were improved with smaller B, while the substitution with larger Al and Ga showed the opposite tendency. Thus B element for Si-substitution was found eﬀective for the improvement of conduction properties glass-ceramic and Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 was the most conductive glass-ceramics. Although the detailed explanation for this result is still incomplete, a structural consideration can be assumed, where the conduction paths for sodium ions, surrounded with 12-tetrahedra-rings in the a-b planes (Fig. 1), are considered to be widened with the decreased lattice constant with B (Fig. 8).Considering the structural similarity and rather high conductivity, we assume at present the analogous conduction mechanism for our materials to that of the mother Na5RSi4O12. In the structure, larger R ions, coordinated as RO6 octahedra, gave rise to enhancement of con-ductivity because of enlargement of the conduction paths. Considering the analogy with the size eﬀect of RO6 octahedra on conductivity, we experimentally conﬁrmed that smaller B-substitution can evoke ex-pansion of paths for sodium ions with shrinkage in the size of 12-membered tetrahedral rings (see Figs. 1 and 8), and to the contrary, lager Al- and Ga-substitution resulted in decrease in conductivity by expansion of 12-membered tetrahedral.It is noteworthy here that the values of σGB (25 °C) (Fig. 13d) and EaGB also depended upon rR (Fig. 13e), and the conduction properties of Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 were superior to those of Na5FeSi4O12 at lower temperatures. As can be seen from Table 4, the values of EaGB varied from 60.6 for Na5FeSi4O12 down to 59.4 for Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 or up to 61.8 kJ mol−1 for Na5.1FeAl0.1Si3.9O12 by Si-substitution. As these va-lues were much higher than those of dielectric grain-boundaries, glassy matrixes are considered to form grain-boundaries. Comparison of σGB with σT as σT / σGB can indicate the contribution of grain-boundary conduction to the total because the ratio corresponds to RGB / RT. As the examples, the ratios obtained at 300, 150, and 25 °C were evaluated as the sets of (0.20, 0.27, 0.24, 0.29), (0.76, 0.72, 0.75, 0.78), and (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0) for (Na5FeSi4O12,N5.1aFeB0.1Si3.9O12, Na5.1FeAl0.1Si3.9O12,Na5.1FeGa0.1Si3.9O12), respectively. These results indicate the less contribution of grain- boundary conduction to the total at higher temperatures, while the ratio became 1.0 at 25 °C, suggesting the grain-boundary conduction as the dominant factor in the total conduction. It is stressed here again that the same geometrical factor of thickness to surface as grains was applied to grain-boundaries because of the undeﬁnable shape. There was not a large diﬀerence in the ratios among those glass-ceramics.Structural and compositional analyses of grainboundaries are under study for more plausible explanation.
We obtained the glass-ceramics of boron-containing rare earth-free Na5FeSi4O12-type from glasses with a composition of Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 as better Na+-conductors. The activation energies for crystal growth were diﬀerent from that of the rare earth-containing N5-type glass-ceramic determined in a previous study [27]. The acti-vation energy showed a high value when substituted with boron, and a low value when substituted with gallium. The ionic conductivities of glass-ceramics Na5FeSi4O12 and Na5.1FeB0.1Si3.9O12 were 1.33 × 10−3 and 1.69 × 10−3 Scm−1 at 300 °C, respectively.
