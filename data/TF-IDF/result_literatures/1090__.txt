Electrical conductivity of xNa2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass was examined. The electrical conductivity of the glasses increases monotonously with increasing Na2O content, and the glass of 60Na2O–10Nb2O5– 30P2O5 shows the value of σ = 5.6 × 10−8 Scm−1 at room temperature and the activation energy (Ea) of 0.54 eV for Na+ ion mobility from 25 °C to 200 °C. We also examined the fabrication of glass–ceramic composites, which is consisted from Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and 60Li2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass. It found that the mixture of 90 wt.% NaNa3Zr2Si2PO12–10 wt.% 60Na2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass calcined at 900 °C for 10 min, gives σ = 1.2 × 10−4 Scm−1 at room temperature. Na2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass is suitable ﬁller material for solid electrolyte in sodium ion batteries.

Sodium ion batteries are focused as alternative secondary batteries to save material cost recently [1]. Due to the intensive research, many active materials, those energy densities are almost identical with that of lithium ion batteries, are proposed. In cathode, layer rock salt type oxides as well as poly-anion type materials are considered as active materials. We proposed triclinic P1 Na2FeP2O7 that exhibits 3.0 V, 97 mAh/g with good cyclic performance [2–5]. Na2FeP2O7 is also available in aqueous based sodium ion batteries that implies chemical stability is much better than that of layer type oxides [6].

We are proposing unique technique to produce Na2FeP2O7 by crystallization of precursor glass (glass–ceramic route). By using glass– ceramic technique we succeed to fabricate LiFePO4 [7], LiMnFePO4 [8], LiVOPO4 [9], and Li3V2(PO4)3 [10] and so on. In anode side, we are proposing SnO–P2O5 glass [11,12], which exhibits over 340 mAh/g reversible capacity during 25 cycles as well [13]. It is convenient to combine both active materials and solid electrolyte with same phosphate-based materials for all-solid sodium ion batteries. Hayashi et al. proposed all-solid sodium ion batteries by using sulﬁde glass as solid electrolyte [14]. Noguchi et al. also demonstrated solid state sodium ion battery, which is consisted from both Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and anode with Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) solid electrolyte [15]. Furthermore Hayashi et al. succeeded to demonstrate sodium air battery by using of NASICON separator [16]. Therefore the role of NASICON solid electrolyte is important to develop next generation sodium based batteries.

It is well known that NASICON is widely used as solid electrolyte in sodium sulfur (NaS) battery, which is working at 300 °C to get high sodium ion conductivity. In general NASICON ceramics is produced by conventional solid state reaction process. It must be calcined over 1100 °C to reduce electrical resistivity due to grain boundary. When applying NASICON related solid electrolyte to sodium ion battery or sodium air battery, sintering process in high temperature and the presence of voids may disturb the development of new structure batteries. To improve the electrical conductivity of NASICON the addition of glass ﬁller is one of solutions. Sadaoka et al. demonstrated higher electrical conductivity by addition of sodium alumino-silicate glass [17]. However the magnitude of electrical conductivity of alumino-silicate is not high (10−11 Scm−1 at room temperature). Furthermore they require high calcination temperature over 1000 °C to obtain a sintered body. Therefore low melting glass matrix with high ionic conductivity is required. Niobium oxide with alkali containing glass exhibits low melting temperature as well as good alkali ion conductivity [18]. The presence of 4d transition metal oxide Nb2O5 may affect reduction from Nb5+ to Nb0 state during electrochemical reaction however, Ohta et al. found the improvement of ionic conductivity and preventing solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation [19]. In order to improve both of problems we focused niobium phosphate glass. In previous study we reported 60Li2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass, which is able to melt up to 700 °C, exhibits 10−6 Scm−1 conductivity at room temperature [20]. In this study we examined thermal and electrical properties on xNa2O–(60-x) Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass and demonstrated to fabricate glass–ceramic NASICON composites to decrease sintering temperature and times.

Glass with the composition of xNa2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5, x = 30–60 was prepared by a conventional melt-quenching method. Commercial powders of reagent grade Na2CO3, Nb2O5, and NaH2PO4 were mixed together and melted at 1000 °C for 30 min in air using a platinum crucible. The melts were poured on an iron plate and pressed to a thickness of 1–1.5 mm by another iron plate. The glass transition, Tg, and crystallization peak, Tc, temperatures were determined using differential thermal analyses (DTA) at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Densities of the glasses were determined by means of the Archimedes method using distilled water as an immersion liquid. Glass samples with plate and powder shape were crystallized by heat treatments at different temperatures in an electric furnace. Glass powders with the particle size of 32–75 μm were obtained by crushing and grinding bulk plate glasses using an agate mortar. The crystalline phases present in the crystallized samples were identiﬁed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Cu-Kα radiation) at room temperature.

Na3Zr2Si2PO12 crystalline powder was prepared from reagent-grade Na2CO3, NaH2PO4, ZrO2, and SiO2 using conventional solid-state reaction. The raw materials were ball-milled with methanol in ZrO2 pot by using planetary ball mill (Fritsch premium line P-7) at 700 rpm for 2 h, dried at 120 °C, calcinated in air for 4 h at 900 °C, then ground. Pellets were pressed at 400 kg cm−2 and sintered in air for 10 h at 1200 °C. The powder was prepared by milling the sintered ceramics. Pellets of NASICON–glass composites were calcinated in air at 400–900 °C. The prepared pellets were shaped to 12 mm ϕ with 1 mm thickness by uniaxial pressing. Electrical conductivities of the glasses and ceramic composite, i.e., the real (Z′) part and imaginary (Z″) part, were measured by an alternating current (AC) impedance method using an LCR meter (HIOKI 3522-50) with the oscillation level of ±1 V in the frequency range of 0.4 Hz–100 kHz. Gold was sputtered onto the surface of the samples as electrodes. Activation energies for the electrical conductivity of the glasses and glass–ceramics were measured in the temperature range of 25–200 °C.

We obtained colorless transparent bulk glasses in the system of xNa2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5. Prepared sample was characterized by DTA and XRD technique to conﬁrm morphology of samples. The DTA patterns for bulk samples of xNa2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5 glasses are shown in Fig. 1. Endothermic bumps corresponding to the glass transition and exothermic peaks due to the crystallization are observed in Fig. 1. The values of Tg and Tc for other glasses were also determined from DTA patterns and are given in Table 1. We could not conﬁrmed crystallization in the composition x from 30 to 45, on the other hand in x = 55 and 60 it seems sharp crystallization exothermic peaks in Fig. 1. Hence we obtained low glass transition temperature in x = 60 glass.

In order to check the crystallization phase of crystallized glass samples we examined heat-treatment process in an electric furnace to obtain crystallized sample. Fig. 2 shows powder XRD patterns of x = 40–60 at Tc temperature for 3 h. In x = 40 and 45 exhibits no crystallization tendency by means of DTA measurements we decided heat treatment temperature as 600 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 the sample x = 40 and 45 identiﬁed as glassy phase even heating up to 600 °C. For the sample of x = 50 and 55 we could not identiﬁed diffractions as known materials. On the other hand, In the sample x = 60, it seems the main phase is consisted from Na4P2O7. The melting temperature of pure Na4P2O7 is 880 °C. Therefore it is expected that x = 60 sample will be able to melt up to 880 °C. Complex plane impedance plots for bulk glass sample at 25, 60 and 90 °C respectively in x = 50 are shown in Fig. 3. We obtained only one semi-circle spectrum in all compositions and temperature. With an increase in the measuring temperature, the arcs diminished. Similar characteristics were conﬁrmed for the glass–ceramic composites that discussed later. So we decided semi-circle as bulk conductivity of xNa2O–(70 − x) Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass. Typical Arrhenius plots obtained in the temperature region room temperature to 200 °C for glass plates are shown in Fig. 4. For instance, the glass with 60 mol% Na2O shows the value of σ = 5.6 × 10−8 Scm−1 at room temperature. As can be seen in Table 1, the electrical conductivity increases monotonously with increasing Na2O content. It is also seen that the electrical conductivity for the glasses increases with increasing temperature and the Arrhenius relation, i.e., σ = σ0 exp(−Ea/kT), is held very clearly, where σ0, Ea, k and T are the pre-exponential factor, the activation energy, the Boltzmann constant, and the temperature, respectively. The values of Ea evaluated from Fig. 4 are also given in Table 1. It is noted that all glasses give the values of Ea = 0.54 eV, irrespective of the Na2O content. In comparison with xLi2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5 glasses it seems that the magnitude of σ at room temperature is 102 order magnitude small but the Ea is almost identical [20]. These results means that the conduction of electricity is subjected to sodium ion conduction and conduction mechanism might be same in all compositions. As shown in Fig. 2 we obtained crystallized glass by heat-treatment. In the precipitation of niobium related crystalline phase have an inhibitory inﬂuence of sodium ion conduction. On the other hand the sample x = 60 which is composed of Na4P2O7 with high volume fraction exhibits almost identical σ and Ea (σ = 6.5 × 10− 8 Scm− 1 at 25 °C and Ea = 0.45 eV) for mother glass. So we choose the sample x = 60 for glass ﬁller for NASICON ceramics. To ﬁnd out optimal calcination temperature and volume fraction of glass ﬁller, the mixture of NASICON and glass ﬁller (0, 10 and 30 wt.%) was mixed and calcined at 480, 600 and 900 °C for 10 min respectively. The results of XRD measurements are shown in Fig. 6. It was conﬁrmed that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 was identiﬁed in its monoclinic form with ZrO2 as an impurity. Hereafter, a specimen of Na3Zr2Si2PO4 with Ywt.% of 60Na2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass will be referred to as NASICON–Y NMP. It seems the precipitation of NaNbO3 is conﬁrmed as byproduct up to 600 °C in NASICON–30NMP glass. On the other hand, NASICON–10NMP that calcined at 900 °C for 10 min, we conﬁrmed strong diffraction intensity that is identical with that of NASICON ceramics without any byproduct formation. We also show the Arrhenius plots for electrical conductivity in Fig. 7. NaNbO3 is well known as lead-free piezoelectric ceramics [21]. Therefore the formation of NaNbO3 phase is not suitable to improve electrical conductivity. Furthermore most samples that calcined up to 600 °C are hard to keep initial shape due to incomplete sintering. On the other hand, NASICON–10NMP sample with 900 °C calcination gives rigid sintering body. To reﬁne calcination condition for NASICON–10NMP sample at 900 °C we examined electrical conductivity measurements and microscope observations. The sample with 5 min calculation is prone to breakage, meanwhile densiﬁed rigid body was obtained up to 10 min. For 10 min calcined sample we conﬁrmed electrical conductivity σ = 1.2 × 10− 4 Scm− 1 at room temperature. However, slightly drop of sigma was observed at 15 min. Fig. 8 shows the temperature dependence of electrical conductivities (σ) for NASICON–10NMP glass–ceramic composite calcined at 900 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min. Fig. 9 shows some views of the microstructure of the sintered samples.

especially the sample of x = 50 and 55, undeﬁned phase formed with high volume fractions. Therefore we checked again the temperature dependence of σ for crystallized samples and results are shown in Fig. 5. In comparison with mother glass (Fig. 4), crystallized sample exhibits relative low electrical conductivity. In our previous study [20], we also observed same decay of electrical conductivity in Li2O–Nb2O5–P2O5. We conﬁrmed crystallization of Li3PO4 and NbPO5 from mother glass. The value of σ diminished with increase of volume fraction of crystalline phase.

The formation of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 sintered body requires over 1100 °C for long time. Hence the grain growth is unavoidable. On the other hand NASICON–10NMP composite exhibits no grain growth during calcination process. By means of XRD analysis as shown in Fig. 6 though broadening of diffraction that corresponds crystallinity is conﬁrmed but any byproducts are undetected. We are expecting that NMP glass ﬁlls in grain boundary in NASICON ceramics.

In conclusion, we examined thermal properties as well as electrical conductivity of xNa2O–(70 − x)Nb2O5–30P2O5 glasses. We also demonstrated fabrication of NASICON–glass composites to improve electrical resistivity. The ceramic composite with 90 wt.% NASICON– 10 wt.% 60Na2O–10Nb2O5–30P2O5 glass that obtained by heat treatment at 900 °C for 10 min exhibits σ = 1.2 × 10−4 Scm−1 at room temperature. The composite of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 crystalline powder and sodium niobium phosphate glass is a promising material for the solid state sodium ion conductor as well as ceramic separator for sodium air batteries.
