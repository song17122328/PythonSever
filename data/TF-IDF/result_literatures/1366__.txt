Na+-conducting  sodium  dysprosium  (phospho)  silicates  with  the  compositions  Na5DySi4O12,  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na3.9Dy0.6Si3O8.85 were  synthesized  by  solid  state  route.  The  phase  evolution  in  the  three  systems  was  studied  as  a  function  of  heat  treatment  temperature  from  600  8C to  1000  8C  by  X-ray  diffraction  technique.  It  was  possible  to  achieve  a  NASICON  Na5DySi4O12-type  single  phase  with  the  compositions Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na3.9Dy0.6Si3O8.85 at  800  8C.  Heat  treatment  at  a  higher  temperature  (>850  8C)  resulted  in  the  formation  of  a  less conductive  Na9DySi6O18-type  phase.  Conventional  and  microwave  sintering  were  carried  out  on  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 sample  at  800  8C  and  the ionic  conductivities  were  measured  as  a  function  of  temperature  from  75  8C  to  325  8C.  The  microwave  sintered  sample  exhibited  better  Na+ ionic conductivity  of  0.42    10 #

Ever  since  Maximov  et  al.  [1]  discovered  sodium  ionic conductivity  in  the  skeleton  structures  of  Na5RESi4O12 (rare earth,  RE  =  Y),  intensive  research  was  carried  out  to  synthesize materials  having  Na5RESi4O12 (N5)  type  crystal  structure. These  materials  fall  under  the  category  of  NASICON  (Natrium Super  Ionic  Conductors)  family  of  solid  electrolytes  which  can be  sintered  at  lower  temperatures.  NASICON  materials  possess isotropic  ionic  conductivity  of  the  order  0.1  S/cm  at  300  8C  [2] that  are  comparable  to  that  of  sodium  beta  alumina.  The structure  of  the  NASICON  is  one  of  the  factors  that  facilitates fast  ionic  transport  through  the  channels  contributing  to  the ionic  conductivity.  The  possible  mechanism  for  ionic conduction  in  Na5RESi4O12 (RE  =  Y,  Sc)  class  of  compounds was  given  in  [3].  NASICON  solid  electrolytes  ﬁnd  applications in  Na–S  batteries,  gas  sensors  [4]  and  in  recycling  aqueous sodium  waste  from  nuclear  reactors  [5].

Following  this,  extensive  research  was  carried  on  ceramics, glasses  and  glass  ceramics  of  various  compositions  of

Na5RESi4O12 and  isotypic  to  N5  with  the  rare  earths  Sc,  In, Er,  Y,  Gd,  Eu,  Sm,  Nd,  La  [6–9].  A  new  family  of  Na+-superionic conductors  with  composition  formula  Na3+3x yRE1 xPySi3 yO9 was  studied  by  Yamashita  et  al.  [10].  They  obtained  polycrystalline  N5  type  materials  with  Sc,  Y,  Gd,  or  Sm  as  the  rare  earth element  using  the  above  composition  and  investigated  the thermodynamics  and  kinetics  of  the  phase  transformation  in  the Na–Y–P–Si–O  system  of  glass  ceramics  [11].  They  had  shown that  N5  phase  was  unstable  in  the  Na–Y–Si–O  system  but phosphorous  inclusion  aided  the  formation  of  N5  phase  and found  Na3.9Y0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 composition  superior  to  others  with regard  to  ionic  conductivity.  Balagopal  et  al.  [12]  synthesized Na5DySi4O12 and  reported  conductivity  of  1.1    10  2 S/cm  at 70  8C.  They  also  tested  its  use  as  electrolyte  in  the  electrolysis  of an  aqueous  alkali  metal  salt  solution.  Souda  and  Shimizu synthesized  Na5DySi4O12 and  studied  its  chemical  stability  [13] and  sensing  properties  in  detecting  SO2 gas.  They  reported  an ionic  conductivity  value  of  1.0    10  1 S/cm  at  300  8C  [4]. However  detailed  study  on  the  formation  of  various  phases  in Na–Dy–Si–O  system  and  their  stability  has  not  yet  been  reported. Microwave  processing  of  ceramic  materials  has  been investigated  over  the  last  two  decades  by  various  researchers [14–16].  The  growing  interest  in  microwave  processing  over conventional  processing  methods  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the

electromagnetic  wave  interacts  with  ceramic  materials  leading  to volumetric  heating  by  dielectric  loss,  which  enhances  rate  of densiﬁcation,  decreases  densiﬁcation  temperature  and  improves microstructure  uniformity,  as  well  as  product  properties.  Also this  unique  heating  method  has  the  potential  for  energy  savings and  cost  cutting  when  compared  to  conventional  heating.

for  Na+-conducting  solid electrolytes  for  use  at  temperatures  <  98  8C  (melting  point of  Na)  to  prevent  the  problems  of  corrosion  due  to  liquid  Na, which  is  one  of  the  electrodes  when  conventional  sodium  ion conductors  are  employed  as  solid  electrolytes,  investigations were  carried  out  on  few  compositions  in  Na–Dy–Si–(P)–O system.  In  this  work,  we  report  the  phase  evolution  in  three compositions  namely;  Na5DySi4O12,  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and Na3.9Dy0.6Si3O8.85,  as  a  function  of  temperature.  The  phase ﬁeld  stability  of  superionic  conductive  N5  phase  was  also determined.  The  microwave  sintering  of  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 has  been  reported  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  literature  and  ionic conductivities  of  the  microwave  sintered  material  have  been compared  with  those  of  a  conventionally  sintered  material.

Ceramic  materials  with  the  compositions  Na5DySi4O12, Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na3.9Dy0.6Si3O8.85 were  synthesized by  solid  state  reaction  method  by  blending  stoichiometric amounts  of  reagent  grade  powders  of  Na2CO3 (Merck; assay    99.5%),  Dy2O3 (Alfa  Aesar;  purity  –  99.9%),  SiO2 (MK  Impex  Corp.;  purity  –  99.9%),  and  NH4H2PO4 (Qualigens;  assay    99%)  by  ball  milling  for  24  h  using  zirconia  balls in  acetone.  The  dried  powders  were  compacted  into  10  mm diameter  disks.  The  disks  were  heat  treated  at  various temperatures  from  600  8C  to  1000  8C  for  time  duration  of 6  h,  then  ground  and  again  pelletized  into  6  mm  diameter  disks for  sintering.  Microwave  sintering  was  carried  out  using  a  6  kW microwave  (MW)  sintering  furnace  (Linn  Hightherm  GmbH,

Germany)  at  a  temperature  of  800  8C  for  2  h.  The  sample  was placed  inside  a  casket  containing  SiC  susceptors.  Conventional sintering  was  also  carried  out  at  800  8C  for  6  h.  The  densities  of conventional  and  MW  sintered  compacts  were  measured  using Archimedes  principle.

The  crystalline  phases  of  the  heat  treated  powders  and sintered  pellets  were  identiﬁed  by  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD) technique  using  Bruker  D8  AXS  Advance  X-ray  diffractometer with  Cu  Ka radiation  (l  =  1.5406  A˚ ).  Ionic  conductivities  of sintered  pellets  were  measured  with  blocking  silver  electrodes using  Solartron  AC  impedance  analyzer  in  the  frequency  range 10  Hz–10  MHz  over  a  temperature  range  from  75  8C  to  325  8C. The  microstructure  of  the  conventional  and  microwave  sintered samples  was  observed  under  scanning  electron  microscope (SEM,  Hitachi  S3400N).

Fig.  1  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  the  samples  heat  treated  at different  the  composition Na5DySi4O12 (C-1).  It  should  be  mentioned  here  that  the number  of  XRD  patterns  present  the  JCPDS  database corresponding  to  Na–Dy–Si–O  system  are  less  since  it  is  not  so well  investigated.  However  since  the  ionic  radius  of  Dy3+ (0.90  A˚ )  is  close  to  that  of  Y3+ (0.89  A˚ )  and  Gd3+ (0.93  A˚ ),  the obtained  phases  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  system  were  analyzed  using patterns  present  in  the  Na–Y–Si–O  and  Na–Gd–Si–O  systems expecting  similarities  in  crystal  structure  patterns.  Henceforth, the  phases  Na5DySi4O12 (PDF  #  00-085-0536),  Na9DySi6O18 (iso  structural  to  Na9YSi6O18;  PDF  #  00-035-0406),  Na3DySi2O7 (iso  structural  to  Na3YSi2O7;  PDF  #  00-035-0405)  and NaDySiO4 (iso  structural  to  NaGdSiO4;  PDF  #  04-011-6096) will  be  referred  to  as  N5,  N9,  N3  and  N1,  respectively.  It  is  clear in  N1  +  N9  at  800  8C, from  Fig.  1

N3  +  N9  +  N5  at  900  8C  and  1000  8C  with  N9  being  the  major phase  at  1000  8C.  There  is  no  single  phase  obtained  between 800  and  1000  8C  and  is  always  a  mixture  of  phases  obtained  at all  the  three  temperatures.  A  similar  kind  of  result  was  observed when  Na5DySi4O12 was  tried  to  be  synthesized  by  wet  chemical route  [17].  Heat  treatment  beyond  1000  8C  also  did  not  result  in a  single  phase.  Yamashita  et  al.  [11]  reported  a  similar observation  for  Na–Y–Si–O  system  and  found  that  Na5YSi4O12 type  phase  could  only  be  stabilized  by  doping  phosphorous  in Si4+ sites,  since  undoped  Na5YSi4O12 was  thermodynamically unstable  phase  when  compared  to  Na9YSi6O18.  Keeping  this  in mind  we  have  sodium dysprosium  silicate  and  studied  the  composition  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 (C-2).  Fig.  2  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  the  samples heat  treated  at  various  temperatures  corresponding  to  C-2.  We found  that  there  is  unreacted  Dy2O3,  SiO2 and  the  formation  of N3  phase  has  started  at  600  8C.  At  700  8C,  there  is  still  an unreacted  mixture  but  amount  of  unreacted  components  is  little compared  to  the  amount  present  at  600  8C  and  the  N3  phase  is synthesized  phosphorous  doped 

developed.  The  phases  at  800  8C  and  850  8C  correspond  to  N5 which  was  reported  to  have  good  ionic  conductivity  in  the literature.  It  is  also  seen  that  at  800  8C  and  850  8C  there  are  no peaks  corresponding  to  Dy2O3,  SiO2 and  also  the  N3  phase which  was  present  at  700  8C  has  transformed  fully  to  N5  phase. A  single  phase  having  N5-type  structure  was  obtained  between 800  and  850  8C.  Heat  treatment  at  950  8C  resulted  in  the formation  of  N9  phase  along  with  N5  phase  that  was  previously formed.  A  variation  to  the  compositions  C-1  and  C-2  was  taken as  Na3.9Dy0.6Si3O8.85 (C-3)  by  maintaining  the  ratio  of  Na/Dy same  as  to  that  present  in  C-2.  It  is  observed  from  the  XRD patterns  in  Fig.  3  that  heat  treatment  at  600  8C  and  700  8C  did not  result  in  the  formation  of  any  new  phase  except  the unreacted  phases.  It  was  found  that  800  8C  was  favorable  for the  formation  of  N5  phase  in  C-3  whereas  900  8C  and  1000  8C resulted  in  N9  phase  along  with  N5.  At  1000  8C  N9  is  the  major phase  while  N5  is  the  minor  one.  In  one  case  of  study  with  the rare  earth  yttrium  using  Na3.9Y0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 composition  by Yamashita,  less  conducting  N3  or  N9  phases  were  formed  as  the

precursor  phases  (in  the  synthesis  of  N5  phase)  and  transformed to  N5  phase  at  higher  temperatures  [18].  In  our  case,  we  found that  N9  phase  started  to  appear  at  about  900  8C  in  C-2,  C-3  and the  percentage  amount  of  that  phase  increased  with  increasing temperature  in  both  the  cases.  We  can  expect  a  single  N9  phase at  higher  temperatures,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  results reported  in  [18].  The  above  observation  imposed  a  restriction on  the  sintering  temperature  to  get  dense,  single  phase  N5-type structure.  The  effect  of  heat  treatment  temperature  in  three compositions  is  summarized  in  Fig.  4.  In  order  to  study  the ionic  conductivities,  a  dense  compact  with  single  phase  N5type  structure  was  necessary  since  it  has  been  reported  that  a single  phase  material  with  N5-type  structure  exhibited  high Na+-ionic  conductivity  [4,5,12]  at  low  temperatures  (70  8C), when  compared  to  conventional  sodium  ion  conductors.  Hence, sintering  was  carried  out  at  800  8C  by  conventional  and microwave  heating  methods  on  green  samples  of  dimensions 10  mm  diameter;  3  mm  thick  and  6  mm  diameter;  4  mm  thick, respectively.  The  dimensions  of  samples  after  sintering  were 9.2  mm  diameter;  2.7  mm  thickness  and  5.5  mm  diameter; 3.9  mm  thickness  for  conventional  and  microwave  sintering. The  active  area  considered  for  evaluation  of  ionic  conductivity was  0.66  and  0.237  cm2 for  the  conventional  and  microwave sintered  samples,  respectively.  The  densities  of  the  samples  were found  to  be  3.01  g/cm3 (conventional)  and  2.97  g/cm3 (MW) which  were  93%  and  92%  of  theoretical  density,  respectively.

Figs.  5(a–c)  and  6(a–c)  shows  Nyquist  plots  of  conventional and  microwave  sintered  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 samples  at different  (10  Hz– 10  MHz).  At  all  temperatures,  a  single  semicircle  with  a  straight line  low frequency  real impedance  axis  could  be  used  to  determine  the  bulk  resistance of  the  sample.  The  bulk  electrical  conductivity  (sB)  is  written sB =  (t/RB   A),  where  t  is  the  thickness  and  A  is  the  area  of  the electrode  deposited  on  the  sample.  Fig.  7  shows  the  Nyquist  plot of  conventional  and  microwave  sintered  samples  at  325  8C.  The microwave  sintered  sample  was  seen  to  show  lower  resistance when  compared  that  of  conventional  sintered  sample. Electrical  conductivities  were  evaluated  for  the  two  samples at  325  8C.  The  ionic  conductivity  of  microwave  sintered  sample (0.42    10  2 S/cm)  is  higher  than  conventional  sintered  sample (0.43    10  3 S/cm).  Fig.  8  shows  the  Arrhenius  plot  of  the  AC conductivity  of Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 samples  as  a  function  of  temperature. The  log  (sT)  versus  1/T  plot  consists  of  two  straight  lines  for  both the  samples.  The  activation  energy  for  electrical  conduction  (Ea) can  be  calculated  from  the  slopes  of  straight  lines.  It  was  found that  the  activation  energy  was  less  up  to  125  8C  and  increased above  125  8C.  The  Ea values  were  found  to  be  0.73  eV  and 0.87  eV  for conventional  and  microwave  sintered  samples,  respectively.

seen  to  have  resulted  in  a  product  with  uniform  grain  structure. The  ionic  conductivity  values  for  microwave  sintering  are higher  than  the  conventionally  sintered  counterparts  though  the activation  energy  for  microwave  sintering  is  higher.  In  order  to ﬁnd  out  the  cause  for  improved  conductivity  in  case  of  the  MW sintered  sample,  XRD  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  sintered pellets  to  verify  whether  the  phases  were  still  retained  after sintering  at  800  8C.  It  was  observed  that  conventionally  sintered pellet  consisted  of  N5  and  N9  phases  almost  in  equal proportions  where  as  the  microwave  sintered  pellet  has  N5 as  the  major  phase  with  trace  amounts  of  N9  phase.  This  must have  been  ionic
