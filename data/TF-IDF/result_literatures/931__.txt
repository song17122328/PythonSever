In this work, the solid electrolyte Na3+xZr2-xMxSi2PO12, M = Ce4+, Gd3+ and Yb3+ compounds weresynthesized by a solid state reaction.

The ceramic samples were sintered in the temperature range1150-1300 C with 5 h holding time.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compleximpedance spectroscopy (IS) were used as experimental techniques.

The investigated compounds atroom temperature belong to monoclinic symmetry, and Ce4+, Gd3+ and Yb3+ ions substitution rangedecreases with increases of x, therefore, optimal concentration was fixed at x = 0.1.Results showed thesignificant influences of dopant ions and the processing condition on the microstructure andconductivity of these ceramics.

Dense Ce4+ and Gd3+ doped samples were obtained at higher sinteringtemperature than Yb3+ doped and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics.

A drop in grain boundary conductivity due toglassy phase formation in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Yb3+ doped compounds was observed.

Maximumconductivity value at room temperature was obtained for Na3+xZr1.9Ce0.1Si2PO12 sample.

Sodium ion conducting solid electrolytes are important for awide variety of application ranging from energy storage toindustrial process control [1,2].

Among the sodium ion conductingsolid electrolytes, Na1+xZr2Si2P3-xO12 (0 <x <3) which named asNASICON (Sodium (Na) Super (S) Ion (I) Conductor (CON)) hasattracted the attention of researchers.

NASICON, a rigid, threedimensional networks with suitable tunnel size for Na+ migrationin three dimensions was proposed for the first time by Hong andGoodenough et. al [3].

These compounds (Na1+xZr2Si2P3-xO12) arepossessing high conductivity, often comparable to that liquidelectrolytes at higher temperatures, therefore, these materials hasbeen proposed for use as a solid electrolyte in devices such asmembranes, fuel cells and gas sensors [4].

The highest sodium ionconductivity is observed for compositions between x = 1.8 and 2.4,with a monoclinic structure.

The NASICON structure consists of arigid three- dimensional network of PO4 (SiO4) tetrahedral andZrO6 octahedral sharing corners.

This framework, containsinterconnected channels which provides the conduction pathwayfor the Na+ ions [3,4].

These conduction pathways determined“bottlenecks” which significantly dominate the ionic mobility.

Theionic conductivity depends on the concentrations of mobile ionand ionic mobility, in other words, the Na+ ion content and the sizeof bottleneck.

The ionic mobility and the mobile ion content could be changedby substituting the ions forming the structure by equi and/oralivalent ions.

Therefore, many attempts have been reported on thesubstitution of Zr4+ ions in octahedral sites with di-, tri ortetravalent cations.

Results showed that partial substitution of di ortri valent cation for Zr4+ ion enhanced the conductivity byincreasing the mobile ion content and tetravalent cationssubstitution for Zr4+ ion caused a geometrical constraint on themobile ion [5,6]. Y. Miyajima et al.[7] reported lanthanide ions (Yb,Er and DY) substituted compound Na1+xZr2MxP3O12 and investigated the change of crystal parameter and conductivity.

It wassuggested that the bottleneck size dominates the ionic conductionof the structure Kenji et al.[5] have reported the substitution of Zr4+ ion with Ti4+ in the system Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 and discussed therelation between unit cell volume and conductivity.

It wasindicated the effective bottleneck depends on geometry ratherthan polarizing power of Ti4+ or Zr4+ ions.

The substitution of Zr4+ inNa3Zr2Si2PO12 with metal ions such as Mg2+, Zn2+, Y3+, Ti4+, Sn4+, V 5+, Nb5+ and Ta5+ in well sintered ceramics have resulted higherconductivities than the conductivity of NASICON [8].

Furthermore,density and nature of the grain boundary have effects on total ionicconductivity [8–12].

Some reports on microstructure showed thatthe NASICON ceramics often are not monophase and a glassy phasewhich is basically a sodium silicophosphate with some dissolvedzirconia results from the liquid phase formed during sintering[2,12–14].

Therefore, some attempts have been made to improvethe phase purity including chemical synthesis method [9,15–17]doping strategy [9,14,18] and spark plasma sintering route [13].

The purpose of this work is to attempt for improving thecharacteristics of NASICON prepared by solid state reaction.

Forthis aim, research was done on Ce4+, Gd3+ and Yb3+ ionssubstitution in the system of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and thoroughdiscussion was made on based on microstructure and electricalconductivity (grain and grain boundary) in the doped and undopedceramics.

Nasicon-type material series with composition Na3+xZr2-xMxSi2PO12, x = 0.1 and M = Ce4+, Gd3+ and Yb3+ was synthesizedby solid state reaction followed by sintering.

The processing andsinterability of NASICON materials can be influenced by thesesubstitution ions.

The major consequences of the substitution ofCe3+ and Gd3+ for Zr4+ were the production of ceramics withhomogenous microstructure without obvious liquid phase and inparticular high conductivities.

The sintering temperature affectedon content of monoclinic zirconia at final product, loweringsintering temperature led to loss of monoclinic zironia in Ce3+ andGd3+ doped samples.

Ac impedance studies indicated that thegrain-boundary contribution to the total (bulk + grain-boundary)resistance is appreciable for NASICON based undoped and Yb3+doped ceramics but in the Ce4+ and Gd3+ substitution samples itdecreases.

The total electrical conductivity strongly depends on thesubstitution dopant, density of samples and the nature of the grainboundaries.
