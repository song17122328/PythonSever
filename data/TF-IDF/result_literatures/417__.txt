The peak-loading shift function of sodium-ion batteries in large-grid energy store station poses a giant challenge on the account of poor rate performance of cathodes. NASICON type Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable three-dimensional framework and fast ion diffusion channels has been regarded as one of the potential candidates and extensively studied. Nevertheless, a multilevel integrated tactic to boost the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in terms of crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design is rarely reported and deserves much attention. In this study, organic ferric was used to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode on the account of low cost, environmental friendliness, and catalytic function of Fe on carbon graphitization. The density functional theory calculation depicts that the most stable site for Fe atom is the V site and moderate replacement of Fe at V position would reduce the band gap energy from 2.19 by 0.43 eV and improve the electron transfer, which is crucial for the intrinsic poor conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. The experimental results show that Fe element can be introduced into the bulk structure successfully, modulating relevant structural parameters. In addition, the coated carbon layer graphitization degree is also regulated due to the catalysis function of Fe. And, the decomposition of organic ferric would infuse the formation of porous structure, which can promote electrolyte permeation and shorten the electron/ion diffusion. Finally, the optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C could possess a high capacity of 103.69 mA h g–1 and retain 91.45% after 1200 cycles at 1.0C as well as 94.45 mA h g–1 at 20C. In addition, the excellent performance is comprehensively elucidated via ex situ X-ray diffraction and pseudocapacitance characterization. The multifunction contribution of Fe-doping may provide new clue for designing porous electrode materials and a new sight into Fe-doped carbon-coated material.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as a potential available technology instead of lithium-ion batteries in the domain of large-scale storing energy owing to their abundant resource and competitive cost benefit. (1,2) Nevertheless, it is still a huge challenge to hunt for befitting electrode materials to meet the requirement of a long lifespan cycling stability and a high rate performance. A range of materials have been exploited and surveyed as cathodes for SIBs, such as NaxMxO2, (3,4) Na2Fe2(C2O4)3·2H2O, (5) and organics. (6,7) Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is of particular interest owing to its relatively decent high theoretical specific capacity (117.6 mA h g–1), high potential platform (3.4 V), benign thermodynamic stability, and rapid Na-ion diffusion channel. (8) Noted that the combined motion of ion and electron within solid is of equal importance. (9) However, the high ionic transfer capacity of NVP is restricted by inferior electronic conductivity, which results in bad rate performance and inferior cycling stability. (10)
At present, three major strategies have been used to promote the electrochemical characteristics of NVP: (i) introducing alien ions; (ii) coating conductive carbon material; and (iii) reducing particle sizes. Among them, introducing foreign ions could adjust crystal structure, coating conductive carbon material focuses on improving the intrinsic poor electron conductivity, and reducing particle size could be helpful for shortening the ion/electron diffusion pathway. Many research institutes have certified that transition-metal ion substituted in the bulk structure of NVP compound exerted beneficial effects on the electrochemical performance by changing the original charge distribution and promoting the intrinsic electronic conductivity. (11,12) For instance, Fe ions were proved to be effective to modulate the crystal structure and beneficial for enhanced electrochemical performance. (13) The surface carbon coating mainly improves the whole electronic conductivity of NVP electrode. And relevant research proposed that transition metal element could regulate coated carbon graphitization. (14) Wang et al. successfully prepared nanotubes from Prussian blue, indicating that Fe element could promote carbon graphitization as a catalyst. (15) Furthermore, the nanosized particles would improve ionic and electronic conductivity by shortening the diffusion distance. (16) Nevertheless, previous studies mostly focus on single aspect. And, few reports were carried out on the simultaneous consideration of the above results.
Hence, so as to make the most of and expand the potential of NVP cathode, a combination strategy including crystal structure modulation, coated carbon graphitization regulation, and particle morphology design was proposed and fulfilled to prepare Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode. The function mechanism of Fe substitution on the modification of the crystal structure and the characteristics of the doped materials are investigated thoroughly by density functional theory (DFT) calculation and experimental results. The results indicate that Fe3+ could regulated carbon layer and bulk phase. Compared with undoped NVP@C, the moderate Fe3+-replaced Na3V2–xFex(PO4)3@C (x = 0–0.25) composites possess tuned structure, porous morphology, and promoted carbon graphitization, which finally result in enhanced electronic conductivity and superior Na+ storage performance.

The Na3V2–xFex(PO4)3@C samples, where x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25, were manufactured by a sol–gel process with Na2CO3, NH4VO3, NH4H2PO4, FeC2O4·2H2O, and citric acid monohydrate as raw materials. Citric acid was added both as complexant and carbon reductant. In the first place, citric acid was dissolved in deionized water at 25 °C to form a transparent solution with perpetual stirring. Then, the mixture of stoichiometric Na2CO3, NH4VO3, FeC2O4·2H2O, and NH4H2PO4 (3:2 – x:x:3, x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25) is added to the above citric acid solution under the condition of vigorous stirring until a gel was fully developed at 80 °C. The ground gel was first preheated to 350 °C for 4 h and then sintered at 800 °C for 8 h under flowing argon atmosphere with rise in temperature at the rate of 5 °C min–1, followed by cooling to 25 °C naturally. Ultimately, the above product was slightly ground to yield Na3V2–xFex(PO4)3@C. All chemical reagents used in the designed experiments were of analytical grade and used without any further treatment. In addition, Na3V2–xFex(PO4)3@C with various contents of Fe with x = 0, 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25 are denoted as NVFP00, NVFP05, NVFP15, and NVFP25, respectively.

The electron conductivity of four samples was recorded by means of four-probe. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted at room temperature in the 2θ degree window of 10–80° with Cu Kα as radiation source, and the following Rietveld measurement was made to analyze the phase composition. Morphology observation was recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, EM30 plus, COXEM) with additional energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Besides, high-resolution and ordinary transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM and TEM, JEM-1400Flash) tests were implemented for revealing structure information. Information of carbon phase was obtained from the pattern of Raman spectra (532 nm blue, laser GS6000). The carbon content was measured by elemental analysis (carbon and sulfur analyzer, HW2000C). The valence state messages of elements on the surface were collected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the machine of Kratos Analytical Ltd. Structure information was further investigated using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrum on the machine of Thermo Nicolet FTIR based on the KBr as a diluter in the wavelength window of 500–2500 cm–1. 13C and 23Na spectra were measured by solid-state NMR (SSNMR) method. In detail, the 13C spectra were conducted at 9.4 T using a Bruker AVANCE III HD 400MHz NMR spectrometer and the H/X double resonance solid probe. For 23Na, the NMR spectra were recorded with a JNM-ECZ600R/M1 spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 14.09637 T. In addition, the pore diameter distribution and the specific surface area were obtained by nitrogen adsorption–desorption curves.

The formation energy of Fe-doped Na3V1.85 Fe0.15(PO4)3 was calculated by the first-principles calculations. Here, the density functional theory (DFT) computation was applied using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (17) with projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. (18) Electron exchange–correlation was represented by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof functional of generalized gradient approximation (GGA). (19) All calculations were based on the cutoff energy of 500 eV. The total energy and the force on each atom were converged to within 10–5 eV and 0.02 eV Å–1, respectively. The Brillouin zone integrations were conducted by employing γ 1 × 1 × 1 for geometric optimization, and van der Waals dispersion with the D3 method of Grimme was regarded for all operations. (20)

The coin-type CR2025 cells were fabricated in a glovebox with Argon filling, with water and oxygen levels both less than 0.1 ppm. All electrodes were prepared from a compound of active material, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) with N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as dispersing agent, and acetylene black. Besides, the ratio of active material, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and acetylene black is 80:7:13 based on weight mass. The slurry was coated onto aluminum foil by an automatic doctor blading machine and the average loading mass of the electrode is 2–3 mg. For the full cell performance evaluation, the anodes were manufactured by blending commercial hard carbon (80 wt %), PVDF (10 wt %), and acetylene black (10 wt %) with NMP as solvent and then cladded on the one side of a copper foil. Besides, all electrodes were vacuum dried at 120 °C for 12 h before fabrication. After drying, the reference electrodes were metal sodium (half-cell) or hard carbon (full cell) as for cells assemble and the separator glass was fiber (GF/D, Whatman) and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (49:49:2, v/v) was used as electrolyte. The cells would be placed for more than 12 h for complete electrolyte penetration. In half-cell electrochemical measurement, constant charging–discharging tests were conducted using a testing system of NEWARE BTS-610 in the voltage window of 2.3–4.3 V (vs Na/Na+). For more objective evaluation of the full cell performance, the hard carbon anode was pretreated with three discharge/charge cycles. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of all electrodes were obtained at different temperatures employing an electrochemical workstation (SHCH-CHI750E) with the frequency window of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz in an open-circuit potential condition with an interference signal of 5 mV. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of different scan rates were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai, China).

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was first carried out to confirm the introduction of Fe into NVP (Table S1). The molar ratios of Na, V, Fe, and P for the samples with different Fe-substituted addition is consistent with the designed values, which implies that a portion of V atoms were favorably replaced by alien Fe ions. Since there are two species of positions accessible for ion doping (the Na-occupied sites and the V-occupied sites), it is important to determine the doping position of Fe element (Figure S1). XPS was carried out and used to detect the doping site of Fe based on the oxidation state of Fe and V (Figures 1a,b and S2). The V 2p XPS spectra show two peaks centered at ∼516.4 and ∼522.6 eV, which could be attributed to V3+. (21) And the peaks at ∼712.1 and ∼725.8 eV of Fe 2p could be attributed to Fe3+. (22) Another small peak at 716.0 eV may reflect the satellite of Fe 2p3/2. (23) The slight shift of V 2p to high binding energy and Fe 2p to low binding energy may be related to the interaction of Fe and V. And the XPS result summary reveals that the introduction of Fe would not make obvious difference in the oxidation state of V (Table S2). Li has put forward an efficient method to determine the preferable doping site in polyanion materials, (24,25) and the reference formula was used as follows

Herein, rM and XM represent the ionic radius and electronegativity of the dopant and rM1(2) and XM1(2) are the ionic radius and electronegativity of the substituted ion, respectively. When the value of DM1 is less than DM2, the dopant ions tend to go to the M1 position, otherwise the value of DM1 is greater than DM2 and the dopant is apt to occupy the M2 position. Based on the above formula, for Fe3+-doped NVP, DV = 0.260 and DNa = 1.373. Evidently, DNa is larger than DV, which indicates that the V-occupied sites are more popular for Fe3+ to take up in NVP rather than the Na position, conforming the design results.
The doping occupied positions were also verified by first principle calculations. Three possible sites could be supplied for iron atom, as shown in Figure 1c–e. One possible site is Na and the other two sites are V and P. The formation energy of Fe-doped different sites is 2.86, 0.5, and 1.02 eV for Na, V, and P, respectively, as shown in Figure 1f. The smallest formation energy of Fe doped into V site means that Fe atom tends to replace vanadium and then forms a more suitable structure, which is in accordance with the results obtained by Li. Moreover, the XRD pattern by DFT is consistence with the pattern recorded in the experiment (Figure S3). In addition, a reduced band energy caused by Fe doping was demonstrated by first principle calculation. Figure 1g shows that the band gap of NVFP15 would significantly decrease with the introduction of Fe3+ ions into the structure. The pristine band energy of NVFP00 and NVFP15 are 2.19 and 1.76 eV, respectively. The decreased band energy may result from different spin configurations of the 3d orbital for Fe3+ and V3+. Meanwhile, the band gap energy could reflect the electrical conductivity, and the smaller band energy could obtain better electron conductivity. (26) And the test results of electron conductivity of four samples are 7.14 × 10–2, 8.25 × 10–2, 9.24 × 10–2, and 9.36 × 10–2 S cm–1, respectively, which demonstrates that the electron conductivity would increase with the addition of iron content.
Further, the oxidation state of Fe in raw material (FeC2O4·2H2O), which was oxidized by V5+ of NH4VO3, is +2. (27) So, Fe2+ could act as a reagent and the decomposition of FeC2O4 could also produce carbon, which could reduce the use of citric acid as a reductant during the preparation process. Thus, with increase in added iron, more citric acid could be used as the carbon source, leading to the increase in carbon content (Table S3) to 4.40, 4.41, 4.47, and 5.30% for NVFP00, NVFP05, NVFP15, and NVFP25, respectively. This type of process could be denoted as VSC doping, which means the valence state of the doping element would change during the process of synthesis and has proved to provide better doping results. (27)
Second, the Fe-doping effect on the crystal texture was explored via XRD (Figure 2a). All of the diffraction peaks could be traced back to the rhombohedral structure with the R3̅c space group (JCPDS No. 53-0018) and no other peaks belonging to impurity could be detected, indicating that low dose replacement of Fe into NVP would not alter the structure. No peaks corresponding to carbon appeared, illustrating the amorphous its characteristic. Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns (Figure S4) for four samples was performed. The decreased lattice parameters compared to the pristine sample may be related with minored radius of Fe3+ (0.064 nm) than that of V3+ (0.074 nm). NVFP15 possesses the least lattice parameters (Table S4), which suggests a more stable structure and an enhanced cycle performance. (22) In addition, the increased NVFP25 sample has a larger cell volume than NVFP05 and NVFP15, possibly due to the larger original radius of Fe2+ (0.076 nm). The FTIR results were recorded to reveal more structural information (Figure 2b). The two peaks located at 504 and 634 cm–1 could be allocated to elastic vibrations between V3+–O2– bond. Moreover, the intense and large band (in the range of 1000–1200 cm–1) consisting of one vibration or two vibrations and the peak at 573 cm–1 could be attributed to the PO4 tetrahedron. An increased intensity with increased Fe reflects the decreased distances of V–O and P–O bonds, which would strengthen the structure’s stability. (27,28) These above results could be evidence that Fe could be successfully introduced into the bulk structure and regulate related structural lattice parameters and bond distances, which could boost the structure’s stability.

23Na and 13C SSNMR spectroscopies were also conducted to further investigate the Fe-doping mechanism in the bulk structure and carbon layer, as shown in Figures 2c and 3d. In Figure 2c, there are two peaks located at −9 and 6 ppm. According to the crystal structure information, there are two species of sodium ions: the first one is bonded to a triangular prism position (labeled as M2) and there are two sodium ions and the other is in the octahedral position (labeled as M1) and there is only one sodium ion in the structure. (29) By analyzing the line intensity, the peak at −9 ppm could be indexed to the sodium ion at the M1 site and the peak at 6 ppm could related to the sodium ion at the M2 site. (30) After Fe doping, more obvious signal of sodium ion at the M1 site could be recorded because the different radius of Fe3+ generates lattice distortion atom and the sodium ion at the M1 site is exposed to the testing environment. And the slight shift of sodium ion at both M1 site and M2 site may also hint Fe doping into the bulk structure. Two peaks observed at 152 and 159 ppm could account for the existence of the sp213C in Figure 2d. (31) Another interesting thing is that after introducing Fe element into the system, the 13C spectrum also changed a lot, which indicates that Fe atom could change the electron cloud of carbon and result in different kinds of carbon. The changes observed at both 23Na and 13C could suggest that Fe atom could not only enter into the bulk structure and also change the charge transfer of the carbon layer.

Third, the morphology evolution with Fe-doping was characterized with SEM. The pristine sample shows irregular particles about 3–5 μm (Figure 3a). Interestingly, the Fe-doped NVFP samples showed porous agglomeration (15–20 μm) of nanoparticles (∼100 nm) (Figure 3b–d). The vesicular structure could be ascribed to the thermal decomposition of FeC2O4 during the calcination process, which would generate massive gas that functions as pore-making agent in final products. (32) In addition, the porous structure of NVFP25 samples was destroyed by escape of gas owing to excess existence of FeC2O4. The vesicular structure is beneficial for the permeating of the electrolyte and enlarges the contact region between active material and electrolyte, thereby the ultrafast shift of Na+ could be facilitated during the repeated charging and discharging process. (33) In addition, all elements including Na, Fe, V, P, O, and C of NVFP15 sample are uniformly distributed as shown by EDS mapping (Figure 3e). Morphology observation could explain that the introduction of organic ferric could induce the formation of a porous structure by generating volatile gas.
Nitrogen desorption isotherms were conducted to give insight into the specific surface area and the pore diameter distribution of the samples. As displayed (Figure 3f,g), the obvious hysteresis loop at higher P/P0 region indicates the high vesicular structure of the NVFP15 composite. Details of the absorbtion and desorption curves of other samples are displayed in Figure S5. The NVFP15 sample is equipped with a large pore volume of 0.1364 cm3 g–1 and a high specific surface area of 50.15 m2 g–1. Moreover, the steep increase of the absorption curve at high pressure (P/P0 = 0.8–0.99) demonstrates that the pore volume is not only generated by nanopores but also produced by mesopores with a relatively wide pore diameter concentrated at 15 nm. The specific surface area of NVFP15 and NVFP05 composite is higher than that of the NVFP00 sample (25.05 m2 g–1). The specific surface area of NVFP25 sample is 19.97 m2 g–1, which may be ascribed to the pristine pore structure destroyed by large amount of gas produced from decomposition, in agreement with the SEM results.
TEM observation reveals NVFP15 samples have particles that have a thinner carbon coating of 10 nm and are smaller than those in pristine sample (Figure 4a–d). As shown in Figure 4d, the dark region could be related to the crystal-type NVP, whereas the light area corresponds to amorphous carbon. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the NVFP sample shows a d-spacing of 0.62 nm with cognizable parallel lattice fringes indexed to the (012) planes and the thickness of the carbon coating is around 10 nm. The typical rhombohedral system of NVP also could be determined by the outcome of fast Fourier transform (FFT) technology (inset in Figure 4e). Besides, it could be guessed that the NVP particles have an uneven carbon coating.

Raman spectrogram and high-resolution C 1s spectrogram were recorded to investigate the properties of carbon in the carbon layer. Obvious bonds of typical carbonaceous material are observed at 1346 and 1600 cm–1 (Figure 4g), which could be related to disordered and graphitic carbon regions, (34) respectively. In addition, the value of ID/IG ratio is the critical parameter to assess the character of carbon materials with a hybrid structure of disordered and graphitic carbon. In addition, the calculated values (Table S5) are 1.02, 1.02, 0.97, and 0.95 for NVFP00, NVFP05, NVFP15, and NVFP25, respectively. Obviously, note that compared with undoped sample, graphitic carbon content increased gradually, and electronic conductivity was enhanced with the catalysis of iron. (35) The C 1s spectrum of Fe-doped samples could be deconvoluted into five peaks centered at 283.5, 284.6, 285.8, 287.8, and 289.3 eV, assigned to Fe–C, C–C, C–O, C═O, and O–C═O bonds, respectively (Figure S5). (36) Moreover, the highest C–C content indicates that better electronic conductivity belongs to the NVFP15 samples (Figure 4h), in agreement with the Raman measurement. The conclusion could be verified that Fe element could also regulate the graphitization degree of coated carbon as a catalyst.
The electrochemical properties of various NVFP cathodes are explored and displayed in Figure 5. The rate capability of NVFP electrodes from 0.1 to 20C is shown in Figure 5a. 1C could be defined as 117.6 mA g–1. All doped samples show better rate capacities than the pristine sample. Following a common rule, the diffusion coefficient of sodium ions could be less pronounced for the NVFP05 sample, reaching 86.04 mA h g–1 in comparison with only 2.28 mA h g–1 obtained at the highest rate (10C). For the NVFP15 samples, the original discharge capacity was 115.71 mA h g–1, which is close to its theoretical capacity, and discharge capacities of 102.16, 100.03, 99.3, 98.05, and 94.05 mA h g–1 were recorded at 1.0C, 3.0C, 5.0C, 10.0C, and 20.0C, respectively. However, when the introduction of Fe doping content surpassed the optimum value, the pore structure between particles would be destroyed, as observed in the SEM results, thus adversely hampering the electron/Na+ transfer and depressing the discharge capacity. The charge/discharge curve shown in Figures 5b and S7 also indicates that the discharge plateau gradually shifts to lower voltage. And, the dQ/dV curves (Figure S8) also illustrated that the internal of the charge/discharge plateau of NVFP15 is the smallest, which is further evidence of the good rate performance.

Long lifespan cycling stability of all samples was monitored at 1.0C continuously (Figure 5c). The original capacity of the pristine sample is 102.3 mA h g–1, and 69.27% capacity could be maintained after 400 cycles. And the capacities after 400 cycles were 100.22, 101.13, and 87.36 mA h g–1 for NVFP05, NVFP15, and NVFP25, respectively, demonstrating an enhanced cycling performance compared to that of NVFP00. Moreover, NVFP15 yielded a capacity of 94.90 mA h g–1 even after 1200 cycles, equivalently corresponding to a super high capacity retention of 91.52%. In addition, although cycled at 5C and 10C, NVFP15 still delivered high capacity of 91.4 mA h g–1 after 1000 cycles and 90.77 mA h g–1 after 600 cycles (Figures 5d and S7d).
Similar to LIBs, the kinetics of the interfacial Na+ transfer process could be qualitatively analyzed from the apparent activation energy (Ea) for the sodium deintercalated/intercalated into NVP, which could be calculated from the following equation (37,38) where Ea denotes the activity energy, T expresses the Kelvin temperature (K), R signifies the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1), Rct presents the interfacial sodium-ion transfer resistance, and A is a constant, independent from temperature. Nyquist plots of NVFP15 and NVFP00 electrodes at open circuit potential under different temperatures are displayed in Figures 6a and S9a. According to the above equation, the activation energies (Ea = Rk, wherein k represents the slope factor of the fitting line) of NVFP00 and NVFP15 electrodes are calculated to be 69.90 and 32.26 kJ mol–1, respectively. The smaller activation energy of NVFP15 illustrates that the surface of NVFP15 has better conductivity, which could expedite the diffusion of Na+ and electron through the whole electrode region and thus guarantee a super-high rate capability.

The EIS results could also be applied to count the apparent sodium-ion transfer coefficient used in equations as follows (31,39) where R represents the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1), T denotes the Kelvin temperature (K), A is the contact surface area of the cathode and the electrolyte, n labels the number of electrons shifted in the charging–discharging process, F is the Faraday constant, C presents the concentration of sodium ion in the crystal structure of cathode, and σ represents the Warburg factor, which is related to the real impedance Z0 (Figure S9b).
The calculated sodium-ion diffusivity are 5.99 × 10–14 and 2.37 × 10–15 cm2 s–1, respectively, for NVFP15 and pristine sample according to the Nyquist plots of all electrodes at the open circuit potential (Figure 6c) at room temperature. These values show excellent sodium diffusion coefficient for the NVFP15 sample. Sodium ion diffusivity at different temperatures could also be calculated according to the same method and would increase with increasing temperature.
The apparent activation energy (EaD) could also be computed from the fitting line in Figure 6d using the computational formula (EaD = −Rk ln 10, where k is the slope of plot of log D vs 1/T). The apparent activation diffusion energy calculated is 78.94 and 52.80 kJ mol–1 for NVFP00 and NVFP15 electrodes, respectively. The lower apparent activation energy of NVFP15 could be due to the better ionic and electron conductivity of porous structure and highly graphitized carbon. It could also be observed from the EIS results that the Rct value of the NVFP15 electrode is much lower than those of other electrodes.
To better understand the electrochemical characteristics of Fe-doped Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes, the CV curves of the NVFP00 and NVFP15 at various scan rates were calculated and are displayed in Figure 6e,f. An obvious peak couple at 3.4 V could correspond the V3+/V4+ redox couple. At a low scan rate of 0.2 mV s–1, two peaks detected may be the result of the two-step transformation of sodium ions during the discharging process. Increase in the scan rates causes the peak area to gradually enlarge. The capacity contribution generally consists of two parts: capacitive-contributed capacity and diffusion-contributed capacity. Figure 6g presents a plot of log (i) versus log (ν) from 0.2 to 1 mV s–1 for both cathodic peaks. According to exponential relationship of the peak current and the sweep rate (40) where both a and b represent variable values in the equation. When the value of b is 0.5, the current is dominated by diffusion. When b value is 1.0, the current is provided through surface reaction. (39) According to the plot of log (i) with the function of log (ν) from 0.2 to 1 mV s–1 for cathodic peaks for NVFP00 and NVFP15 in Figure 6g, b values are fitted as 0.54 and 0.58, respectively. The bigger value of the NVFP15 sample indicates that more surface capacity could be obtained because its enlarged special area and porous structure are beneficial for electrochemical reaction. In addition, the apparent sodium ion diffusivity could be calculated by the Randles–Sevcik equation (39,41) where Ip, A, C, and n are the peak current, the contact region between the electrode piece and the electrolyte solution, the concentration of Na+ in the internal solid, and the number of electrons included in the half-cell for the redox couple, respectively. By the plot of Ip versus ν1/2 (Figure 6h), the slope could represent a positive relationship of sodium ion diffusion coefficient. The bigger slope of NVFP15 indicating better sodium ion transfer dynamics.
The crystal texture was spied on in a step-by-step mode by recording the XRD patterns at different voltages during the first charging and discharging process. The relevant peaks go through distinct variations during the process of charging–discharging, as depicted in Figure 7a in the range of 10–40°, and charging and discharging boundary is labeled in red. Preliminary peaks observed at 2.9 V are located at 36.0, 34.6, 32.8, 29.1, 20.5, 20.3, and 14.6°, which reflect the crystal faces of (300), (116), (024), (113), (110), (104), and (012) of the Na3V2(PO4)3 composition, respectively, with the space group of R3̅c. And, the peak at 38.5° could be indexed to the existence of an aluminum foil. As suggested from the unitary flat plateau in the galvanostatic tests, this material experiences two-phase reaction mechanism in the reduplicative charging and discharging process as previously reported. (42) During the charging process, the peaks corresponding to Na3V2(PO4)3 gradually shift to a high angle and then disappear; meanwhile, the peaks corresponding to NaV2(PO4)3 appear. During the process of charging and discharging, the intensity of these peaks alter reversibly, demonstrating that the two-phase reaction is invertible. And, some unusual peaks at 4.1 V detected during charging and discharging may be the result of the introduction of iron atom into the bulk structure. The peaks at 20° break up into two peaks at higher voltage, in accordance with previous report. (43) To uncover the alteration of the oxidation state of transition metals during the electrochemical period, the XPS spectra of Fe 2p and V 2p core levels of the Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3 electrodes fully charged at 4.3 V were recorded (Figure S10). The Fe 2p core-level spectrum of the electrode fully charged at 4.3 V shows two peaks at 725.8 and 721.1 eV, demonstrating Fe element mainly exists as Fe3+ and its oxidation state does not change. (25) Major contributions located at 523.4 and 516.9 eV for V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2, respectively, through a decent disintegration of the XPS V 2p spectrum collected on a fully charged electrode suggests the presence of V4+. (22) Besides, extra couple of peaks come out at 525.4 and 518.1 eV, whose positions accords with those of V5+. (22)

In addition, the XRD and SEM of pristine electrodes before cycling and after 200 cycles at 1C were recorded to confirm the stability of the NVFP15 sample, as shown in Figures 7b and S11. The pristine diffraction peaks could be well related to the positive material of the NVP phase and sharp peaks at 38, 65, and 78° imply aluminum foil. After 200 cycles at 1C, the diffraction peaks of NVP could be well maintained, illustrating excellent stability of the NVFP15 material. A careful comparison of electrodes before and after cycling shows no obvious changes and the porous structure may be filled with smaller acetylene black particles. It could be guessed that the morphology of the porous structure could be well maintained during the cycling process.
To further evaluate the outlook of the application of Fe-doped specimen, NVFP15 was selected based on its excellent expression as a cathode electrode in a full sodium ion cell. The full cell was configured with the uncycled NVFP15 electrode as a positive material and three cycled hard carbon electrodes as negative electrodes (Figure S12a). The cell could deliver 105.07 mA h g–1 for first cycle at 0.1C. With increased current density, capacity of 76.96, 65.97, and 64.08 mA h g–1 could be obtained at 0.2C, 0.5C, and 1C (Figure S12b), respectively. When both charged and discharged at 5C, a discharging capacity of 27.42 mA h g–1 could be kept after 400 cycles (Figure 7c), corresponding to 64.2% of the original capacity (42.72 mA h g–1). To further testify its potential use, the as-prepared full cell was also employed to support the working of commercial red-light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs. As discerned in Figure S12, one LED bulb (1.7 V, 0.3 W) could be readily illuminated after being fully charging. After 1 h, the bulb remains lighted. These results further declare the reserve force of the synthetic NVFP15 electrodes as a hopeful positive material for commercial SIBs.
Above all, the Fe-doped NVP@C samples indeed show better electrochemical properties than the pristine sample. Other’s works have been displayed in Table S6, the Fe-doped NVP cathodes also display a long lifespan cycling and high rate performances. The Fe-doping mechanism was proposed; unlike traditional ion doping, the Fe3+ is not only doped into the NVP bulk structure but also adjusted to the graphitization degree of carbon. The elevated electrochemical properties of Fe substituted samples could be due to couple of factors: (1) after Fe3+ supersedes V3+, the crystal structure becomes distorted at the atomic level and reduces the Na+ migration barrier in NVP@C; (2) thermal decomposition of organic ferric composite would induce the formation of vesicular structure, which is instrumental for electrolyte penetration; and (3) the promoted graphitization of the carbon layer would further enhance the electronic conductivity.

A multifunctional Fe substitution strategy was adopted to promote the electronic conductivity of insulating NVP via sol–gel method. The Fe substitution could modulate the crystal structure parameters, tune the morphology, and boost the coated carbon graphitization. Moderate Fe replacement is shown to be capable of effectively elevating the rate capability and cycle capability of the NVP by embellishing the electron conductivity and sodium ion diffusivity. The optimized Na3V1.85Fe0.15(PO4)3@C delivers the high original discharge capacity of 103.69 mA h g–1, with 91.45% of the preliminary discharge capacity retained after 1200 cycles at 1C. When the discharging rate was increased from 0.1C to 20C, the capacity declined from 115.71 to 94.45 mA h g–1, demonstrating a preeminent rate capability. Hence, the moderate content of alien metal doping is effective to modify the electrochemical property of cathode materials. In the tactics of devising V site-substituted Na3V2–xFex(PO4)3@C on the account of valance charge process is also yearn for being favorable for cognition of doping mechanism for advanced secondary batteries and broadening horizons about Fe doping into carbon-coated material.
