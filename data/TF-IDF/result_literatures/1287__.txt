NASICON is the acronym for NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor, typically represented by the ideal material Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [1] which is derived from Na1+xZr2SixP3 xO12 (0 < x < 3) studied series for x = 2 and has a potential interest due to its most important application as a base solid electrolyte material for gas electrochemical sensors because of its excellent sodium cationic conductivity. The NASICON structure is built up of corner-sharing ZrO6 octahedra and TO4 (T = P, Si) tetrahedra leading to a 3D-framework with interconnected channels where Na+ cations can be inserted in two types of sites usually noted S1 at 6b (0,0,0) and S2 at 18e (x,0, 1/4) Wyckoff positions. The excellent ﬂexibility of this 3Dframework allows large chemical substitutions [2–5].

Due to extensive investigations during the last three decades, numerous Nernstian-types of NASICON-based gas electrochemical sensors are able to analyze various gases such as SO2 [6,7], CO2 [8– 14], NO2 [15] and Cl2 [16] in parts per million concentrations. Among these Nernstian-type gas sensors, NASICON-based CO2 sensors are the most studied devices because their remarkable properties, which include high sensitivity and selectivity, good stability and low cost [8–14].

However, the NASICON-based solid electrolyte was also used for non-Nernstian-kind gas sensors to analyze NOx [17,18], H2S [19], SO2 [20,21], Cl2 [22], NH3 [23,24] and C6H5–CH3 [24,25]. In this case, the devices in which NASICON was combined with different oxide electrodes responded to these mentioned gases according to the mixed-potential theory [19,23–25].

Li-NASICON, Li1+xZr2 ySix 4yP3 x+4yO12 (1.8 6 x 6 2.2 and 0.45 6 y 6 0.55), system is known to be an excellent fast lithium cation conductor: Li2.8Zr2 ySi1.8 4yP1.2+4yO12 (x = 1.8 and 0 6 y 6 0.45) [26]; Li3.2Zr2 ySi2.2 4yP0.8+4yO12 (x = 2.2 and 0 6 y 6 0.55) [27]. It is derived from the parent compound LiZr2P3O12 (x = y = 0). Indeed, these materials which belong to this system are very useful for applications in electrochemical devices such as chemical sensors and fuel cells.

The present work is an extension of the exploration in the same system and has been devoted to the synthesis and physicochemical characterizations of the Li-NASICON new series Li3Zr2 ySi2 4yP1+4y O12 (x = 2 and 0 6 y 6 0.5). The ﬁve studied materials have been elaborated by sol–gel process and their calcined temperatures have been deduced from their corresponding DTA–TGA thermograms. Then the structure of each synthesized material was conﬁrmed by X-ray powder diffraction, whereas the complex impedance spectroscopy study showed that these materials are excellent lithium fast cationic conductors. On the other hand, only Li3Zr2Si2PO12 was investigated by 7Li, 31P and 29Si MAS NMR.

The lithium-substituted NASICON structure existence range was delimited by the three materials: LiZr2P3O12–Li4Zr1.25P3O12–Li4Zr2Si3O12 of the ternary diagram (Fig. 1) in which the ﬁve studied compositions derived from the general formula: Li1+xZr2 ySix 4yP3 x+4yO12 (x = 2; y = 0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375 and 0.500), are represented on the line x = 2 and noted respectively:

In view of the fact that the usual solid-state reactions does not allows the obtaining of high-purity Li-NASICON, the ﬁve selected compositions were elaborated by sol–gel method in order to obtain the preliminary formation of an amorphous solid precursor which has a high reactivity and as a result leads more easily to monophasic compositions. However, this sol–gel synthesis method consists in preparing, under agitation and at room temperature, three clear homogeneous solutions which are prepared from appropriate reactants taken in stoichiometric proportions of each corresponding composition: Solution N°1 (H2O–C2H5–OH–Si(C2H5O)4, the pH of this solution was adjusted to one by adding HNO3(4 M)) in order to better homogenize these reactants during the mixture agitation; Solution N°2 (H2O–LiNO3–ZrO(NO3)25H2O) and Solution N°3 (H2O–(NH4)2HPO4). Then, the mixing, under agitation and simultaneously at room temperature, of these three previous clear homogeneous solutions provide immediately the formation of white gel, which was slowly dried at 373 K and then held at this temperature for 48 h to ensure the formation of dehydrated amorphous precursor of Li-NASICON.

The calcined temperatures of the ﬁve studied samples have been deduced from their corresponding DTA–TGA thermograms which were recorded by using SETARAM TGA92 thermoanalyser in the temperature range from room temperature to 1373 K at heating rate of 10 K min 1 and under argon atmosphere.

After calcination at temperatures slightly higher than their crystallization temperatures, all samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction at room temperature using Siemens D5000 automated diffractometer operating with CuKa radiation. The recorded pattern scan has been carried out in steps of 0.02° with counting time for 16 s at each one and in the 2h angle range from 10° to 70°.

Electrical conductivity measurements were collected on cylindrical pellets of 13 mm of diameter which were obtained by applying uniaxial pressure of 120 MPa and sintered at 1273 K under air for 72 h with the rates of heating–cooling equal to 5 K min 1 in order to improve the mechanical strength. Electrodes were covered by sputtering gold on opposite pellet faces by vacuum evaporation. The impedance measurement data were collected by using a Solartron SI 1260 imped-

ance/gain-phase analyzer, and the data acquisition was made over the frequency range 10 Hz–32 MHz at intervals of 10 points per decade with an applied voltage of 100 mV. The measurements were carried out at different temperatures in the range 293–373 K. During the heating runs, the increment of temperature was 20 K, and before each measurement the sample was kept at indicated temperature for 60 min in order to establish the thermal equilibrium.

7Li, 31P and 29Si MAS NMR spectra were acquired in solid state at room temperature by using MLS 300 Bruker spectrometer operating under classical MAS conditions with a 5 mm probehead. Magic angle sample spinning experiments were carried out at a spinning frequency of 8 kHz. The frequencies used for 7Li, 31P and 29Si signals were 116.64, 121.49 and 59.62 MHz and their chemical shift values were given relative to 1 M LiCl, 85% H3PO4 and TMS reference solutions, respectively.

The thermogravimetric study by coupled DTA–TGA put in evidence that the ﬁve studied materials, derived from Li3Zr2 ySi2 4yP1+4yO12 (0 6 y 6 0.5) system, have markedly the same thermal behavior. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2 the obtained thermogram by heating the precursor of the material M1 (y = 0) between room temperature and 1373 K displayed, in the TG curve, three successive mass losses. However, the ﬁrst mass losse, Dm   5%, was appeared in the temperature range 302.73–505.52 K, whereas the second which represents losse, Dm   35%, has been located between 505.52 and 592.47 K, and the third, Dm   5%, was occurred in the temperature range from 592.47 to 886.03 K. Furthermore, these three mass losses, described previously, were conﬁrmed, in the DT curve, by the presence successively of an endothermic broad peak centered at 428.25 K which has been ascribed to the evaporation of physiosorbed water and solvents such ethanol, an exothermic narrow peak at 563.89 K which was assigned to the departure of residual organic compounds and a very wide exothermic peak centered at 728.11 K which was attributed to the removal of residual water and organic solvents trapped in the closed pores. The last exothermic peak observed at 1215 K in the DT curve, not accompanied by mass loss corresponds to the crystallization temperature of the studied material M1 and represents the most important part in the thermogram because the calcined temperatures of the ﬁve studied materials have been deduced from the values of their crystallization temperatures which were derived from their corresponding DTA–TGA thermograms. Otherwise, the ﬁve dried gels at 373 K were calcined at temperatures higher than their crystallization temperatures.

Fig. 3. Crystallization temperature evolution as function of y composition.

The crystallization temperature evolution of the ﬁve studied samples as function of y composition was displayed in Fig. 3 and putting in evidence that during the substitution when y composition increase the phosphorus content (1 + 4y) increase also, on the other hand silicon (2   4y) and zirconium (2   y) contents decrease and consequently the total mass rate of substitution of both silicon and zirconium, [4Mr(Si) + Mr(Zr)]y with Mr(Si) = 28.086 g mol 1 and Mr(Zr) = 91.224 g mol 1, is greater than the one compensated by phosphorus, 4Mr(P)y with Mr(P) = 30.974 g mol 1, within the framework, i.e., 203.568y > 123.896y, and as a result this substitution involved the decrease of the melting temperature and therefore leading to the decrease of crystallization temperature observed in the studied series.

The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the ﬁve studied materials, recorded at room temperature in the 2h range 10–70° and using calcined powders at optimal temperature 1273 K, are similar. Fig. 4 shows the X-ray powder diffractogram of the material M1 (y = 0) which exhibits only peaks of rhombohedral structure of lithium-substituted NASICON single phase without any detection of other trace phases, according to their corresponding JCPDS ﬁle cards, such: ZrO2 [JCPDS: 88-1007, 87-2105, 83-0943], SiO2 [JCPDS: 89-3609, 88-2488, 88-2487, 88-2486], Li2O [JCPDS 77-2144], ZrSiO4 [JCPDS: 89-2655, 83-1383], Li3PO4 [JCPDS 84-0003], Li2SiO3 [JCPDS 83-1517] or Li2ZrO3 [JCPDS: 76-1150, 75-2157, 41-0324],

and suggest that the substitution of both silicon and zirconium by phosphorus does not have an inﬂuence on nanostructure stability of the ﬁve synthesized materials. Consequently, the ﬁve powder diffractograms were indexed on the basis of the rhombohedral R3c lattice according to the radiocrystallographic data which were taken from the JCPDS card ﬁle No. 84-1199 of the NASICON-type material Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The determination of unit cell parameters was carried out with the least square ﬁt reﬁnement program, CELREF [28], using the hkl and 2h (°) values. The indexed powder diffractogram of the material M1 (y = 0) is depicted in Table 1.

The crystallographic parameters of the unit cell of the ﬁve studied materials are given in Table 2.

The unit cell data, Table 2, revealed a moderate decrease of parameters upon the increase of y composition. Indeed, the slightly reduction during the progressive substitution of zirconium and silicon by phosphorus is due to the larger ionic radius of both Zr4+ (r = 0.72 Å) and Si4+ (r = 0.42 Å), relative to P5+ (r = 0.35 Å). This result is in good agreement with those reported in previous works [29]. Moreover, the calculation of the size crystallites forming the synthesized powder of each studied material was carried out with the Scherrer equation: D ¼ Kk Dð2hÞ cos h, of which the detailed deﬁnition of each variable was reported in our previous work [27]. However, Table 2, showed the decrease of size crystallites with the increase of y composition and as a result conﬁrms the nanostructure of these studied materials.

The technique of complex impedance spectroscopy was applied, for the ﬁrst time, to solid electrolytes by Bauerle [30] in order to separate and identify different responses relative to electrolyte and electrodes. The proﬁles of the recorded impedance diagrams, in the temperature range 293–373 K with an increment of 20 K, of the ﬁve studied compositions corresponding to y = 0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375 and 0.5, are similar. The impedance diagram of M1 (y = 0) material, Fig. 5, showed the presence of two successive semicircles and a linear region at lower frequency range. The ﬁrst semicircle was observed, at high frequency range, with an associated capacitance of C (293 K) = 8.55 lF cm 1 at 20 Hz and has been

deduced from the relation Rgb = Rtot   Rg. Then, the value of cationic conductivity rtot has been calculated from the relation rtot ¼ e RS, where e is the thickness and S the area of the pellet. Moreover, the plots of ln(rtot) versus 103/T, Fig. 6, verify the Arrhenius equation, rtot = r0exp( Ea/kT), where r0 is the preexponential factor, Ea is the activation energy for the conduction and k is the Boltzmann constant. The electric properties of the ﬁve studied materials are listed in Table 3. These results are in good agreement with previous works [26,27] and showed that rtot(293 K) seems increasing with the increase of y composition from 0 to 0.5 and the maximum of conductivity rtot(293 K) = 1.97  10 3 S cm 1 was reached for y = 0.5, whereas the activation energy Ea decrease from 0.254 to 0.192 eV with the same variation of y composition varies from 0 to 0.5. Indeed, the observed total conductivity increase which has been accompanied by the decrease of activation energy can be mainly linked to the increase of relative density with minimum and maximum values of dRe(y = 0) = 90.98% and dRe(y = 0.5) = 95.32%, leading to the decrease in the porosity which strongly interferes with the response of the studied material grains

ascribed to grain interior response, whereas the second was located, at medium frequency range, with an associated capacitance of C (293 K) = 0.80 nF cm 1 at 50.716 kHz and has been assigned to the grain boundary response and then the linear region was detected at lower frequency range which has been attributed to the lithium cation blocking at the pellet electrodes. Furthermore, the grain resistance Rg and the total resistance Rtot were determined by extrapolating of the left intercept of the ﬁrst and the second semicircle with the real axis in the Nyquist graphic representation, respectively, and as a result the grain boundary resistance Rgb was

[30,31]. On the other hand, the substitution of both zirconium and silicon by phosphorus probably increased the ﬂexibility of the 3Dframework channels of the studied lithium-substituted NASICON and as a result caused a considerable amelioration of the electric properties.

The 7Li, 29Si and 31P MAS NMR spectra of Li3Zr2Si2PO12 are displayed in Figs. 7–9, respectively. However, the recorded 7Li MAS NMR spectrum, Fig. 7, showed the presence of single resonance at  0.19 ppm with its two corresponding satellite side bands, in spite of the presence of two lithium sites: Li(6b) and Li(18e). Consequently in order to raise this ambiguousness, why only one peak has been observed, the DFT/B3LYP [32] theoretical calculations of chemical shifts, using SDD Stuttgart basis [33] and GIAO method computing NMR Properties [34], were performed by Gaussian 09W software [35]. Indeed, the calculation results conﬁrm that these two lithium atoms have nearly the same calculated isotropic chemical shifts: diso(Li(6b)) = 111.6318 ppm and diso(Li(18e)) = 111.3014 ppm with variation of 0.3304 ppm according to the expression of dexp = dref   diso. Moreover, 29Si(18e) and 31P(18e) MAS NMR spectra exhibit only one resonance peak, each one, with different values of chemical shifts at  111.13 and 9.76 ppm, respectively and as a result conﬁrm that both silicon and phosphorus atoms are crystallographically equivalent in each unit cell. Indeed, there is only one type of local structure unit surrounding the silicon or phosphorus atoms [Q°(4Zr)] within the atomic arrangement of the studied material. Otherwise the local structure unit is built by one tetrahedron T(Si, P)O4 connected to four octahedra ZrO6 by T(Si, P)–O–Zr bridges. Furthermore, these results derived from the MAS NMR study is in good agreement with analog previous works [26–27,36–38].

The ﬁve materials of the studied lithium-substituted NASICON Li3Zr2 ySi2 4yP1+4yO12 (0 6 y 6 0.5) series have been prepared by sol–gel process in order to obtain pure polycrystalline powder and then have been analyzed by different physicochemical characterization techniques such DTA–TGA, XRPD, SIC and MAS NMR. However, the DTA–TGA analyses allowed the estimation of crystallization temperatures of the ﬁve studied samples, whereas their recorded X-ray powder diffractograms were indexed on the basis of the rhombohedral R3c lattice and as a result suggest that the substitution of both zirconium and silicon by phosphorus does not have an inﬂuence on their structure stability in the y compositional range 0–0.5. Furthermore, the complex impedance spectroscopy study results showed that these ﬁve NASICON-type materials are excellent lithium fast cationic conductors with total electric conductivity maximal value 1.97  10 3 S cm 1 at 293 K in the case of Li3Zr1.5P3O12 and with an associated activation energy value of 0.192 eV. Moreover, from the MAS NMR study, the 7Li MAS NMR spectrum showed the presence of only one resonance peak instead of two as expected, so in this case the DFT/B3LYP theoretical calculations of chemical shifts, using SDD Stuttgart basis and GIAO method computing NMR Properties, were carried out with Gauss-

ian 09W software in order to raise this ambiguousness who exists between the peak number in the spectrum and the inequivalent crystallographic site number of lithium within the crystalline framework structure. On the other hand, 29Si(18e) and 31P(18e) MAS NMR spectra exhibit only one resonance peak, each one, with different values of chemical shifts at  111.13 and 9.76 ppm, respectively and as a result conﬁrm that both silicon and phosphorus atoms are crystallographically equivalent in each unit cell with the same local structure [Q°(4Zr)].
