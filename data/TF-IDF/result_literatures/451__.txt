A simple freeze-drying-assisted method is used to prepare various porous Mn-doped Na3V2(PO4)3/C composites. Rietveld refinement and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) are applied to probe the real substitute site of Mn and demonstrate that Mn ions successfully occupy the V sites. The Mn2+/Mn3+ doping in the vanadium site of Na3V2(PO4)3 causes the lattice volume to expand with enlarged Na ion diffusion channels, which benefits Na+ transportation and increases the ionic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3. Furthermore, due to the charge compensation, the presence of Mn2+ in Na3V2(PO4)3 leads to the formation of V4+, which improves the intrinsic conductivity and stabilizes the NASICON framework. Through the XPS results of the electrode under the fully charged or discharged states, the small and reversible plateau at ca. 3.85 V of the Mn-doped Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode is ascribed to the activation of the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple. An optimized performance is achieved for Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C, which exhibits a capacity of 106.8 mAh g−1 at 1 C and 77.8 mAh g−1 at up to 30 C. Even more impressive, a high capacity retention of 82% was achieved at 30 C after 10000 cycles.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as one of the most promising options for large-scale electrical energy storage (EES) because of the plentiful supply, low costs and environmental friendliness of sodium [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. However, appropriate electrode materials with superior performances are even more difficult to find than the electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) because of the larger ionic radius of Na+ compared with that of Li+, thus leading to a low ion diffusion coefficient and severe structural degradation during the Na ion intercalation/deintercalation process [6,7].

In recent years, cathode materials, including layered transition metal oxides [8,9], metal hexacyanometalates [10,11], and polyanionic compounds [12,13], have been extensively studied. Among these materials, Na3V2(PO4)3 possesses the sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) framework, which provides 3D tunnels for Na+ insertion/extraction, resulting in excellent ionic conductivity. However, the poor electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 resulting from the separated VO6 octahedral units significantly limits its rate capability and further industrialization [[14], [15], [16], [17]].

Extraordinary efforts have been made to solve the inherent drawbacks of Na3V2(PO4)3. Until now, it has been demonstrated that carbon coating is a simple and practical way to improve surface electronic conductivity [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. Ion doping in Na sites or V sites can effectively improve the structural stability, thereby enhancing the ionic diffusion and intrinsic electronic conductivity [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Many researchers have focused on doping with alien cations, and many ions have been proven to be effective for improving the electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. Aragon et al. proved that doping Cr into the V sites could stabilize the NASICON framework and effectively improve the Na+ and electron diffusion velocities [28]. Li et al. doped Na3V2(PO4)3 with different Mg2+ contents to enhance the structural stability and the ionic and electronic conductivity [30]. Particularly, Klee et al. found that the sol-gel synthesis of Mn3+-doped in Na3V2(PO4)3 would enhance the ion diffusion ability and stability during cycling [33]. However, the rate capability and long cycling performance of the doped Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode have not yet reached a satisfactory level.

Herein, we successfully synthesized Mn-doped porous Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C composites through a novel freeze-drying-assisted thermal treatment method and confirmed the successful occupancy of Mn (Mn2+/Mn3+) in the octahedral V sites. The porous structure of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C created during the freeze-drying process provides a large contact area with the electrolyte and facilitates the ultrafast transportation of the Na ion. Additionally, Mn doping in Na3V2(PO4)3 increases the lattice parameters, which help to increase the sodium ion diffusion rate. The presence of Mn2+ will lead to the formation of V4+ due to the charge compensation. The mixed-valences of the V ion may have fascinating effects on the performance of Na3V2(PO4)3, which have been proved for Li3V2(PO4)3 [34]. The existence of V4+ could stabilize the NASICON framework of Na3V2(PO4)3. As a result, the obtained porous Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C exhibits a superior rate capability and ultra-long cycle life up to 10,000 cycles.

The porous Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) was prepared via a freeze-drying-assisted thermal treatment method. First, the stoichiometric amount of NaH2PO4, NH4VO3, Mn(CH3COO)2 and citric acid were dissolved in deionized water with the molar ratio of 3: 2-x: x: 7.5 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). The mixture was then stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Here, the citric acid was used as both a chelating reagent and a carbon resource. Then, the mixture was frozen and freeze-dried. The obtained dry precursor was annealed at 400 °C in air for 5 h and then sintered at 800 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 6 h to obtain the final Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C materials.

The structural analysis of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) using Cu Kα radiation (10°≤2θ ≤ 90°). The chemical compositions were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS, VARIAN 220FS). The oxidation states of Mn and V in Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD). The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Merlin) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100F). The elements were analyzed using X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) linked to SEM. The carbon contents of the samples were determined by an elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario EL III). The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured at the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K, Micromeritics ASAP 2460).

The electrochemical properties were investigated using a CR2032 coin-cell with sodium flakes as the counter electrode. The electrodes were fabricated by mixing 70 wt% Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C, 15 wt% super P and 15 wt% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and by casting the mixture on aluminum foil. The active material mass in each electrode was approximately 1.5 mg. The separator was a glass microfiber filter (Whatman, Grade GF/F), and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbon (EC)-diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:2 v/v) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box and tested on a NEWWARE battery test system. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was assessed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, Shanghai Chenghua Company, China). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was assessed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex) over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz at a potential amplitude of 5 mV.

The precise elemental compositions of synthesized Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C were obtained using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and the results were normalized to Na (Table 1). It can be clearly found that the experimental compositions are very close to the theoretical compositions.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C samples were collected to investigate the effect of Mn ions on the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 (Fig. 1). A tiny diffraction peak at 32.9° indexed to Mn2O3 can be detected in Na3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3/C, while no Bragg peaks related to impurities were detected in Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2). All of the strong diffraction peaks are well indexed to the R-3c space group with a rhombohedra NASICON framework, indicating that moderate doping of Mn ions does not change the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3. The magnified (116) peaks shifted to smaller angles when the Mn ion content increased from 0 to 0.2, which means the Mn-doped samples have larger lattice parameters than pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 [35,36]. At x = 0.3, the peaks shifted to higher angles, which may be caused by the impurity segregation of Mn2O3. To further investigate the effects of Mn ions on the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3, Rietveld refinements were performed for the Na3V2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C samples (Fig. 1c). The results are calculated and listed in Table 2. The value of the axis (a = b axis) slightly increases with the Mn2+ doping. Furthermore, the Mn doping increases the lattice parameters significantly. The lattice volume of Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C (1439.94 Å3) is larger than that of Na3V2(PO4)3/C (1430.37 Å3), which helps to enlarge the Na ion diffusion channels, contributes to the transportation of sodium ions and increases the ionic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 [29,37].

To further analyze the valence states of the V and Mn ions in Na3V2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Obviously, no peak corresponding to Mn 2p was detected in the undoped Na3V2(PO4)3/C (Fig. 2a). In addition, the V 2p XPS spectrum of Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits two peaks at 523.8 and 516.7 eV, thus corresponding to the V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 spin-orbit states of V, respectively (Fig. 2b). The binding energy (BE) value of V 2p is attributed to the 3 + oxidation state of V and matches well with the values reported in the previous literature [[38], [39], [40]]. After Mn doping in Na3V2(PO4)3/C, as shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks at the binding energies of 653.7 and 642.0 eV belong to Mn3+, while the peaks at the binding energies of 652.2 and 641.2eV are assigned to Mn2+ [41]. Thus, it could be concluded that the Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions coexist in the Mn-doped Na3V2(PO4)3/C, and the Mn ions are successfully incorporated into the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3. Furthermore, two new V 2p peaks were observed at 524.8 eV and 517.6 eV, as shown in Fig. 2d, indicating the presence of V4+. According to the XPS results, the doped Mn ions have mixed valences of +2 and + 3. The Mn3+ forming MnO6 octahedral could partly replace the VO6 octahedral, thus stabilizing the NASICON framework against structural degradation and internal strain during repeated cycling [29,42,43]. Meanwhile, due to the charge compensation, the different valence states between V3+ and Mn2+ will lead to the formation of V4+, which could stabilize the NASICON framework and improve the intrinsic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3.

The SEM images of the Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C composites are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that the doping of Mn ions does not affect the morphology of Na3V2(PO4)3 since the particles of all four samples are micron-sized. The morphologies and microstructures of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C samples were further clarified by HRTEM characterization (Fig. 4). It can be clearly detected that a uniform carbon-coating layer (3–8 nm) is formed on the surface of the Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3 particles. The precise carbon content of the samples was determined via elemental analysis. The results were 11.14 wt%, 10.76 wt%, 11.58 wt% and 10.83 wt% for Na3V2(PO4)3/C, Na3V1.9Mn0.1(PO4)3/C, Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3/C, respectively. Due to the similar carbon contents, it can be inferred that the carbon layer has a similar effect on the electrochemical performance of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C. The EDS mapping of Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C shows that C, Na, V, P and Mn are uniformly distributed in the particles, which confirms the formation of a homogeneous composite (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2). The Raman spectrum of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C is shown in Fig. S3, and the high ID/IG ratio indicates the dominance of the disorderly carbon phase, which is consistent with the HRTEM results.

The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution (PSD) curves of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C are shown in Fig. 5. All the samples show a typical IV isotherm with a type-H3 hysteresis loop in the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, which means that the obtained Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C samples have a porous structure. The BET surface areas of Na3V2(PO4)3/C, Na3V1.9Mn0.1(PO4)3/C, Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3/C are calculated to be 76.5, 73.6, 85.7, and 79.1 m2 g−1, respectively, and these BET surface areas are much higher than those of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample synthesized by the sol-gel method (22.1 m2 g−1) [44]. Distinct pore size peaks at 0.8 nm and 3.6 nm were observed on the PSD curves of all samples. The porous structure helps the penetration of the electrolyte and then facilitates the ultrafast transportation of sodium ions during the charge/discharge process, which could improve the rate capability of sodium-ion batteries.

The sodiation/desodiation behaviors of the Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C samples were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scanning rates (Fig. S4). A symmetrical couple of the anodic and cathodic peaks can be clearly detected in all samples, and these peaks were assigned to the transformation of V3+ to V4+. Furthermore, the redox peaks were maintained, even at a high scan rate of 5.0 mV s−1. The good symmetry of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CV curves indicates that the Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C materials possess good reversibility during the Na extraction/insertion [19]. Conversely, the peak currents and the square root of the scan rates for both electrodes are correlated and possess a good linear relationship (Fig. 6a). Thus, these materials demonstrate the typical behavior of a diffusion-controlled electrode reaction process, and the diffusion coefficient of Na ions can be calculated based on the slope of the oblique line according to the following Randles Sevcik equation [7,45,46]:(1)where n is the number of electrons in the reaction (n = 2 for the V3+/V4+ redox pair), A is the effective contact area the between electrode and electrolyte and C is the concentration of Na ions in the electrode (6.92 × 10−3 mol cm−3). The D values of the anodic and cathodic reactions are shown in Table S1 and depicted in Fig. 6b. Through the calculation, it can be concluded that Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C has the largest Na+ diffusion coefficient, which is ascribed to the appropriate doping amount of Mn ions, which helps to enlarge the Na+ transportation channels.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also employed to evaluate the conductivity and diffusion ability of the as-synthesized Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C electrodes. The Nyquist plots of the various Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C were collected for the frequency range of 106 Hz to 10−2 Hz in the discharged state after 3 cycles at 0.5 C (Fig. 7). The diagrams exhibit a semicircle in the high frequency region and an oblique linear Warburg slope in the low frequency region. The resistors Re, Rs and Rct correspond to the electrolyte resistance, the contact impedance and the charge transfer impedance, respectively [47]. The Rct values for Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) obtained from fitting are listed in Table S2. Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C exhibits the lowest charge-transfer impedance, which confirms that the moderate doping of Mn ions could facilitate the transport of ions/electrons and obviously decrease the charge transfer resistance.

The electrochemical performances of the Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) electrodes were evaluated. Fig. 8a shows the discharge capacity of Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C at different current densities from 1 C to 30 C (1 C = 117 mA g−1). Due to the porous structure and doping effects of Mn ions, the Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C electrode exhibited a very impressive rate capability. The specific discharge capacities were 106.8, 102.7, 97.0 and 90.9 mAh g−1 at the current rates of 1, 2, 5 and 10 C, respectively. The capacity at the extremely high rates of 20 and 30 C can still reach 84.0 and 77.8 mAh g−1, respectively, corresponding to a high capacity retention of 72.8% from 1 C to 30 C, which is also quite superior to the literature's reported values [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21],[28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. In contrast, the undoped-Na3V2(PO4)3/C electrode delivered only 67.9 and 60.2 mAh g−1 at 20 C and 30 C, respectively, which is still better than many Na3V2(PO4)3 samples synthesized via conventional methods, and the improved performance could be attributed to the porous structure created through the freeze-drying process [19,44,47]. The results demonstrate that the moderate introduction of Mn ions at the V site could effectively improve the rate performance of Na3V2(PO4)3. The charge and discharge curves of the Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C electrode between 2.5 and 4.0 V at current rates of 1–30 C are shown in Fig. 8b. A flat voltage plateau of approximately 3.4 V was observed at an initial low rate of 1 C, which was assigned to the phase transformation between Na3V1.8-x3+Vx4+Mn0.2-x3+Mnx2+(PO4)3 and Na1.2+xV1.84+Mn0.2-x3+Mnx2+(PO4)3. It is worth nothing that another small voltage plateau at approximately 3.85 V was also detected, which is in accordance with the CV results (Fig. S5).

To analyze the actual redox reaction occurring at 3.85 V, XPS was carried out to verify the valence states of Mn 2p and V 2p in the Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C electrode at fully discharged and charged states, respectively (Fig. 9). The peaks at binding energies of 642.0 and 641.4 eV belong to the +3 and + 2 oxidation states of Mn, respectively (Fig. 9a). In addition, the peaks at 524.2 and 523.2eV are assigned to the +4 and + 3 oxidation states of V, respectively (Fig. 9b). However, the peaks at 641.4 and 523.2 eV disappeared when the electrode was charged at 4.0 V, which means that Mn2+ was oxidized to Mn3+ during the charging process. Thus, it could be concluded that the short plateau at 3.85 V is due to the reversible reaction of the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple.

In addition to the rate capacity, the cyclic performance is also a significant index for industrial applications [48]. As shown in Fig. 10a, the Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C electrodes have excellent cyclic stability with an initial capacity up to 92.0 mAh g−1 at 10 C, and it retained a capacity of 84.4 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles, which is much higher than the Na3V2(PO4)3/C (81.1 mAh g−1 for the first cycle, and 71.9 mAh g−1 at the 1000th cycle). Fig. S6 shows the voltage profiles at different cycles (the 10th, 100th, 500th, and 1000th cycles) of Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C at 10 C, and the voltage plateaus are stable after 1000 cycles. More impressively, a capacity of 64.7 mAh g−1 and 82% capacity retention were achieved for Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C at 30C after up to 10,000 cycles, thus corresponding to an ultra-low capacity decay of 0.0018% per cycle and the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode remained above 98.0% during cycling (Fig. 10b). To the best of our knowledge, micro-sized Na3V2(PO4)3/C materials that possess this superior rate capability and ultralong cyclability are rarely reported in the literature (Table S3). The superior electrochemical performance of the Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C material occurs for three reasons: (i) Mn3+ ions form MnO6 octahedrals and partly replace VO6 octahedrals, which effectively improve the structural stability of Na3V2(PO4)3/C material; (ii) the doping Mn2+ ions will cause the formation of V4+ and thus lead to a high degree of defects, which helps to enhance the electronic conductivity and improve the rate capacity; and (iii) the porous structure offers abundant nanopores and a large active surface area, which facilitate the ultra-fast ionic transportation and improve the rate performance of batteries.

We successfully synthesized a series of Mn-doped Na3V2(PO4)3/C (Na3V2-xMnx(PO4)3/C) cathode materials with different Mn contents using a freeze-drying-assisted thermal treatment method. The freeze-drying method helped achieve high surface area Na3V2(PO4)3 particles with a porous structure. Mn ion doping into the V site increased the lattice of the Na3V2(PO4)3, which helped enlarge the ion transportation channels. In addition, the mixed-valence state of Mn also improved the electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 and stabilized the NASICON framework of Na3V2(PO4)3 As a result, the moderate Mn-doped Na3V1.8Mn0.2(PO4)3/C sample exhibited improved electrochemical performance. When the cycling rate was as high as 30 C, the capacity reached 77.8 mAh g−1 and exhibited an amazing cycling stability (82% capacity retention for up to 10,000 cycles). The easy doping method and excellent performance provide a new strategy towards synthesizing high-performance cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.
