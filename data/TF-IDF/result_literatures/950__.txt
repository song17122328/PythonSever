The objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of sintering temperature on the structural, electrical and electrochemical propertiesof novel Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 NASICON structured compound prepared via sol gel method.

X-ray diffraction was used to study the structuralproperties such as crystalline phase and lattice parameters of the solid electrolytes.

Electrical properties of the compound were measured usingimpedance spectroscopy while the electrochemical stability was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry.

All the sintering temperatures yieldedcompounds consisted of monoclinic crystalline phase with a space group of P1 21/c1. Lattice parameters for Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 samples increasedfrom the sintering temperature at 700–800 1C but decreased for sintering temperature at 900 1C.

The sample sintered at 800 1C showed thehighest total conductivity of 1.83  105 S cm1 and the highest value of ions mobility, m of 6.17  1010 cm2 V1 s1 which was attributed tothe optimum size of migration channel indicated by its unit cell volume.

 Linear sweep voltammetry result showed that the Mg0.5Si2 (PO4)3powder was electrochemically stable up to 3.21 V.

Li-ion batteries have received a large amount of attentiondue to their attractive properties such as high energy density,no memory effect and long life cycle.

The batteries areextensively used in various electronic products, such as laptopcomputers, cellular phones and electric vehicles.

However, thistype of batteries was reported to suffer from a safety aspect andrequire protection from being overcharged or discharged toofar [1].

Magnesium batteries, on the other hand, can be easilysynthesized and are thermodynamically stable.

Furthermore,from the electrochemical point of view, magnesium batterieshave a working voltage around 1.0–1.2 V and can reach anenergy density around 80 W h kg1.Their full depth ofdischarge is up to 1000 cycles at a wide temperature rangemaking them possible candidates for new battery systems [2].

NASICON (Natrium Super Ionic Conductor) compoundsare interesting candidates to be used in the development ofsolid electrolytes for ionic batteries.

The compounds showhigh ionic conductivity, large enough interstitial void to uptakeguest species and high structural stability based on 3D framework.

Many researchers explored the capability of thenasicon structured compounds to be used as electrolytematerials.

 It started with the introduction of Nasicon compound, NaZr2(PO4)3 by Hong and Goodenough in 1976 [5].

The maximum conductivity observed the Na3ZrSnSi2PO12compound was 2.85  103 S cm1 at room temperature.

Then, the Nasicon compound was improvised by introductionof lithium analogous NASICON with a general formula ofLiZr2(PO4)3.The highest conductivity observed for this type ofcompounds was 3.00  103 S cm1 at room temperature forthe Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound [6].

Only a limited number of research on the use of magnesiumin the structure of NASICON compounds has been reported inthe literature.

 Makino et al.successfully synthesized magnesium electrode using NASICON type, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 parentcompound and modified compounds of Mg0.5þy(FeyTi1-y)2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5þy(CryTi1-y)2(PO4)3] [7].

The onlyresearch that discovered the capability of Mg2þ ion conducting Nasicon compound solid electrolytes was done by ourgroup [8].

 However, the studied Mg0.5Zr2 (PO4) 3 NASICONskeleton was too large for the Mg2þ to migrate resulting inlow conductivity.

A suitable tunnel size for Mg2þ migration isexpected to be obtained by reducing the lattice size of theNASICON type structure by substitution of Zr (0.72 Å) with Si(0.41 Å).

The research on the NASICON compound developedusing silicon element, Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3, has never beenreported yet in the literature.

The focus of the study was to investigate the effect ofsintering temperature on the structural, electrical andelectrochemical properties of Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 compound.

The characteristics such as thermal, structural, electrical andelectrochemical properties of the Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 wereinvestigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC),X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), impedance spectroscopy (IS) and magnesium transference numbermeasurement and linear sweep Voltammetry (LSV).

The pure Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 samples were successfullyobtained by the sol gel method with sintering temperaturesin 700, 800 and 900 1C.

The characteristics of the sampleswere influenced by the sintering temperatures.

However, it wasfound that the temperature of 800 1C yielded a sample withoptimum lattice size for ion migration leading to highestconductivity.

 The Mg0.5Si2 (PO4) 3 ceramic sample alsoshowed a wide, stable voltage window up to 3.21 V at ambienttemperature.
