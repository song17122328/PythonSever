The NASICON-type Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolytes were synthesized by a facile aqueous-based sol-gel process with alcohols free. Compared with the samples prepared by solid-state reaction, the modified sol-gel derived Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolyte exhibited a rhombohedral crystal symmetry without impurity phase and higher ionic conduction behavior. After sintered at 850 °C for 5 h, the sol-gel specimen showed a total ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10− 4 S/cm at 30 °C and 1.0 × 10− 3 S/cm at 60 °C. In addition, the chemical and phase stability of the as-prepared Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 with three types of cathode materials (i.e. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Li3V2(PO4)3) was investigated in the temperature range of 500 to 700 °C. This work proposes a synthesis choice for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, and also favors to the electrode identification for all-solid-state lithium secondary battery using NASICON-type electrolyte.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are attractive power source for portable electronic devices. Their further applications in the electrical vehicles and large-scale energy storage system require high safety, large energy density and wide temperature compatibility [1]. However, the conventional organic liquid electrolytes limit the battery application due to their flammability and low electrochemical window [2]. Therefore, research interest has focused on the all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries to solve the safety issue of LIBs. As the key component in the solid-state battery, the solid electrolytes are expected to possess high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window and good chemical compatibility with electrodes [3].

Among all the electrolyte materials, the NASICON-type electrolytes, e.g. Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3, are promising candidates due to their high ionic conductivity. Similar to other NASICONs, the Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 lattice contains two types of polyhedra, GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, linked by corners to form the [Ge2(PO4)3]− skeleton. This rigid framework provides the 3D interconnected channels for Li+ migration [4]. Various techniques have been reported to prepare Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 electrolytes, i.e. melt-quenching method [5], [6], solid-state reaction [7], [8], sol-gel synthesis [9], [10], flame spray technique [11], etc. The Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 glass-ceramics synthesized by melt-quenching often possess high ionic conductivity with dense microstructure [12]. However, this technique involves a high-temperature melting process (1350-1600 °C) and long annealing time, which probably requires high energy consumption and laborious grinding work. Besides, the heat treatment over 1200 °C can easily lead to lithium losses [13]. Consequently, to develop a low-temperature synthesis method is of practical interest for Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 electrolyte. As mentioned above, sol-gel method has been applied in the preparation of NASICON-type electrolytes. However the alcohols system or organic solvents are commonly used, either to dissolve metal alkoxide or to prevent precipitation and promote polyesterification [7], [9], [14]. Then a facile aqueous-based sol-gel method is highly required.

In addition, to fabricate all-solid-state lithium secondary battery using ceramic electrolytes, the annealing procedure at high temperature is usually necessary for crystallization of cathode film and better components connection [15]. It has been reported that the unfavorable interaction between cathodes and solid electrolyte during annealing can lead to the interfacial resistance growth, and then capacity decay [16]. Therefore, the chemical stability (or say chemical compatibility) of solid electrolyte with electrode materials becomes quite important for the cell performance. However, the high-temperature compatibility of Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 with different cathode materials has not been widely investigated yet.

In this work, the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) electrolyte was prepared by a facile sol-gel method in aqueous solution with simple and economical Ge(OCH3)4 as germanium source. The structure-electrochemical property relationship of the as-prepared LAGP was investigated. Besides, three kinds of promising cathode materials, i.e. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, and Li3V2(PO4)3, were selected to interact with LAGP for chemical compatibility analyses. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 has a high charge/discharge voltage plateau of c.a. 4.7 V vs. Li/Li+, favorable for high energy density [17]. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 presents a superior discharge specific capacity of ca. 200 mAh/g among current commercial cathode materials [18]. Li3V2(PO4)3, similar to Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3, is also a polyanion-type phosphate material but with a lower crystallographic symmetry [19].

The aim of our work is to provide a preparation choice for LAGP electrolyte, and also favor to clarify the interaction mechanism of LAGP with cathode materials for better electrode identification in all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries.

The Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 precursor was prepared by a facile aqueous-based sol-gel process. Stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NH4H2PO4 were first dissolved in de-ionized water by magnetic stirring. Citric acid (CA) was added into the nitrate solution as the chelating agent with the molar ratio of [CA] / [Li+ + Ge4 + + Al3 +] = 2. Then stoichiometric Ge(OCH3)4 was dissolved to form a transparent homogeneous solution. The reaction system was heated at 80 °C for polyesterification. When the viscous gel was formed, it was transferred to an oven and heated up to 170 °C for 15 h to evaporate water and promote polymerization and gelation. The dried gel was ground and then pyrolyzed at 500 °C for 5 h to release the volatile compounds. The as-prepared LAGP precursor was reground, die-pressed into pellets, and sintered at 850 °C for 5 h in air on a platinum sheet to avoid reaction with alumina crucible. For comparison, Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 was also synthesized through the conventional solid-state reaction. The stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3, GeO2, Al2O3 and NH4H2PO4 were ball-milled and calcined at 700 °C. The precursor was then ground and die-pressed into pellets, followed by sintering at 850 °C for 5 h as well.

To investigate the chemical stability of LAGP electrolyte towards cathode materials at high temperature, three active materials were selected, i.e. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2, and Li3V2(PO4)3. The as-prepared LAGP and each cathode powder were first weighed in 1:1 weight ratio, mixed thoroughly and reacted at 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C for 1 h, respectively. Then, to further evaluate their stability in a more compact condition, the mixture of LAGP and each cathode (with 1/1wt ratio) were die-pressed into pellets, and reacted at 700 °C for 1 h. For LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 cases, they were co-heated with LAGP in air. Since Li3V2(PO4)3 can be oxidized in air at high temperature, Li3V2(PO4)3 and LAGP were co-heated in Ar2 atmosphere.

The crystal structures of synthesized LAGP and its composites after co-sintered with different electrode materials were investigated using a powder x-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X'pert Pro). Samples were scanned over the 2θ range of 5–90° with CuKα radiation at room temperature. The Rietveld refinement of as-prepared LAGP was conducted with the FullProf software [20]. The morphology and composition of the LAGP and its co-sintered pellets were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The ionic conductivity of the sintered pellets were measured by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using an electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research VersaSTAT 4). A gold coating was sputtered on both sides of the pellets as Li blocking electrodes. EIS data were collected in the frequency range between 1 MHz and 1 Hz with AC amplitude of 5 mV in the temperature range of 30 to 100 °C. The activation energy (Ea) for lithium-ion conduction was calculated from the Arrhenius plot of the total ionic conductivity to temperature. The electrochemical window of synthesized LAGP was determined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s between − 0.5 and 6.0 V. An Au layer was sputtered on one side of the specimen as a working electrode, while a lithium foil was attached on the other side as a counter and reference electrode.

Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 sintered at 850 °C for 5 h by facile sol-gel method and solid-state reaction, respectively. The diffraction peaks of the sol-gel derived sample can be indexed to the LiGe2(PO4)3 with the NASICON structure (JCPSD# 01-080-1924). The Rietveld analyses of its XRD pattern in Fig. 1(b) indicated the sol-gel LAGP had a rhombohedral structure with the space group R-3c. The lattice parameters were calculated to be a = 8.2604(3) (Å) and c = 20.6224(8) (Å), which slightly varied from the size of LiGe2(PO4)3 due to the Al3 + doping. The small weighted factor Rwp(~ 6.63%) suggested that single-phase LAGP can be prepared by this facile sol-gel method. As for the LAGP prepared by solid-solid reaction, besides the major rhombohedral phase, its XRD spectra also exhibited some impurity phases in Fig. 1(a). The diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of ca.21–36° can be ascribed to AlPO4 (JCPSD# 00-011-0500). The peak at ca. 20.5° favored to be Li4P2O7 (JCPSD# 01-087-0409), which was also confirmed by the solid-state NMR study from Liu et al. [10]. In comparison, a single phase detected in the sol-gel derived LAGP can be attributed to the homogeneous cation mixing at the atomic or molecular level during the facile sol-gel process.

In the Pechini route, a carboxylic acid and an alcohol are required to have esterification reaction and further polymerization [21]. Citric acid and ethylene glycol is a chelate couple widely employed in the Pechini process [9], [10], [13], [14]. Citric acid has strong chelating ability towards metal cations. Its molecule contains both carboxylic acid groups (single bondCOOH) and hydroxyl group(single bondOH), which could have polyesterification itself. Besides, it was reported that the carboxylic acids could be used as solvent or chelate towards simple metal alkoxides [22]. Among the germanium alkoxides, Ge(OCH3)4 has the simplest chemical structure. In our work, the germanium source Ge(OCH3)4 was observed to dissolve in the aqueous solution of citric acid. Accordingly, only citric acid chelate was employed in this modified method with glycol free. The XRD results confirmed this facile sol-gel process could prepare LAGP with pure rhombohedral symmetry.

Fig. 2 displays the microstructure morphology of the LAGP specimens sintered at 850 °C for 5 h prepared by different methods. The grains in the sol-gel prepared LAGP sample packed closely with each other, and most of its grain size was observed in the sub-micron range in Fig. 2(a). The sol-gel derived precursors after pyrolyzation often had small particle size even at the nano-level, which would lead to a high driving force for sintering. While in the LAGP synthesized by solid-state reaction, the grains had a wider size distribution (from sub-micron to 1–2 μm range). In addition, the microstructure with a smooth-like morphology (marked in the red solid line) was also observed in Fig. 2(b). EDS analyses indicated this second phase had a Al, P and O-containing composition (Al ~ 13 at%, P ~ 17 at%, and O ~ 70 at%) in Table 1 which was probably attributed to AlPO4, consistent with the XRD results in Fig. 1(a).

The impedance plots of LAGP pellets at 30 °C sintered at 850 °C for 5 h are shown in Fig. 3(a). The inset is the magnified impedance plot of the facile sol-gel derived LAGP sample, in which an incomplete semicircle and an inclined line were observed. The long tail at low frequency indicated the ionic characteristics of the synthesized LAGP electrolytes [7], [9]. The disappearance of the bulk impedance semicircle could be due to the high bulk conductivity, which responded at quite high frequency range. The impedance plot of the LAGP prepared by solid-state reaction contains two overlapped semicircles related to the bulk and grain boundary resistance, and also a long tail. The total ionic resistance (bulk and grain boundary) of both LAGP samples can be obtained from the right intercept of the semicircle or inclined line with the real impedance axis [12]. The ionic conductivity at 30 °C was 3.1 × 10− 4 S/cm for the facile sol-gel LAGP which was comparable to or higher than reported values [7], [9], [14], while it was only 7 × 10− 5 S/cm for the LAGP synthesized by solid-state reaction.

The temperature dependences of total ionic conductivity for both LAGP electrolytes are plotted in Fig. 3(b). Their ionic conductivity increased with elevated temperature, and was observed to follow the Arrhenius relationship of , where σ is the ionic conductivity, A the pre-exponential factor, k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and Ea the activation energy for lithium-ion conduction. The activation energy can be calculated from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots in Fig. 3(b), and the Ea values were 0.37 eV for the sol-gel derived sample and 0.42 eV for the solid-state reaction specimen, respectively. The ionic conductivity of sol-gel LAGP at 60 °C reached 1 × 10− 3 S/cm, quite close to the conductivity of sulfide electrolytes at room temperature [3]. In the whole temperature range, the facile sol-gel LAGP exhibited better conductivity behavior than the LAGP prepared by solid-state reaction. The ionic conductivity of polycrystalline solid electrolytes usually depends on the grain boundary conductivity because grain boundary region are weak link or where impurity phases usually agglomerate. Thokchom et al.'s work indicated the presence of dielectric AlPO4 phase leads to decrease the conductivity of LAGP specimen [23], [24]. The relative density values of LAGP pellets synthesized by sol-gel process and solid-state reaction were 76% and 82%. Then probably the lower conductivity of the solid-state reaction sample may be related to the heterogeneous phase and composition. The formation of AlPO4 distributed among LAGP phase shown in Fig. 2(b) could lead to a blocking effect on the ion transport and decrease grain boundary conductivity. In comparison, the improved conductivity of the facile sol-gel LAGP can be attributed to its homogeneous NASICON-phase formation.

Fig. 4 shows the cyclic voltammogram of the LAGP synthesized by facile sol-gel method measured at room temperature in the voltage range of − 0.5–6 V (vs. Li/Li+). The reversible lithium deposition (Li+ + e− → Li) and dissolution (Li → Li+ + e−) occurred between − 0.5 V and 0.7 V. A tiny unidentified anodic peak was observed at round 1.5 V. Recent studies reported that LiGe2(PO4)3 based material can react with lithium at quite low potential of 0–1 V (vs. Li/Li+) [25], [26]. The CV curve in Fig. 4 indicated the reduction by lithium did not affect the lithium-ion conduction behavior of the synthesized LAGP, which is also consistent with Feng et al.'s work [8]. In addition, no other reaction was detected in the high potential range up to 6 V. This suggested that LAGP can work with most of cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries which usually require electrochemical window up to 5 V.

To clarify the chemical stability of LAGP with different cathode materials (i.e. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Li3V2(PO4)3), the mixtures of LAGP and each cathode material were reacted at elevated temperature from 500 °C up to 700 °C, respectively.

Fig. 5(a) shows the XRD patterns of as-prepared LAGP, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, and their specimens after heating at 700 °C for 1 h in air individually. It can be observed that both LAGP and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 maintained their phase stability after heat treatment at 700 °C individually. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 can be hygroscopic and easily form Li2CO3 on its surface. Here, the LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 before and after heating at 700 °C both showed a single hexagonal structure, which may indicate Li2CO3 is amorphous or its amount is not enough for XRD detection. The phase evolutions of their powder mixture after reaction are displayed in Fig. 5(b). After co-heating at 500 °C, clear diffraction peaks of LAGP and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 were observed. But when temperature increased to 600 °C, the peaks of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 began to broaden and moved to a lower 2θ angle. Meanwhile, some new peaks appeared. As reaction temperature further lifted to 700 °C, diffraction peaks of LAGP still remained, while the peaks from LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 almost vanished, which indicated LAGP maintained a higher structural stability than LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2. The intensity of the additional peaks increased with the reaction temperature. A detailed phase analysis for the 700 °C case in Fig. 5(c) showed that LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 had reacted with LAGP and decomposed. The major interaction products may be attributed to NiO (JCPSD# 01-073-1519), Li3PO4 (JCPSD# 00-015-0760), Li4P2O7 (JCPSD# 01-087-0409), etc. The XRD results suggested the appropriate annealing temperature could be below 600 °C for solid-state battery using LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode and LAGP electrolyte.

To study the stability of LAGP with LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 in more close contact, their die-pressed composite pellet was co-heated at 700 °C for 1 h in air. Its SEM morphology in Fig. 6 showed although there existed pores, particles connected with each other. The EDS results in Table 2 indicated the Ni/Co mole ratio varied locally and was different from original nominal case, which may also suggest LAGP and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 have interacted.

Fig. 7(a) plots the XRD patterns of as-prepared Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, and their samples after heating at 700 °C for 1 h in air individually. Similar to LAGP, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 did not change its phase symmetry after heated at 700 °C. Fig. 7(b) shows the XRD patterns of their powder mixtures reacted at elevated temperatures. Compared with LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 displayed a better stability towards LAGP. The diffraction peaks belonging to LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LAGP were clearly detected respectively after heating at 500 °C and 600 °C, respectively. But as temperature reached 700 °C, some new peaks grew up. Also, the peaks of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 shifted to the low angle and became broadened, which implied LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 had decomposed. A phase analysis for the reaction products at 700 °C is shown in Fig. 7(c). Although the diffraction peaks of LAGP remained (denoted by LiGe2(PO4)3, JCPSD# 01–080-1924), the GeO2 phase was also observed (JCPSD# 01-083-2475). The shifted peaks from a spinel structure were ascribed to LiMn2O4 (JCPSD# 00-054-0257). Other possible products may contain NiO (JCPSD# 01-073-1519), LiMnPO4 (JCPSD# 01-077-0178) and Li3PO4 (JCPSD# 00-015-0760). Kotobuki et al compared the compatibility of LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4 cathode materials with Li0.55La0.35TiO3 electrolyte [27]. Impurity phases were confirmed between LiCoO2 and Li0.55La0.35TiO3 after annealed at 700 °C, while no impurity phases for LiMn2O4 even heated at 800 °C. This might reflect that the spinel cathode material have better stability towards Li0.55La0.35TiO3 electrolyte than the cathode with a layered hexagonal structure. Our preliminary work also exhibited similar phenomenon for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode materials in the LAGP case.

The SEM image for composite pellet of LAGP and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 heated at 700 °C for 1 h is shown in Fig. 8. The particles contacted well. As for its chemical composition, the Ni/Mn and Al/Ge/P mole ratios both varied from their original nominal values in Table 3, which also implied LAGP and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 had reacted.

Fig. 9(a) presents the XRD patterns of as-prepared LAGP, Li3V2(PO4)3, and their samples after heating at 700 °C for 1 h in Ar2 atmosphere individually. LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 both kept their crystal structure after heated at 700 °C in Ar2. The XRD patterns of their powder mixture after interaction from 500 to 700 °C for 1 h in Ar2 are shown in Fig.9(b). For the powder case, after reaction at 700 °C, the diffraction peaks of both LAGP (JCPSD# 01-080-1924) and Li3V2(PO4)3 (JCPSD# 01-072-7074) were observed. A phase scrutiny of the mixture reacted at 700 °C is shown in Fig. 9(c). A peak at 2θ = ca.13o was detected, which could be assigned to Li9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2. Li9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2, a type of layered monodiphosphates, has the same crystallographic symmetry as Li9Fe3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (JCPSD# 01-089-4707) with space group P3c1, and provides a theoretical capacity of 173.45 mAh/g [28], [29].

For further exploration, the composite pellet containing LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 was co-heated at 700 °C for 1 h in Ar2 atmosphere. Its SEM morphology in Fig. 10(a) showed the particles contacted well. But EDS analyses in Table 4 reflected that the Al/Ge mole ratio varied locally, which indicated LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 had reacted. The XRD analyses for the composite pellet in Fig. 11 illustrated that besides the peaks from LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3, the new peaks could be mainly attributed to Li9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 and LiVP2O7 (JCPSD# 01-085-2381). LiVP2O7 is a kind of pyrophosphate cathode material with space group P21 [30]. It should be noted that closer contact between LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 in composite pellet can promote their interaction at 700 °C. Then their composite pellet co-heated at 600 °C for 1 h in Ar2 was investigated on the morphology and phase stability as well. The particles were observed connected with each other in Fig. 10(b), and the Al/Ge ratio did not change much when compared with that of 700 °C case in Table 4. Its XRD pattern in Fig. 11(a) displayed peaks belonging to LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 while no impurity phase was detected. This may confirm that LAGP and Li3V2(PO4)3 are phase stable at 600 °C.

In addition, Nagata et al. observed that LiCoO2 reacted with Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) electrolyte after co-sintered at 800 °C while Li3Fe2(PO4)3 did not react [31]. Both of our works could probably indicate the polyanion phosphate cathode materials have better stability with NASICON-type lithium-ion electrolytes (e.g. LAGP, LATP, etc.) than the cathode material with a layered hexagonal structure for solid-state battery fabrication.

The single-phase LAGP electrolyte with high conductivity was synthesized via a facile sol-gel method, and it should also be noted that the sintering process will be optimized to tune the microstructure and then the ionic conductivity of LAGP. Our prepared electrolyte is expected to apply in solid-state batteries. Accordingly, to further clarify the interface stability between LAGP electrolyte and electrode materials, more detailed work on phase and electrochemical analyses will be carried out and reported. In addition, all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries using LAGP electrolyte will be fabricated with different composite cathodes of co-sintered LAGP and electrode materials, and their electrochemical performance will be investigated. Such work is underway.

The Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte was prepared via a facile sol-gel technique in the aqueous environment. A simple and economical alkoxide Ge(OCH3)4 was used as the germanium source. The as-prepared LAGP showed a single phase of rhombohedral symmetry and dense microstructure morphology. Its ionic conductivity at 30 °C reached 3.1 × 10− 4 S/cm, and the activation energy of conduction was lower than that of the LAGP synthesized by solid-state reaction. The sol-gel derived LAGP exhibited a wide electrochemical window. Even though the scan potential reached 6.0 V (vs. Li/Li+), LAGP had not decomposed yet. The high-temperature stability of LAGP with different cathode materials (i.e. LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Li3V2(PO4)3) were investigated as well. In comparison LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 tended to react with LAGP at lower temperature. Appropriate materials selection and process contribute to the fabrication of all-solid-sate lithium secondary battery using NASICON-type electrolyte.
