320-nm-thick LiZr2(PO4)3 thin ﬁlm was prepared by radio frequency sputtering and thermally annealed up to 1000 C to fully C was 1.3 × 10 ◦ −7 S/cm crystallize the as-deposited ﬁlm. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of the ﬁlm annealed at 800 which was inferior compared to its bulk counterpart due to the partial crystallization and small grain size; however, at an elevated temperature, the ionic conductivity approached the bulk value, reaching 4.0 × 10 C. It was demonstrated that combined with chemical stability of LiZr2(PO4)3 and low electronic conductivity, the LiZr2(PO4)3 thin ﬁlm can be a possible candidate material for a solid electrolyte operating at an elevated temperature.

Rechargeable Li-ion batteries typically use liquid electrolytes largely due to their superior ionic conductivity and excellent contact with the electrodes; however, liquid electrolytes suffer from potential leakage, relatively high electronic conductivity and poor physical and chemical stability. Especially, in a large format Li-ion battery, chemical stability of the non-aqueous liquid electrolyte has become an important issue due to the ﬁre and explosion hazards posed by the highly ﬂammable solvents commonly contained in the liquid electrolyte.1–2 On the other hand, solid electrolytes provide a much safer transport medium for Li-ions with minimal electronic conductivity. In addition, solid electrolyte offers the possibility of using Li metal anode to increase the cell voltage and capacity2–3 or using a liquid cathode with higher capacity compared to the solid insertion cathodes.4 However, the relatively low ionic conductivity of the solid electrolytes reduces the power density of a solid state battery; hence, studies of the solid electrolytes have mainly focused on identifying ceramic electrolytes 6 with high Li-ion conductivity. So far, Li0.5La0.5TiO3,5 Li10GeP2S12 7 have been found to exhibit high ionic conductivities and LiTi2(PO4)3 of ∼10 −3 to 10 −4 S cm−1 near room temperature.

With advent of breath-taking developments in synthesis and manipulation of nano-scale materials combined with the existing semiconductor processing technology, thin ﬁlm Li batteries can potentially offer high volumetric/gravimetric energy density together with design ﬂexibility8 so that thin ﬁlm batteries can be deployed in applications requiring extremely high power density such as implantable medical devices,9 wireless sensors10 and smart cards8 as well as conventional mobile electronic devices. Early thin ﬁlm batteries employed amorphous oxide electrolyte (except for Li polymer batteries) such 11 and Li3.4V0.6Si0.4O4.12 Since then, lithium phosas Li3.6Si0.6P0.4O4 phorous oxynitride glass (LiPON), ﬁrst introduced by Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1997,13 has been recognized as a standard solid electrolyte in spite of its ionic conductivity being limited to 2 × 10 −1 at room temperature.14 Although the abovementioned Li0.5La0.5TiO3, Li10GeP2S12 and LiTi2(PO4)3 possess higher ionic conductivity in their crystalline form than amorphous LiPON does, these electrolytes have been used only in a thick ﬁlm produced by spray coating,15 tape casting, and screen printing16 largely due to the difﬁculty of depositing a pinhole-free thin ﬁlm by sputtering and the misﬁt strain with the substrate during crystallization.17 The difﬁculty in producing thin ﬁlms of thus-identiﬁed fast ion conductors (Li0.5La0.5TiO3, Li10GeP2S12 and LiTi2(PO4)3) have mainly limited their applications in a thin ﬁlm battery. In this study, LiZr2(PO4)3, a well-studied Li-NASICON material with high ionic conductivity of ∼10 C (for R¯3c phase)18 was deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering for possible application in a thin ﬁlm battery. The deposited thin ﬁlm was heat-treated at different temperatures and the ensuing microstructure and electrical properties were characterized for potential application in a thin ﬁlm battery.

LiZr2(PO4)3 thin ﬁlm was deposited using RF sputtering using LiZr2(PO4)3 target produced by isostatic pressing and sintering of solgel-prepared LiZr2(PO4)3 powder. Composition and structure of the LiZr2(PO4)3 powder were veriﬁed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The pre◦ C pared powder was pressed at 2 metric ton and sintered at 1200 for 24 h in air. The base pressure for sputtering was <1 × 10 −4 Pa and typical ﬁlm deposition was carried out at 3 mTorr (working pressure), 50 sccm Ar and 50 W with a deposition rate of 0.45 Å /sec. LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was deposited on a Si substrate with 200-nm-thick thermal oxide (SiO2) and the ﬁlm thickness was monitored using a surface proﬁlometer and veriﬁed using cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The as-deposited ﬁlm was annealed at different temperatures in a tube furnace for 1 h under open air. Microstructure of the post-annealed samples was examined with XRD and TEM. For ionic conductivity, 330-nm-thick LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was deposited onto a Si wafer on which 100-nm-thick Pt ﬁlm, serving as a bottom electrode, was deposited by direct current sputtering and ◦ annealed at 700 C for 1 h in air. Another 70-nm-thick Pt ﬁlm was deposited on top of the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm. The impedance measurements was performed on the Pt/LiZr2(PO4)3/Pt specimens at different temperatures from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz using impedance analyzer (ZIVE MP2).

The quality of the deposited LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was very much dependent on the processing condition. In general, to obtain a dense ﬁlm, the growth rate has to be reduced below 5 Å/sec. XRD pattern of the LiZr2(PO4)3 sputtering target material that was sintered at ◦ C is provided in Fig. 1a. The XRD spectrum was indexed to 1200 the R¯3c structure whose lattice parameters were in agreement with the previous values [JCPDF-#84-0998]. Fig. 1b shows the XRD data for the as-deposited LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm on a SiO2/Si substrate and the ◦ ﬁlms that were subsequently annealed at 600 – 1000 C for 1 h. The as-deposited ﬁlm was amorphous and according to the XRD data, the ﬁlm annealed at 600 C also appears to be amorphous. After an◦ C, the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm ﬁnally crystallized as evnealing above 800 idenced by sharp XRD peaks which were indexed to the R¯3c structure, similar to the target material. The lattice parameters, a and c, calculated from the XRD pattern were 8.8796 Å and 22.0438 Å, closely matching the literature values for bulk LiZr2(PO4)3.

Annealing the as-deposited LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm below 700 lead to crystallization of the amorphous LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm so that ∼800 C is likely the critical temperature triggering the crystallization of the amorphous LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm. To examine the microstructure of the annealed ﬁlm, cross-sectional SEM images taken from the fractured ﬁlms grown on a SiO2/Si substrate together with the corresponding plan view SEM images are shown in Fig. 2. To check the substrate-dependence on the annealed ﬁlm morphology, the sputter deposition was also carried out on top of Pt (150 nm) / TiO2 (20 nm) / SiO2 / Si Substrate (the Pt ﬁlm is to be used as an electrode for electrical measurements). The uniform contrast with no distinctive features veriﬁes the amorphous state of the as-deposited ﬁlm (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In the case of the ﬁlm annealed at ◦ C, grainy structure can be clearly seen in Fig. 2a. The annealed 800 ﬁlm appears to be fully crystallized with grain size ranging from 50 nm to 200 nm. The plan view conﬁrms the rough ﬁlm surface developed by the crystallized grains. It is also noted that grains that were abnormally grown large were interspersed among much ﬁner ◦ C. A similar morphology was also obgrains when annealed at 800 ◦ C in Fig. 2c, served on the Pt ﬁlm as can be seen in Fig. 2b. At 1000 the grain size distribution became much narrower with average grain size of ∼200 nm. Compared to the ﬁlm annealed at 800 ◦ C, the ﬁlm surface was ﬂatter due to the narrow grain size distribution and the disappearance of over-grown grains observed in Fig. 2a. On the Pt ﬁlm in Fig. 2d, the LiZr2(PO4)3 grains were slightly larger compared to those grown on SiO2, otherwise, no essential difference was observed in the cross-sectional view of the annealed ﬁlm. In the plan view, however, there were dark patches which were identiﬁed to be regions where the LiZr2(PO4)3 separated from the substrate. It is likely that the strain produced by the volume contraction curing crystallization and thermal expansion mismatch (α for LiZr2(PO4)3 = 4∼ 5 / K and α for Pt = 8.8 / K) led to the delamination of the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm. Fig. 3a show a cross-sectional TEM image of the crystallized ◦ LiZr2(PO4)3 on SiO2/Si after annealing for 1 h at 800 C. Welldeveloped grains whose size was in agreement with the SEM data were clearly observed, but there appears to be some pockets that remained amorphous indicated by arrows in Fig. 3a. An electron diffraction pattern taken from the sample in Fig. 3b was unequivocally indexed to LiZr2(PO4)3 without any impurity phases in agreement with the XRD data. To verify the crystallinity of the LiZr2(PO4) ﬁlm annealed ◦ at 800 C, a high-resolution image of the ﬁlm of the sample were taken and shown in Fig. 3c which indicates that there was residual amorphous phase at the grain boundary among the LiZr2(PO4)3 grains so that the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm did not fully crystallize after anneal◦ ing at 800 C. A high-resolution TEM image of the ﬁlm annealed at ◦ C in Fig. 3d conﬁrms that the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm fully crystallized 1000 without residual amorphous phase at this temperature. It appears that ◦ C are required to fully crystallize the temperatures well above 800 as-deposited amorphous LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm. Since the metal ﬁlms or substrates would lead the delamination of the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm above ◦ 800 C as shown in Fig. 2d, a suitable substrate with small thermal expansion mismatch or reduction of the sample size would be required for electrical contact.

Impedance spectroscopy was used to estimate the Li ionic conductivity of the annealed ﬁlms. Like most sputter-deposited ﬁlms of fast ion conductors, the as-deposited LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was in the amorphous state. The impedance of the amorphous as-deposited ﬁlm was over 1 G so that the ﬁlm was essentially an insulator. It is noted that the deposited ﬁlm suffered from the pinhole problem so that the electrical measurements could not be performed when the deposited area was as large as 2 cm × 2 cm. A shadow mask was used to reduce the measurement area down to 5 mm × 5 mm to avoid the pinholes existing in the ﬁlm. Even then roughly 30% of the measurements failed because of the pinholes. It is expected that a clean-room facility would substantially assuage the pinhole problem.

The Nyquist plot for the ﬁlm annealed at 800 C shown in Fig.4b contain a depressed semicircle at high frequencies and a straight tail at low frequencies, similar to that of the bulk sample in Fig. 4a. The ionic conductivity for the annealed LiZr(PO4)3 was 1.3 × 10 −7 S/cm which is considerably lower than that of the polycrystalline LiZr2(PO4)3 pellet (4 × 10 −6 S/cm) at room temperature. The discrepancy in the ionic conductivity of polycrystalline LiZr2(PO4)3 pellet and the annealed thin ﬁlm is reasonable considering the small grain size found in the ﬁlm. Li-ion grain boundary conductivity is, in general, 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower compared to the bulk ionic conductivity for NASICON structure.19 It is expected that ionic con◦ C, if measured, should approach ductivity of the ﬁlm annealed at 1000 the ionic conductivity of polycrystalline LiZr2(PO4)3 pellet due to the much larger grains and thus reduced fraction of grain boundaries. Impedance measurements of the annealed ﬁlm were also carried out as a function of temperature and the resulting Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 4c. The ionic conductivities estimated from the data are listed in Table I. With increasing temperature, the ionic conductivity for the thin ﬁlm improved up to 4.9 × 10 C, closely approaching the bulk ionic conductivity. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm is shown in Fig. 4d which plots log σ vs. 1000/T. A well-deﬁned linearity in Fig. 5d indicates that the conductivity values obeyed the Arrhenius relationship20 and the activation energy estimated from the Arrhenius relationship21 was 0.42 eV. The estimated activation energy was in general agreement with that of bulk LiZr2(PO4)3.22

Although the ionic conductivity of the annealed LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was inferior compared to its bulk counterpart, similar to other fast ion conductors,23–25 the annealed LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm can be potentially used in a solid-state battery system at an elevated temperature. Alternatively, if a suitable substrate that can tolerate thermal annealing ◦ C can be found, the fully crystallized LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm above 800 can provide ionic conductivity that would be comparable to that of the bulk material.

Reactivity of the solid electrolyte with the cathode and Li needs to be addressed if the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm is to be successfully incorporated into a thin-ﬁlm battery. To examine the reactivity of a cathode ﬁlm during high-temperature annealing, a thin ﬁlm of LiCoO2 was ◦ deposited on the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm and heat treated at 700 C for 1 h to crystallize the LiCoO2 ﬁlm. SEM analysis did not show any noticeable reaction layer; however, the LiCoO2 ﬁlm tended to separate from the electrolyte layer such that the ﬁlm adhesion, not the reaction was a problem in the case of the LiCoO2 cathode. Hence, to apply the LiZr2(PO4)3 electrolyte to a battery system, amorphous V2O5 was considered as a cathode26–27 since V2O5 cathode does not require post-deposition thermal annealing. Shown Figs. 5a and 5b are TEM images of the amorphous V2O5 thin ﬁlm deposited on the crystallized LiZr2(PO4)3 electrolyte. As can be seen in the TEM images, no visible reaction layer can be seen between the V2O5 thin ﬁlm and the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm. The reaction of Li with the LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm was tested based on the Ref. 28. The Li LiZr2(PO4)3 thin ﬁlm was tested against Li foil in 1.2 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate in 3:7 ratio by volume. The voltage was swept from −0.3 V to 3.0 V at 1 mV/sec. The resulting C – V curve shown in Fig. 6 indicates no side reactions with LiZr2(PO4)3 except for oxidation/reduction of Li up to 3 V.

A thin ﬁlm of LiZr2(PO4)3 was prepared by RF sputtering and ◦ thermally annealed up to 1000 C to fully crystallize the amorphous as-deposited ﬁlm. Electrical measurements were performed for the ◦ C due to delamination of the metal electrical ﬁlm annealed at 800 contact. The ionic conductivity of the annealed LiZr2(PO4)3 ﬁlm (1.3 −7 S/cm) was inferior compared to its bulk counterpart (4 × 10 × 10 −6 S/cm) at room temperature due to partial crystallization and small grain size; however, at an elevated temperature, the ionic conductivity approached the bulk value, reaching 4.9 × 10 C. Combined with chemical stability of LiZr2(PO4)3 and low electronic conductivity, the LiZr2(PO4)3 thin ﬁlm can be a possible candidate material for a thin-ﬁlm solid electrolyte operating at an elevated temperature.
