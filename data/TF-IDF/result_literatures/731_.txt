Materials with a NASICON structure having the composition (NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3 (x = 0–1)have been obtained by hydrothermal synthesis followed by heat treatment and by ion exchange and characterizedby X-ray powder diffraction, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy.
The catalytic activity of the materials in the conversion of ethanol is studied.
All synthesized samplesare shown to exhibit activity in the dehydration of ethanol and, to a small extent, the dehydrogenation of ethanol.
At low temperatures, the conversion of ethanol predominantly results in the formation of diethyl etherand, at higher temperatures, the reaction predominantly affords ethylene.
The selectivity in diethyl ether formationreaches 96% with 60% conversion at 360°С on the ion exchange–produced material of HHf2(PO4)3composition with a triclinic modification.
At temperatures ≥450°C, the selective formation of ethylene isobserved almost on all materials (~100%, with 100% conversion on NH4Hf2(PO4)3 with a rhombohedralmodification at 450°C).(NH4)1–xHxHf2(PO4)3 samples with a NASICONstructures crystallizing in cubic, rhombohedral, or tricliniccrystal system were synthesized.
The study ofcatalytic properties of synthesized compounds in thetransformations of ethanol showed that all synthesizedsamples exhibit activity in the dehydration of ethanoland, to a small extent, in the dehydrogenation of ethanol.
Ethanol conversion predominantly affordsdiethyl ether at low temperatures and ethylene athigher temperatures.
This opens up the way for theselective preparation of diethyl ether (up to 96% at60% conversion on t-HHf2(PO4)3-{II} at 360°C)and, at high temperatures, for the selective preparationof ethylene (~100% at 100% conversion onr-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 at 450°C).
