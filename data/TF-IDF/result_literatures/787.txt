Many studies of all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries have been performed due to the high energy density and small radii of the lithium ion.
However, the much lower price of sodium compared with lithium gives the former a large advantage; therefore, there is a compelling reason to study sodium-ion batteries.
Although there have been some reports of all-solidstate sodium-ion batteries using a sulfide-based electrolyte, there have been only a limited number of publications regarding all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries incorporating inorganic oxide-based solid electrolytes, and these reports involve high temperature operation (above 473 K).
One challenge associated with the fabrication of all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries is the interfacial resistance between the electrolyte and the electrode.
In order to ensure good contact between the electrode and electrolyte, high temperature sintering is typically employed, particularly in the case of an oxide-based solid electrolyte.
However, this process potentially brings a high-resistive layer between the electrode and electrolyte as a consequence of reactions induced in the various materials.
