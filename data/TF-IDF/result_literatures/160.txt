Sodium-ion battery is considered to be a potential replacement for lithium-ion battery due to abundant sodium reserve and low cost. NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 possesses three-dimensional channels, which makes it show excellent sodium storage performance. And it is a prospective anode for sodium-ion battery. In this paper, sodium storage property of NaTi2(PO4)3/C was further improved by rational structural design. We prepared NaTi2(PO4)3-xCl3x/C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) by sol-gel method and applied it to anode materials for sodium-ion battery. Cl doping on PO43− site has no significant effect on the crystalline structure and particle agglomeration of materials. It is clear that electrochemical performances of all Cl-doped samples are better than those of blank sample. As the doping amount increases, the performance first enhances and then declines. For the rate performance of all samples, NaTi2(PO4)2.9Cl0.3 (NC/Cl-30) delivers discharge capacities of 257.8, 212.7, 169.5, and 146.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.4, 2, and 4 A g−1, with marked enhancement of 133.7, 124.4, 113.2, and 112.2 mAh g−1 compared with NaTi2(PO4)3/C (NC). In addition, NC/Cl-30 also exhibits outstanding cycling performance. The discharge capacity of NC/Cl-30 at 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles reaches up to 142.2 mAh g−1, 6 2 . 9 m A h g−1 larger than that of NC. NC/Cl-30 presents higher capacity resulting from proper Cl doping. Our work provides some references for optimizing performance of NaTi2(PO4)3 in sodium-ion battery through a method of anion doping.
In the current era, the reserves of non-renewable energy such as coal, oil, and natural gas have become less [1–4]. In addition, the environmental pollution caused by burning fossil energy (coal, oil, et al.) cannot be ignored [5–7]. Most countries in the world are developing and utilizing new energy and renewable resource, such as solar energy, wind energy, and so on [8–11]. However, the use of these energy sources is costly, inefficient, and intermittent [12–15], and the technology is not too mature. Therefore, it is more necessary to develop energy storage systems [16–18]. Lithium-ion battery, as a kind of electrochemical energy storage systems, has been successfully used in many aspects, such as smart electronics and automotive industry [19–24]. But unbalanced distribution and insufficient reserve of lithium resource hinder further application in energy storage systems [25, 26]. Both sodium and lithium are located in the IA main group, and sodium has rich natural reserves on earth. In latest years, sodium-ion battery has received a lot of attention from researchers because of abundant raw materials and low price [27–29].
Sodium-ion battery completes the charge and discharge process by sodium-ion intercalating and deintercalating in the electrode, thereby realizing the conversion of electric energy and chemical energy. Although the principle of sodiumion battery is similar to that of lithium-ion battery, the ionic radius of sodium is 1.02 Å, which is about 34% larger than that of lithium ions [30]. The insertion of sodium ions inevitably leads to larger volume expansion and even destroys the overall structure of electrode [31–33]. The destruction of electrode structure brings irreversible damage to reversibility and stability of batteries [34, 35]. Thus, finding a suitable electrode material for storing sodium ions has practical significance and applied value [36, 37]. Materials with three-dimensional frames and channels offer a possible choice because these channels provide wider transport path for sodium ions and allow faster transport of sodium ions [38–40].
At present, electrode materials owning this structural feature are being studied more and more. For example, olivinetype LiFePO4 and NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 can be used as cathode materials, and NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 can be used as anode materials in lithium- or sodium-ion battery [41–44]. However, the intrinsic conductivity of these materials is not satisfactory, resulting in poor cycle performance under large current [45, 46]. Moreover, ionic conductivity also needs to be further improved. There are several common ways to modify them to achieve the purpose of improving electrochemical performance. Modification methods mainly include preparing nanoscale particles [47, 48], introducing conductive agents [49], doping ions [30, 50, 51], et al. Among them, anion doping (F−, Cl−, et al.) may be an effective means. As reported by Pan et al. [52], LiFe(PO4)0.95F0.15/C was acquired by carbothermal reduction approach and utilized as cathode in lithium-ion batteries. It delivers the highest first-cycle discharge specific capacity. And it shows the best rate and cycle property, with the discharge capacity of 147.5 and 119.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 and 5 C, respectively. The experiment also proves that the charge transfer resistance of the battery can be reduced by replacing PO43− with F−. L i u e t a l . [38] successfully synthesized Na3V2(PO4)2F3 modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The reversible capacities of Na3V2(PO4)2F3-SWCNT composite are 117.7, 114.3, and 100.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, and 10 C, respectively. It also possesses excellent cycling stability, keeping 96% of discharge specific capacity at 10 C after 500 cycles. The above facts indicate that anion doping has a positive influence on electrochemical performance of materials.
NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 has the advantages of environmental friendliness, low cost, high specific capacity, and thermal stability [53–55] and is an anode materials with promising prospects. More importantly, its three-dimensional channel is very beneficial for the rapid transmission of sodium ions [56]. In this paper, we prepared NaTi2(PO4)3-xCl3x/C via solgel approach. The inductive effect of Cl may lead to rearrangement of electron clouds in PO43−, further improving the conductivity of samples [41]. In addition, Cl doping can also significantly improve the kinetics of electrode materials by improving the ionic conductivity [57]. The sol-gel method is a simple method for synthesizing composites, which is safe and easy to get nano size material. Figure 1 shows a concise schematic of the whole synthesis process. The electrochemical properties of Cl-doped NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites are investigated in detail.
All composites were prepared by a sol-gel technique, and all raw materials were analytical purity without any other treatment before using. First, 1.7363 g Ti(OC4H9)4 was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol under magnetic stirring to form matrix solution. Second, 0.2503 g CH3COONa dissolved in 15 mL ethanol, 0.17 g phenolic resin, and 2 mL concentrated HCl were poured into the matrix solution in sequence with stirring. Third, 0.8647 g H3PO4 was mixed with 15 mL ethanol using ultrasonic equipment. This homogeneous solution was dripped into the matrix solution. Subsequently, the beaker containing mixed solution was sealed by plastic wrap and heated to 55 °C in a water bath under stirring. After 3 h, the plastic wrap was removed to make the system open and heated to 70 °C to evaporate the ethanol. Then, the obtained precursor was grounded into powder and calcined at 750 °C for 5 h in tube furnace with argon environment. After calcination, it was grounded again to obtain blank NaTi2(PO4)3, which was recorded as NC. The basic preparation steps of Cl-doped samples were identical to those steps described above. The source of Cl was Cl− from HCl. The NaTi2(PO4)3-xCl3x (x = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) were prepared by appropriately reducing the mass of H3PO4 according to the stoichiometric ratio and recorded as NC/Cl-15, NC/Cl-30, and NC/Cl-60, separately.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to analyze type and purity of crystallization of four samples using Cu-Kα radiation (D/MAX2500PC, Rigaku). The agglomeration and surface morphology features were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with Hitachi S-4800 model from Japan. Electrode sheets after different cycles were also inspected by SEM. Before SEM, cells were taken apart, and the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried at 80 °C for 7 h.
Electrochemical properties of all materials were tested by CR2016 coin half cell, with sodium disk as counter electrode, glass fiber as separator, and NaTi2(PO4)3-based electrode as working electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in DMC/EMC/EC (1:1:1 volumetric) and 5% FEC. NaTi2(PO4)3, Super P , and PVDF with mass ratio of 7:1.5:1.5 were ground and mixed evenly, then dissolved in appropriate amount of NMP . Then, the mixed slurry was coated on Cu foil and cut into 14 mm small wafer after drying at 80 °C. The mass load of the obtained working electrode was 1.5– 1.9 mg cm−2. The cells were assembled in the glove box, in which water and oxygen value were both less than 0.1 ppm. Charge and discharge performance of cells was evaluated by rate and cycling tests, which were carried out on Neware system (CT-3008W) with voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were executed on CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai). For EIS tests, frequency varied from 0.01 to 100,000 Hz. After the cell was activated at a small current of 0.04 A g−1 and charged to 2.1 V at a constant voltage for 2 h, the EIS test could be performed. For CV tests, scan rate was 0.2 mV s−1 and voltage range was 0.01–3.0 V.
Figure 2 displays XRD patterns of four composites. Strong diffraction peaks of all samples are indexed to rhombohedral NaTi2(PO4)3 (JCPDS no.01-084-2008). There are no obvious diffraction peaks of other impurity substances. The results show that doping a small amount of Cl has no visible effect on the crystal form in this experiment.
In order to observe whether the surface morphology changes after Cl doping, SEM is carried out. Images at low and high magnification for NC and NC/Cl-30 are displayed in Fig. 3. As shown, the size of most particles is nanoscale. But there are still some agglomerations for two samples. It is noted that surface morphology for NC and NC/Cl-30 is almost no difference. This indicates that the improvement in electrochemical performance of NC/Cl-30 is mainly due to Cl doping, not due to differences in morphology and particle size.
Rate performance of all samples at current density from 0.04 to 4 A g−1 is presented in Fig. 4. As can be seen, the rate performances of all Cl-doped samples are generally higher than those of blank samples. This result shows that replacing PO43− with Cl− is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance. This may benefit from the simultaneous improvement in electron conductivity and ionic conductivity after Cl incorporation. It is noted that the amount of doped Cl has a significant effect on electrochemical performance. As the amount of Cl increases, electrochemical performance becomes better and then deteriorates. NC/Cl-30 with suitable Cl content shows the highest discharge capacity compared to other composites. It releases discharge capacity of 257.8, 212.7, 169.5, and 146.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 0.4, 2, and 4 A g−1, respectively. However, NTP only releases 124.1, 88.3, 56.3, and 34.1 mAh g−1 at the same current. Obviously, discharge capacities of NC/Cl-30 far exceed those of NC. Moreover, after cycling at 4 A g−1, all samples maintain high discharge capacity at 0.1 A g−1. And these values are almost no decline contrasted to original value, indicating good stability and reversibility of the cell.
To further study the stability of the materials, chargedischarge curves of all samples are shown in Fig. 5. T h e shape and trend of four sets of curves are similar. All curves show a large voltage platform around 2.1 V and a small voltage platform around 0.4 V . Clearly, the voltage platforms around 2.1 V for Cl-doped samples remain well, demonstrating complete and sufficient Na+ intercalation and deintercalation process. For NC, platforms around 2.1 V can maintain at low currents. As current increases, platforms gradually deteriorate and almost disappear at high currents. This may lead to poor rate performance of NC. As for small platforms near 0.4 V , NC/Cl-30 maintains the best, which contributes to display the best rate performance among all samples.
The cycling performance of NC and NC/Cl-30 is compared in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows the discharge capacity of two samples at 1 A g−1 (1000 cycles). NC/Cl-30 delivers discharge capacity of 142.2 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles, while that of NC is only 79.3 mAh g−1. The value of NC/Cl-30 is approximately twice as large as NC. And this significantly increased discharge capacity indicates excellent long-term cycling performance of NC/Cl-30. As seen from Fig. 6b, coulombic efficiency of NC and NC/Cl-30 is almost 100%, confirming the excellent reversibility and stability of assembled cells. Figure 6c and d present charge-discharge curves of NC and NC/Cl-30 after different cycles. There are stable charging and discharging platforms at around 0.4 V and 2.1 V for both samples. It is noted that NC/Cl-30 has more prolonged platforms and delivers higher discharge capacity than NC for each cycle, showing excellent cycling property of samples.
Cyclic voltammetry tests were implemented on cells to investigate intercalation/deintercalation process of Na+ in the electrode. Figure 7 a displays the cyclic voltammetry curves of NC and NC/Cl-30 with scanning speed of 0.2 mV s−1. T w o pairs of peaks appear near 0.04–0.77 and 1.80–2.48 V for two composites, corresponding to two platforms for chargedischarge curves. Two pairs of peaks correspond to Ti4+/Ti3+ and Ti3+/Ti2+ redox reactions, respectively. It is noted that NC/ Cl-30 shows higher and sharper redox peaks than NC. This indicates that intercalation/deintercalation process of Na+ can be effectively facilitated by Cl doping. Corresponding peak current densities are compared in Fig. 7b. The oxidation peak current densities for NC/Cl-30 are 0.116 and 0.154 A g−1, a n d the reduction peak current densities are 0.106 and 0.175 A g−1, respectively. For two pairs of peaks, the current densities of NC/Cl-30 are greater than those of NC. The enhanced electrochemical activity is probably attributed to that Cl doping improves the conductivity and broadens pathway in material, accelerating electron and Na+ transfer.
To explore the impact of Cl doping on kinetic process of Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests are executed and the results are displayed in Fig. 8. Nyquist curves are composed of a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a tilted line in lowfrequency region. The size of semicircle diameter represents the value of charge transfer resistance (Rct) [58]. Rct for NC and NC/Cl-30 are 346.6 Ω and 196.9 Ω, separately . The lower Rct for NC/Cl-30 reveals that Na+ migration at electrode/ electrolyte surface in NC/Cl-30 electrode is faster than NC electrode and proves positive impact of Cl doping. Each curve has an intercept on the Z′-axis at high frequency, standing for ohmic resistance (Rs). Rs for NC/Cl-30 is lower than that of NC. This shows that the electrical conductivity of NC/Cl-30 becomes better after Cl doping. The sloping line on behalf of Warburg impedance (Zw) can reflect the diffusion performance of Na+ in the electrode. Larger slope for NC/Cl-30 implies that Na+ diffusion in NC/Cl-30 electrode is faster than that for NC [32, 59].
 Aiming at observing the deterioration of electrode surface after different cycles, SEM is carried out and images are revealed in Fig. 9. The electrode surface after 100, 500, and 1000 cycles is not significantly different, illustrating excellent structural stability of NC/Cl-30 electrode. There are no large holes and defects appearing on the surface, even after charging  and discharging 1000 times. The cycle and rate performance of NC/Cl-30 is outstanding, and electrode structure of NC/Cl30 maintains well. This can demonstrate excellent performance of NC/Cl-30 material. 
In summary, Cl-doped NaTi2(PO4)3/C was fabricated through a sol-gel method followed by high-temperature calcination. From XRD and SEM results, crystallographic phase is pure and surface morphology is unchanged. It shows that the introduction of a small amount of Cl does not affect the crystal and morphology of all samples. In terms of electrochemical performance, NC/Cl-30 performs best in all samples. It delivers discharge capacity of 257.8, 169.5, and 146.3 mAh g−1 at 0.1, 2, and 4 A g−1, while those of NC are 124.1, 56.3, and 34.1 mAh g−1, severally. Undergoing 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1, d i s charge capacity of NC/Cl-30 reaches 142.2 mAh g−1. Moreover, Rct of NC/Cl-30 is also significantly improved compared with NC. Cl doping on PO43− site is an easy and effective way to improve electrochemical performance of NaTi2(PO4)3.
