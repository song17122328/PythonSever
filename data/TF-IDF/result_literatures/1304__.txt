Abstract.  All samples of NASICON have been synthesized by taking new chemical (Na2.H.PO4.2H2O) by solid sate  reaction method at different sintering temperature range (1150-1250 ºC). The synthesized samples were characterized by  X-ray powder diffraction and Impedance spectroscopy. The variatioQRIİƍZLWKIUHTXHQF\LQGLFDWHV the relaxation in all  the samples.

Sodium  superionic  conductors  (NASICON)  have  wide applications in solid state electrochemistry where  fast  ioQLF FRQGXFWLYLW\ LV UHTXLUHG [1].  A  detailed  literature  the  dielectric  spectroscopy studies of these compounds are not well  explored. Different methods and chemicals have been  used  to  synthesize  NASICON  materials.  To  see  the  variation  in  dielectric  and  impedance  properties  we  used  a  new  chemical  Na2.H.PO4.2H2O  to  synthesize  NASICON.  The  effect  on  Z constant,  w.  r  presented in this paper. 

All  samples  were  prepared  by  solid  state  reaction  method  by  taking  rHTXLUHG VWRFKLRPHWULF DPRXQW RI oxides for the composition (Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12) for (x=  2).  Appropriate  amount  of  ZrO2,  SiO2,  Na2CO3  and  Na2.H.PO4.2H2O  were  mixed  and  ground  for  2h  in  agate  mortar.  The  mixture  was  preheated  for  4h  at  225°C  decompose  Na2.H.PO4.2H2O. The resulting ground mixtures were  dried, and then calcined at 900°C in alumina crucible  for 10 h to decompose Na2CO3. The calcined mass was  further  ground  for  2h  in  agate  mortar  to  get  fine  homogenize powder. Thereafter, the fine powder  was  pressed into sample discs (diameter 15 mm, thickness  3  mm)  using  10  tons  of  pressure.  Finally  all  samples  were  sintered  at  alumina  plate  at  1150,  1200  and  1250°C  for  14h  and  designated  as  N1,  N2  and  N3  respectively.  The  crystalline  phases  in  sintered  samples  were  identified  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction 

The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  N1,  N2  and  N3  samples are given in the figure 1. The volume fraction  and  indexing  of  the  phases  are  done  using  X’-pert  High  Score  Plus  software.  All  samples  exhibits  monoclinic-Na3Zr2Si2PO12  (ICDD  No.  01-084-1200),  phase with minor monoclinic-ZrO2 (ICCD No.01-0780047)  phase.  The  volume  fraction  of  ZrO2  phase  in  N1,  N2  and  N3  are  8%,  5%  and  13%  respectively.  Moreover, from figure 1 we also observed that N3 and  N1  sample  have  more  ZrO2  phase  than  N2.  In  N3  sample higher sintering temperature leads to loss of P  and  Na  and  expulsion  of  Zr4+  from  NASICON  takes  place which give rise to increased volume fraction of  ZrO2 phase. This precipitated phase (ZrO2) segregates

This  behavior  in  temperature  the  numbers  of  charge  carriers  are  increasing.

Moreover,  the  high  degree  of  dispersion  with  temperature  at  lower IUHTXHncy is clearly indicating that hopping type  conduction  mechanism  is  taking  place  in  the  sample  [4].
