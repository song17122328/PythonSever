Inorganic solid electrolytes play a critical role in solid-state  Li  batteries  achieving  high  safety  and  high  energy  densities.  The  synthesis  approaches  for  solid  electrolytes  are  important  for  both  fundamental  research  and  practical  applications.  Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3  (LATP)  and  Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3  (LAGP)  are  two  representative  solid  electrolytes with Na superionic conductor (NaSICON) structure. Here  in,  we  reviewed  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  from  the  synthesis  perspective,  and  correlated  with  their  structure  and  conductive  properties,  also  presented  their  electrochemical  applications  in  batteries.  Firstly,  the  solid-based  and  liquid-based  synthetic methods of LATP and LAGP solid electrolytes and the key  influencing  factors  are  described.    Secondly,  the  crystal  structure  and  phase  purity  from  different  synthetic  approaches  will  be  introduced.  Thirdly,  the  conductive mechanism  and  the composition  effects  and  synthesis  effects  on  conductivities  of  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  will  be  compared.  Fourthly,  the  electrochemical  applications  of  these  two  solid  electrolytes  in  full  batteries  will  be  discussed,  including  the  roles  as  solid  electrolytes,  composite  component  in  electrodes,  and  surface  coating  on  electrodes.  In  the  last section, a brief outlook is provided on the future development of  NaSICON-type solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries.  


Inorganic  solid  electrolytes,  in  comparison  with  their  liquid  counterparts,  have  more  potential  in  various  types  of  batteries  due  to  their  dual  roles  of  ion  transportation  and  separation.  For  all-solid-state  batteries,  solid  electrolytes  bring  several  advantages  [1-6]  such  as  enhanced  safety,  increased  energy  density,  solid  device  integration  and  packaging;  expanded  operation  temperature  range;  and  potentially  improved  cycling  stability  and  lifetime.  Moreover,  inorganic  solid  electrolytes  are  also beneficial for Li-ion batteries and Li-air batteries when they  function  either  as  surface  medication  layers  or  as  Li-ion  conductors [7,8].  

In  principle,  the  ideal  solid  electrolytes  are  expected  to  have  several  features  [9-14]:  (1)  fast  ion  dynamics  and  negligible  electronic conductivity (minimum ionic conductivity of 10-4 S cm-1  at  room  temperature  for  practical  consideration);  (2)  a  wide  electrochemical  potential  window  for  battery  cycling;  (3)  an  exceptional mechanical strength to suppress  Li dendrite growth;  (4)  an  excellent  thermal  stability  during  the  cycling  processes;  (5)  a  simple  and  low  cost  synthesis  process  for  large-scale is  an  Assistant  Professor  of 

LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  have  been  synthesized  from  several  different  methods,  which  can  be  generally  divided  into  solid-based  and  liquid-based  approaches.  The  solid-based  methods  include  solid-state  synthesis,  melt-quenching,  and  fast  sintering  techniques.  The  liquid-based  approaches  include  solgel,  co-precipitation,  solution-based,  evaporation-induced  selfassembly reaction, and others. 

Solid-state synthesis  is  a  classic  way  to  prepare  inorganic  solid  electrolytes  such  as  LATP  and  LAGP  [35,41-50].  In  this  method  (Figure  1a),  the  chemical  precursors  are  mixed  and  ball  milled,  followed  by  the  solid-state  reaction  and  densification  through  annealing  and  sintering  heat  treatments,  which  usually  require  high temperatures (700-1200ºC) and long dwell times (>12 h). It  is  notable  that  metal  oxides  (i.e.  TiO2,  Al2O3,  GeO2)  are  often  used  as  precursors  for  conventional  solid-state  synthesis.  In  addition, high temperatures are required to complete solid-state  and  achieve  maximum  densification  to  reduce  grain  boundary  resistance.  The  obtained  samples  usually  have  a  highly  crystalline  structure,  large  grains  and  less  grain  boundaries,  great  ionic  conductivity  and  high  density.  However,  lithium  loss  and  secondary  phase  formation  are  two  detrimental  effects  associated  with  high  temperature  heat  treatment  [51],  both  of  which  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Li-ion  conductivity.  For  solid-state  synthesis,  the  heat  treatment  parameters  such  as  temperature  and  time  influence  the  cell  volume,  phase  purity,  relative  density  and  ionic  conductivity  of the  final  product.  Song  and Sun et al [45] investigated the effect of sintering temperatures  on the structure, composition and conductive properties of LAGP  (Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3)  from  solid-state  synthesis.  They  reported  that  the  cell  volume  continuously  increased  as  the  sintering  temperature increased; in contrast, the phase purity and density  peaked  at  800  ºC  and  then  declined  due  to  the  appearance  of  secondary  phases  (GeO2  and  AlPO4)  and  increased  porosity.  They  found  the  sample  that  sintered  at  750  ºC  had  the  highest  total conductivity of 2×10−4 Scm−1 at room temperature.  


Melt-quenching  method  is  another  traditional  way  to  prepare  NaSICON-structured  ion  conductors  [52-59].  The  LAGP  glassceramic from the melt-quenching method was reported to exhibit  the  highest  Li-ion  conductivity  of  4.22  ×10−3  Scm−1  at  room  temperature  [53].  As  shown  in  Figure  1b,  this  method  requires  even  higher  temperatures  (i.e. 1500  ºC)  to  melt  the  precursors;  the  melt  is  then  quenched  at  room  temperature  to  form  an  amorphous  glass,  and  to  achieve  crystallization.  During  synthesis,  three  major  factors  are  known  to  influence  the  density,  ionic  conductivity  and  phase  purity  of  obtained  solid  electrolytes:  the  chemical  precursors,  sintering  methods,  and  the  temperatures.  Huang  and  Xu  et  al  [54]  investigated  the  effects  of  different  phosphorous  sources  (NH4H2PO4,  H3PO4,  P2O5,  H3PO4  and  Al(PO3)3)  as  well  as  various sintering temperatures (800-950 ºC) on the phase purity  and  conductive  properties  for  LAGP  (Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3)  solid  electrolytes.  They  found  that  the  H3PO4  precursor  and  850  ºC  sintering temperature contributed the best room temperature  Liion  conductivity  of  5.21  ×10−4  Scm−1.  Mahmoud  et.  al  [55]  compared  the  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  obtained  from  different  heat  treatment  methods  (powder  sintering  and  bulk  heating)  during the crystallization process. With the same initial chemical  compositions,  the  samples  prepared  from  bulk  heat  treatment  showed  higher  ionic  conductivity  (2.38×10−4  Scm−1),  thermal  conductivity and density than that of powder sintering (6.3×10−5  Scm−1).  


To reduce the lithium loss during the heat treatment process for  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolyte  synthesis,  rapid  sintering  techniques  are  developed:  spark  plasma  sintering  (SPS)  [60-62],  field-assisted  sintering  technique  (FAST)  [63],  and  microwave  (MW)  assisted  sintering  [64,65].  Figure  1  c-e  shows  the  set-up  of  these  rapid  sintering  techniques.  In  principle,  SPS  technique  utilizes  electrical  currents  to  aid  densification  in  a  die  with  resistive heating at high rates (>100 ºC/min)  [66,67]. FAST applies  a  voltage  exclusively  to  the  sample  during  sintering  to  increase the resistivity of the material and then achieve the similar effect  as  solid-state  sintering.  For  MW-assisted  sintering,  the  electromagnetic  energy  is  directly  introduced  inside  the  sample  and  transformed  into  heat  by  molecular  interactions,  leading  to  fast volumetric heating [68].  

Although  complicated  instruments  are  required,  these  fast  sintering  techniques  have  shown  ultrafast  timescales  while  providing  excellent  control  over  composition  and  phases.  In  addition,  the  rapid  heating  rates,  localized  heating  at  the  grain  boundaries, or the electric field enhancing diffusion mechanisms  of  these  techniques  contribute  to  the  enhanced  conductive  properties  of  the  obtained  solid  electrolytes.  Tortet  et  al.  [62]  employed  SPS  technique  to  enable  a  rapid  densification  of  LAGP  powder  in  10  mins,  leading  to  a  pellet  with  high  compactness  (higher  than  87%)  and  decent  room  temperature  Li-ion  conductivities  (bulk  conductivity  of  1.33×10−4  Scm−1,  total  conductivity of 3.3×10−5 Scm−1) with a relatively low temperature  processing  (650  ºC).  For  the  field-assisted  sintering  technique,  the  applied  voltages  were  reported  to  significantly  influence  the  density,  grain  size,  morphology  and  conductivities  of  obtained  LATP  samples  [63].  They  found  that  higher  applied  voltage  increased  ionic  conductivity.  With  the  help  of  MW-assisted  reactive  sintering,  Bregiroux  et  al  [64]  reported  that  pure  LATP  crystal  can  be  obtained  from  amorphous  and  compacted  LATP  precursors  powders in 10 mins. The obtained LATP sample had high phase  purity (no trace amount of AlPO4 detected), high relative density  (88 %) and great ionic conductivity (3.5×10-4 S cm-1).  

Liquid-based  methods,  in  comparison  with  solid-state  synthesis  and  melt-quenching  method,  require  lower  heat  treatment  temperatures  and  can  achieve  better  particle  size  and  morphology  control  of  the  synthesized  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes.  They  include  sol-gel,  co-precipitation,  solutionbased method. 

Sol-gel  method  offers  an  efficient  synthetic  path  for  crystalline  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  using  a  solvent  intermediate  step  to  form  a  colloid solution  and  then  a  gel  network,  followed  by  the  heat  treatment  for  crystallization  (Figure  2),  which  has  been  demonstrated  in  many  reports  [69-78].  With  the  sol-gel  method,  it  is  possible  to  obtain  pure  materials  at  lower  heat  treatment  temperatures  and  shorter  times  compared  to  solidstate synthesis and melt-quenching method. In addition, the solgel  method  also  enables  for  a  large-scale  synthesis  of  LATP  solid  electrolytes.  Ma  et  al  [73]  employed  aqueous-based  sol-gel  method  to  prepare  large  batch  LATP  (Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3)  solid  electrolytes (up to 1 kg) with high purity, great ionic conductivity  (6.9  ×10−4  Scm−1),  and  high  density  (95%).    During  the  sol-gel  process,  the  precursors,  the  solvents,  as  well  as  the  heat  treatment  all  affect  the  crystal  structure,  composition  and  the  conductivity  of  produced  solid  electrolytes  [72,73].  To  obtain  pure  phase  and  high  ion-conduction,  these  synthetic  parameters compared (precursors,  solvents  and  temperatures)  need  to  be  wellcontrolled.  Kotobuki  et  al.  the  LATP  (Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3)  solid  electrolytes  using  Al(NO3)3  and  Al(C2H7O)3  (both  water  soluble)  as  Al  sources,  and  found  that  AlPO4 impurity was observed only in the sample produced from  Al(NO3)3  and  not  from  Al(C2H7O)3  because  of lower  solubility in  water. Jiménez et al.  [69] reported that a slower heating process  and  conductivity  enhancement  for  sol-gel  synthesized  LATP  (Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3)  nanopowder.  step  were  beneficial lamination for Pechini  process,  a  modified  sol-gel  method,  is  defined  by  the  introduction  of  an  alpha-hydroxycarboxylic  acid,  such  as  citric  acid,  to  the  mixed  precursors  in  aqueous  solution  [75-78],  which  results  in  the  chelation  of  the  solution i.e.  a  large  and  crosslinked  network  is  formed.  After  the  polymerization  and  decomposition  in  the  following heat  treatment  processes,  nanosized LATP or LAGP particles are obtainedtypically 20-50 nm.  Zhang  et  al  [77]  investigated  the  effect  of  heat  treatment  atmosphere on the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) produced by citricacid-assisted  sol-gel  method.  They  found  that  a  two-step  heat  treatment  (the  dry  gel  is  calcined  in  argon  first  and  then  in  air)  yielded  nanosized  LATP  (40  nm)  with  less  aggregation  than  LATP  prepared  by  a  conventional  sol−gel  method,  leading  to  a  high  ionic  conductivity  (5.9  ×  10−4  Scm−1)  and  97%  relative  density. Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 (LAGP), synthesized from citric acid  assisted  sol-gel  method,  was  reported  to  show  a  maximum  Liion conductivity of 1.22 × 10-3 Scm-1 at room temperature [75].  

LiTi2(PO4)3  and  LiGe2(PO4)3  is  around  x=0.4-0.5  in  Li1+xAlxTi2x(PO4)3  and  Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3,  above  which  the  content  of  secondary phase increases. 

Unlike  perovskite-type  and  garnet-type  oxides,  NaSICON  type  structure  is  pretty  stable  in  an  aqueous  enviroment.  Adams’s  group studied the structural change of Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (x=0.5,  LAGP) glass when the pressed pellet was inmersed in deionized  water  for  20  days  and  found  that  NaSICON  type  structure  still  existed with only a slight difference in the Al content [52].  


AlPO4 is the most common secondary phase besides LiTi2(PO4)3  when LATP solid electrolyte is synthesized. It is amorphous and  forms as a barrier layer at the grain boundaries of LATP [87]. The  amount  of  AlPO4  phase  varies  depending  upon  the  synthetic  approaches  and  process  parameters.  In  solid-state  synthesis,  the  residual  parent  phase  may  exist  due  to  the  incomplete  reaction  if  the  heat  treatment  temperature  is  too  low  (i.e.  <600  ºC)  [88].  When  the  temperature  is  higher  than  900  ºC,  the  secondary phase AlPO4 appears, suggesting the loss of Al from  NaSICON-type  structure.  At  high  temperatures  (>950  ºC),  the  rhombohedral  lattice  structure  in  LATP  shrinks  due  to  the  vaporization of Li2O, resulting in the formation of AlPO4 and TiO2  phases  treatment  temperatures  for  solid-state  synthesis  are  considered  between  650-800  ºC.  In  liquid-based  approaches,  the  secondary  phases  are often related to the chemical precursors and heat treatment  temperatures.  For  example,  when  different  Al  sources  were  used  as  precursors  in  sol-gel  synthesis  [72],  the  LATP  from  Al(NO3)3  contained  a  small  amount  of  AlPO4  while  the  LATP  from  Al(C3H7O)3  resulted  in  higher  purity.  For  solution-based  synthesis,  Key  et  al  [80]  clearly  observed  that  the  removal  of  Al  from  the  primary  phase  was  dependent  on  annealing  temperatures,  which  was  confirmed  by  NMR  results.  Besides  AlPO4, Li4P2O7 also has been reported as a secondary phase in  LATP  powder  synthesized  from  the  Pechini  method  (modified  sol-gel)  when  the  calcination  temperature  was  higher  than  850  ºC [89].  



In  general,  the  ionic  conductivities  of  LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  are  influenced  by  synthesis  methods  and  compositions.

The  conductivities  of  LATP  and  LAGP  from  both  solid-based  synthesis  and  liquid-based  approaches  are  influenced  by  the  chemical  precursors.  In  solid-state  synthesis  of  LAGP  solid  electrolytes,  different  phosphorous  sources  (NH4H2PO4,  H3PO4,  P2O5 and H3PO4 and Al(PO3)3) were employed and compared [54].  The  H3PO4  precursor  resulted  in  the  best  phase  purity  and  highest  room  temperature. With the melt-quenching method, Morimoto et al [92]  added  the  excess  amount  of  Li2O  precursor  to  synthesize  the  LAGP  glass-ceramic  and  found  that  the  excess  Li2O  was  beneficial  for  higher  ionic  conductivity.  Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)30.05Li2O reached the maximum ionic conductivity with bulk and  total values of 1.18×10−3 S cm−1 and 7.25×10−4 S cm−1 at room  temperature, respectively. In sol-gel method, different Al sources  (Al(NO3)3  and  Al(C2H7O)3)  were  used  to  compare  the  obtained  [72].  The  Al(C2H7O)3LATP  produced sample exhibited higher phase purity as well as higher  ionic conductivity.  

The  heat  treatment  (method,  temperatures  and  time)  have  significant  influence  on  the  ionic  conductivities  of  produced  LATP and LAGP for both solid-based and liquid-based synthesis  approaches.  

In solid-based approaches, Davis et al [65] demonstrated that the  LATP  synthesized  from  microwave-assisted  method  had  the  ionic conductivity of 5.33 × 10  -4 Scm-1, 5 times higher than that  of  LATP  from  conventional  heat  treatment.  They  attributed  the  Li-ion conductivity enhancement to the microstructure difference,  specifically  the  larger  grain  size  and  lower  grain  boundary  resistance.  The  same  trend  was  observed  for  comparison  of  SPS  with  conventional  sintering  methods  to  prepare  LATP  [60]  and  LAGP  [62].  Kotobuki  et  al. [72]  prepared  LAGP  glass-ceramic  by  melt-quenching  method  and  found  that  the  obtained  sample  exhibited  higher  ionic  conductivity  (4  ×  10  -4  Scm-1)  than  LAGP  from  traditional  sintering.  With  precise  control  of  the  sintering  temperature  and  time  in  the  melt-quenching  method,  LAGP  (Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3  (x  =  0.5))  samples  were  reported  to  show  room  temperature  ionic  conductivity  of  4.22  ×  10  -3  Scm-1  after  heating at 825 °C for 8 h [53], and 5.08×10−3 S cm−1 after heating  at 850 °C for 12 h [63]. 

For sol-gel method, Jin et  al  [75] reported the synthesis of LATP  solid  electrolytes  under  different  calcination  temperatures and  found  the  best  ionic  conductivity  (6  ×  10  -4  Scm-1)  with  the  highest  density  (95%)  was  obtained  after  the  850  ºC  heat treatment. During the sintering process, the preheating and  final  sintering  temperatures  were  investigated  for  rhombus-like  LATP  powder  synthesis  [88].  The  low-preheating  temperature  (<600  ºC)  had  an  incomplete  reaction  between  precursors,  which  generated  voids  in  the  following  final  sintering  process.  The  optimization  of  heat  treatment  (600  ºC  pre-heat  treatment  and 900 ºC sintering temperature) yielded the highest total Li-ion  conductivity of 1.5 × 10  -4 Scm-1 at room temperature. For LAGP 

All-solid-state Li batteries were assembled using LATP or LAGP  as the solid electrolytes. In such batteries, the cathode materials  include  LiCoO2,  LiFePO4  and  LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2  as  cathode  materials, and anode materials include Li and Li4Ti5O12.   

When LATP or LAGP is used as the solid electrolyte in the solidstate batteries with Li anode, it faces the big challenge of a high  level of chemical reactivity at interfaces of LATP/Li and LAGP/Li  (Eq.  1  and  2)  [52]. 𝟐𝑳𝒊𝑮𝒆𝟐(𝑷𝑶𝟒)𝟑 + 𝟒𝑳𝒊 → 𝟑𝑮𝒆𝑶𝟐 + 𝟔𝑳𝒊𝑷𝑶𝟑 + 𝑮𝒆  (Eq.1) and 𝑳𝒊𝑻𝒊𝟐(𝑷𝑶𝟒)𝟑 + 𝑳𝒊 → 𝑳𝒊𝟐𝑻𝒊𝟐(𝑷𝑶𝟒)𝟑 (Eq.2) To address  this  issue,  a  buffer  layer  such  as  PEO,  LiPON,  or  Li3PO4,  was  introduced  to  avoid  the  direct  contact  between  LATP  solid  electrolyte  and  Li  metal  and  stabilize  the  interface.  Xie  et  al. [94]  first  reported  a  Li/PEO/  LATP/LiCoO2  battery  structure,  which  exhibited  a  high  operation  voltage  of  3.8  V  and  a  high  capacity  above 150 mA h g−1 at 50°C. As shown in Figure 7, Yoon et al.  [95]  demonstrated  that  a  thin  LiPON  film  (1  μm)  on  LATP  solid electrolyte  also  successfully  prevented  the  direct  contact  between  LATP  with  Li  metal  and  stabilized  the  interface.  In  addition, an artificial Li3PO4 layer was proven to be effective and  the  assembled  batteries  delivered  an  excellent  capacity  retention ratio of 95.2% at 0.1 C rate after 50 cycles [96]. Sun and  Song  et  al  [97]  employed  an  Al2O3  coating  (150  nm)  on  LATP  surfaces  by  atomic  layer  deposition  (ALD)  (Figure  8a).  In  comparison  with  bare  LATP  and  LATP@  Li3PO4,  the  Li/Al2O3coated  LATP/Li  symmetric  cell  exhibited  much  better  performance with an overpotential of 0.9 V after 300 cycles (3.5  V for LATP and 3.8 V for LATP@ Li3PO4). 

Similar with LATP, LAGP solid electrolyte is also instable with Li  metal  anode  due  to  the  chemical  reactivity  issue  and  a  thin  stable film at the Li/ LAGP interface is an effective solution. For  instance,  Li/Ge/LAGP/Ge/Li  symmetric  cells  demonstrated  that  sputtering  an  amorphous  Ge  film  could  stabilize  the  interface  between LAGP solid electrolyte with Li metal anode (Figure 8b)  [93]. The Ge thin film not only suppresses the reduction but also  produces  an  intimate  contact  between  the  Li  anode  and  solid  electrolyte by forming a Li ionic conducting interlayer. In addition,  Kumar  et  al.  [98,99]  used  lithium  oxide/boron  nitride  based  polymer-ceramics  composite  or  liquid  electrolyte  (LiAsF6  in  EC:EMC:DMC) including 2 wt% vinylene carbonate (VC) as the  interface  layer  between  Li  and  LAGP  to  stabilize  the  interface.  An alternative solution is to introduce an excess amount of Li2O  in  LAGP  glass-ceramic  [92].  The  Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3-0.05Li2O  glass-ceramics  showed  excellent  electrochemical  stability  with  lithium deposition and dissolution at voltages between 0.5 V and  0.4 V vs. Li/Li+ and was stable up to 6 V vs. Li/Li+. Interestingly,  an  ultrafine  surface  of  LAGP  was  reported  to  suppress  Li  dendrite  growth  by  eliminating  protrusion  induced  locally  by  concentrated  free  electron  density  on  the  surface,  which  had  been  proved  in  Li-air  batteries  with  specific  capacity  of  1000  mAh g-1 [100]. 

Besides  Li  metal,  Li4Ti5O12  and  Li7Ti5O12  are  other  popular  anode  candidates  for  all-solid-state  batteries.  Inda  et  al.  [101]  demonstrated  a  Li4Ti5O12/LATP/LiCoO2  battery  structure  with  a  high  capacity  of  150  mA  h  g−1.  With  Li7Ti5O12  as  the  anode,  LiCoO2  as  the  cathode,  and  Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3  as  solid electrolyte, the assembled batteries were demonstrated to cycle  at a low current density (1 µA cm-2) and had poor capacity  [102].  They  mentioned  that  the  interface  resistance  between  LAGP  and Li metal increased with the storage time while the resistance  was constant when LAGP made contact with Li7Ti5O12.  


To  further  enhance  the  ionic  conductivity  and  modify  the  electrochemical  properties  of  LATP/or  LAGP,  composite  solid  electrolytes were prepared.  


LATP  and  LAGP  solid  electrolytes  were  combined  with  popular  anode  materials  such  as  Li4Mn5O12  and  Li4Ti5O12  to  form  composite  anodes.  The  compatibilities  of  LATP  with  these  two  anode  materials  were  studied  through  the  crystal  structure,  cyclic  voltammograms,  and  capacity  tests  [108].  They  found  that  Li4Mn5O12-LATP  had  high  phase  purity  in  comparison  with  Li4Ti5O12-LATP  composite,  which  contained  TiO2  impurity.  In  addition,  the  Li4Mn5O12-LATP  composite  exhibited  obvious  reversible Li insertion and extraction peaks in CV. The all-solidstate  batteries  with  Li4Mn5O12-LATP  composite  as  the  anode  showed  a  discharge  capacity  of  480  Ahcm−2,  and  the  performance could be further improved with a higher filling ratio 

The  composite  cathodes  with  LATP/LiCoO2  were  prepared  and  cycled in full Li batteries [92,109]. This composite cathode exhibited  high capacity (around 180 mAh g-1) and good cycle performance  at  a  high  charge  cut-off  potential  of  4.5  V  (vs.  Li/Li+)  in  the  lithium cell [92]. The enhanced performance of the full battery was  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  addition  of  LATP  inhibited  the  increase  in  charge  transfer  resistance  and  decreased  the  activation energy  of the  LiCoO2 electrode. The SEM image and  EDS  maps  of  LCO/  LATP  composite  (Figure  10)  exhibited  a  homogeneous  distribution  of  LATP  over  LCO  cathode  material.  The  LATP  nanoparticles  dispersed  within  the  cathode  had  high  lithium  ion  conductivity,  which  played  a  crucial  role  in  operating  the all-solid-state lithium-ion battery [109]. Yoon et al [110] sputtered  LiCoO2  on  LATP  (Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3)  to  form  a  composite  cathode.  The  LCO/LATP  interface  remained  stable  during cycling  in  comparison  with  the  interface  of  LCO  cathode  and  sulfide or perovskite type solid electrolytes. Koenig et al  [111] also  tried to deposit LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) on LAGP pellets to form a  composite  cathode  and  assembled  a  battery  with  structure  of  Li/LAGP/  LMNO  on  LAGP.  Thick  interfacial  phases  resulted  in  high electrochemical resistance and poor cycling performance.  

Surface  modification  is  currently  one  of  the  most  widely  used  strategies  for  improving  the  cycling  performance  of  electrode  materials,  especially  for  solving  the  capacity  fading  problem  at  high  temperature  and  large  rates.  LATP  and  LAGP  are  both  recognized as good candidates for surface modification of anode  and cathode materials in Li-ion batteries.   

Spinel  LiMn2O4  is  also  one  of  the  most  promising  cathode  materials for Li-ion batteries owing to its low cost and discharge  potential of 4.2V (vs Li/ Li+). However, it faces one big challenge  of  Mn  dissolution  in  liquid  electrolytes  due  to  side  reactions  at  the  cathode/electrolyte  interface  during  battery  cycling,  which  results in  dramatic  capacity  fading.  LATP  solid  electrolyte,  as  a  surface  modification  layer,  could  efficiently  prevent  such  interfacial reactions and contribute to better cyclability. Wu et al  [112]  employed  a  liquid-based  approach  to  form  a  layer  of  LATP  coated  on  LiMnO4  to  enhance  its  electrochemical  stability  up  to  [77]  prepared  nano-sized  LATP  40  cycles.  Zhang  et  al  Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3  (LATP)  with  spinel  LiMn2O4  as  a  composite  cathode. The battery cycling performance was greatly improved  at  both  ambient  and  elevated  temperature  with  only  4%  and  11% capacity loss after 100 cycles at 25 and 55 ºC. 

NASICONs solid electrolytes have been employed to protect the  Li  metal  anode  [43,52]  when  they  are  not  directly  contact  with  metallic Li. As shown in Figure 11 a , Adams et al.  [52] prepared  LAGP  pellets  with  thickness  of 1-2  mm  through  melt-quenching  method  (850  ºC  annealing).  This  pallet  was  sandwiched  between  Li  anode  and  catholyte  (LiOH  and  LiCl  in  aqueous  solution) in Li-air batteries to protect the anode. They found that  LAGP dense pellet was stable in water and the attach by water  remains  limited  to  a  thin  surface  layer.  Solid-state  synthesized  LAGP was also introduced to  be a protective layer on Li anode  in  Li-S  batteries  [43].  This  protective  layer  was  found  not  only  effectively  resist  corrosive  action  of  lithium  polysulfides  (LiPSs)  on  Li  metal  anode,  but  also  reduce  interfacial  polarization  and  restrain dendritic Li growth (Figure 11 c).   

LATP-LNMO  composite  electrode  was  prepared  by  Zhao  et  al  [113]. In their research, the designed LATP-LNMO cathode shows  higher  charge-discharge  capacity  (82.24  mAh·g−1  at−20  °C),  superior middle discharge voltage (4.51 V at −20°C), and higher  discharge  capacity  retention  (61%  at  −20°C)  as  compared  to  pristine LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 without LATP coating (39% retention). The  LATP-LNMO/LTO  full  cell  exhibited  the  energy  density  of  270  Wh·Kg−1 at −20°C, much better than that of pristine LNMO. The  LATP  coating  was  considered  to  play  an  important  role  in  enhancing  the  charge  transfer at low temperature. 

LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (C622) is one of the cathode materials with a  high capacity, but it suffers from a poor cycling stability and rate  capability.  To  overcome  its  shortcomings,  Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  (LATP) was prepared as a coating on the C622 cathode through  sol-gel  method  [114].  It  was  found  that  a  0.5  wt.  %  coating  of  LATP  on  C622  significantly  improved  overall  cell  performance  including  the  discharge  capacity,  rate  capability,  and  cycling  stability, which was attributed to a high diffusion coefficient and a  low  interfacial  resistance  of  LATP  coating.  However,  an  excessive coating may degrade the cell performance due to the  barrier  against  the  Li-ion  mobility.  LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2  is  another  popular  NMC  cathode.  Iriyama  et  al  [115]  investigated  the  sintering effect of the LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC) with LATP glass  ceramic  solid  electrolyte.  They  reported  that  higher  sintering  temperature  (900  ºC)  resulted  in  larger  interfacial  resistance  than lower sintering temperature (700 ºC)  due to a formation of  nonconductive Co-rich layer at the interface.  

NaSICON-type  solid  electrolytes  LATP  and  LAGP  have  been  successfully  synthesized  through  different  kinds  of  solid-state  and  liquid-based  approaches.  Solid-state  reaction  and  sol-gel  are  two  of  the  most  popular  synthetic  methods.
