NASICON structured Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (0.1x0.7) powders were prepared byhydrothermal synthesis method and the pressure applied to press the powders into pellets wasinvestigated in this study.
The conductivity was measured by an impedance analyzer and themicrostructures were examined by SEM.
The variation trend with Al amount was almostidentical for LATP pressed at high pressure and low pressure.
Both the total conductivities ofLATP prepared at high pressures and low pressures peaked at x=0.6. The conductivities ofLATP pressed at high pressures were all higher than those at low pressures.
The reason wasmainly attributed to the denser microstructures achieved at higher pressure.
NASICON structured Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (0.1<=x<=0.7) powders were prepared by hydrothermalsynthesis method in this study and the pressure applied to press the powders into pellets wasinvestigated.
The variation trend with Al amount was almost identical for LATP pressed at highpressure and low pressure.
Both the total conductivities of LATP-H and LATP-L peaked at x=0.6. Theconductivities of LATP pressed at high pressures were all higher than those at low pressures.
Thereason was mainly attributed to the denser microstructures achieved at higher pressure.
