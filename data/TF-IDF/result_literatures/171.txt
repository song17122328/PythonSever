Phosphor-converted white light emitting diodes (pc-WLEDs) have been used widely in many fields due to their signatures of energy saving, environmental friendliness, and long lifetime [1-3]. Phosphors play a key role in determining the quality of fabricated pc-WLEDs [4, 5]. Recently, a new family of phosphor hosts, Na+ ion super ionic conductors (NASICON) type compounds with a general formula of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, have been widely studied due to their versatile structure types and adjustable chemical compositions in isostructural compounds [6]. For example, when [Zr4+ + Si4+] was substituted by [Sc3+ + P5+], near-zero thermal quenching phosphors Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+/ Mn2+/ Tb3+ were achieved [7-9]. When [Na+ + Si4+] was substituted by P5+ ion, i.e., NaZr2(PO4)3, a large number of NASICON-type phosphors were synthesized by replacing Na+ ions with monovalent, divalent and trivalent metals, such as rare earth doped AZr2(PO4)3 (A = Li, K), M1/2Zr2(PO4)3 (M= Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu) and R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R= Y, La, Gd, Lu) [10-17]. 
It is well known that applying solid solution is an efficient method to tune the spectrum of Ce3+/Eu2+ ions which are ligand sensitive activators in phosphors [18-24]. The open framework feature of the NASICON-type structure provides a generic platform for designing solid solution luminescent material hosts, and thereby enables achieving of tunable photoluminescence by doping rare earth. To the best of our knowledge, however, there is only one report focus on the NASICON-type solid solution phosphors Ca1−xSrxHf4(PO4)6:Eu2+ [21]. In the NASICON-type structure of CaZr4(PO4)6 and SrZr4(PO4)6, Eu2+ shows blue-green and blue emissions [10, 25, 26]. However, the emissions from Eu2+ at which site is unclear and needed to be further investigated. Solid solutions between CaZr4(PO4)6 and SrZr4(PO4)6 can be formed [27]. Thus, it is possible to achieve tunable emission by changing the ratio of Ca2+ to Sr2+. However, investigation of Eu2+ in this series solid solutions has not been reported until now. 
Herein, we designed and synthesized a NASICON-type solid solution of Ca1−xSrxZr4(PO4)6:0.03Eu2+ (CSZPO:0.03Eu2+). The effects of the Sr2+ substitution on the crystal structure and photoluminescence properties were investigated in detail. The structural information was determined using the XRD data and the Rietveld refinement analysis. The blueshift and narrowing emissions were discussed.
Through a conventional high-temperature solid-state reaction, we have synthesized powder samples of Ca1−xSrxZr4(PO4)6: 0.03Eu2+ (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1). The stoichiometric starting materials of CaCO3 (A.R.), SrCO3 (A.R.), ZrO2 (A.R.), NH4H2PO4 (A.R.) and Eu2O3 (99.99%) were mixed and ground homogeneously in an agate mortar with pestle. Then, we transferred those homogenized mixtures into crucibles, and preheated them at 350℃ for 2 h. After that, we fired them at 1250 ℃ for 5 h under a reducing atmosphere of N2−H2 (5%). At last, the samples were ground into powders after natural cooling.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of our samples were obtained by using a D8 advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray tube. The General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) was employed to do the Rietveld refinements. A Zolix spectrophotometer with a 150 W xenon lamp was applied to collect the photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation spectra. Through equipping with an extra automatic temperature-regulating device, the temperature dependent luminescence properties were measured. By exciting the samples with a supercontinuum white light laser (SuperK EVO, NKT Photonics), the PL decay curves were detected by an Edinburgh Instruments system (LifeSpec II).
Fig. 1 depicts the crystal structure of MZr4(PO4)6 (M = Ca and Sr) viewing along the [111], [001], and [110] directions. MZr4(PO4)6 belongs to the NASICON family and crystallizes into a rhombohedral phase with space group 㼿3̅ [25, 28]. MZr4(PO4)6 is constructed by ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners with six isolated PO4 tetrahedra. Ca2+ and Sr2+ are coordinated with six oxygen atoms and randomly distributed at interstitial cavities of the structure. There are two types of bond lengths for Ca2+ and Sr2+, which are defined as Ca1/Sr1 and Ca2/Sr2. The average bond length of Ca1-O (Ca2-O) is 2.351 Å (2.508 Å), which is smaller than 2.383 Å of Sr1-O (2.543 Å of Sr2-O) because of the larger ionic radii of Sr2+. When Ca2+ ions are replaced by Sr2+ ions, a tunable photoluminescence can be expected in CSZPO:0.03Eu2+ by changing of the local environment.
Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of CSZPO: Eu2+ (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1). All the samples nearly display a single phase and can be matched well with the standard cards of CaZr4(PO4)6 (JCPDS card 33-0321) and SrZr4(PO4)6 (JCPDS card 33-1360). These results demonstrate that solid solutions can be formed over the whole x range. As the Sr2+ content x increases, the diffraction peaks of (104), (113), (024), and (116) crystallographic planes systematically shift toward the lower-angle side, as shown in Fig. 2(b). This is reasonable and consistent with previous reports [29, 30], because Sr2+ is larger than Ca2+. However, it is quite abnormal that the peak of (110) plane shifts to the higher-angle side along with the Sr2+ substitution. In order to illustrate this unusual higher-angle shift and reveal the phase structure evolution, the Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns were performed by using the rhombohedral structure of Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (ICSD NO. 91805) as the initial model [25, 27].The refined results are presented in Fig. 3, Fig. S1, and Table S1. The final fit factors (Rwp, Rp and χ2) indicate that all samples crystallize into the rhombohedral structure with a space group of 㼿3̅. The cell volume (V), the lattice parameter c, and the average bond lengths (Ca1/Sr1–O and Ca2/Sr2–O) increase almost linearly as raising the Sr2+ content x, which can be anticipated by the Vegard's law [31]. This is a strong evidence of the formation of continuous solid solution and the lattice expansion caused by the larger Sr2+. However, the lattice parameter a shows an anisotropic behavior, i.e., it decreases linearly. Such anisotropic behavior can be ascribed to the rotation of the corner-shared PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra around the c-axis [14, 21, 32]. The interplanar spacing dhkl of the {hkl} planes in the rhombohedral structure can be estimated by
For the {110} planes, d110 is proportional to only a, so the corresponding diffraction peak shifts toward the higher-angle side. As for other crystallographic planes, the dhkl values are decided by both a and c. The elongation (2.88%) of c is much larger than the shrinkage (0.76%) of a, i.e., the dhkl values are dominated by the increased c, so the lower-angle shift of the corresponding diffraction peaks is observed.
Luminescent properties of CSZPO:0.03Eu2+ (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) are shown in Fig. 4. The PLE spectra recording at the respective maxima in emission intensity exhibit a broad excitation band around 300-420 nm from the 4f-5d transitions of Eu2+ (Fig. 4a). The excitation band matches well with the emission of nearly ultraviolet (NUV) LED chips, making it possible to be NUV-based pc-WLEDs phosphors. Upon excitation of 365 nm, all PL spectra present a similar and asymmetric emission band ranging from 400 to 600 nm, originated from the transition from the lowest 4f65d energy state to the 4f7 ground state (Fig. 4b). The integrated PL intensity shows a maximum at x = 0.2 (Fig. 4c). It can be ascribed to the best crystallinity of the x = 0.2 sample [33], which is supported by the XRD results in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2. When the Sr2+ content x increases from 0 to 1, the PL peak shifts from 492 to 463 nm (Fig. 4d). The corresponding Commission Internationale de L’Eclairage (CIE) color coordinate changes from the blue-green region (0.1944, 0.3714) to the blue region (0.1532, 0.1574). The digital photographs of the samples reflect this blue-shift, see Fig. 5. The full-widths at half maximum (FWHM) narrows from 87 to 68 nm, indicating an improvement of the color purity. Both the PL peak position and the FWHM show a linear relationship with the Sr2+ doping content x, as a result of the continuous solid solution phosphors.
As illustrated in Fig. 1(c), there are two distinct Ca1/Sr1 and Ca2/Sr2 sites in CSZPO, which are randomly occupied by 90% and 10%, respectively [10]. The asymmetric PL spectra indicate that Eu2+ is distributed in both the Ca1/Sr1 and Ca2/Sr2 sites. Thus, the broad PL spectra are deconvoluted into two Gaussian bands, the low-energy band (peak 1) and the high-energy band (peak 2), see Fig. 6. The cumulative deconvoluted curves fit well with the observed spectra. Peak 1 (peak 2) is assigned to Eu2+ at the Ca1/Sr1 site (Ca2/Sr2 site), because the relatively longer Eu-O distance at the Ca2/Sr2 site leads to a weaker crystal-field splitting, i.e., a higher 5d level [26, 34].The intensity of peak 2 is stronger than that of peak 1 for all x values, suggesting that Eu2+ prefers to at the Ca2/Sr2 site over the Ca1/Sr1 site. This site-preference can be understood as follows: the Ca1/Sr1 site has the same number as the Ca2/Sr2 site in the host structure, but the occupation rates are quite different, 90% for the former and 10% for the later. Hence, there are more vacant Ca2/Sr2 site available for Eu2+ to occupy, naturally leading to the preference of Eu2+ for the Ca2/Sr2 site.
The peak wavelengths and FWHM of peak 1 and peak 2 as a function of the Sr2+ content x are plotted in Figure. 7(a), and detailed data are listed in Table S2. It shows that both peak 1 and peak 2 move toward short-wavelength side and get narrowed with increasing x. Generally, the Eu2+ 5d-4f emission in phosphors is affected by two separate factors: the nephelauxetic effect and the crystal filed splitting, see Fig. 8. The nephelauxetic effect causes a centroid shift εc, which can be estimated by the energy reducing of the barycenter of the 5d levels as compared to the free Eu2+ ion in vacuum [35]. The Eu-O bond stretches as the Sr2+ content x increases, i.e., the centroid shift εc becomes smaller, resulting in a blue-shift in the PL spectrum. On the other hand, the size of the crystal filed splitting εcfs depends on the crystal field strength, which gets weaker if the Eu-O distance is longer. Thus, εcfs will decrease as raising the Sr2+ content x. This also makes some contributions to the blue-shift of the emission. Besides, the narrowing of the PL spectra must be a result of the decrease of the crystal filed splitting.
Considering that the PL spectrum is the superposition of peak 1 and peak 2, the distribution of the Eu2+ ions between the Ca1/Sr1 and Ca2/Sr2 sites will also induce the shift of the PL spectrum [20, 36]. To address this question, the integral intensity ratio of peak 1 to peak 2 (I1/I2), as a function of x is plotted in Fig. 7(b). The I1/I2 increases as the Sr2+ content x increasing from 0 to 0.2, then decreases and eventually approaches to the case of x = 1 for pure Sr2+ end member. When the Sr2+ content x is low (e.g., 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2), the crystal structure of CSZPO:0.03Eu2+ must be close to CaZr4(PO4)6. The Sr2+ ions may prefer the lower occupation rate Ca2/Sr2 site. As a consequence, there are less Ca2/Sr2 sites available for the Eu2+ ions, and some of them would occupy the Ca1/Sr1 sites, indicating an increase of the I1/I2. However, at high Sr2+ content (0.2 ≤ x ≤1), the crystal structure approaches to SrZr4(PO4)6. The competition between Eu2+ and Sr2+ occurs at the Ca1/Sr1 site, i.e., a decrease of the I1/I2 with increasing x. It seems that the change in structure happens at x = 0.4 because of the sudden decrease of I1/I2 at this Sr2+ content. An increase of I1/I2 would induce a redshift of the PL spectrum, but the observed PL spectra in Fig. 4 exhibit a blue-shift over the whole x range. It is thus certain that the crystal field regulation plays a more dominant role compared to the distribution of Eu2+.
The decay behaviors of CSZPO:0.03Eu2+ collected at the respective maxima in the PL spectra under 330 nm excitation are displayed in Fig. 9. All the decay curves can be fitted by a bi‐exponential function [37]:
where I(t) is the luminescence intensity at time t. τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow components of the decay time. A1 and A2 are the corresponding fitting parameters. The detailed fitting results are listed in Table 1. Based on the fitted parameters in Eq. (1), the average lifetime (τ) can be acquired by using the following expression:
The values of τ are given in the inset of Fig. 9, that is 92, 191, 173, 151, 132, and 99 ns corresponding to x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1, respectively. One can notice that the variation trend of τ is similar to that of I1/I2 in Fig. 7(b), indicating that the dynamic behavior is related to the distribution of Eu2+ between the Ca1/Sr1 and Ca2/Sr2 sites. Generally, the electrons of Eu2+ in the higher energy 5d levels have a large chance to transfer to the lower ones and possess a relatively lower decay times [20, 36]. Thus, the fast (τ1) and slow (τ2) components are assigned to Eu2+ at the Ca2/Sr2 and Ca1/Sr1 sites, i.e., peak 2 and peak 1, respectively. The percentage contributions of the fast (Pc1) and slow (Pc2) components are listed in Table 1 [37]. Apparently, almost each decay curve is dominated by the fast component (τ1), which is consistent with the result that peak 2 is higher than peak 1 in all the PL spectra.
Temperature-dependent emissions of as-prepared samples are shown in Fig. 10. PL intensities of all samples decrease seriously when the temperature rises from 303 to 573 K (Fig. 10a). All samples possess a strong thermal quenching effect originated from the increased probability of non-radiative transition. In the magnified patterns in the inset, the intensity of the samples for x=0, 0.2, and 1 at 373 K decreases to 19.7%, 24.7%, and 15.3% of the initial value at room temperature. It is noted that the thermal quenching behavior is not very sensitive to the Sr2+ content. Only for the case of x = 0.2 exhibits the best thermal stability.
There are two well-known mechanisms for the luminescence thermal quenching. One is the thermal release process that 5d electrons return to the 4f levels through the intersection point in the configurational coordinate diagram by thermal activation [30] . The other is the thermal ionization process that 5d electrons jump into the host conduction band by thermal stimulation, see Fig. 10(d) [38]. The quenching temperature is usually high for the former, and low for the later. In CSZPO:0.03Eu2+, the luminescence thermal quenching can be attribute to the thermal ionization process. The band gap for CaZr4(PO4)6 and SrZr4(PO4)6 are 4.3 eV and 4.45 eV, respectively [26], i.e., an energy difference of 0.15 eV. On the other hand, the PL peaks of CaZr4(PO4)6: Eu2+ and SrZr4(PO4)6: Eu2 are 492 nm and 463 nm, respectively, which also yields an energy difference of 0.15 eV. The same amount of these two energy differences indicates that the thermal ionization energy (ΔE) in CaZr4(PO4)6: Eu2+ and SrZr4(PO4)6: Eu2 should be close to each other. This inevitably induces the insensitivity of the luminescence quenching of CSZPO:0.03Eu2+ phosphors to the Sr2+ content. In addition, the little improvement of thermal stability for the x = 0.2 sample might derive from that peak 1 has the largest spectral contribution and its thermal stability is better than that of peak 2 [39].
A slight blue-shift of the PL peak was observed as raising the temperature. The peak position evolutions of the x = 0, 0.2 and 1 samples are illustrated in Fig. 10(c). This blue-shift can be ascribed to the thermally active phonon-assisted tunneling of the lowerenergy emission band 5d electrons to the higher-energy emission band 5d levels, i.e., peak 1 5d electrons to peak 2 5d levels in CSZPO: 0.03Eu2+ phosphors [30, 40].
In summary, Ca1−xSrxZr4(PO4)6:0.03Eu2+ (0 ≤ x ≤1) was synthesized through a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The Rietveld refinements of XRD confirmed that single phase solid solutions were achieved when Ca2+ is substituted by Sr2+. The luminescence shifts to blue region and the emission band narrows with increasing Sr2+ content. Eu2+ shows a preference on Ca2/Sr2 sites. The crystal field effect dominates the tunable luminescence. The decay time results further confirmed the site-preference of Eu2+. The thermal stability is insensitivity to the Sr2+ content x. However, the thermal quenching is strong due to the thermal ionization of 5d electron into the host conduction band, which should be improved if it is used for pc-WLEDs.
