Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type compounds have been regarded as promising cathodes for sodium-ion batteries(SIBs) due to their favorable ionic conductivity and robust structural stability. However, their high cost and relatively low energy density restrict their further practical application, which can be tailored by widening the operating voltages with earth-abundant elements such as Mn. Here, we propose a rational strategy of infusing Mn element in NASICON frameworks with sufficiently mobile sodium ions that enhances the redox voltage and ionic migration activity. The optimized structure of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C is achieved and investigated systematically to be a durable cathode (76.6% capacity retention over 5,000 cycles at 20 C) for SIBs, which exhibits high reversible capacity (113.1 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 C) with relatively low volume change (7.6%). Importantly, its high-areal-loading and temperature-resistant sodium ion storage properties are evaluated, and the full-cell configuration is demonstrated. This work indicates that this Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C composite could be a promising cathode candidate for SIBs.
Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for grid-scale electric storage applications owing to the good performance as well as low cost of sodium resources [1–3]. However, SIBs face the challenges of low energy density and poor cycling stability [4]. In recent years, a wide range of materials with different crystalline structures and building units have been investigated as sodium hosts [5, 6], such as layered structure, tunnel structure, and framework structure, etc. Among them, polyanionic framework compounds have been brought into the limelight owing to their excellent structural stability, good safety, and small volume variations during cycling, especially for the need of large-scale energy-storage. As a typical one, Na3V2(PO4)3, an immortal superstar, has been extensively investigated as promising two-electron reaction cathode material. However, it faces severe bottle-necks owing to limited energy density (about 370 Wh·kg−1), low vanadium (V) abundance and relatively high cost. The substitution of V element with other inexpensive and earth-abundant active redox transition-metals (such as Mn, Fe, Ti, Zr, Cr, etc.) in Na3V2(PO4)3 shows promising features in terms of enhanced output voltage and specific capacity. J. B. Goodenough, et al. prepared NaxMV(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Fe, Ni) to improve operating voltage of the cathode by the regulation of V4+/V3+, Mn3+/Mn2+, Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ redox centers [7].
Soon afterwards, they reported a Na3MnZr(PO4)3 cathode which delivered high discharge voltage plateaus at 4.0 and 3.5 V through activation of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples [8]. Three-electron redox reactions are realized in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 exhibiting high capacity of 160 mAh·g−1 [9]. More recently, a novel three-electron reaction cathode of Na4MnCr(PO4)3 with a high average discharge voltage of 3.53 V is realized for the phosphate cathodes in SIBs [10]. Thus, the introduction of abundant and innoxious 3d element of manganese, is the first choice as the redox-center in sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) frameworks. However, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the effects of different levels of Mn substitution, especially on the crystal structure and redox potential. Another critical issue for SIBs is their performance under all-climate conditions, which closely involves in the transport of ions and electrons. Carbon coating is a practicable and economic technique that can be easily scaled up to improve the electronic conductivity [11–13], which is realized by uniform carbon-coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) with excellent cycling stability at both room temperature and low/high temperature (−20 °C/50 °C) [14]. Nanostructural tailoring can effectively facilitate the ion diffusion kinetics [15, 16], as demonstrated in Na3V2(PO4)3 via the integration of hierarchical structure and N-doped carbon coating [17].  Herein, in this work, we elucidate the effects of Mn ions infusing on the crystal structure distortion, ionic migration activity, and electrochemical performance of NASICON- structured Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤1) cathodes. Carbon coating and nanostructure design strategies are applied to improve the performance of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3, with favorable operating voltage (3.42 V) and high electronic conductivity/ionic diffusion capability, which delivers high-rate capacity and long cycling stability, even under high-areal-loading and all-climate tem-perature conditions. The Mn-substitution Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C with sufficient sodium ions occupancy demonstrates moderate volume changes (7.6%) during sodium ion insertion/extraction. Furthermore, from a practical point of view, full SIBs con-figurations are demonstrated using Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C as cathode and commercial hard carbon as anode, which exhibit high working voltage (3.26 V) and good cycling stability.  A series of NASICON-structured Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.5, 1) composites were synthesized using a one-step, solid-state reaction in molten surfactant-paraffin media (details are described in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM)). Crystal structures, electrochemical properties, and ionic diffusion coefficients of the Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.5, 1) are compared and showed in Fig. 1. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns collected on the Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C samples are illustrated in Figs. 1(a)–1(c). Rietveld refinement method is used to fit the XRD data. The fitting process is acceptable, with reasonably small weighted profile factors (Rwp = 8.46%, 8%, and 7.8%), and detailed structural information, including the unit cell lattice parameters, atomic positions and occupancies of both samples, is summarized in Tables S1–S3 in the ESM). The samples can be well inde_xed to the trigonal symmetry within the space group of R3c. The lattice parameters of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C (NMVP/C) are a = b = 8.8467 Å, c = 21.7368 Å, and V = 1473.292 Å3, which enable larger lattice space compared to its counterpart-Na3V2(PO4)3/C (V = 1438.679 Å3), providing satisfactory Na-ion diffusion interspace [18]. The typical crystalline structure of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 is presented in the Fig. S1 in the ESM. It is clear that the Mn goes to the V site as shown in Note S1 in the ESM, which means that the Mn atom replaces the position of V in a relative proportion. Each PO4 tetrahedron is connect with four neighboring Mn/VO6 octahedrons to form a 3D framework of [Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3]. The interstitial space of the frame under different oxygen environments has two types of independent sites for sodium ions occupying, one for sixfold coordination (Na1, 6b), and another for eightfold coordination (Na2, 18e). Due to the stronger bonding force between O and Na in the Na1 site, the electrochemical redox reaction is usually determined by the extraction and insertion of Na2 cations (Fig. S2 in the ESM) [19]. With the amount of Mn substitution increases, the positions of Na1 and Na2 are gradually fully occupied, which is consistent with the nominal chemical formula of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.5, 1). The Na fully occupied frameworks may offer preferable ionic migration dynamics than the partially occupied ones [20]. 
The electrochemical properties of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C samples are studied by galvanostatic cycling at 0.5 C rate and the corresponding dQ/dV curves are simultaneously provided (Figs. 1(d)–1(f)). The initial discharge capacity of NMVP/C cathode is 110.8 mAh·g−1, slightly lower than that of Na3V2(PO4)3/C (115.7 mAh·g−1) and higher than Na4MnV(PO4)3/C (103.4 mAh·g−1). After 100 cycles, the capacity retention of NMVP/C and Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode is 93.6% and 93.2%, respectively. For Na4MnV(PO4)3/C, only a discharge capacity of 88.6 mAh·g−1 can be retained, corresponding to 85.7% of its initial value after 100 cycles. From the dQ/dV curves, the NMVP/C cathode shows higher redox peaks (3.45/3.42 V) compared to Na3V2(PO4)3/C (3.39/3.37 V), which is ascribed to the activation of high-potential Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples [21, 22]. The Na4MnV(PO4)3/C exhibits two pairs of anodic and cathodic peaks located at around 3.64/3.55 V, and 3.39/3.34 V, owing to a series of reversible phase transitions. For cathode materials, both the specific capacity and the working voltage are critical. As shown in Fig. S3 in the ESM, the estimated energy density of NMVP/C (regarding both potential and capacity) is the highest of the three cathodes when coupled with a typical hard carbon anode.  To further reveal the reason of the enhanced electrochemical performance for NMVP/C cathode, the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was carried out on coin cells under the as-assembled condition to estimate the electrode process kinetics of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C samples (Figs. 1(g)–1(i)). The details for this calculation can be found in Note S2 in the ESM. The calculated sodium ion diffusion coefficients for NMVP/C cathode are in the range from 10−11 to 10−10 cm2·s−1, which are higher than those of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C (10−13–10−10 cm2·s−1) and Na4MnV(PO4)3/C (10−13–10−11 cm2·s−1). As shown in Fig. 1(i), the ionic-migration speed is very slow in region of Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples around 3.6 V, which is due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox centers [9, 18]. In order to investigate the volume change of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C samples during the sodium ion insertion/extraction processes, ex situ XRD measurements were executed (Fig. S4 in the ESM). The change of the unit cell volume (from Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 to Na1.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3) is found to be 7.6%, lower than those of Na3V2(PO4)3/C (8.1%) and Na4MnV(PO4)3/C (10.3%), respectively. This indicates that replacement V with proper amount of Mn indeed improves the charge transfer kinetics and sodium stability, so that the high energy density and excellent cycling stability can be achieved simultaneously. As discussed above, the substitution of Mn ion into the NASICON framework can significantly affect the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C. The abundant and non-toxic Mn-redox center can not only enhance the average intercalation voltage, but also introduce additional sodium ions accompanied by the Na1 and Na2 sites progressively filling up. However, the Na4MnV(PO4)3/C cathode offers inferior specific capacity and cycling stability, which may be attributed to the Jahn-Teller anisotropic lattice distortion in Mn3+, electrolyte degradation and other undesirable side reactions [23, 24]. Here, among the Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C compounds, Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C (NMVP/C) is proposed as a highly prospective cathode, owing to its sufficient Na supply, tiny volume change, high operating voltage, excellent cycling stability, and abundance in nature. In order to further highlight the effects of carbon coating and structural regulation on the electrochemical behaviors  of Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3/C cathode, the controlled sample Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 (NMVP) was prepared using the similar synthesis conditions except for without adding oleic acid. Raman spectra were recorded to reveal the surface-coated carbon of the samples (Fig. 2(a)). The two characteristic bands located at around 1,340 and 1,590 cm−1 are associated to the D-band (disordered carbon) and G-band (graphitic carbon), respectively. The intensity ratios of D to G bands of NMVP/C and NMVP are 1.06 and 1.13, respectively, suggesting a partially graphitized of the carbon layer [25]. The carbon contents of NMVP and NMVP/C are 1.03 wt.% and 12.61 wt.%, respectively, which are determined from thermogravimetric (TG) analysis in air condition (Fig. 2(b)). The crystal structure of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 remains intact after the TG analysis at 550 °C in air (Fig. S5 in the ESM). Surprisingly, the TG curves can maintain stable up to 450 °C, demonstrating the good thermodynamically stability of the compounds. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured to study the physical adsorption behaviors of the products (Fig. 2(c), and Fig. S6 in the ESM). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of NMVP/C is 21.96 m2·g−1, which is larger than that of NMVP (surface area of 17.42 m2·g−1). The pore diameter is mainly distributed at below 10 nm for both samples (the insets of Fig. 2(c), and Fig. S6 in the ESM). Such large surface area and abundant mesopores can facilitate the electrolyte infiltration and accelerate the strain relaxation effectively [26, 27]. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to identify the surface chemical composition of NMVP/C. The survey spectrum (Fig. S7 in the ESM) suggests that NMVP/C composite is mainly composed of Na, Mn, V, P, O, and C elements. The inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP) results further display the rational atomic ratio of Na:Mn:V = 3.50:0.51:1.51 for NMVP/C, indicating the high purity of the samples. Mn 2p high resolution XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 2(d), the peaks at 653.7 and 641 eV correspond to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 for Mn2+, respectively. The peaks at 654.8 and 642.6 eV belong to Mn3+, indicating the surface Mn2+ of MNVP/C is partially oxidized, which is consistent with previous reports [9]. The high-resolution of V 2p spectra (Fig. 2(e)) split into two peaks located at 517.4 eV (V 2p3/2) and 523.9 eV (V 2p1/2), which can be attributed to the trivalent V in the NMVP/C [28, 29]. In the case of C (Fig. 2(f)), the peak centered at 284.7 eV can be attributed to C–C bond, the peaks at 286.1 and 288.4 eV can be assigned to CO type bonds, respectively [30–32].The morphology and microstructure of NMVP/C and NMVP were observed by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S8 in the ESM). The SEM images of NMVP/C at low and high magnifications are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). The product exhibits a homogeneous hydrangea-like hierarchical structure, which is assembled by numerous interconnected nanoplates with different geometries and orientations, and further revealed by the TEM image (Fig. 3(c)). However, NMVP shows bulk microstructure with many voids between the neighboring particles (Figs. S8(a)–8(c) in the ESM). A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 3(d)) reveals lattice fringes of the nanocrystals, which can be correlated to the (213) planes of NASICON-type Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3. 
Besides, a thin carbon layer with an average thickness of 6 nm is contacted to the crystal. Elemental mappings analysis based on X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) is depicted in Fig. 3(e). The result shows that Na, Mn, V, P, O, and C elements are uniformly distributed throughout the whole domain. The NMVP sample also possesses good crystallinity and homo-geneous element distribution (Figs. S8(d) and S8(e) in the ESM). Owing to the unique structure of NMVP/C with carbon coating and hydrangea-like structure, a remarkable electro-chemical performance of NMVP/C composite is achieved in the half-cells compared with NMVP (Fig. 4). The rate performance of the two samples was compared at various current densities ranging from 0.5 to 50 C (1 C = 110 mA·g−1), as presented in Fig. 4(a). The NMVP/C electrode can deliver an average reversible capacity of 113.1, 108.5, 105.5, 103.2, 102.5, 101.3, 99.9, 95.5 mAh·g−1 at the rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 C, respectively. It is worth noting that a high specific capacity of 108.2 mAh·g−1 is quickly recovered, when the current density is reduced back to 0.5 C from 50 C, suggesting the electrochemical reactions are highly reversible. Additionally, the well-defined discharge curves at various current densities also verify the excellent rate capability and low polarization of the NMVP/C electrode (Fig. 4(b)). In stark contrast, the reversible capacities of the NMVP cathode decrease quickly when the current density is increased. Figure 4(c) shows the representative galvanostatic charge-discharge voltage profiles of NMVP/C and NMVP electrodes at a current density of 0.5 C. The electrochemical polarization of the NMVP/C electrode has been alleviated manifestly compared to NMVP. The NMVP/C electrode delivers an initial charge capacity of 113.5 mAh·g−1 and a discharge capacity of 110.7 mAh·g−1, affording a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, higher than that of NMVP (91.7%). The cycling performance of the two samples at 0.5 C is further compared (Fig. 4(d)). A capacity retention of 91.8% over 150 cycles is observed for NMVP/C electrode. The Coulombic efficiency of the electrode remains around 100% during cycling. For comparison, the capacity of NMVP drops rapidly, showing poor cyclic performance (69.3% capacity retention over 150 cycles). The high-rate long-term cyclability of NMVP/C is further performed in Fig. 4(e). The NMVP/C electrode deliver an initial specific discharge capacity of 93.1 mAh·g−1 at the rate of 20 C and retain a capacity of 71.3 mAh·g−1 after 5,000 cycles, corresponding to the capacity retention of 76.6%, demonstrating a extraordinary durable long-term cycle life. Impressively, the NMVP/C electrode also exhibits excellent cycling performance at other current densities (Figs. S9(a), S9(c), and S9(d) in the ESM), showing ultra-durable cycle life. For comparison, the NMVP electrode manifests poor cycling performance with substantial capacity loss (Figs. S9(a) and S9(c) in the ESM). The electrochemical impedance spectros-copy (EIS) spectra indicate that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of the NMVP/C electrode is much smaller than that of the NMVP electrode (Fig. S9(b) in the ESM). It is indicated that both the nanoplate-assembled structure and carbon coating can effectively improve the electronic conductivity and ion transfer kinetics of the NMVP/C electrode.  To demonstrate the practical potential of the NMVP/C cathode, we further evaluated the electrochemical properties with under different areal mass loadings and all-climate temperatures. Figure 4(g) shows the cycling performance of NMVP/C cathode with different mass loadings of 1.6, 2.5, and 3.2 mg·cm−2 at 5 C. It can be clearly seen that as the loading increases, the specific capacity decreases slightly, but the cyclic stability remains stable. Even at a high active material loading of 3.2 mg·cm−2, the NMVP/C composite can still deliver high capacities of > 60 mAh·g−1 at 5 C over 2,000 cycles, further demonstrates the high availability and stability of the active material. In addition, the electrochemical properties under all-climate temperatures are provided in Fig. 4(f). The NMVP/C electrode delivers stable capacities of 99.9, 100.3, 96.8, 86.5, and 61.4 mAh·g−1 under the rate of 5 C at 20, 30, 40, 50, and -20 °C, respectively. When the temperature is reseted back to 20 °C, a reversible and stable capacity of 93.7 mAh·g−1 can be recovered. There is almost no difference in the performance of NMVP electrodes between 40 °C and room temperature, however, indicating that their superior Na-storage behavior can be well maintained in hot climate regions. The low- temperature resisted performance can be improved through collaborative optimization of electrolyte and separator [33]. When cycling at 50 °C, the specific capacity of NMVP/C is lower than those in 20, 30, and 40 °C. High temperature testing condition accelerates the kinetics of electrochemical reactions, leading to the decomposition of electrolyte and the growth of interface film, resulting in irreversible capacity loss [34, 35].
In order to grasp deeper understanding of the structural evolution in the NMVP/C cathode during sodium ions extraction/insertion process, ex situ XRD experiments were carried out at various voltage states, as shown in Fig. 5(a). In general, the diffraction peaks located at 14°–15°, 20°–21°, 23°–25°, 31°–33°, and 34°–36° undergo compelling shift and gradually recover to the initial state during charge/discharge, demonstrating the highly reversible phase transition. The (211) profile shifts toward a higher angle, and totally disappears during the desodiation process. The peak gradually reappears at the later stage of sodiation process and then shifts to a lower angle. When sodium ions are being extracted during the charge process, the (104) peak consecutively shift to a higher angle and then split into two. As sodium ions being inserted back to the crystal lattice, the (104) peak experiences an exact opposite evolution. The results demonstrate that the electro-chemical reaction of NMVP/C electrodes is a reversible process of sodium ions extraction/insertion (Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 ↔ Na1.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 + 2Na+ + 2e−) (Fig. S2 in the ESM). 
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves and GITT measurements are performed to further reveal the electrode reaction kinetics of NMVP/C and NMVP. The inset of Fig. 6(b) shows the first three consecutive CV curves of the NMVP/C electrode in the voltage range of 2.5–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na. The well defined sharp redox peaks at 3.49/3.42 V should be attributed to the sodium ions extraction/insertion of the MNVP host structure. With the increasing scan rate, both the peak current and the potential polarization increase (Fig. 6(b) and Fig. S10 in the ESM). The corresponding linear relationships between peak current (Ip) and square root of scan rate (ν1/2) of the anodic/cathodic processes for NMVP/C and NMVP electrodes are shown in Fig. 5(c), and Fig. S10(b) in the ESM. Based on Randles Sevcik equation (Note S3 in the ESM), the diffusion coefficients of sodium ions in solid state NMVP/C composite are calculated to be around 10−9 cm2·s−1, higher than those of NMVP (about 10−10 cm2·s−1), which are consistent with the results in previous literature [36]. The apparent sodium ions diffusion coefficients of two electrodes are further calculated via the GITT during the whole desodiation and sodiation processes (Note S2, and Fig. S11 in the ESM). The sodium ion diffusion coefficients of NMVP/C are nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of NMVP, which is consistent with the CV result. Generally, non-faradic and faradic processes always coexist in the charge- storage mechanism of nano particles [37, 38]. Accordingly, the b value of the NMVP/C electrode (0.677 vs. 0.681 at the cathodic and anodic peak) (Note S4 and Fig. S12 in the ESM) means a more favored diffusion kinetics of NMVP/C. On the basis of the above results, it can be concluded that, both the carbon coating layer and the robust crystallographic framework contribute to the rapid electronic transport and ionic diffusion, which can be regarded as the key factors behind the outstanding electrochemical properties of NMVP/C. Inspired by the satisfactory electrochemical performance of the NMVP/C electrode in half-cell, Na-ion full cells were also fabricated with commercial hard carbon as anode, schematically illustrated in Fig. 6(a). XRD pattern and cycling performance of hard carbon are presented in Fig. S13 in the ESM. The anode electrodes were presodiated to reduce the initial irreversible capacity loss. Figure 6(b) shows the selected charge/discharge curves of the NMVP/C//Hard carbon full cell at 200 mA·g−1. It is observed that the full-cell can display an initial capacity/ discharge capacity of 106.7 and 102.7 mAh·g−1 with a cell voltage of about 3.26 V, corresponding to a Coulombic efficiency of 96.3%. Cycling performance of the full-cell at current density of 200 mA·g−1 is shown in Fig. 6(c). Impressively, the full-cell exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 102.7 mAh·g−1, and delivers a capacity of 91.1 mAh·g−1 after 140 cycles, corresponding to capacity retention of 88.7%. Figure 6(d) summarizes the capacity and voltage parameters of recently reported sodium ion full cells. In comparison, NMVP/C//Hard carbon full cells display great prospect for practical utilizations, in terms of high operating voltage, large reversible capacity. 
In summary, through systematic investigation the effects of Mn ions infusing on the crystallographic structure and electro-chemical behavior of NASICON-structured Na3+xMnxV2−x(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), the Na-rich Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 is proposed owing to its robust structure, high operating voltage, and abundant resources. A uniform carbon-coated Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 with hydrangea-like hierarchical structure has been synthesized and investigated to be a high-energy cathode for SIBs. Excellent rate performances of 113.1 and 95.5 mAh·g−1 were achieved at 0.5 C and 50 C, respectively, and excellent cycling stability was obtained (76.6% capacity retention after 5,000 cycles at 20 C). More importantly, the NMVP/C composite shows excellent high-areal-loading and temperature adaptability. A low volume change of 7.6% and reversible phase transitions were observed. Towards practical applications, a full-cell configuration is fabricated using hard carbon as anode with high working voltage (3.26 V) and large reversible capacity (102.7 mAh·g−1 at 200 mA·g−1). All the comprehensive studies demonstrate that this NASICON-type Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C material is one of the most attractive cathodes for practical applications.
