The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of crystalline pentasodium hafnium tris (phosphate) was studied over the temperature range 6–650 K. The experimental data were used to calculate the thermodynamic functions of Na 5 Hf(PO 4 ) 3 from 0 to 650 K and the fractal dimension at 20–50 K. The standard entropy of formation from simple substances at 298.15 K was calculated from the absolute entropy value. The thermodynamic properties of Na 5 M(PO 4 ) 3 (M = Ti, Zr, and Hf) phosphates were compared.

Orthophosphates with framework structure ( NaZr 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (NZP) structure type) with a large isomorphous capacity are studied because of their chemical, thermal, and radiation stability and controllable (including ultralow) thermal expansion [1]. They offer promise for the development of ceramics with high stability toward destroying actions of the environment such as thermal shocks. Systematic studies of the thermodynamic characteristics of NZP phosphates are therefore of current interest. Earlier, we studied the thermodynamic characteristics of zirconium phosphate Zr 3 (PO 4 ) 4 ( ≡ Zr 0.25 Zr 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ) [2], alkali-zirconium phosphates AZr 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs) [3, 4], and Na 5 M(PO 4 ) 3 (M = Ti and Zr) compounds [5, 6]. The crystal structure of these phosphates is based on the {[Zr 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ] – } 3 ∞ or {[NaM(PO 4 ) 3 ] 4– } 3 ∞ framework, and alkali metal or Zr 4+ cations occupy frame cavities [7–9]. Differences in the structure of Na 5 Ti(PO 4 ) 3 and Na 5 Zr(PO 4 ) 3 phosphates involve ordering/disordering of framework cations (titanium/zirconium) over their sites and the special features of the distribution of sodium cations in cavities. These differences cause structural rearrangement (polymorphic transition) observed at an elevated temperature for the Na 5 Zr(PO 4 ) 3 phosphate and the absence of Na 5 Ti(PO 4 ) 3 phase transitions up to its melting point. The closeness of the ionic radii and chemical properties of Zr 4+ and Hf 4+ causes similarity of the crystal structures of Na 5 Zr(PO 4 ) 3 [9] and Na 5 Hf(PO 4 ) 3 [10] and the possibility of phase transition manifestations in the hafnium-containing phosphate. This work presents the results of an experimental study of the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of crystalline pentasodium hafnium tris (phosphate) from 6 to 650 K. We calculated its thermodynamic functions ( T ), H °( T ) – H °(0), S °( T ) , and G °( T ) – H °(0) over the temperature range 0–650 K and determined the standard entropy of formation at 298.15 K. We also compared the thermodynamic properties of NZP phosphates of the composition Na 5 M(PO 4 ) 3 (M = Ti, Zr, and Hf).

Na 5 Hf(PO 4 ) 3 was prepared by the solid-state method. The initial substances were NaCl, HfO 2 , and NH 4 H 2 PO 4 of kh. ch. (chemically pure) grade. A finely ground mixture of stoichiometric amounts of the initial reagents was subjected to thermal treatment under the conditions of free access of air at 473 K for 12 h, at 873 K for 24 h, and at 1073 K for 50 h. Step heating alternated with regrindings. The product was a white polycrystalline powder. Its composition and structure were characterized by X-ray diffraction and electron microprobe and chemical analyses. The phase purity of the sample was substantiated by X-ray powder patterns taken using a STOE STADI MP diffractometer, ëu K α filtered radiation. The X-ray pattern was indexed in the R 32 ( Z = 6) space group, it only contained reflections characteristic of Na 5 Hf(PO 4 ) 3 [10]. The rhombohedral cell parameters in the hexagonal system calculated over the angle range 2 θ = 8°–117° were a = 9.15591(7) Å , c = 22.2521(3) Å , and V = 1615.490 Å 3 . The chemical composition and sample homogeneity were controlled using a CamScan MV -2300 scanning electron microscope equipped with a Link INCA ENERGY 200C energy dispersion detector. According to the electron microscopic and microprobe data, the sample was homogeneous at various points and contained the Na, Hf, P , and O elements only. The chemical composition of the sample was substantiated by elemental analysis. A weighed portion of the sample was dissolved in an aqueous solution of HF. The content of sodium was determined by the atomic absorption method on a PerkinElmer 603 instrument. The content of hafnium was determined gravimetrically with Cupferron as described in [11], and the content of phosphorus, colorimetrically on an SF-46 spectrophotometer with ammonium vanadate and molybdate [12]. The results showed that the stoichiometric composition of the sample was close to theoretical and corresponded to the formula Na4.97(3)Hf1.01(2)P3.00(3)O12.

The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the phosphate from 6 to 350 K was measured on a BKT-3.07 thermophysical unit (fully automated adiabatic vacuum calorimeter). The design of the calorimeter and the procedure for measurements were similar to those described in [13]. The reliability of the results was checked by measuring the heat capacity of copper (special purity grade, OSCh-11-4), reference synthetic corundum, and benzoic acid K-1 brand. According to calibration and test results, the error in heat capacity measurements was no more than ±2% at 6–10 K, decreased to ±0.5% as the temperature increased to 40 K, and was of ±0.2% over the temperature range 40–350 K. The substance (0.9660 g) was loaded into the calorimetric ampule of the adiabatic vacuum calorimeter. Het capacity over the temperature range 320–650 K was measured using an ADKTTM differential scanning calorimeter operating on the principle of a triple heat bridge. The design of the calorimeter and procedure for measurements were described in [14, 15]. The reliability of calorimeter operation was checked by measuring the heat capacity of standard special purity copper samples and standard synthetic corundum and the thermodynamic characteristics of fusion of tin, indium, and lead. The error in heat capacity measurements was ±2%, in phase transition temperatures ±0.3 K, and in the enthalpies of phase transitions ±1%. The heat capacity of the phosphate over the temperature range 320–350 K was also measured on the adiabatic vacuum calorimeter, and the conditions of dynamic calorimeter measurements were adjusted to obtain coinciding values at these temperatures. We therefore assumed that, at T > 350 K, the error in values was ±(0.5– 1.5)%. The substance was loaded into the ampule of the dynamic calorimeter in an amount of 0.5952 g.

The heat capacity of crystalline Na5Hf(PO4)3 phosphate was studied over the temperature range 6–650 K (Table 1). Measurements on the adiC p° C p° C p° abatic vacuum calorimeter gave 135 experimental values. Heat capacity measurements on the dynamic calorimeter were performed under continuous heating conditions of the calorimeter with the substance. The rate of heating was 1.6 K/min. The experimental values were averaged using power and semilogarithmic polynomials; the root-mean-square deviation of the experimental values from the smoothing curve did not exceed heat capacity measurement errors. All the experimental values and the smoothing curve over the temperature range 6–650 K are shown in the figure. We see that the heat capacity of the Na5Hf(PO4)3 phosphate changes anomalously over the temperature range 476– 572 K. This anomaly is caused by an endothermic phase transition. The shape of the heat capacity curve in the region of the anomaly is characteristic of λ-type phase transition. No other heat capacity anomalies were observed for Na5Hf(PO4)3. Below 476 K (crystals I) and above 572 K (crystals II), the heat capacity smoothly increases as the temperature grows.

The temperature corresponding to the largest apparent heat capacity value over the temperature range of the transition was taken to be the Na5Hf(PO4)3phase transition temperature, Ttr = 516.5 K. The enthalpy of the transition was determined by the numerical integration of the heat capacity curve over the transition interval, ∆trH° = 1.54 ± 0.01 kJ/mol. The entropy of the transition determined by the numerical integration of the = f(lnT) dependence coincided with the value calculated by the ∆trS° = ∆trH°/Ttr equation (∆trS° = 3.00 ± 0.03 J/(mol K)). In [5, 6], we studied the heat capacities of Na5M(PO4)3 (M = Ti and Zr). A similar polymorphic transition was observed in the heat capacity curve of Na5Zr(PO4)3 at 389–424 K. According to the single crystal X-ray data [16], this transition was related to changes in the position ordering of Zr4+ ions (which populate two closely lying framework sites) and Na+ cations (situated in framework cavities). Similarity of the structures of Na5Zr(PO4)3 [9] and Na5Hf(PO4)3 [10] leads us to suggest that the phase transition observed in the heat capacity curve of the hafnium-containing phosphate is also related to position ordering of cations. The absence of a phase transition of the Na5Ti(PO4)3 phosphate can likely be explained by the presence of one Ti4+ site in its framework structure [8] and lower mobility of Na+ cations in small-sized cavities compared with the hafnium- and zirconium-containing phosphates having the same formula.

In view of the development of models describing the temperature dependence of heat capacity, it is of interest to calculate the fractal dimension D [17, 18] for Na5Hf(PO4)3. The D value is an indirect characteristic of the topology of the structure of solids; D = 1 for chain structures, 2 for layered structures, and 3 for spatial structures. The experimental heat capacities of Na5Hf(PO4)3 at 20–50 K were used to calculate D = 3 (error is 2%), which corresponded to the spatial (framework) structure of this compound and was in agreement with the structural data [10]. Starting with T < 20 K and to the temperature of the beginning of measurements, the heat capacity of Na5Hf(PO4)3 was described by the Debye function for the heat capacity of solids, The characteristic Debye temperature ΘD was adjusted to fit the experimental values over the interval 6–11 K at the number of degrees of freedom n = 3. This gave 100.6 K to within 1.9%. For thermodynamic function calculations, the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the phosphate was extrapolated to 0 K according to the Debye heat capacity function. We assumed that, at T < 6 K, this equation reproduced equally accurately. The smoothed heat capacity values and the [H°(T) – H°(0)], S°(T), and [G°(T) – H°(0)] thermodynamic functions are listed in Table 2. The enthalpies [H°(T) – H°(0)] and entropies S°(T) of the phosphate were calculated by the numerical integration of the corresponding = f(T) and = f(lnT) dependences, and the Gibbs function values [G°(T) – H°(0)], from the enthalpies C p° nD ΘD/T[ ].= C p° C p° C p° C p° and entropies at the corresponding temperatures. We assumed that errors in function calculations made no significant contribution to the accuracy of their determination because they did not exceed heat capacity measurement errors (see above). The absolute entropies of crystalline phosphate S°(Na5Hf(PO4)3, cr, 298.15 K) = 452.3 ± 1.0 J/(mol K) (Table 2) and the corresponding simple substances [19, 20] S°(Na, cr, 298.15 K) = 51.30 ± 0.20, S°(Hf, cr, 298.15 K) = 43.555 ± 0.209, S°(P, cr, 298.15 K) = 41.09 ± 0.25, and S°(O2, g, 298.15 K) = 205.152 ± 0.005 J/(mol K) were used to calculate the standard entropy of formation of the substance, ∆fS°(Na5Hf(PO4)3, cr, 298.15 K) = –1202 ± 2 J/(mol K). The heat capacity and standard thermodynamic functions of formation of Na5M(PO4)3 (M = Ti [6], Zr [5], and Hf) at 298.15 K are listed in Table 3. The thermodynamic parameters of formation correspond to the reactions 5Na(cr) + M(cr) + 3P(cr, white) + 6é2(g) = Na5M(PO4)3(cr). Below phase transition temperatures of zirconiumand hafnium-containing phosphates, the heat capacities and absolute entropies of these compounds are closely similar. It follows from Table 3 that the T∆fS° entropy factors of all the three phosphates are also similar and make small contributions to the Gibbs functions of their formation, which are to a substantial extent determined by the standard enthalpies of formation of NZP phosphates [2, 3, 5]. This allows us to expect high thermodynamic stability of crystalline Na5M(PO4)3 at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa.
