Phase relations have been investigated in the subsolidus region of the Na 2 MoO 4 – NiMoO 4 – Fe 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 system by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and vibrational spectroscopy. The phase of variable composition Na 1 – x Ni 1 – x Fe 1 + x ( MoO 4 ) 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) with the NASICON structure (space group R c ) and the NaNi 3 Fe ( MoO 4 ) 5 ternary molybdate crystallizing in the triclinic crystal system (space group P have been obtained. A high conductivity was found in Na 1 – x Ni 1 – xFe1 + x(MoO4)3, which allows one to consider this phase of variable composition as a promising solid electrolyte with sodium ion conduction.

New phases with the NASICON structure is have long been sought in phosphate, molybdate, sulfate, silicate, and arsenate systems. A specific feature of their structure is a rhombohedral framework {[ R 2 (EO 4 )] p – } 3∞ consisting of RO 6 octahedra and EO 4 tetrahedra. Smallsize atoms of alkali metals occupy voids in skeletons and determine high ionic conductivity of these phases [1–9]. The NASICON structure features a large isomorphic capacity to cations of various natures and sizes, which occupy framework and extraframework sites. In this work, we investigated phase formation in the Na 2 MoO 4 –NiMoO 4 –Fe 2 (MoO 4 ) 3 system and the possibility of entering Ni 2+ and Fe 3+ cations into the NASICON structure of the phase of variable composition Na 1 – ı Ni 1 – ı Fe 1 + ı (MoO 4 ) 3 ; determined the synthetic conditions, homogeneity regions, and thermal stability regions; and investigated the temperature dependence of conductivity, dielectric constant, and dielectric loss tangent.

The starting components for the investigation of phase formation in the Na 2 MoO 4 – NiMoO 4 – Fe 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 system were Na 2 MoO 4 , NiMoO 4 , and Fe 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 preliminary prepared a solid-phase reaction from Na 2 CO 3 , NiO, Fe ( NO 3 ) 3 · 9 H 2 O, and MoO 3 within 400–650°ë with multiple intermediate grindings each 20–30 h. The sintering time at each temperature was 120–150 h. After annealing, the samples were slowly cooled with the furnace. Nonequilibrium samples were additionally annealed, and equilibrium was considered to be attained if the phase composition of the samples remained invariable after two consecutive annealings. Synthetic products were identified by X-ray powder diffraction analysis in an FR-552 monochromator chamber (Cu K α radiation, Ge internal standard). X-ray diffraction patterns were calculated using Rentgen software. Vibrational spectra of polycrystalline Na 1 – ı Ni 1 – ı Fe 1 + ı ( MoO 4 ) 3 samples were detected on Bruker FT–IR and Specord 80-M spectrometers with excitation by near-IR laser radiation at 1.06 nm. Scattering geometry was reflective; resolution was 3–5 cm –1 . Test samples were Nujol mulls on a polyethylene substrate and KBr disks. Samples with molybdenum isotope substitution were prepared with the use of 92 MoO 3 and 100 MoO 3 . DTA was performed on an OD-103 derivatograph (MOM); the heating rate was 10 K/min; the sample size was 0.3–0.4 g. The temperature dependence of conductivity σ , dielectric constant ε , and dielectric loss tangent were studied by the V est and Tallan polarization procedure [6] for densely pressed ceramic samples in the form of disks 10 mm in diameter and 1–1.5 mm thick with platinum electrodes. The electrodes were deposited by burning-in platinum paste. Electrical measurements were performed using an E8-4 ac bridge at 10 3 Hz with an R-5025 capacitance box, which expanded the range of dielectric loss tangent measurement (determination accuracy was ± 5% ). An E6-13A teraohmmeter (direct current, voltage 30–50 mV) was employed. The temperature of the samples in the process of electrical measurements was monitored with a chromel–alumel thermocouple with a V7-21A voltmeter accurate to ± 2°ë .

Precision of measurements was monitored in the heating and cooling models in a temperature range of 20–600°ë.

Interaction in the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3system was investigated in two stages. First, we investigated the phase composition at the intersection points of joins originating from neutral and binary molybdates that are formed in binary subsystems Na2MoO4– NiMoO4, Na2MoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3, and NiMoO4– Fe2(MoO4)3. Second, we investigated the revealed quasi-binary joins, which allowed us to perform the triangulation of the system (Fig. 1). A new ternary molybdate NaNiFe(MoO4)3 was found to form along NiMoO4–NaFe(MoO4)2 and Na2 + 2xNi1 – x(MoO4)2–Fe2(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) joins at 500–550°ë. In the plane of the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4– Fe2(MoO4)3 triangle and along the NaNiFe(MoO4)3– Fe2(MoO4)3 join, the phase of a variable composition Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.5) is formed, which is the subtraction solid solution based on the NaNiFe(MoO4)3 ternary molybdate. At 580–650°ë, the NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5 ternary molybdate in the join NaFe(MoO4)2–NiMoO4 (ratio 1 : 3) is formed in the system. Single-phase Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 samples, which belong to the NASICON structural type (space group R c), are prepared by sintering at 600°ë for 140–160 h; the NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5 ternary molybdate, which crystallizes in the triclinic crystal system (space group P Z = 2), is synthesized as a single-phase at 650°ë and annealing time of 200 h. NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5has the following sizes of the unit cell: a = 6.938(2) Å, 3 1, b = 17.573(5) Å, c = 6.851(1) Å, α = 87.94(2)°, β = 101.46(2)°, and γ = 92.29(2)°. Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 and NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5 melt incongruently at 815 and 840°ë without polymorphic transformations. According to X-ray powder diffraction data, Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system and is isostructural to Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 [2]. The extensive crystallization field of NASICON solid solutions (0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.5) is due to the possibility of isomorphic substitutions in octahedra. Octahedral sites (M), which are statistically filled by Ni and Fe atoms, contain an excess of iron (at ı > 0) and a deficit of nickel. Sodium, which is arranged interstices, does not distort the lattice symmetry and is also in deficit. These specific features of the structure of Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 and the character of cation distribution lead to an increase in the contribution of the Fe–O bonds to the total electrostatic balance of the structure. To maintain the structure balance, weakening of the Na–O bonds is necessary, which is attained by a deficit of sodium in interstices and by an increase in framework sizes, which leads to an increase in the unit cell volume of Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 as the homogeneity region increases (Table 1). NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5 is isostructural to NaMg3In(MoO4)5[4], the crystal structure of which is based on a threedimensional framework consisting of åÓé4 tetrahedra and Mg(In)O6 octahedra. Closed voids in the skeleton are populated by sodium atoms. The distinctive feature of this structure is the presence of fragments consisting of four octahedra, which form a flat quadrangle, and paired edge-sharing octahedra. The structure of Na1 – xNi1 – xFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 is topologically identical to the structure of corundum; Ni(Fe) atoms are randomly distributed over two sets of crystallographic sites with octahedral oxygen coordination on third-order axes (symmetry ë3), and åÓé4 groups are on ë2 axes. V acant octahedral and tetrahedral voids merge into a three-dimensional netrwork of channels, whose voids are filled by sodium cations; the symmetry of arrangement of the sodium cations is ë3i. The presence of isolated distorted tetrahedral anionic groups Mo in the structure allows one to perform a comparative analysis of internal vibrations of discrete Mo groups and external vibrations, i.e., vibrations of cation sublattices and åÓé4 tetrahedra as a whole [9]. The bands corresponding to vibrations of Mo undergo an isotopic shift upon substitution 92Mo–100Mo (Tables 2, 3).

In the Raman spectrum, three vibrational lines of Ni2+ and Fe3+ cations should be observed; and in the IR spectrum, two vibrational bands of Na+ cations and three bands of the Ni2+ + Fe3+ cations should be observed. Six vibrational bands of MoO4 groups should be observed in the Raman spectrum and nine bands in the IR spectrum. To the internal vibrations of MoO4 groups, we assigned the bands with frequencies of 986–769 cm–1 (stretching) and 408–310 cm–1 (deformation vibrations), which experience a shift upon molybdenum isotope substitution and lie in the spectral region characteristic of the vibrations of åÓé4 tetrahedra. The full-symmetry stretching vibrations of molybdate groups, which are distributed over two sets of crystallographic sites, are degenerate, probably because of the similarity of the geometrical and dynamic characteristics of these polyhedra [4, 9]. The frequencies of stretching vibrations of MoO4 groups increase by 20– 25 cm–1 as ı increases, which is apparently conditioned by an increase in the energy of the Ni–O and Fe–O bonds upon the formation of the additional (considerable) number of vacancies in the cation sublattice. The character of cation distribution, not affecting the shape of the spectrum in general, leads to considerable broadening of the lines, with a decrease in the degree of distortion of MoO4 tetrahedra and a decrease in splitting of the triply degenerate stretching vibrations. The lines observed in the Raman spectrum below 300 cm–1 (263– 269 cm–1) are assigned to Ni2+ and Fe3+ cations, and the band at 192 cm–1 to iron cations. The low-frequency sets of Raman lines at 112–111–87 cm–1 correspond to the vibrations of nickel since the vibrations of sodium cations are inactive in the Raman spectrum. In the IR spectra, the bands below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to the vibrations of sodium cations. Temperature dependences of conductivity for Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 are plotted in Fig. 2, in the rectification Arrhenius coordinates – 103/í. Conductivity of the phase of the variable composition varies from 10–8–10–2 Ω cm–1; for Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3, conductivity is mostly ionic (ti = 0.72–0.88) (Table 4). Above 300°ë, the conductivity versus temperature curvesfeature an inflection point and the activation energy of conductivity increases, which is apparently associated with the transition from the impurity to intrinsic conductivity. In the portion of impurity conσlog ductivity, the activation energy is 1.07–1.13 eV , while in the portion of intrinsic conductivity, it is 2.05– 2.37 eV . Conductivity 10–2 Ω cm–1, which is characteristic of the NASICON phase Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3, is conditioned by a sufficiently large size of interstices in the skeleton, which substantially decreases steric hindrances in Na+ transport [7, 8].

In the series of the Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 solid solutions with heterovalent substitution Na+ + Ni2+ Fe3+ + ?, additional vacancies are formed in the sodium sublattice, which increases the mobility of sodium cations and the electrical conductivity of the phase as ı increases from 0. to 0.5. There is a correlation between σ and the unit cell volume of the phase of variable composition. Dielectric constant (ε) and dielectric loss tangent have a exponential temperature dependence (Fig. 3). The absence of extrema in the curves indicate the absence of phase transitions and ferroelectric properties for Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3. The high ionic conductivity of the phase of variable composition allows us to consider Na1 – ıNi1 – ıFe1 + ı(MoO4)3 as a promising solid electrolyte with sodium ion conduction.
