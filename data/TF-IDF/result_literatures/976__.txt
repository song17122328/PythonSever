Na3V2(PO4)3 is one of the most promising cathode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries, which can deliver two Naþ ions extraction/insertion from/into the crystal structure.

To further improve the electrochemical performance of the carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode, theconducting graphene has been adopted.

In this paper, graphene-wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite has been successfully synthesizedthrough a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel method.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) results demonstrate that the obtained nanocomposite is well crystallizedwith NASICON-type structure.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal that themodification of Na3V2(PO4)3/C with graphene could construct an effective conducting network, which significantly enhances the electronicconductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3/C based sample.

Thus, the graphene-wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3/C exhibits superior high-rate capacity and excellentcycling stability.

 It shows an initial charge capacity of 113 mA h g1 and a discharge capacity of 106.5 mA h g1 at 0.1 C, and retains stabledischarge capacities of 104.3, 101.1, 96.4 and 93 mA h g1 at current rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C, respectively.

Even at higher rate of 5 C,it can still deliver a discharge capacity of 88.7 mA h g1 with remarkable capacity retention of 92.5% after 200 cycles.

This synthetic strategyshould be helpful for the design of other conducting network structured electrodes with high-performances.

There has been a steady increase in demand for clean andefficient energy storage devices due to the ever-rising concernsabout limited global energy supply and environment andclimate changes [1–6].

Among the various available energystorage technologies, lithium-ion batteries play a dominant rolein portable electronic devices and have become the primecandidate to power the next generation electric vehicles andplug-in hybrid electric vehicles [1,5,7–9].

Nevertheless, thefurther development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries stillfaces a serious challenge that arises from the cathode materials.

Especially, the amount of lithium resources in the earth is notsufficient, which makes the lithium-ion batteries too muchexpensive.

Oppositely, the sodium resources are inexhaustibleand homogenously spread around the globe, suggesting thatsodium-ion batteries are more sustainable, crust and economical than the lithium-ion batteries for large-scale stationarybatteries [10–12].

Up to now, many sodium ion based materials such as NaxCoO2 [13], NaxMnO2 [14], NaFePO4 [15], Na0.7Fe0.7Mn0.3O2[16], and Na3V2(PO4)3 [17–25] have been proved to bepromising as electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.

Among these materials, Na3V2(PO4)3 with NASICON structure which has large interstitial channels for fast Naþ ionmigration through the empty space in its crystal structure [19]shows a very flat voltage curve with a plateau at around 3.4 Vvs.

 Naþ/Na (similar as the plateau voltage of LiFePO4 vs.Liþ/Li).

The NASICON structure is built up from isolated[VO6] octahedral and [PO4] tetrahedrally interlinked viacorners to establish the framework anion [V2(PO4)3]3.

Moreover, the theoretical capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is 176 mA h g1based on all of the three Naþ ions extracted from the materiallattice, but the extraction of the third Naþ ion is very difficult.

It can deliver a theoretical discharge capacity of 118 mA h g1with two Naþ ions being completely extracted up to 4.0 V vs.Naþ/Na.

Unfortunately, the electronic conductivity of the pureNa3V2(PO4)3 is as low as LiFePO4 and Li3V2(PO4)3, whichsignificantly limits its electrochemical performance and furtherpractical applications.

In recent years, a number of approaches to overcome theseissues have been explored with various strategies.

Carboncoating [17–20,22] is the most common way to improve theelectrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 because it isfacile, rapid, and easily spreadable to other cathode materials.

Owing to this carbon shell layer, which could be able toenhance the electronic conductivity [26,27], the rate capabilityand cycling stability will be improved.

Li's group [28] reportedthat the carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 synthesized through acarbon-thermal reduction method exhibited an initial specificdischarge capacity of 98.17 mA h g1 at 0.1 C in the potentialwindow of 2.5–3.8 V vs. Naþ/Na.

 And about 95.1% of itsdischarge capacity can be obtained after 50 cycles.

AnotherNa3V2(PO4)3/C [21] fabricated by a sol–gel route delivered areversible specific capacity of 84.8 and 66.5 mA h g1 at0.2 and 1 C, respectively, indicating that although the carboncoating approach has been effective to a certain degree, thehigh-rate capacity remains low.

Therefore, it remains challenging to obtain high-rate capacity and good cycling stability ofNa3V2(PO4)3 electrode for sodium-ion batteries.

Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) one-atom-thick conductor with high surface area, chemical stability, mechanicalstrength and flexibility, making it a useful growth substrate toanchor active materials for electrochemical energy storageapplications [29–34].

Up to the present, many cathodematerials including LiMnO2 [35], LiMn2O4 [36,37], LiFePO4[38,39] and Li3V2(PO4)3 [40–42], LiVPO4F [43] have beenmodified with conducting graphene, which exhibit superiorhigh-rate capacity and excellent cycling stability.

Althoughmany groups have previously demonstrated the effect ofconducting graphene in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries,only a few reports of graphene-modified Na3V2(PO4)3 assodium-ion batteries electrode exist in the literature.

In 2013,Jung's group firstly prepared graphene-modified Na3V2(PO4)3via sol–gel and solid-state reaction [25].

And the obtainedNa3V2(PO4)3/graphene composite displays an excellent highrate performance and cycling stability.

However, the pureNa3V2(PO4)3 particles were only wrapped by graphene in theirstudy.

Significantly, the Na3V2(PO4)3 should be coated withcarbon to form a conducting network with graphene forelectron transport, which may further improve the high-rateelectrochemical activity of Na3V2(PO4)3.Herein, we develop a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel methodfor the synthesis of graphene-wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite.

The added graphene mixed with the carbon forms aconducting network which is helpful for the transport ofelectron.

The electrochemical performance of graphene-modified Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode material in rechargeable sodiumion batteries is investigated and compared with the pureNa3V2(PO4)3/C.

In this study, we speculate that the resultingnanocomposite would exhibit significantly improved Na storage performance.

In summary, we report a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gelapproach to attach NVP/C nanoparticles on the surface ofgraphene to improve the high-rate performance of electrode forsodium-ion batteries.

The added graphene not only preventsthe growth of NVP/C particles, but also improves theirelectronic conductivity.

In the material, graphene can form aconducting network with the coated carbon, and NVP/Cnanoparticles are strongly adhered to the surface of grapheneand wrapped into the graphene nanosheets uniformly.

Thus,the obtained NVP/(CþG) sample exhibits impressive electrochemical performance as electrode for sodium-ion batterieswhen charged–discharged in the voltage range of 2.5–3.8 V.

Inall, the as-synthesized NVP/(CþG) nanocomposite can beconsidered as a suitable cathode material for rechargeablesodium-ion batteries.
