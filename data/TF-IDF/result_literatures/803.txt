Rhombohedral NASICON compounds with general formula Li1+xTi2−xScx(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) have been prepared using a conventional solid-state reaction and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and impedance spectroscopy.
The partial substitution of Ti4+ by Sc3+ and Li+ in pristine LiTi2(PO4)3 increases unit-cell dimensions and the number of charge carriers.
In Sc-rich samples, the analysis of XRD data and 6Li/7Li, 31P, and 45Sc MAS NMR spectra confirms the presence of secondary LiScO2 and LiScP2O7 phases that reduce the amount of lithium incorporated in the NASICON phase.
In samples with x < 0.3, electrostatic repulsions between Li ions located at M1 and M3 sites increase Li mobility.
For x ≥ 0.3, ionic conductivity decreases because of secondary nonconducting phases formed at grain boundaries of the NASICON particles (core−shell structures).
For x = 0.2, high bulk conductivity (2.5 × 10−3 S· cm−1) and low activation energy (Ea = 0.25 eV) measured at room temperature make Li1.2Ti1.8Sc0.2(PO4)3 one of the best lithium ionic conductors reported in the literature.
In this material, the vacancy arrangement enhances Li conductivity.
The Li1+xTi2−xScx(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) series has been prepared by solid-state reaction and characterized with XRD, NMR, and IS techniques.
In Sc-poor samples, XRD patterns display only NASICON phases with rhombohedral symmetry (space group R3̅c).
In Sc-rich samples, secondary, LiScO2, LiScP2O7, and TiO2 phases coexist with the NASICON phase.
In x < 0.3 samples, the substitution of Ti4+ by Sc3+ increases the Li content, enhancing electrostatic Li−Li repulsions, favoring the creation of vacant M1 sites.
This arrangement of vacancy increases Li conductivity; however, the formation of the secondary LiScO2 and LiScP2O7 phases decreases the amount of Li and Sc incorporated in the NASICON phase.
In parallel to the phases segregation, the formation of core−shell structures reduces the total conductivity of x > 0.3 samples.
From this fact, the determination of cation miscibility in the NASICON Li1+xTi2−xScx(PO4)3 series was of major importance in optimization of transport properties.
This miscibility seems to be related to the preparation method used.
High conductivity values found in the Li1+xTi2−xScx(PO4)3 series open new perspectives for preparing NASICON-based electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium batteries.
At present, electrical properties of Li1.2Ti1.8Sc0.2(PO4)3 make this material one of the best reported ion conductors at room temperature (σb ≈ 2.5 × 10−3 S·cm−1), displaying one of the lowest activation energies reported in NASICON compounds (0.25 eV).
