NASICON-structured  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  (NMTP)  is  a  high-energy  sodium-ion  battery  (SIB)  cathode  material.  However, the low rate capability and unsatisfactory cycle life limit its practical applications. Herein, a dual  carbon decoration strategy has been proposed to tackle the above-mentioned issues of NMTP. The semi-graphitic  carbon and reduced graphene oxide co-functionalized NMTP (NMTP/C@rGO) demonstrates a specific capacity  of ~114 mAh g 0) 1, reaching a high energy density of ~410 Wh kg 0) 1 with an average discharge potential of ~3.6  V. Besides, the NMTP/C@rGO also manifests long-term durability and high rate capability. More importantly,  the NMTP/C@rGO also demonstrates ideal electrochemical properties in NMTP/C@rGO//soft carbon full cells.  The impressive electrochemical performances make the NMTP/C@rGO a reliable cathode material for SIBs.   
Sodium-ion  batteries  (SIBs)  have  become  a  promising  candidate,  which  aroused  explosive  enthusiasm  of  the  researchers  recently,  to  compensate lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in energy storage [1–9]. This  can be ascribed to the analogous operating principles of SIBs and LIBs as  well as the cheapness and profusion of Na resources. To push the practical application of SIBs in large scale energy storage, efforts have been  dedicated to improving the energy/power density, cycle life, and safety  [10–13].  The cathode represents one of the most important components for  SIBs. Tremendous efforts have been dedicated to seeking suitable cathode materials, such as Prussian blue analogues [14–16], layered oxides  [17–22], and polyanionic compounds [23–27]. Although the Prussian  blue analogues possess an open framework structure with large interstitial  sites,  they  suffer  from  poor  thermal  stability,  low  volumetric  density, and toxicity. The layered oxides have high theoretical capacity,  while the structural instability and unsatisfactory cycle life extensively  limit  their  applications.  Polyanionic  compounds  have  aroused  great  attention due to their robust crystal structure with excellent thermal  stability,  ion  intercalation/de-intercalation, and high safety. 
Among the  polyanionic  compounds,  Na  superionic  conductor  (NASICON)-structured materials possess a unique framework, endowing  the material three-dimensional channels for fast Naþ mobility [28–30].  As one of the most famous NASICON-structured material, Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP) has a theoretical capacity of 117 mAh g 0) 1 with a flat plateau at  3.3–3.4 V [31]. Considering the toxicity and relatively high cost of V,  increasing attention has been paid to partial/entire substitution of V  with other elements, such as Mn, Fe, Ni, Ti, Cr, Mg, etc. [1,32–39] Lavela  and  co-workers  replaced  10%  of  the  V  with  Cr  and  obtained  Na3V1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 with a high plateau at ~3.8 V [33]. The Cr doping  amount could be further increased to 50% in this case. Goodenough  et al. reported a series of NASICON-structured NaxMV(PO4)3 compounds  with half of the V in NVP being substituted, in which M represents Mn,  Fe, and Ni [35]. Among these materials, the Na4MnV(PO4)3 exhibited  two high plateaus at ~3.6 and 3.4 V vs. Naþ/Na, corresponding to the  Mn2þ/3þ and V3þ/4þ redox couples, respectively. Such high plateaus  could lead to a high energy density as demonstrated by Zhang and Jiao  et al. in their recent study [36]. Recently, NASICON-structured Na3MnTi  (PO4)3 (NMTP) was reported by Goodenough and co-workers [40]. This  material possesses  three redox couples: Mn3þ/4þ (~4.1  V), Mn2þ/3þ (~3.6 V), and Ti3þ/4þ (~2.1 V vs. Naþ/Na). When the three-electron  redox reaction is realized, its theoretical capacity can reach 176 mAh g 0) 1 [41]. Aside from the high theoretical capacity and high plateaus, the  replacement of V with Mn and Ti can bring advantages such as lower  toxicity and lower cost. Thus, the NMTP has been recognized as an  immensely promising high-energy cathode material for SIBs. Despite the  above-mentioned  favorable  characteristics,  the  NMTP  suffers  from  disappointing electronic conductivity, which may lead to unsatisfactory  cycling stability and rate performance.  Herein, we propose a dual carbon decoration strategy to boost the  rate  capability  and  cyclability  of  NMTP.  Semi-graphitic  carbon  and  reduced graphene oxide co-functionalized NMTP microspheres (NMTP/  C@rGO) have been constructed by a spray-drying approach. The obtained NMTP/C@rGO manifests a considerable capacity of ~114 mAh  g 0) 1 with an average potential of ~3.6 V vs. Naþ/Na, affording a high  energy density of ~410 Wh kg 0) 1. Apart from high energy density, the  NMTP/C@rGO also demonstrates long-term durability and high rate  capability. After 800 cycles at 1 C (1 C ¼ 117 mA g 0) 1), 76% of the capacity can be retained. When coupled with soft carbon, the NMTP/  C@rGO also demonstrates good cycling stability in NMTP/C@rGO//soft  carbon full cells.  2. Experimental section  2.1. Preparation of NMTP/C@rGO 

The NMTP/C@rGO was synthesized through a spray drying method  with  subsequent  high-temperature  annealing.  This  method  has  two  obvious merits. (I) Spray drying has been extensively employed in food  and pharmaceutical industries and it is feasible for mass production. (II)  The product has a microspherical morphology with minimized aggregation, which is beneficial for achieving high packing density.  The XRD pattern and Rietveld refinement are presented in Fig. 1a.  The XRD pattern can be indexed to pure phase NASICON-structured  NMTP with rhombohedral R-3c space group, agreeing well with previous literature [40-42]. More detailed structural information, such as  lattice  parameters,  atomic  coordinates,  and  occupancy,  is  listed  in  Table S1. The occupancy factors for Na (1) and Na (2) are 0.981 and  0.673, respectively. According to the occupancy, the total Na in a unit  cell (Z ¼ 6) is calculated to be 18, in well consistent with the chemical  formula.  The schematic structure of  NMTP/C@rGO is also  provided  based on the Rietveld refinement results (Fig. 1b). The XRD pattern of  NMTP/C resembles that of NMTP/C@rGO (Fig. S1). For both samples,  no impurity diffraction can be detected, confirming their high purity.  The TGA curve of NMTP/C@GO (Fig. 1c) shows a total mass loss of  7.95 wt%. It should be noted that a slight weight gain is observed at  480–520 �C, which is mainly caused by the oxidation of Mn(II). From the  TGA curves, the carbon content of NMTP/C@rGO is slightly higher than  that of NMTP/C (6.86 wt%). For both NMTP/C@rGO and NMTP/C, the  intensity of D-band (1350 cm 0) 1) is slightly lower than that of G-band  (1580  cm 0) 1)  in  Raman  spectra  (Fig.  1d),  suggesting  the  partially  graphitized characteristic of carbon in both samples. N2  sorption experiments were used to determine the surface area and pore volume of  NMTP/C@rGO and NMTP/C (Fig. S2). The NMTP/C@rGO manifests a  higher surface (33.56 vs. 2.23 m2 g 0) 1) but lower pore volume (0.31 vs.  0.52 cm3 g 0) 1) than the NMTP/C.  The  NMTP/C@rGO  shows  well-defined  microsphere  morphology  with a relatively rough surface (Fig. 2a). The size of microspheres ranges  from 0.3 to 5 μm. TEM images (Fig. 2b–c) reveal that the NMTP/C@rGO  solid microspheres are assembled by a large number of irregular nanoparticles. High-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2d) of NMTP/C@rGO displays lattice fringes of 0.21 and 0.44 nm, corresponding to the (303) and  (104) crystal planes of NASICON structured NMTP, respectively. Besides, a semi-graphitic carbon layer can be observed on the surface. The  HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding EDS mappings show that  each  element  is distributed  uniformly throughout  the entire NMTP/  C@rGO microsphere. Acid etching treatment was carried out for NMTP/  C@rGO to study the microstructure of carbon matrix. The acid etching  removes  most  of  the  NMTP  and  leaves  behind  a  continuous carbon  matrix (Fig. S3). Such a continuous carbon matrix wires the NMTP in the  composite.  The  control  sample,  NMTP/C,  exhibits  a  similar  microspherical morphology to NMTP/C@rGO (Fig. S4). The major difference  is that the NMTP/C possesses a hollow microsphere structure, which  may be caused by the foaming of citric acid during spray drying/pyrolysis.  With  the  introduction  of  GO,  the  foaming  of  citric  acid  is  restricted  and  solid  microspheres  can  be  obtained.  Given  the  solid  spherical structure of NMTP/C@rGO and the hollow spherical structure  of  NMTP/C,  the  former  demonstrates  an  obviously  higher  packing  density than the later (Fig. S5).  The  Na  storage  properties  of  NMTP/C@rGO  were  measured  in  CR2016 type coin cells using sodium disks as the anodes. The CV profiles  (Fig. 3a) display two pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks located at 3.73/  3.43 and 4.14/3.94 V, which can be assigned to the Mn2þ/3þ and Mn3þ/  4þ redox  couples,  respectively.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  a  weak  anodic peak can also be observed at around 3.98 V. However, this peak 
The NMTP/C@rGO was prepared by a spray-drying approach with  post-annealing. 15 mmol NaH2PO42H2O, 5 mmol Mn(CH3COO)2⋅4H2O,  5  mmol  C6H18N2O8Ti,  and 10  mmol  C6H8O7⋅H2O were  dissolved in  water. After adding 50 mL of graphene oxide solution (GO, 2 mg mL 0) 1)  to the above solution, the suspension was spray dried. The intermediate  collected after spray drying was annealed in Ar for 4 h at 600  �C to  obtain the NMTP/C@rGO. The control sample, NMTP/C, was synthesized with a similar method without the introduction of GO. The NMTP/  C@rGO-550 and NMTP/C@rGO-650 were synthesized by varying the  annealing temperature to 550 and 650 �C, respectively.  2.2. Material characterization 

Phase analyses were implemented by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray  diffractometer in a 2θ range of 10–80, which equipped with a non monochromated Cu Kα X-ray with 1.5418 Å. The microstructure  was  analyzed  by  field-emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM,  JEOL-7100F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-angle  annular  dark-field  scanning  TEM  (HAADF-STEM,  JEOL  JEM-2100F)  equipped  with  energy-dispersive  spectroscopy  (EDS,  Oxford  EDS  IE250). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air with a  temperature ramping rate of 10 �C min 0) 1 using an STA-449C thermobalance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterizations were  performed  on  a  VG  Multilab  2000  instrument.  Raman  spectra  were  recorded by a Horiba LabRAM HR Evolution (532 nm laser). The N2  sorption results were measured by a Tristar II 3020 instrument.  In-situ XRD experiment was performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray  diffractometer. The electrode was placed behind an X-ray transparent Be  window. The signals were collected in a still mode with a planar detector  during the charge/discharge process and each pattern was acquired in  120 s. The cathode was composed of active material, acetylene black,  and polytetrafluoroethylene with a mass ratio of 6: 3: 1. The loading  mass of the active material was roughly 1.2–1.8 mg cm 0) 2.  2.3. Measurement of electrochemical characterization 
Electrochemical tests were measured by assembling 2016 coin-type  cells. The cathode was composed of active material, acetylene black,  and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 7: 2: 1. Sodium  disks were employed as the anode, 1.0 M NaClO4 in EC/PC (1:1 w/w)  with FEC (5 wt%) was used as the electrolyte, and the separator was  grade  GF/D.



The CV  profiles overlap quite well, demonstrating the excellent reversibility of  Naþ de-intercalation/intercalation processes in NMTP/C@rGO. The two  pairs of redox peaks can also be explicitly observed even at high scan  rates,  indicating  the  good  rate  capability  of  NMTP/C@rGO  microspheres (Fig. S6).  Fig. 3b and c show the charge/discharge curves of NMTP/C@rGO  and NMTP/C at various rates, respectively. Obvious charge/discharge  plateaus can be observed, agreeing well with the presented CV curves.  The NMTP/C@rGO displays discharge capacities of 114, 112, 97, 78,  and  61  mAh  g 0) 1  at  0.2,  0.5,  1,  2,  and  5  C,  respectively  (Fig.  3d). 

Considering the average discharge potential of ~3.6 V and a discharge  capacity of 114 mAh g 0) 1, the energy density of NMTP/C@rGO reaches  up to 410 Wh kg 0) 1. When the C-rate returns to 0.2 C after cycled 50  times, 94% of the initial discharge capacity can be recovered (107 mAh  g 0) 1). In contrast, for NMTP/C microspheres, a relatively low discharge  capacity of 62 mAh g 0) 1 is obtained after 50 cycles. The NMTP/C@rGO  exhibits higher medium discharge voltage platforms (~3.5 V vs. Naþ/  Na) than the NMTP/C, especially at high current densities (Fig. S7) [43].  Interestingly, the medium discharge voltage of NMTP/C@rGO at 5 C is  higher than those at lower C-rates.


 

In  summary,  a  facile  spray-drying  assisted  approach  has  been  developed to fabricate reduced graphene oxide and semi-graphitic carbon co-decorated Na3MnTi(PO4)3 microspheres. When employed as the  SIB cathode, the dual carbon functionalized NMTP manifests a high  discharge capacity of 114 mAh g 0) 1, corresponding to a high energy  density  of  410  Wh  kg 0) 1  at  0.2  C.  Benefiting  from  the  dual  carbon  decoration, high rate capability, and long-term durability have also been  demonstrated.  Sodium-ion  full-cells  have  also  been  assembled  using  NMTP/C@rGO  as  the  cathode  and  soft  carbon  as  the  anode.  The  impressive electrochemical performances make the NMTP/C@rGO microspheres a promising cathode material for SIBs.
