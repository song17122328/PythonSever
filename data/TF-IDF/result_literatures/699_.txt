The sodium ions in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) weresubstituted with protons using an electrochemical alkali−proton substitution(APS) technique at 400 °C under a 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere.
The sodiumions in NASICON were successfully substituted with protons to a depth of<400 μm from the anode.
Completely protonated NASICON, i.e.,H3Zr2Si2PO12, was obtained to a depth <40 μm from the anode, althoughcomplete protonation of NASICON cannot be achieved by ion exchange inaqueous acid.
H3Zr2Si2PO12 was amorphous, whereas the partially protonatedNASICON was crystalline, and its unit cell volume decreased with an increasein the extent of substitution.
Amorphous H3Zr2Si2PO12 was prepared bypressure-induced amorphization of the NASICON framework, in which aninternal pressure of ∼3.5 GPa was induced by the substitution of large sodiumions with small protons during APS at 400 °C.
The temperature forion exchange in aqueous acid, i.e.<100 °C, is not sufficient todevelop structural reorganization, relaxing the internal pressure.
The extent of substitution of alkali ions with protons istherefore limited up to the internal pressure, at which theframework structure is stable, without structural reorganization.
As a result, the sodium ions in NASICON cannot becompletely substituted with protons using ion exchange inaqueous acid, and the substitution is limited to (Na0.9H2.1)-Zr2Si2PO12. In contrast, in the case of APS, a temperature of400 °C is just enough to develop structural reorganization,relaxing the internal pressure.
The sodium ions in NASICONcan therefore be completely substituted with protons.
However,the temperature is not sufficient to develop reconstructivetransformations.
