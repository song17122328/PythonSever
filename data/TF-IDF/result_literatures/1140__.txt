Subsolidus phase ratios in the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3 system have been studied using X 2)ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, and vibrational spectroscopy. A phase of variable composition Na1 – xNi1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3  (0  ≤  x  ≤  0.5)  having  NASICON  structure  (space  group  R c)  and  a  triple molybdate crystallizing in triclinic system (space group P ) have been obtained. The high conductivity of Na1 – xNi1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 allows the phase of variable composition to be regarded as a promising sodium 2) ion 2)conductive solid electrolyte.

NASICON oxide phases are promising solid elec 2) trolytes due to their high ionic conductivity, efficacy, and  environmental  friendliness.  A  development  of alternative  power  sources  dictates  an  ever  increasing demand for new ion 2)conductive materials. A search for new NASICON phases has been carried out for a long time  in  phosphate,  molybdate,  sulfate,  silicate,  and arsenate systems. The specific structural feature of these phases is a rhombohedral framework {[R2(EO4)4)]p–}3∞ built  of  RO6  octahedra  and  EO4  tetrahedra.  Small alkali  metal  atoms  populate  voids  in  the  frameworks and are responsible for the high ionic conductivities of the phases [1–9].

The  variability  of  cationic  composition  in  the frame of one structure type offers a means to perform a targeted synthesis of phases of variable composition M1 – хA1 – хR1 + х(MoO4)3,  which  are  isostructural  to NASICON. This structure of rhombohedral phases is topologically  identical  to  corundum;  A(R)  atoms reside on triple axes, and MoO4 groups reside on dou 2) ble axes. The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral voids merge to form a three 2)dimensional network of chan 2) nels whose bores are filled with alkali cations [3]. The necessary  condition  for  the  NASICON  structure  to exist is that the sizes of doubly and triply charged cat 2) ions would fall within the range 0.6–0.9 Å; this condi 2) tion is satisfied by Ni2+ and Sc3+ in combination with Na+  (which  has  a  moderate  size)  as  the  extraframe 2) work cation.

Our goals here were as follows: to elucidate whether Ni2+ and Sc3+ can enter the NASICON structure of a phase  of  variable  composition  Na1 ⎯ хNi1 – хSc1 + х (MoO4)3, which is a NaNiSc(MoO4)3 2)based subtrac 2) tion solid solution; to determine the conditions for the phase of variable composition to be prepared and its homogeneity range and thermal stability; and to study conductivity, dielectric permittivity, and dielectric loss tangent as a function of temperature.

Interactions the  Na2MoO4–NiMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3 system were studied by solid 2)phase reac 2) tions in the temperature range 450–800°C.

The initial  components for  the  study  were Na2MoO4,  NiMoO4,  and  Sc2(MoO4)3,  which  had been  presynthesized  by  solid 2)phase  technology  from Na2CO3,  NiO,  Sc(NO3)3  ⋅  6H2O,  and  MoO3  in  the temperature range  400–650°C with grinding repeat 2) ing every 20–30 h. The calcination time at each tem 2) perature  was  120–150  h.  After  calcination  was  over, samples were slowly cooled with the furnace. Unequil 2) ibrated  samples  were  additionally  annealed;  equilib 2) rium was considered acquired when the phase compo 2) sition of a sample remained unchanged upon two con 2) secutive anneals. Synthesis products were identified by X 2)ray powder diffraction using an FR 2)552 monochro 2) mator  chamber  (CuKα  radiation,  internal  Ge  stan 2) dard). The X 2)ray diffraction patterns were processed using the “Rentgen” software.

Vibrational  spectra  were  recorded  from  polycrys 2) talline Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 samples on a Bruker FT 2)IR spectrometer and a Specord M 2)80 spectrome 2) ter using near 2)IR laser radiation of 1.06 nm for excita 2) tion. The scattering geometry was reflection geometry; resolution was 3–5 cm–1. Samples were Nujol mulls or KBr disks. Molybdenum isotope substituted samples were prepared using 92MoO3 and 100MoO3.


Differential  thermal  analysis  (DTA)  was  carried out on an OD 2)103 MOM derivatograph; the tempera 2) ture  elevation  rate  was  10  K/min;  sample  sizes  were 0.3–0.4 g.

Conductivity  σ,  dielectric  permittivity  ε,  and dielectric loss tangent tanδ were studied as function of temperature  using  Vest  and  Tallan’s  polarization method [6] on ceramic samples having relative densi 2) ties of 95–97% compressed into disks 10 mm in diam 2) eter and 1–1.5 mm high with platinum electrodes. The electrodes were applied by burning 2)in platinum paste. Electrophysical  measurements  were  performed  on  an E8 2)4 ac bridge at a frequency of 103 Hz with an R 2)5025 capacitance box to extend the dielectric loss tangent measurement  range  (determination  accuracy  was ±5%). Direct current was recorded by an E6 2)13A ter 2) aohmmeter  at  a  set  voltage  of  30–50  mV.  Electronic transference number te and ionic transference number ti were  determined  by  the  Vest  and  Tallan’s  polarization method  using  a  circuit  with  ion 2)irreversible  electrodes [6].  The  ti  was  calculated  from  ti =  1  –  te.  The  te  was determined as the ratio of the dc electronic conductiv 2) ity (measured with intensity of 0.09 V/cm) to the over 2) all ac conductivity.

The  temperature  of  a  test  sample  during  electro 2) physical  measurements  was  monitored  using  a Chromel–Alumel  thermocouple  attached  to  a  V7 2) 21A voltmeter accurate to ±2°С.

The  reproducibility  of  measurement  results  was verified in the heating 2)and 2)cooling mode in the range 20–600°С.

Interactions the  Na2MoO4–NiMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3  system  were  studied  in  two  steps.  First,the phase compositions were studied for samples that corresponded to the meeting points of sections radiat 2) ing from the points of normal and double molybdates that  form  in  the  Na2MoO4–NiMoO4,  Na2MoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3,  and  NiMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  binary  sub 2) systems. The second step involved studying the quasi 2) binary sections recognized at the first step in order to triangulate the system (Fig. 1).

A new triple molybdate NaNiSc(MoO4)3 was found to  and Na2 + 2xNi1 ⎯ x(MoO4)2–Sc2(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) sec 2) tions  at  550–600°C. In the plane of the Na2MoO4– NiMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  the NaNiSc(MoO4)3–Sc2(MoO4)3 section, there exists a  composition Na1 ⎯ хNi1 ⎯ хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 (0 ≤  х  ≤  0.5),  which  is  a subtraction  solid  solution  based  on  triple  molybdate Na NiSc(MoO4)3.  At  600–650°С  triple  molybdate NaNi3Sc(MoO4)5  was  the NaSc(MoO4)2–NiMoO4 (1 : 3) section. Single 2)phase samples of Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3, which belongs to  the  NASICON  structure  type  (space  group  R c, Z = 6), were prepared at 680°C and with calcination time  triple  molybdate NaNi3Sc(MoO4)5,  which  crystallizes  in  triclinic  sys 2) tem (space group P  Z = 2), was prepared as a single 2) phase  sample  at  700°C  in  a  200 2)h  anneal.  The NaNi3Sc(MoO4)5 has the following unit cell parame 2) ters: a = 6.945(2) Å, b = 17.578(5) Å, c = 6.859(1) Å, α = 87.93(2)°, β = 101.44(2)°, γ = 92.28(2)°.

The  NaNiSc(MoO4)3  and  NaNi3Sc(MoO4)5  melt incongruently  at  885  and  860°C,  respectively,  not undergoing polymorphic transitions.

The  extent  of  the crystallization field of the NASICON solid solutions (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5) is dictated by the possibility of isomorphic substitutions in octahedra. Octahedral positions (M), which  are  randomly  occupied  by  Ni  and  Sc  atoms, have an excess of scandium (when х > 0) and a deficit of  nickel.  Sodium,  which  resides  in  interstices,  does not distort the lattice symmetry and is also deficient. These structural features of Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 and the cation distribution character increase the con 2) tribution  of  Sc–O  bonds  into  the  total  electrostatic bond  balance  of  the  structure.  For  the  structure  to retain this balance, Na–O bonds should be weakened, which is achieved due to a deficit of extraframework sodium and an increase in framework size so that the

The  NaNi3Sc(MoO4)5 unit  cell  volume  of  Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 increases as the homogeneity range extends (Table 1). to NaMg3In(MoO4)5 [4], where the basis of crystal struc 2) ture is a three 2)dimensional framework built of МоО4 tetrahedra and Mg(In)O6 octahedra. Closed voids in the  framework  are  populated  by  sodium  atoms.  The distinctive  features  of  this  structure  are  fragments comprised  of  four  octahedra,  which  form  a  planar rectangle, and paired edge 2)sharing octahedra.

The  Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  is  topologically identical  to  corundum;  Ni(Sc)  atoms  are  randomly distributed over two sets of crystallographic sites with an  octahedral  oxygen  coordination  on  triple  axes (symmetry С3), and МоО4 groups are on double axes (symmetry С2). The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral voids merge to form a three 2)dimensional network of channels whose bores are filled with sodium cations; the site symmetry of sodium cations is С3i. The exist 2) ence  of  isolated  distorted  tetrahedral  anionic  groups 2  in the structure makes it possible to carry out a −MoO 4 comparative analysis of the internal vibrations of dis 2) crete   groups and external vibrations, i.e., the vibrations of cation sublattices and МоО4 tetrahedra as  a  whole  [9].  The  bands  corresponding  to  4 ,−MoO vibrations  experience  an  isotope  shift  upon  92Mo– 100Mo substitutions (Tables 2, 3).

The comparatively low symmetry of МоО4 tetrahe 2) dra implies the release of degeneration from their dou 2) bly  and  triply  degenerate  vibrations  and  implies  the activity  of  components  of  full 2)symmetric  stretching vibrations in IR spectra.

Group 2)theory  analysis  suggests  the  following  dis 2) tribution  over  irreducible  representations  of  factor group D3d of the space group of crystals:

The Raman spectrum should feature three lines of vibrations of Ni2+ and Sc3+ cations, and the IR absorp 2) tion spectrum should feature two bands of vibrations of Na+ cations and three bands of vibrations of Ni2++ Sc3+.  Six  lines  of  vibrations  of  MoO4  groups  should appear  in  the  Raman  spectrum,  and  nine  should appear in the IR absorption spectrum.

Bands  with  frequencies  of  986–769  (stretching vibrations) and those at 408–310 cm–1 (bending vibra 2) tions), experiencing a shift upon molybdenum isotope substitutions and lying in the spectral range character 2) istic of the vibration frequencies of MoO4 tetrahedra, are assigned to the vibrations of МоО4 groups [9].

The full 2)symmetry stretching vibrations of molyb 2) date  groups,  which  are  distributed  over  two  sets  of crystallographic sites, are degenerate likely because of the similarity of the geometric and dynamic parame 2) ters  of  the  relevant  polyhedra  [4,  9].  The  stretching vibration frequencies of MoO4 groups increase by 20–

The random cat 2) ion  distribution,  while  not  influencing  the  spectral pattern as a whole, leads to relative line broadening so that  the  degree  of  distortion  of  MoO4  tetrahedra  is reduced  and  the  splitting  of  the  triply  degenerate stretching vibration decreases. The Raman lines that appear below 300 cm–1 (263–269 cm–1) are assigned to Ni2+ and Fe3+. The band at 192 cm–1 is assigned to the  vibrations  of  scandium  cations.  The  low 2)fre 2) quency sets of Raman lines at 112–111–87 cm–1 are assigned to the nickel vibrations, since the vibrations of sodium cations are Raman inactive. In IR absorp 2) tion spectra, the bands appearing below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to the vibrations of sodium cations.

Figure  2  displays  conductivity  versus  tempera 2) ture  curves  for  Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  plotted in  the  Arrhenius  linearization  coordinates  log σ– 103/Т.  The  conductivity  of  the  phase  of  variable composition  ranges  between  10–8  and  10–2  S/cm; for  Na1 – хNi1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  dominantly  ionic conductivity is typical (ti = 0.86–0.89) (Table 4).

Above 300°С the conductivity versus temperature curves feature an inflection and the activation energy of conduction increases, likely due to transition from impurity  to  intrinsic  conductivity.  

conductivity region, and over the intrinsic conductiv 2) ity region, its value is 2.01–2.34 eV. The conductivity value  of  10–2  S/cm,  which  is  typical  of  the  sodium NASICON  phase  Na1 – xNi1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3,  is  due to  the  rather  large  sizes  of  interstitial  voids  and  the associated appreciable reduction in steric hindrances to Na+ transport [7, 8].

Heterovalent substitutions Na+ + Ni2+ → Sc3+ +  1) in  the  Na1 ⎯ xNi1 ⎯ xSc1 + x(MoO4)3  solid  solution series generate additional vacancies in the sodium sub 2) lattice,  and  these  additional  vacancies  enhance  the sodium cation mobility and the electrical conductivity of the phase as the index х increases from 0 to 0.5. A correlation may be traced between variations of σ and the unit cell volume of the phase of variable composi 2) tion.
