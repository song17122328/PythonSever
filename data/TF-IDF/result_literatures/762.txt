The rechargeable molten-sodium systems work at approx.100 oC and useaqueous bromine/bromide or iodine/iodide solutions as catholyte and sodium-ion conductive NaSICON(Na3Zr2Si2.3P0.7O11.85) as solid electrolyte.
The free halogen, which is formed upon charge, is complexed ashighly soluble tribromide and triiodide, respectively.
These systems can work in both, static and redox-flow setup, respectively, and aim at stationary energy storage applications.
The sodium-halogen batteries were shown to run with high coulombic efficiency over several hundred hours.
Long-term stability of theNaSICON ceramic material in contact with aqueous electrolytes, however, is still a concern.
The sodiumbrominesystem suffers from a considerable bromine vapour pressure of the tribromide, whereas thesodium-iodine system was shown to operate in a stable manner with a catholyte allowing for a high totaliodine concentration (2.0 M).
Catholyte concentrations up to 2.75 M total iodine in redox-flow setupand up 3.7 M in static setup are possible without iodine precipitation and correspond to specific energiesof 198 Wh kg1 and 228 Wh kg1, respectively, on total active material level.
In this study, aqueous medium temperature (100 oC) sodiumhalogenbattery systems are evaluated.
In theflow-cell setup thecatholyte is stored in a tank and pumped continuously through thecell which is maintained at temperatures around 100 C to keep thesodium in the liquid state.
Slightly sodium-deficient NaSICON witha nominal composition of Na3Zr2Si2.3P0.7O11.85 was used as solidelectrolyte.
This material showed chemical stability against Nahalogenide and Na halogenide + halogen solutions over severalhundreds of hours, except for NaBr+Br2, in which the low pH of 3.0causes a slight attack of the surface-near layer under formation ofhydronium NaSICON.
The ceramic material shows good wetting, apparent chemical stability against molten sodium and ionicconductivities of 7.0 mS cm-1 under DC conditions in a cell in NaNa configuration and 21.4 mS cm1 under high frequency AC conditions.
Discs with an active diameter of 14 mm and 28 mm andtypical thicknesses between 0.6 mm and 1.0 mm were used.
Theaqueous sodium bromine system is limited by the vapour pressureof bromine at 100 oC to approx.0.5 M Br2 if the battery is kept undernormal pressure in aflow-system.
In a static setup 1 M of Br2 was reached.
The aqueous sodium-iodine system does not suffer from ahigh vapour pressure of the free iodine.
Accordingly, a battery with concentrations of 0 - 2.0 M of iodine (present as NaI3 + traces of I2) was shown to run under normal pressure inflow-cell setup using7 M sodium iodide as catholyte at 101 C for several hundred hourswithout increase of cell polarization.
The faradaic efficiency of thissystem is >99.9% and (for [I2] >0.3 M) the energy efficiency is 80% ata current density of 20 mA cm-2 (55 mW cm-2) at a mean discharge voltage of 2.75 V.
A maximum current density of100 mA cm-2 was tested which corresponds to a discharge power density of approx.180 mW cm-2. A total iodine concentration of upto 2.75 M was obtained starting from saturated (8.3 M) NaI.2.75 M total iodine catholyte corresponds to 405 Wh L1 oncatholyte basis, at a mean discharge voltage of 2.75 V.
A very high specific energy of 198 Wh kg-1 on “active material level” (=Na + NaIsolution) can, thus, be obtained.
