The  high-voltage  cathode  material  based  on  the  sodium  super  ionic  conductor  (NASICON) structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been found to be a potential candidate for Mg storage. In this work,  to  improve  its  electrochemical  performance,  we  construct  honeycomb-like  structured NVP/C/G  with  faster  electronic  and  ionic  transport  by  a  convenient  and  universal  spray-drying method  for  the  first  time.  After  electrochemically  desodiating  two  Na  from  the  NVP/C/G (ED-NVP/C/G), the ED-NVP/C/G is  tested in highly anhydrous  Mg electrolyte,  and  the insights into its Mg storage property and mechanism are carefully studied. An initial capacity of 87 mAhg-1 with a relatively high average discharge voltage of 2.47 V vs. Mg2+/Mg are obtained at 0.1 C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the inserted Mg2+ ions tend to occupy the Na2 (at 18e sites) vacant sites. The investigation of kinetic process by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique  (GITT)  reveals  that  the  Mg  diffusion  kinetics  is  faster  during  the  demagnesiation process. The electrochemical reaction bases on two-phase transition mechanism, and the Rct value shows  a  positive  relationship  to  the  formation  of  NaV2(PO4)3  phase.  Finally,  a  Mg  full  cell prototype  based  on  the ED-NVP/C/G  cathode  with  Mg metal  as  the  anode  is  built.  The  rational structure design of NVP/C/G improves the electrochemical performance for Mg storage, and our work also gives new understanding into the Mg storage mechanism in the ED-NVP/C/G structure.   


The applications of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) in large scale energy storages are hindered by the high cost and safety problems. Although post-LIBs such Li-S batteries are developed, they are still  Li-based  electrochemical  systems  [1,  2].  Due  to  the  scarcity  and  uneven  distribution  of  Li resources,  the  post-LIBs  based  on  non-Li  systems,  such  as  Na/Mg/Al/Ca-based  batteries,  are attracted increasingly attention as alternatives for LIBs. For example, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) become a shining star benefiting from its low cost. However, unlike multivalent metal, Na metal is not  suitable  to  be  used  as  an  anode  due  to  the  safety  problems.  Although  researches  focus  on anode  materials  such  as  TiO2,  alloys  and  carbon  materials,  and  polymer  electrolyte  with  better safety  properties  have  been  done,  the  electrochemical  performance  of  the  full  cell  still  needs further  improvement  for  commercialization  [3-8].  On  the  other  hand,  to  improve  the  energy density,  using  metals  as  the  anode  is  an  effective  strategy  since  they  usually  possess  their  low reduction potential and high energy density (Fig. S1). For instance, Ca2+/Ca exhibits a relatively low  potential  of  -2.86  V  vs.  S.H.E.,  and  the  moderate  charge  density  of  Ca2+  may  allow  faster diffusion than other multivalent ions,  making it a promising post-LIBs. However,  the electrolyte that allow reversible Ca stripping/deposition is very rare at room temperature (RT), resulting in the difficulty  to  build  a  full  cell  [9,  10].  Among  the  multivalent  ion  batteries,  rechargeable  Mg batteries  (RMBs)  possesses  prominent  overall  advantages:  (i)  The  deposition  of  Mg  tends  to  be dendrite-free due to its low diffusion barrier, making it a safe anode [11]; (ii) The low reduction potential  of  Mg  (-2.37  V  vs.  S.H.E.)  provides  great  potential  for  building  a  high-voltage  RMBs based  on  the  Mg  anode;  (iii)  Mg  element  is  abundant  in  the  earth’s  crust,  which  is  important  to decrease the production cost; (iiii) The energy densities of Mg are high [12].  These  advantages  provide  great  opportunity  for  RMBs  to  be  applied  in  the large-scale energy storages.   


However,  the  development  of  RMBs  is  still  in  its  early  stage  and  far  away  from commercialization  [13].  The  strong  polarity  of  Mg2+  resulting  from  its  divalent  nature  leads  to slow  diffusion  kinetics  in  solid  materials,  thus  finding  suitable  cathode  materials  is  one  of  the greatest  challenges  in  RMBs  [14,  15].  The  most  promising  cathode  material  is  still  Mo6S8 proposed by Aurbach group in 2000 [16]. Despite the excellent electrochemical performance for Mg storage, the preparation process of Mo6S8 is complex and high energy-consumption, limiting its  further  application.  Although  several  types  of  cathode  materials  are  available,  their electrochemical performances are not satisfactory. For example, the average discharge voltages of the  sulfides,  including  Mo6S8,  are  less  than  1.5  V  vs.  Mg2+/Mg,  and  such  low  working  voltage greatly  limits  the  energy  density  [16-18].  Developing  high-voltage  cathode  materials  is  an effective  strategy  to  enhance  the  energy  density.  Although  several  cathode  materials  based  on oxides and polyanions materials with high working voltage have been developed, two challenges still exist at least: (i) The electrochemical performances at RT need further improvement since low current  density  and  high  working  temperature  are  usually  necessary;  (ii)  The  average  discharge voltages  are  usually  much  lower  than  2.5  V  vs.  Mg2+/Mg  [19-24].  Here,  the  average  discharge voltage  represents  the  voltage  when  the  battery  reaches  half  value  of  the  total  specific  capacity. 

For instance, it was reported that the MgFeSiO4 delivered an average discharge voltage of 2 V vs. Mg2+/Mg  with  a  discharge  capacity  of  about  300  mAh  g-1  at  55  ˚C.  However,  the  discharge current density was only 6.62 mA g-1 (~ 0.02 C) and the cycle performance was not provided [19]. 

Thus, exploration of new cathode materials with high working voltage is highly needed.


The  NASICON  structured  NVP  allows  fast  transportation  of  Na+  due  to  the  opened three-dimensions  framework  [25].  The  NVP  delivers  a  flat  plateau  at  3.34  V  vs.  Na+/Na  with excellent  electrochemical  performance  in  SIBs.  The  theoretical  specific  capacity  is  118  mAh  g-1 when consider the redox reaction of V4+/V3+. Due to the fast Na+ migration ability, the framework of  the  NVP  might  also  be  suitable  for  the  Mg2+  transportation.  In  addition,  vanadium-based materials  possess  good  electrochemical  performance  as  electrode  materials  for  both  LIBs  and RMBs  [26-28].  The  applications  of  NVP  have  first  been  reported  as  the  cathode  material  in Na-Mg  hybrid  batteries.  Yao  et  al.  reported  a  high-voltage  rechargeable  Na-Mg  hybrid  battery based on NVP cathode, Mg anode and chlorine-containing electrolyte. However, the insertion of Mg2+ into NVP seems difficult due to the incompatibility of the cathode and the electrolyte [29]. 

By changing the electrolyte to a chlorine-free electrolyte Mg(TFSI)2/DME, (TFSI= C2F6NO4S2, DME = 1,2-dimethoxyethane), Tirado et al. proved the NVP structure is possible for Mg storage with  a  relatively  low  discharge  voltage  of  1.2  V  vs.  Mg2+/Mg.  Very  recently,  we  have  first investigated  the  electrochemical  performance  of  the  NVP  in  RMBs  with  the  electrochemically desodiated NVP/C  (ED-NVP/C)  as  the  cathode.  Despite  the  high  discharge  voltage,  the  insights into  the  Mg  storage  mechanism  is  still  not  very  clear,  such  as  the  crystal  structure  of  the Mg2+-inserted product. Thus, further investigation is necessary [30].   


On the other hand, since NVP shows poor electronic conductivity, the effective structure design and  carbon coating process are  usually  needed  [31, 32].  The  more rational structure design with faster  electronic  and  ionic  path  can  effectively  improve  the  electrochemical  performance.  The NVP/carbon  (NVP/C)  composites  with  honeycomb-like  structure  can  significantly  enhance  the electrochemical  performance  of  the  electrode  materials  with  poor  electronic  conductivity.  This structure with interconnected pores can enlarge the electrode/electrolyte contact area, shorten ion transportation path, as well as accommodate the volume change of the materials [33-35]. Although honeycomb-like  porous NVP/C  microballs  have  been  synthesized  with  cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a soft template, the preparation process is rather complicated and not suitable for mass  production  [36].  Thus, a  convenient and  universal  method is desired.  The  spray-drying method is a good choice to integrate inorganic materials with various carbon materials to serve as the electrode materials [28, 33, 37].   

In  this  work,  we  have  prepared  honeycomb-like  structured  NVP/C/G  microspheres  by  a universal  spray-drying  method  with  the  polystyrene  (PS)  as  a  hard  template  and  the  graphene oxide  (GO)  as  the  structure  support  (Fig.  1a).  The  electrochemical  performance  of  the ED-NVP/C/G  for  Mg  storage  is  investigated  in  highly  anhydrous  electrolyte.  The  Mg  storage mechanism  in  the  ED-NVP/C/G  is  further  studied  by  the  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD), galvanostatic  intermittent  titration  technique  (GITT)  and  electrochemical  impedance  spectrum (EIS). Finally, a Mg full cell prototype based on the ED-NVP/C/G cathode, Mg metal anode and the electrolyte composed of 0.1 M Mg(TFSI)2/triglyme is proposed. 



The PS was synthesized according to the previous report [33]. Typically, styrene (Aladdin) was washed with 4 M NaOH solution to remove the anti-polymerizer before polymerization reaction. 

The  styrene was  then washed with deionized water until  pH ~  7. Next,  the  sodium lauryl (SDS, 0.152 g) and potassium persulfate (KPS, 0.305 g) were added into 140 mL alcohol-water solution (2: 5, volume: volume) in a 250 mL three-neck flask. The polymerization reaction proceeded with the protection of N2. The solution was heated to 70  ˚C, and then 7.0 mL of the styrene was added. 

The  solution  was  kept  at  70  ˚C  for  10  h  under  vigorous  stirring.  Finally,  the  as-prepared  PS suspension was obtained.   



In  a  typical  experiment,  the  CH3COONa  (0.005  mol,  0.41  g),  NH4VO3  (0.003  mol,  0.39  g), NH4H2PO4 (0.005 mol, 0.552 g) and 0.3 g sucrose were added into 40 mL deionized water. The suspension  was  kept  at  70  ˚C  for  30  min  under  stirring  to  dissolve  NH4VO3.  Then  20  mL  PS suspension and 4.0 g GO suspension (0.2 wt%) were added into the transparent yellow solution. 

The  obtained  suspension  was  then  under  ultrasonic  treatment  for  1  h.  The  homogeneous suspension was dried by using a mini spray dryer under the protection of N2. The inlet and outlet temperature were 200  ˚C and 112  ˚C, respectively. The collected precursors were calcined at 350 ˚C for 4 h  followed by 750  ˚C for 8 h  in  5 wt% H2/Ar atmosphere  to obtain the NVP/C/G.  For pure  NVP  (PNVP),  NVP/C  and  NVP/C-PS,  the  prepare  processes  were  the  same  as  that  of  the NVP/C/G without the addition of corresponding reactants.   



The  XRD  measurement  was  operated  on  Rigaku  Ultima  IV  or  Rigaku  miniflex  600 diffractometer.  The  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM,  HITACHI  S-4800)  and  transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100) were used to analyze the morphology and crystal nature. 

The  Raman  spectra  were  obtained  on  the  Raman  spectroscope  (HORIBA  Xplora).  The thermogravimetric  (TG,  SDT-Q600)  was  used  to  determine  the  carbon  content.  The  specific surface  area  was  calculated  according  to  the  nitrogen  adsorption  and  desorption  isotherms. 


The working electrode composes 80 wt% of the NVP/C/G, 10 wt% of the acetylene black and 10 wt% of the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) on Ti foil. The mass loading of the NVP/C/G was 0.6 ~ 0.8 mg cm-2 for electrochemical measurement and ~ 2.0 mg cm-2 for ex-situ XRD test. The activated carbon (AC) electrode  composes  of 80 wt%  AC, 10 wt%  acetylene black  and  10 wt% PVDF on a nickel foam. The mass loading of the AC was ~ 55 mg cm-2. For anhydrous electrolyte, the  Mg(TFSI)2.6H2O  (Alfa  Aesar)  was  dehydrated  at  200  ˚C,  and  then  dissolved  in  anhydrous acetonitrile (AN, Alfa Aesar). The electrolyte was further dried using molecular sieve for several times. The water content was less than 20 ppm tested by Metrohm 831 Coulometric Karl Fischer titrator. The electrodes were charged to 0.6 V vs. AC in the home-made Swagelok cell to extract two Na from the NVP,  and then dissembled in glove box.  Anhydrous AN was used to wash the desodiated  electrodes  several  times  to  remove  the  residue  electrolyte.  Then,  the  half-cell  was reassembled  with  the  desodiated  electrode  as  a  cathode  and  the  AC  electrode  as  a  counter electrode with fresh electrolyte in a 2032-type coin cell.   

The galvanostatic charge-discharge test was operated in -0.4 ~ 0.6 V vs. AC at 0.1 C and 0.2 C.  For  the  GITT  test,  the half-cell was discharged/charged at 0.1 C for 10 min and then relaxed for 1 h. For the EIS test, the cell  at  different  charged/discharged  states  was  tested  on  the  Solartron  Modulab  1287A/1260  in 10-2 ~ 105 Hz and the result was confirmed in repeated measurements. The full cell was assembled with  the  desodiated  electrode  as  a  cathode,  the  metal  Mg  as  an  anode  and  the  0.1 Mg(TFSI)2/triglyme  (battery  grade)  as  an  electrolyte.  The  stripping/deposition  potential  of  the electrolyte  was  tested  in  a  Mg//Mg  symmetric  cells  at  1  mA  cm-2.  The  electrochemical performance of the full cell was tested both at RT (25  ˚C) and high temperature (100  ˚C) at 0.05 C. For XRD test, to obtain enough intensities to do the XRD refinement, the amount of the active material should be no less than 10 mg. Since the active material loading of NVP/C/G for XRD test is  ~  2.0  mg  cm-2,  thus  we  used  six  cells  for  one  XRD  sample.  The  cells  after  desodiation (ED-NVP/C/G) or magnesiation (ED-NVP/C/G-Mg) are dissembled in the glove box and washed with anhydrous AN. After dried at RT, the electrode materials on Ti films were carefully scrape off and collected as one XRD sample. To prevent the influence of air and H2O, the XRD sample were protected with kapton film before taken out of the glove box.   


The  electrochemical  performance  of  the  NVP/C/G  has  first  been  evaluated  in  the  SIBs. As shown, the NVP/C/G shows better electrochemical performance than the NVP/C-PS and  NVP/C,  indicating  that  the  honeycomb-like  structured  design  is  effective  for  enhancing  the electrochemical  performance.  Thus,  the  NVP/C/G  is  selected  as  the  Mg  storage  host  for  further study.  To  create  vacant  sites  for  Mg2+  intercalation,  the  NVP/C/G  electrode  was  first electrochemically desodiated two Na+  to get  the ED-NVP/C/G.  The specific capacity is  97  mAh g-1,  corresponding  to  1.94  Na+  extraction  (Fig.  S6).  

Thus,  the  chemical  composition  of  the ED-NVP/C/G is Na1.06V2(PO4)3. The electrochemical performance of the ED-NVP/C/G has been investigated  in  a  half-cell  (Fig.  2a).  The  AC  counter  electrode  can  act  as  a  quasi-reference electrode  in  the  AN-based  solution  with  a  potential  of  2.45  V  vs.  Mg2+/Mg  [39].  


In  this  work,  we  have  successfully  prepared  honeycomb-like  structured  NVP/C/G  via  a convenient  and  universal  spray-drying  method  with  improved  electrochemical  performance.  An initial  capacity  of  87  mAh  g-1  and  an  average  discharge  voltage  of  2.47  V  vs.  Mg2+/Mg  are obtained in highly anhydrous electrolyte at 0.1 C. The investigation of the Mg storage mechanism shows that the cell unit of the ED-NVP expands during the magnesiation process, and the inserted Mg2+  tends  to  occupy  the  Na2  vacant  sites  in  the  NVP  crystal  structure.  The  electrochemical reaction  takes  place  via  a  two-phase  transition  with  larger  DMg2+ in  the  demagnesiation  process, indicating  that  the  Mg  extraction  kinetics  is  faster.  The  Rct  of  the  half-cell  varies  at  different charge-discharge states  and shows  a positive relationship to the  formation of  NaV2(PO4)3  phase. The Mg storage mechanism in the ED-NVP is very similar to that of Li in FePO4. The Mg full cell prototype  based  on  the  ED-NVP/C/G  cathode  and  Mg  metal  anode  is  proposed.  The electrochemical  performance  of  the  full  cell  is  much  poorer  than  the  half-cell,  indicating  that  a more suitable chlorine-free electrolyte that are compatible to both cathode and Mg anode is highly needed. In conclusion, the rational structure design improves the electrochemical performance for Mg  storage,  and  our  work  also  gives  new  understanding  into  the  Mg  storage  mechanism  in  the
