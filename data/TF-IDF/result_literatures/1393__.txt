Abstract. Lithium dizirconium phosphate (LiZr2(PO4)3) possesses good ionic conductivity owing to its unique framework structure and can be used as favorable anode material in Li-ion battery. LiZr2(PO4)3 is commonly prepared by solid phase reaction in which higher temperature is needed and pure LiZr2(PO4)3 without other phases is difficult to obtain in the final products. In this paper, low cost hydrothermal synthesis of pure (LiZr2(PO4)3) was studied. Effects of the hydrothermal conditions (molar ratios of Li+ to ZrOCl2, addition of HF, pH values of reaction system and hydrothermal temperatures) on the phase composition of the products were investigated. The results showed that pure LiZr2(PO4)3 was successfully prepared at lower temperature of 80°C for 24h with the addition of HF when the pH value was adjusted to 5.0 and the molar ratio of Li+ to ZrOCl2 was 0.5 with the concentration of ZrOCl2 as 0.6mol/L. The phases and purity of the final products were characterized by XRD analysis.  Introduction Lithium-ion conducting solids are materials of increasing interests because of their potential use as solid electrolytes in high-energy solid-state batteries [1-3]. LiZr2(PO4)3 (Li123) in particular is an important material of this category due to its lightweight and the high reduction potential of lithium[4,5]. Li123 is commonly prepared by solid phase reaction in which higher temperature is needed and pure Li123 without other phases is difficult to obtain in the final products [6-8]. In this paper, low cost hydrothermal synthesis of pure Li123 was studied. Effects of the hydrothermal conditions (molar ratios of Li+ to ZrOCl2 referred as n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2], addition of HF, pH values of reaction system and hydrothermal temperatures) on the phase composition of the products were investigated. Experimental Experimental materials. ZrOCl2.8H2O, H3PO4 with mass concentration of 85% and Li2CO3 was used as starting materials. HF and ammonia was used to decrease the reaction temperatures and to adjust the pH values of the reaction system. Experimental instruments. Thermogravimetric (TG) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) were conducted with simultaneous thermal analyzer (STA449C-QMS403C, Netzsch, Germany). X-ray powder diffracter (D8 AdvanceXRD, Bruker, Germany) was employed to characterize the phase and purity of the final products.  Experimental processes. Chemical co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis were applied in this paper to prepare Li123. Firstly, ZrOCl2.8H2O, H3PO4 and Li2CO3 were dissolved in water in fixed molar ratios. Ammonia was added to adjust the pH values of the mixture and chemical co-precipitation began. Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 80~150°C for 24h and then the reaction system was cooled to room temperature, washed with deionized water to pH values around 7 and dried in air at 80~100°C to obtain the precursors. Fine-crystalized Li123 powders were finally prepared after the calcination of the precursors at 400~600°C. 196

In order to analyze the thermal parameters of the samples, TG and DTA curves of the precursors prepared under hydrothermal conditions No.4 were collected (Fig. 1). From Fig. 1 we can see that an endothermic peak appears at about 180°C which indicates the loss of crystal water from 130~300°C and a moderate endothermic reaction occurs from 300~900°C that demonstrates the growth and development of Li123 crystals. According to the result of thermal analysis, the calcination temperatures of the precursors were set at 600°C to obtain fine and well-crystallized Li123 powders. XRD patterns of the same precursors and the corresponding products after calcination at 600°C were collected and shown in Fig. 2. The result in Fig. 2 is in agreement with the result of Fig. 1, and demonstrates that only amorphous structures can be found in XRD patterns of the precursors and calcination is essential to obtain well-crystallized Li123 powders under conditions mentioned above. Effects of pH values on  the precursors. The pH value of the starting mixtures is one of the most important factors to the phase composition of the hydrothermal products. Clear and colorless sol, milky sol-gel, and white precipitates were obtained at pH values of 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 respectively, when the concerntration of ZrOCl2 was fixed at 0.3mol/L, n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] was 0.5 and the hydrothermal temperature was 150°C. Therefore, a pH value of 5.0 adjusted by ammonium was selected to prepare the precursors and final Li123 crystallized powders in this study.  Key Engineering Materials Vols. 512-515

 Effects of ZrOCl2 concentrations on  the phase composition of the products. XRD patterns of products prepared with different ZrOCl2 concerntrations were shown in Fig. 3. The results demonstrate that single phase of LiZr2(PO4)3 was obtained under hydrothermal conditions No. 3 with ZrOCl2 concerntration as 0.3 mol/L, phase of ZrP2O7 appeared when ZrOCl2 concerntration increaed to 0.7 mol/L (conditions No. 5) and only phase of ZrP2O7 were obtained at  ZrOCl2 concerntration of 1.0 mol/L (conditions No. 6). Taking the final yields of Li123 into consideration, ZrOCl2 concerntration of 0.6mol/L was selected to prepare single phase of Li123 in this study.

Effects of n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] on the phase composition of the products. XRD patterns of products prepared with different n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] were shown in Fig. 4. The results demonstrate that single phase of Li123 were obtained under hydrothermal conditions No. 4 with n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] as 0.5, phase of ZrP2O7 appeared when n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] increaed to 1.0 (conditions No. 7) and only amorphos structures were obtained at  n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] of 2.0 (conditions No. 8). n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] was set to 0.5 to prepare single phase of Li123 in this study. Effects of hydrothermal temperatures on the phase composition of the products. XRD patterns of products prepared at different hydrothermal temperatures of 80°C and 150°C were shown in Fig. 5. The results demonstrate that single phase of ZrP2O7 was obtained under hydrothermal conditions No. 9 at 80°C and single phase of Li123 was prepared at 150°C (conditions No. 4).   198

 Effects of mineralizer on the phase composition of the precursors. XRD patterns of precursors obtained with and without the addition of mineralizer (HF) were shown in Fig. 6. The results demonstrate that single phase of Zr(HPO4)2·H2O was obtained in precursors under hydrothermal conditions No. 9 and single phase of Li123 was prepared in precursors under hydrothermal conditions No. 10, which indicates that the addition of mineralizer effectively decreased the hydrothermal temperatures. As reported in the hydrothermal synthesis of microporous aluminophosphate[9], the existence of  Ffavored the complex formation between Fand silicon or aluminum source which activated the silicon or aluminum source and therefore decreased the reaction temperatures. The effects of  HF in this study can likely be attributed to the complex formation between Fand zirconium source in the same mechanisms mentioned above.   Conclusions Single phase of LiZr2(PO4)3 was successfully prepared at lower temperature of 80°C for 24h with the addition of HF when the pH value was adjusted to 5.0 and n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2] was 0.5 with the concentration of ZrOCl2 as 0.6mol/L. Effects of the hydrothermal conditions (n[Li+]/n[ZrOCl2], content of HF, pH values of reaction system and hydrothermal temperatures) on the phase composition of the products were investigated in details by XRD patterns.
