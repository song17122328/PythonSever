The replacement of the presently used liq-uid electrolytes by a non-ﬂammable solid elec-trolyte is an important avenue to create safer batteries. The Natrium Superionic CONduc-tor (NaSiCON) Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) that displays high bulk ionic conductivity and good stability towards other NaSiCON-based electrodes is a good solid electrolyte in NaSiCON-based batteries. Despite the size-able share of research on Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, the structural and thermodynamic properties of NaSiCON require better understanding for more eÿcient synthesis and optimization as a solid electrolyte, which often follows chemical intuition. Here, we analyze the thermodynamic properties of the rhombohedral NaSiCON elec-trolyte by constructing the Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 phase diagram, based on density functional the-ory calculations, a cluster expansion frame-work, and Monte Carlo simulations. Speciﬁcally, we build the phase diagram as a func-tion of temperature and composition (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) for the high-temperature rhombohe-dral structure, which has been also observed in several positive electrode materials, such as Na3Ti2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3Cr2(PO4)3, and Na3Fe2(PO4)3. Through the phase dia-gram, we identify the concentration domains providing the highest Na+-ion conductivity and previously unreported phase-separation behav-ior across three di˙erent single-phase regions. Further, we note the similarities in the phase behavior between Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 and other NaSiCON-based mono-transition metal elec-trodes and discuss the potential competition between thermodynamics and kinetics in ex-perimentally observed phase separation. Our work is an important addition in understand-ing the thermodynamics of NaSiCON-based materials and in the development of inexpen-sive Na-ion batteries. From our results we propose that the addition of SiO44– moieties The development of green energy technolo-gies, such as photovoltaics, wind turbines and rechargeable batteries, is essential in meeting the sustainable needs of a society to limit its fossil fuel usage. Lithium (Li)-ion batteries power the world’s mobile devices, and they are increasingly seen in vehicular transporta-tion. When life-cycle analysis is examined in the design of batteries, however, sodium (Na) appears attractive since it can be “har-vested” directly from seawater, making Na ∼ 50 times lower in cost than Li.1–3 Na-ion batter-ies also use inexpensive, stainless-steel current collectors.2 However, commercial Li-ion bat-teries and the state-of-the-art Na-ion batteries employ highly ﬂammable organic liquid elec-trolytes,4,5 which pose a tangible safety concern in their widespread deployment.A pathway to create a battery with a high energy density as well as safety is to replace the liquid with a non-ﬂammable solid elec-trolyte,6 leading to all-solid-state batteries, which are the object of a sizeable amount of current research.7–24 Today, the super-ionic conductivity of Li+ and Na+-ions in solid electrolytes can achieve record-values >10 mS·cm−1 at room temperature,25–27,27 rivalling those of commercial liquid electrolytes (e.g., 1 M LiPF6 in dimethyl/ethylene carbon-ates ∼ 10−2 S·cm−1).28 More than 40 years ago, Hong and Goodenough studied the “Na-trium Superionic CONductor” (NaSiCON), Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3),29,30 which can achieve exceptional bulk ionic Na+-conductivity (∼15 mS·cm−1 at 298 K) for x ∼2.0–2.4.31 The NaSiCON structure provides a versatile frame-work, incorporating both cationic (Na+ and Zr4+) and anionic (SiO44– and PO43– ) moi-eties,32,33 which enable the number of Na+-ions to vary between 1 and 4 per formula unit with corresponding changes in the P:Si ratio and Na+-ion conductivity.
Figure 1 depicts the structure of the high-temperature (> 450 K) rhombohedral (space group: R c) phase of Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12,29,30,32,33 where the 3 blue XO4 (X = P or Si) tetra-hedra share corners with two grey ZrO6 oc-tahedra forming the so-called “lantern units” (panels a and b). There are two distinct, partially occupied (disordered) sodium sites, Na(1) and Na(2) (panel b). The super-ionic behavior in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 is driven by a Na-vacancy migration mechanism that re-lates directly to the occupational disorder of Na(1) and Na(2).29,34–36 The volume of the polyhedra formed by Na(1) site is typically larger than that of Na(2) and is coordinated by oxygens atoms from ZrO6 units in an anti-prismatic arrangement (Figure 1b and 1c), while Na(2) resides in an irregular polyhe-dral, coordinated to seven neighboring oxygen atoms from the ZrO6 and XO4 units. The ex-istence of a third Na site between Na(1) and Na(2) has been reported,33,37 and attributed to a metastable state in the Na+ migration. At lower temperatures (< 450 K) and for 1.8 ≤ x ≤ 2.2 for x in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, the NaSiCON undergoes a monoclinic dis-tortion (space group: C2/c) that is often as-sociated with Na+ ordering into distinct Na sites and lower Na-conductivities.29 Here, we will use the nomenclature rhombohedral- and monoclinic-NaSiCON to distinguish the two Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 phases.There exists an extensive body of prior lit-erature on optimizing the Na-ion conductivity within the NaSiCON electrolyte,30,31,33,34,36–40 especially at x ∼ 2 in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12. Alio-valent doping has been used to increase the Na-ion conductivity by varying the Na content and disorder in NaSiCON.34,38–40 For example, Miyajima et al.41 studied the partial substi-tution of Zr4+ by 3+ cations, such as In3+, Yb3+, Er3+, Y3+, Dy3+, Tb3+, and Gd3+ in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 leading to an increase of the Na content. While Sc3+ has also been used as a common aliovalent dopant on Zr4+,39–41 high Na+ conductivities (∼3.7 mS·cm−1) have been achieved by doping with trivalent Al3+, Fe3+, and Y3+, and divalent Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ species.38 The complete substitution of Zr4+ in NaSiCON by redox-active transition metals,36,38–40 e.g., Ti, V, Cr, and Fe, in NaSiCON transforms the solid elec-trolyte into an electrode. Notably, NaSiCON-derived electrodes (e.g., Na3Ti2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3Cr2(PO4)3) often show phase-separation behavior upon Na intercala-tion/extraction.34,42,43,43–47The phase behavior –phase separation or the existence of solid solutions– has not been fully elucidated in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12. Speciﬁcally, the experimentally observed disorder and frac-tional occupancies of the Na/Vacancy (Va) and Si/P sites in the rhombohedral-NaSiCON structure29,30,33 hinder characterization at-tempts in assigning speciﬁc phases (or ordered Na conﬁgurations) at di˙erent temperatures and Na compositions. In this investigation, we therefore analyze the phase behavior of the NaSiCON electrolyte by constructing the Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 phase diagram as a func-tion of composition (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) and temperature. We focus on the high-temperature rhombohedral-NaSiCON Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 structure, which exhibits high Na-conductivity and is adopted by several Na-based positive electrodes (e.g., Na3Ti2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3Cr2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3) as well at high temperature. The phase diagram of the rhombohedral Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 phase is developed by grand canonical Monte-Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on a cluster ex-pansion (CE) model,48 which is built on density functional theory (DFT)49,50 calcula-tions. Importantly, we ﬁnd speciﬁc tempera-ture and Na-concentration domains where the rhombohedral-NaSiCON exhibits a biphasic be-havior (or phase separation), which is similar to the behavior observed in NaSiCON-based elec-trodes. Finally, we provide strategies for further optimizing the synthesis of NaSiCON-related materials and improving their ion-transport properties.
To coarse grain the Gibbs free-energy with changes in composition and temperature of the rhombohedral Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, the Metropolis-Hasting GCMC51 was performed using a CE Hamiltonian. The CE was pa-rameterized on various Na-vacancy (Va) and Si-P conﬁgurations, and the CE ﬁt was ob-tained using the cluster assisted statistical mechanics (CASM) code.52–55 In performing the GCMC simulations, every Na/Va swap must be coupled to a Si/P swap or vice versa, in order to maintain the charge neutrality of the overall simulation cell. We have enforced the charge neutrality by modifying the GCMC code in the CASM package (https://github. com/caneparesearch/CASMcode).52–55 GCMC runs were performed on 16×16×16 supercells of the primitive cell with 172,032 atoms and ranged between 57,344,000 and 573,440,000 steps. The condition of charge neutrality in-creases substantially the number of GCMC steps required to achieve convergence compared to GCMC simulations without this constraint. GCMC simulations were considered converged when deviations in formation energies reached ≤ 0.5 meV/f.u.In GCMC, either the chemical potential (µ) or temperature (T) can vary. Due to the charge-neutrality constraint, there is a single indepen-dent µ in the NaSiCON system, i.e., one unique composition variable (x). As a result of the three ground-states in the convex hull at x = 0, 2 and 3 (see Section 3.1), µ was scanned in two regions with a ﬁne step-size (∆µ = 0.005 eV/f.u) in both “forward” and “backward” directions (Section S4 in Supporting Informa-tion, SI). GCMC scans were also performed at ﬁxed µ and with varying T from 5 to 1605 K (∆T = 5 K).The CE Hamiltonian, based on the approach of Sanchez et al.,48 parameterizes the forma-tion energies (Ef in Eq. 2), as calculated from DFT, of various Na/Va and Si/P con-ﬁgurations, which are mapped onto a ﬁxed Na4Zr2Si3O12 topology. The CE is typically written as a truncated summation of the e˙ec-tive cluster interactions (ECIs) of pair, triplet, quadruplet, and higher order clusters as: where E is the formation energy of a Na/Va and Si/P conﬁguration (i.e., a given structure). The ECI V , and a polynomial func-tion mapping the occupation of the lattice site, with ζi = 0 or 1 representing the occupation of Na or Va and φa = 0 or 1 that of Si or P.56 Each ECI in the sum includes the multiplicity (the cluster symmetry). All symmetrically distinct pairs, triplets, and quadruplets in the rhombo-hedral cell within a radius of 10 Å, 6 Å and 5 Å, respectively, are used for constructing the CE model. Note that including larger clusters via increasing the maximum radius (within which clusters are included) results in a dramatic in-crease of the basis-set size and the complexity of the ﬁtting procedure, without any improve-ment in the quality of the CE.Di˙erent Na compositions of the rhombohedral-NaSiCON were studied by varying the Na con-tent from Na4Zr2Si3O12 to Na1Zr2P3O12. To keep charge neutrality in Na4Zr2Si3O12 upon the “removal” of Na+ ions (i.e., addition of va-cancies), the Si4+ ions must also be substituted by P5+ ions. Hence, we used the so-called “coupled” CE model57 that constraints the con-centration of Si4+/P5+ to Na+/Va by utilizing a single “point” term (ζi) of Eq. 1. The point term in a CE typically sets µ and the presence of a single µ ensures charge neutrality of the under-lying NaSiCON within the CE. Given the large number of clusters available versus the num-ber of DFT-calculated conﬁgurations, we used the compressive sensing approach to determine the absolute values of the ECIs by employing α = 1.5 × 10−5 to penalize the L1-norm of the ECIs and minimize overﬁtting.58Di˙erent Na/Va and Si/P conﬁgurations were enumerated using the pymatgen package.59 The primitive cell of the experimental rhombohedral Na4Zr2Si3O12 structure60 (2 f.u., with 42 atoms) was used to enumerate the conﬁgurations in the possible Na concentration range (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) at a step-size, ∆x = 0.5. To keep the num-ber of possible conﬁgurations to a computa-tionally tractable level, we used an electrostatic ranking scheme based on the Ewald energy,61 where classical point charges are assigned to each species (Na= +1, Zr = +4, Si= +4, P= +5, and O= −2). We selected 500 struc-tures at each x with the lowest Ewald energies. We applied a similar enumeration and ranking procedure to obtain Na/Va and Si/P conﬁgura-tions in 2×1×1 supercells (4 f.u., with 84 atoms, equivalent to 1×2×1 and 1×1×2) of the prim-itive cell with a step-size, ∆x = 0.25. The ﬁ-nal number of structures considered in our DFT calculations was further reduced by considering only the symmetry inequivalent orderings. In total, we computed 1192 structurally and sym-metrically distinct orderings using DFT as im-plemented in VASP.62,63The exchange-correlation energy in DFT was approximated by the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) semi-local meta-generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional.64 The accuracy of SCAN has been demonstrated on oxides and phosphates,65–67 where SCAN has been shown not to overbind O2 gas, as is typical of GGA functionals.68
Wavefunctions were expanded in terms of a plane-wave basis set, truncated at a kinetic energy cut-o˙ of 520 eV and combined with projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials to describe the core electrons.69 The PAW po-tentials used were Na_pv 19Sep2006 2p63s1, Zr_sv 04Jan2005 4s24p64d25s2, Si 05Jan2001 3s23p2, P 06Sep2000 3s23p3 and O 08Apr2002 2s22p4. Total energies were integrated on a 3×3×3 Monkhorst-Pack grid70 for the primitive cells (while the k-point density was maintained for the larger supercells), and converged within 10−5 eV/cell, without preserving any symmetry. The atomic forces (and stresses) were converged to within 10−2 eV/Å (0.29 GPa).
The formation energy (Ef ) of each ordering, computed by DFT, is deﬁned with respect to the lowest energy end-member compositions, Na4Zr2Si3O12 and Na1Zr2P3O12, using Eq. 2 where E [Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12], E [Na4Zr2Si3O12] and E [Na1Zr2P3O12] are the DFT total ener-gies of each Na/Va + Si/P ordering, and the two end-members. Figure 2 plots the forma-tion energy vs. Na composition, which is the phase diagram of the rhombohedral-NaSiCON system at 0 K. The DFT formation energies are shown in orange whereas the formation en-ergies predicted by the CE model are shown in blue (Figure 2a). The convex envelopes of the structures with the lowest formation ener-gies —the convex hull— as predicted by DFT and CE are depicted by solid orange and solid blue lines, respectively. Importantly, the three lowest energy (or ground state) conﬁgurations that lie on both the DFT and CE hulls oc-cur at Na compositions of x = 0.0, 2.0, and 3.0, in agreement with experimental observa-tions.29,71 Thus, there should be a distinct, stable Na/Va (and Si/P) ordering corresponding to the x = 2.0 ground state conﬁguration, apart from the x = 0.0 and x = 3.0 end-members. The structures of the ordered ground-state con-ﬁgurations (the Na/Si/P orderings) that form the convex-hull are represented in Figures S3 and S4 of the SI.Note that the ground state at Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 (x = 2.0) distorts away from rhombo-hedral symmetry upon DFT structure re-laxation, which indicates the tendency for the rhombohedral-NaSiCON to transform into the stable low-temperature monoclinic-NaSiCON.29,37,72,73 It is worth mentioning that any attempt to resolve the Si/P disorder of the rhombohedral primitive cell at x = 2.0 reduces the symmetry to a monoclinic arrangement (space group C2/c) even prior geometry opti-misation, i.e., ordering the Si/P sites breaks the three-fold rotational symmetry of a rhombohe-dral system. Furthermore, we did not preserve the symmetry in any of our DFT structure re-laxations (i.e., impose only a primitive triclinic or P 1 symmetry). Nevertheless, preserving the symmetry during the DFT calculation leads to a negligible change in the energy of the ground state at x = 2.0 (∼ 0.274 meV/f.u.). Although the low-temperature monoclinic distortion ob-served experimentally exhibits the C2/c space group,29,37,72,74,75 this structure presents a rota-tional distortion of the ZrO6 octahedra in com-bination with disorder in the Si/P sites, which is not observed in our ground state structure at x = 2.0 (of Figures S3 and S4).In the case of x = 0, the ground-state struc-ture in Figure 2a is ordered and all the Na+ ions occupy the Na(1) position (Figures S3 and S4 in SI), in agreement with previous experimen-tal reports.29,72 The occupation of the Na(1) sites at low Na concentrations is driven predom-inantly by the higher electrostatic repulsion be-tween P5+ and Na+ ions compared to Zr4+ or Si4+, and the closer proximity of Na(2) sites to P5+ than Na(1). Therefore, any attempt for Na to occupy the Na(2) sites will increase the in-stability of these orderings at x = 0, x = 0.25 as shown in Figure 2a.In Figure 2a, most orderings in 2×1×1 super-cells exhibit higher formation energies than conﬁgurations within the primitive cell. For exam-ple, all the conﬁgurations that exhibit Ef < –50 meV/f.u. at x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 are orderings within the primitive cell.
Of the 1192 distinct orderings computed by DFT (Figure 2a), only 884 conﬁgurations were selected to ﬁt the CE model Hamiltonian. The reduction of our data set is due to the high (and expected) mobility of Na ions in spe-ciﬁc starting conﬁgurations, which causes Na ions to move from their initial positions dur-ing the structure relaxation to ﬁnal positions that are symmetrically equivalent to other ini-tial Na conﬁgurations. We removed selected structures, primarily at x = 0 and 0.25, whose high energies originate from the unfavourable ordering of Na in the structure while making the ﬁtting of the CE extremely challenging. The ECIs obtained via ﬁtting the CE to the DFT formation energies are depicted in Figure 3.The ECIs of Figure 3 are obtained by min-imizing the root mean square error (RMSE) against the DFT energies of all 884 conﬁgu-rations, which is ∼ 11.20 meV/f.u. (∼ 0.53 meV/atom), while minimizing the total mag-nitude of all ECIs to minimize overﬁtting.58 The transferability of the CE is assessed via the leave one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) score, which is ∼ 24.9 meV/f.u. (1.18 meV/atom). The 65 clusters with non-zero ECIs are listed in Table S2 of the SI.Of the 65 ECIs, 38 ECIs are pair interac-tions, 22 are triplets and 4 are quadruplets. In Figure 3, a negative ECI indicates “attrac-tive” interactions between Va for clusters built on Na/Va sites and P for clusters consisting of Si/P sites. Since the NaSiCON structure has both Na/Va and Si/P sites, attractive in-teractions are also extended to other species with the same occupational variable. Specif-ically, our CE model uses an identical notation for the occupation of Na/Si (σ = 0) and Va/P (σ = +1). Thus, a negative ECI on a Na/Va-Si/P pair translates to an attractive in-teraction that favors the occupation of Va (on the Na/Va site) and P (on the Si/P site). Sim-ilarly, positive ECIs indicate “repulsive” inter-actions between Va and P. Due to the speciﬁc assignment of σ = 0 for any Na/Si occupation, only clusters that are fully constituted by Va and/or by P contribute to non-zero ECIs to-wards the overall energy estimation in our CE model. The dominant pair and triplet terms in Figure 3, i.e., highest absolute magnitude ECI, are the repulsive pair cluster #34 (Na/Va-Na/Va of length ∼ 7.40 Å), the attractive pair cluster #65 (Na/Va-Na/Va, ∼ 9.19 Å), and the triplet cluster #92 (Na/Va-Na/Va-Na/Va, ∼ 4.72 Å), respectively. All dominant pair, triplet and quadruplet interactions within our CE model are listed in Tables S3, S4 and S5 of the SI.Remarkably, our CE model captures some im-portant physics of the system. For example, the attractive pair #6 (in Figure S1 of the SI) fa-vors Va located within the cluster formed by one Na(1) and one Na(2) site, separated by a length ∼ 3.162 Å within the primitive rhombo-hedral cell. However, a larger (∼ 6.52 Å) pair cluster #27 (in Figure S1 of the SI) with Na(1) and Na(2) sites is repulsive, which favors either a Na-Va or a Na-Na occupation within the pair. Thus, the interplay between pair #6 and #27 indicates the competition between short-range vs. long-range ordering phenomena in the struc-ture. Furthermore, the most dominant triplet is ECI #92, is repulsive, penalizes the Va-Va-Va occupation and consists of one Na(1) and two Na(2) sites within the primitive cell (size < 4.73 Å), see Table S2 in SI. Hence, ECI #92 captures the rather strong short-range interac-tion between symmetrically distinct Na sites, i.e., Na(1) and Na(2) (as elucidated in Sec-tion 3.5). Also, the triplet ECI #92 likely acts in conjunction with pairs #27 and #6 (both involving Na(1) and Na(2) sites) to favour a Va-Na-Na conﬁguration on the Na(1)-Na(2)-Na(2) sites, which is the underlying motif of the ground state at x = 2 at 0 K (see Fig-ure 2a and Section 3.5). Finally, the quadru-plet ECIs #113 and #118 are attractive, span across Na/Va and Si/P sites, and favour occu-pations of Va-Va-Va-P and Va-Va-P-P, respec-tively, which likely indicate the electrostatic at-traction between Va and P species.The error in formation energies predicted by the CE expansion model are compared with the energy above the convex hull in Figure 2b, with two regions of conﬁdences, ±10 and ±20 eV/f.u.(dashed lines). Importantly, the CE repro-duces well the DFT formation energies within ∼ 100 meV/f.u. above the convex hull line. In Figure 2b, points near 0 meV/f.u. on the hori-zontal axis represent a perfect ﬁt with the DFT data, whereas points beyond ±20 meV/f.u. can be considered poorly described by the model. Most of the formation energies predicted by the CE model lie within the ±20 meV/f.u. window, which indicates that the CE can also reproduce the formation energies of several high energy conﬁgurations accurately.
Using large simulation cells (172,032 atoms) with GCMC, we can coarse-grain76 the grand-canonical potential at any Na(Va)/Si(P) con-centration and temperature. The tempera-ture vs. Na-composition phase diagram of the rhombohedral Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, as obtained via GCMC simulations, is shown in Figure 4. The CE method has been proved very accu-rate in the prediction of Na chemical poten-tials (and voltages) in electrode materials,77,78 which indicates that our methodology is reli-able in predicting the useful ranges of µNa in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12. The phase boundaries of Figure 4 are identiﬁed by analyzing the grand-canonical potential energies, the discontinuities of Na concentration (vs. µ), and the variation of the heat capacity (vs. µ). Numerical hysteresis arising from the GCMC was removed by per-forming a free-energy integration (see Section S4 and Figure S2 of the SI).76 A representative snapshot of GCMC simulations is provided in Figure S3.The phase diagram in Figure 4 contains four single-phase (or monophasic) regions, which are labelled as A (yellow), B (green) C (dark purple) and C’ (light purple), with three two-phase (or biphasic) regions separating the monophasic domains. The biphasic regions are A+B (red dome between 0 < x < 2, T < 650 K), A+C’ (orange dome, T > 650 K), and B+C (blue dome between 2 < x < 3). The monophasic regions can be described as, A: Na-poor domain, similar to the rhombohedral-Na1Zr2P3O12; C: Na-rich domain, similar to Na4Zr2Si3O12; B: high-conductivity domain based on the Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 conﬁguration, which is the target composition in experimental studies; and C’: a high-temperature disordered domain that encompasses both Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 and Na4Zr2Si3O12 regions. Experimentally the Na/Va and Si/P lattices in rhombohedral-NaSiCON are known to disorder in the com-position range 1 < x < 3 (i.e., excluding the end members) and at high temperatures (> 473 K),9,32,33,33,72,84 in qualitative agreement with our predicted phase diagram.In the case of the B-phase (green domain in Figure 4), at temperatures < 150 K, phase B is only stable at near x = 2, but its sta-ble composition range increases progressively with increasing temperature to a maximum range of 1.25 ≤ x ≤ 2.5 at 650 K. The region of stability of the B-phase also over-laps with the composition (1.8 ≤ x ≤ 2.2) and temperature (< 415 K) where the rhom-bohedral structure transforms into the mono-clinic polymorph in experiments.29,30,72 Thus, the presence of the B-phase may facilitate the well-known rhombohedral-to-monoclinic tran-sition. At temperatures above 650 K, a high-temperature disordered phase C’ appears, which encompasses both the B and C monopha-sic regions. The miscibility gap that sepa-rates the B and C monophasic regions (blue dome in Figure 4), reaches its critical point at x = 2.5 and 650 K. The transition from the high-temperature disordered C’ phase to the miscibility gap (i.e., the B+C two phase re-gion) represents a ﬁrst-order phase transition, and marked by the dashed black line at 650 K.The experimental compositions, which are assigned to single-phase regions and deter-mined from X-ray and neutron di˙raction mea-surements, are shown as red stars in Fig-ure 4.40,60,72,79–83 Most experimentally observed compositions are found in the single phase re-gions of A, B, C or C’, and in good agree-ment with our calculated phase diagram. Ex-ceptions are reported single-phase structures at x = 2.—2.3 at 443 K, x = 0.1 and 2.35 at 300 K,33 and x = 1 at 473 K.40 Although most of the disagreements with experimentally reported single-phase compositions lie at (or near) the predicted phase boundaries, the mea-sured, low temperature data point at x = 2.35, 300 K signiﬁcantly deviates from our predic-tions. Notably, the experimental literature, so far, on Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 has never reported any phase separation in this system. 
The DFT-calculated volumes (panel a) and lat-tice constants a and c (panel b) of the vari-ous conﬁgurations as a function of the Na com-position are shown in Figure 5. Stars repre-sent experimentally reported values of volumes, lattice constants and c/a ratio,29,32,33,60,79–84 while dots, squares and triangles are the DFT-predicted values. The color of each point in Figure 5 is associated with its energy above the convex hull (Figure 2a), with darker blue (lighter white) indicating structures that are near (far away from) the convex hull. The black-dashed lines connect volumes, lattice con-stants and c/a ratio of structures forming the convex hull.29,32,33,43,85Moving from x = 0 to x = 2 in Figure 5a, the predicted volume increases monotonically with a maximum at x = 2 (Na3Zr2Si2P1O12), in excellent agreement with experimental reports (distribution of stars). Although DFT calcula-tions do not capture the e˙ect of temperature, the agreement between theory and experiments on lattice volumes can be attributed to the low thermal expansion (< 5%, 11.8×10−6 ◦C−1) with increasing temperature (over a wide tem-perature range, i.e., 25 < T < 700 ◦C) of NaSi-CON.60,79In the case of lattice parameters (Figure 5b), we observe that the a parameter increases monotonically with increasing Na content, while the c parameter increases for 0 < x < 2 and decreases for x > 2, in excellent agree-ment with experimental studies.29,33 As the Na content increases in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 in the range 0 < x < 2, the Na+ are displaced from Na(1) into Na(2) sites (Figure 6d, e and f). The reduced occupation of Na(1) sites facili-tates the electrostatic repulsion between ZrO6 units stacked along the c direction, resulting in an increase in the c parameter.Importantly, we predict a mild volume con-traction (∼ 1%, panel a) for x > 2, in agreement with experimental observations that Na4Zr2Si3O12 has a lower volume than Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 (∼ 1% smaller) due to a con-traction of the c axis (panel b).79 The reduction of the c/a ratio with increasing Na concentra-tion (Figure 5c) captures the typical behavior of the rhombohedral-NaSiCON as the Na con-tent is varied (stars in panel c).
The GCMC data enable the analysis of relevant thermodynamic properties, e.g., the Gibbs en-ergy (G, orange dots and lines) and the con-ﬁgurational entropy (S, green dots and lines) functions. These are shown in Figure 6, for 3 distinct temperatures, a 445 K, b 625 K, and c 905 K centered around the B+C→C’ tran-sition (∼ 650 K). Note that the Gibbs ener-gies are referenced to the ground state end-member conﬁgurations, namely Na1Zr2P3O12 and Na4Zr2Si3O12. Panels d-f in Figure 6 show the extent of occupation of Na(1) (blue dots and lines) and Na(2) (red dots and lines) by Na+ vs. x at three temperatures, where a fully Naoccupied site (fully empty) has an occupancy of 1.0 (0.0). Notably, the occupation values are obtained as statistical averages from GCMC simulations. Also, the multiplicity of Na(2) is three times that of Na(1), i.e., there are three Na(2) sites for every Na(1). Dashed lines in all panels of Figure 6 indicate thermodynamic properties and Na occupancies within biphasic regions.An increasing temperature typically decreases G, which is consistent with the more negative Gibbs energies at 905 K compared to 445 K in Figure 6. While S depends strongly on the tem-perature, the value of S at a given x depends on the number of accessible conﬁgurations at that composition. For example, S(x = 3) = 0 at all temperatures since there are no conﬁg-urational degrees of freedom available at the Na4Zr2Si3O12 composition, i.e., no conﬁgura-tions lie above the convex hull at this composi-tion (Figure 2).Below the B+C→C’ transition (445 and 625 K), S(x) shows three distinct segments for the three monophasic regions A, B and C, with three minima of S(x) (and G(x)) located at the 0 K ground state compositions, namely, x = 0, 2, and 3. The higher entropy observed for other compositions away from the 0 K ground states is indicative of the higher conﬁgurational dis-order within the Na/Va and Si/P sub-lattices. Importantly, the minima in entropy at x ∼ 2 (within the B monophasic region) at 625 K and 445 K correlates with the Na occupancies of the Na(1) and Na(2) sites (Figures 6d-f, see discus-sion below). At 905 K (beyond the B+C→C’ transition), S(x) shows two distinct segments, corresponding to the A and C’ monophasic re-gion. The minima in G(x) (and S(x)) at x = 2 is driven by a minima in enthalpy already dis-cussed in Figure 2 —a reﬂection of the stable ordering which enhances the chemical bonding at this composition.Unraveling the distribution of Na among the Na(1) and Na(2) sites sheds light on the Na-ion transport in NaSiCON phases, which is still not fully understood.37 From Figures 6d-f, we note that for x = 0, Na(1) is fully occupied and Na(2) is empty at all temperatures, in agreement with previous reports indicating that Na1Zr2P3O12 is a fully ordered phase, with Na occupying only Na(1).71,79 Similarly, at x = 3, both Na(1) and Na(2) sites are fully occupied, in agreement with the observations of Hong et al.29 Interestingly, within the monophasic A re-gion (x = 0 to x ∼ 1) at 905 K, the occupation of Na(2) increases with increasing x, while Na(1) remains fully occupied (Figure 6f).At higher sodium contents, i.e., x > 2 (within C’), the occupation of Na(1) increases monoton-ically towards 1.0 at x = 3, while the occupa-tion of Na(2) remains roughly constant (∼ 1.0). However, at intermediate Na contents (x ∼ 1.25 to x ∼ 1.75), the occupancies of Na(2) and Na(1) show contrasting trends with increasing Na content, i.e., as Na(2) sites are occupied by Na, Na(1) sites become unoccupied. This si-multaneous occupation and un-occupation of Na(2) and Na(1) sites results in a decrease of conﬁgurational entropy (Figure 6c), which eventually reaches a minima at x ∼ 1.75.Similar trends in Na(1) and Na(2) occu-pancies at intermediate Na concentrations can also be observed below the B+C→C’ transi-tion (panels d and e in Figure 6), in agree-ment with the trends reported by Boilot and Collin (starts in panels d and e).33 Notably, the Na(1) sites become empty at Na compositions of 1.5 < x < 2 within the B domain (at 445 K and 625 K), whereas the Na(1) site is never fully empty in C’ with the minimum in occupation reaching at x ∼ 1.75. Also, the Na sites are completely ordered, i.e., Na(2) is fully occupied and Na(1) is fully empty, at x = 2 within the B-phase, whereas complete ordering does not occur at x = 2 within the high-temperature C’ phase, underlying the key di˙erence between the B and C’ monophasic regions. Thus, Na oc-cupying the Na(1) sites is the primary mecha-nism of inducing conﬁgurational disorder in the NaSiCON structure as the system transitions from ordered B to disordered C’, particularly at x = 2. Additionally, the complete ordering at x = 2 in B corresponds to the minima in entropy observed at 445 K and 625 K at x = 2 (Figure 6a-b).
Understanding the thermodynamic proper-ties of the rhombohedral Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, and NaSiCON systems in general, is of im-portance for the development of inexpen-sive solid electrolytes and electrode mate-rials for novel Na-ion batteries. We have systematically analyzed the phase-diagram of rhombohedral-Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 by com-bining ﬁrst-principles calculations, the clus-ter expansion formalism, and Monte Carlo simulations. The computational investiga-tion of the monoclinic phase diagram of Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 requires knowledge of the end-member structures at Na = 1 and Na = 4, which are only found experimentally in the rhombohedral arrangement. This lack of infor-mation curbs the prediction of the monoclinic phase diagram.The computed phase diagram of Figure 4 re-veals the presence of two main regions charac-terized by biphasic behavior, which are: i) the A+B region that stretches through Na compo-sitions 0 < x < 2 at low temperatures (below 200 K) and narrows in composition range with increasing temperature, ii) the miscibility gap, B+C, in the region 2 < x < 3 between 0 and ∼ 650 K. Our result is in stark contrast with ex-perimental literature, which indicates a single phase behavior across the whole region of ac-cessible Na compositions (i.e., 0 ≤ x ≤ 3) and temperatures (> 450 K, beyond the region of monoclinic phase stability).9,30,32,33,39,40,72 The phase diagram also displays four monophasic regions —A, B, C and C’, with B spanning a noticeably increasing range of Na concentra-tions with increasing temperature. Note that Zr o˙-stoichiometry is often observed in the rhombohedral-Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, with resid-ual ZrO2 found after high-temperature synthe-sis and sintering treatments.9,31,39,40,86Our computed phase diagram does not ac-count for Zr o˙-stoichiometry, and the inclu-sion of an additional compositional axis would make this study intractable in terms of com-putational complexity. However, Boilot et al.32 conﬁrmed that Na migration in vacant Zr sites is impeded, indicating that Zr deﬁciency is less relevant for optimizing the Na-conductivity of this material.Few experimental reports have targeted the structural characterization of rhombohedral-Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 at Na compositions 0 < x < 2 or 2 < x < 3.29,40 Notably, most of the early characterization work on rhombohedral Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 used single crystal sam-ples with x ≥ 2,30,33,72,74,87 which were mostly reﬁned according to the structural model of Hong.29 While single-crystal X-ray di˙raction (XRD) experiments are undoubtedly useful in understanding the structural properties of this material, they may hinder the observation of phase separation in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, in par-ticular, across Na-rich and Na-poor composi-tion domains (e.g., A+B and B+C in Fig-ure 4), resulting in the lack of identiﬁcation of unique mono or biphasic domains. For this purpose, advanced powder X-ray or neutron di˙raction experiments are required since they should identify phase separation and reveal all the crystalline phases that would eventually coexist in a given sample. Di˙erential scanning calorimetry can also be used to identify the well-documented, albeit weak rhombohedral-to-monoclinic phase transition,9,40,88 but phase separation has not been observed so far in the rhombohedral phase.Recent bench31 and synchrotron40 powder XRD studies demonstrated unequivocally that the low temperature Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 com-positions behave as a single phase, in con-trast to our predictions. For example, Deng et al.40 reported a single phase at Na2Zr2Si1P2O12 at temperatures of 295 and 473 K, which is in the middle of the A+B two-phase re-gion (Figure 4). The disagreement in terms of phase stabilities at low temperatures (< 500 K) between the theory-predicted ther-modynamics (suggesting phase-separation) and experimental reports (indicating single-phase behavior) can be also attributed to kinetic factors. For example, at low temperatures (∼ 300 K), our predicted phase diagram sug-gests that Na3.5Zr2Si1P2O12(C’) will phase sep-arate into a mixture of Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 (B) and Na4Zr2Si3O12 (C). This requires the disordered SiO44– and PO43– ions in the high temperature C’ phase to be redistributed in order to form the stable B and C phases. The redistribution of the SiO44– and PO43–, which requires macro-scopic di˙usion of multivalent Si4+ and P5+ ions, would involve high activation barriers that are inaccessible at the lower temperatures to ensure full phase separation.89 We veriﬁed this unsurmountable energetic cost for Si4+ and P5+ reorganization by computing the migration bar-rier of P5+ in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, which results larger than ∼ 4.02 eV (Figure S5 in SI). How-ever, it remains to be veriﬁed experimentally (which we will do in the near future) whether prolonged annealing treatments at intermediate temperatures can promote phase separation in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12.Biphasic behavior is typical in NaSiCON-based electrodes. For example, Delmas et al.42 detected phase separation of the rhom-bohedral electrode Na2Ti2(PO4)3 when cooled, leading to the formation of Na3Ti2(PO4)3 and Na1Ti2(PO4)3. For NaSiCON-electrodes with a single transition metal (e.g., M = Ti, V, Cr and Fe in NaxM2(PO4)3), the existence of two-phase domains is also observed in electrochemical ex-periments, whereby the Na-discharge voltage proﬁle exhibits a ﬂat plateau as Na intercalates in the electrode (see Figure 7).42,47Notably, mechanisms of phase separation in single-transition-metal NaSiCON-electrodes do not involve modiﬁcations of the structural framework since phase separation occurs across Na compositions (i.e., the formation of Na-rich and Na-poor domain) and bond break-ing/reforming involving framework atoms (e.g., Ti, V, Cr or Fe) is not required, as transition metals do not have to di˙use macroscopically. In other words, the mobile Na+ and the accom-panying electrons can be redistributed swiftly even at low temperatures (∼ 300 K) to ensure phase separation. Interestingly, previous stud-ies have claimed that the thermodynamically favorable phase-separation was curbed in mixed transition-metal NaSiCON systems. For exam-ple, in Na2ZrCr(PO4)3 the phase separation re-action, 2Na2ZrCr(PO4)3 → NaZr2(PO4)3 + Na3Cr2(PO4)3, is inhibited by the slow ki-netics of bond-breaking/reforming Zr O and Cr O bonds and the poor macroscopic di˙u-sivity of Zr4+ and Cr3+.42 Notably, phase sep-aration of Na2ZrCr(PO4)3 was not observed even after prolonged annealing treatments at high temperatures. Thus, the thermodynami-cally favored phase separation in rhombohedral-Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 may also be kinetically in-hibited, similar to the mixed transition-metal NaSiCON systems.44To illustrate explicitly the similarity between the phase-separation behavior identiﬁed in this work in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 and as observed in NaSiCON electrodes, we schematically super-impose our computed phase diagram (around 295 K) onto the experimental voltage curves of the Na3Ti2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3Cr2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3 in Figure 7.Similarly to Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 all the elec-trode materials of Figure 7, i.e., Na3Ti2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3Cr2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3 crystallise in the rhombohedral structure at x = 0 and x = 3 and distort into a mono-clinic form at x = 2.73 Furthermore, the octa-hedrally coordinated transition-metals involved in the redox couples of these NaSICON elec-trode materials are not prone to Jahn-Teller distortions,90 thus making our comparison with Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 appropriate.Figure 7 shows that as Na is inserted/extracted into/from NaM2(PO4)3/Na3M2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, V, Cr and Fe), the materials always phase separate for Na concentrations in the range 0 < x < 2. Nax+1V2(PO4)3 also phase sepa-rates between Na concentrations of 2 < x < 3. Figure 7 identiﬁes that at composition x = 2 a stable phase (or structure/conﬁguration) is always found and appears to be common to all NaSiCON-based electrodes, analogous to Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12. Intriguingly, at low tem-perature and at x = 2 all of the Na(2) sites in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 are occupied while the Na(1) sites have negligible occupations, similar to trends observed in Figure 6.29,33,84 On the ba-sis of our entropy curves of Figure 6, we believe that the tendency for Na to order at composi-tion x = 2 in Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3Cr2(PO4)3 and Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 is signiﬁcant, and eventually drives the rhombohedral to monoclinic (and their superstructures) phase transition at room temperature.29,73,91In light of these ﬁndings one can formulate the following hypothesis:
Phase separation appears to be the un-derlying favorable thermodynamic pro-cess in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, but is inhib-ited by the large energy barrier involved in the rearrangement of the SiO44– and PO43– species.Phase separation is fully or partially in-hibited, kinetically, whenever cations of the M2(PO4)3 framework are required to break bonds, migrate and form new bonds. Analogous to the kinetic impedi-ment to phase separation observed for the solid electrolyte Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, par-tial replacement of SiO44– and PO43– may also kinetically limit any phase sepa-ration in mono-transition metal elec-trodes. Other “network formers”, such as SiS44– and PS43– found in Li-ion con-ductors may provide similar e˙ects.92In both the solid electrolyte and NaSiCON-electrodes, the existence of a stable ordering of Na-ions on the Na(2) site at the x = 2 composition is a com-mon feature. The stability of the fully occupied Na(2) plus fully empty Na(1) conﬁguration might be electrostatically driven (see Section 4.2) and requires fur-ther exploration. As is well established in the literature, at low temperatures, this peculiar Na conﬁguration seems to promote the phase transition from rhom-bohedral into monoclinic symmetry, with the rhombohedral→monoclinic transfor-mation mechanism needing more work to understand fully.
The validation of these hypotheses and their extension to all NaSiCON-derived electrodes requires further experimental and computa-tional investigations. In particular, the inter-play of structural and electronic structure effects needs attention. Importantly, the redis-tribution of octahedrally coordinated cations in mixed transition-metal NaSiCONs, e.g. Ti and Fe in NaxTiFe(PO4)3, may be subject to di˙erent mechanisms than our predictions for Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 
The bulk ionic conductivity of Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 is set by the occupations of Na(1) and Na(2) sites,31,33,35,37 which enables Na+ percolation along Na(1)–Na(2)–Na(1) paths. While Zhang et al.37 investigated the existence of a 3rd Na site, Na(3), located between Na(1) and Na(2); Na(3) is negligibly occupied at high temper-atures 200 < T < 800◦C, hence not relevant to the thermodynamics. Occupancies of Na(1) and Na(2) sites are in turn determined by the distribution of SiO44– and PO43– groups, in order to maintain “local” charge-neutrality within the rhombohedral-Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12, an aspect that has been rarely discussed in prior exper-imental reports. Furthermore, the higher mo-bility of Na enables Na+ ions to adopt energy minimizing conﬁgurations, given a Si/P ar-rangement. Thus, the interplay of local charge neutrality, the short and long-range cluster in-teractions among the Na(1) and Na(2) sites, and Na+ mobility will control the experimen-tally observed population of Na sites at di˙erent Na concentrations.The GCMC data showed that the occupation of the Na(1) site decreases from x = 0 to x = 2, and increases monotonically between x = 2 and x = 3 below the B+C→C’ transition (see Fig-ure 6). For site Na(2), we observe a constant in-crease of its occupation in the range 0 < x < 2, while Na(2) remains fully occupied for x > 2. The trends in occupancies of Na(1) and Na(2) sites are in excellent agreement with the exper-imental study of Boilot et al.33 The selective occupation of Na(2) sites at x ∼ 2 can be at-tributed to the shorter distance between Na(2) sites and XO4 tetrahedra, where the increasing occupation of Si in the XO4 units with increasing x can electrostatically favour Na occupation of Na(2) sites.It is well known that a ﬂat energy land-scape is beneﬁcial for ion migration,93–95 which indicates that the initial and ﬁnal migration sites should also have comparable energies. In Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12, Na ions migrate between Na(1) and Na(2) sites, and the resultant mi-gration barrier is related to the energy di˙er-ence between the Na(1) and Na(2) sites when they are occupied by Na. To quantify this as-pect, we plot the minimum absolute di˙erence in electrostatic energies (∆E), based on the classical Ewald summation, between the ground state (GS) structures and “excited” state (ES) structures in Figure 8, at x = 0, 2, and 3. Note that the GS structures are the ground state Na/Si/P conﬁgurations at x = 0 and 2 (see Figure 6), while at x = 3, the GS is the DFT ground state with a Na vacancy. The corresponding ES conﬁgurations involve swap-ping the Na atom/vacancy with an “adjacent” Na(1)/Na(2) site.
eV/f.u. at x = 3) Na content, signifying high migration barriers for Na transport. In con-trast, min[∆E] is low at x = 2 (∼ 0.14 eV/f.u.), signifying a ﬂat electrostatic energy landscape that may correspond to a low Na migration bar-rier as well, which is consistent with previous experiments reporting the highest Na+ conduc-tivity in the range 2 ≤ x ≤ 2.5.33 While our preliminary analysis does not capture the ge-ometric and bonding e˙ects during Na migra-tion, it should be useful in providing a quali-tative guideline of how Na migration barriers (and Na conductivity) vary with Na concentra-tion in the NaSICON system considered here. However, it remains to be seen how speciﬁc con-ﬁgurations of Na/Va and Si/P a˙ect the micro-scopic migration barriers that govern the overall Na-transport. Hence, it is important to extend our model by incorporating migration barriers, as a function of Na content and temperature, which will be the focus of future work.
We investigated the phase stability of the high-temperature Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 ionic conduc-tor using a multi-scale approach based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, a cluster expansion framework, and large-size Monte Carlo simula-tions. We observed excellent agreement with DFT predicted structural properties, namely lattice volumes, c and a parameters, with ex-isting measurements. Additionally, we found that the selective occupation of Na(2) sites in-stead of Na(1) sites drives the stability of the Na3Zr2Si2P1O12 ground state, particularly at low temperatures.The computed phase diagram suggests that Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 would phase separate into three distinct single-phase domains at low tem-perature, in contrast with experimental ob-servations so far. Kinetic limitations, specif-ically the macroscopic di˙usion of Si4+ and P5+ ions, may inhibit the phase separation into Na+Si-rich and Va+P-rich domains in experi-ments. We identiﬁed similarities in phase be-havior between the NaSiCON-electrolyte and mono-transition-metal NaSiCON electrodes, which typically phase separate upon Na ex-traction/insertion. Interestingly, the lack of phase separation observed in mixed-transition-metal NaSiCON electrodes may be attributed to kinetic limitations, similar to the scenario in Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12. Therefore, we speculated that the introduction of SiO44– into phosphate-based electrodes can inhibit kinetically phe-nomena of phase separation.Based on our phase diagram, we also un-veiled the complex interplay betwen Na sites occupancy at di˙erent temperatures and elec-trostatic. With this understanding, we could identify and explain why experimentally only speciﬁc compositions o˙ers high Na-transport. Our work o˙ers important insights on the role of Na-Va and Si-P conﬁgurations on the stabil-ity and Na-transport properties of NaSiCON-electrolytes and will be an important addition in the development of safe and sustainable Na-ion batteries.
