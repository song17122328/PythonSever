Three types of Nasicon-type materials, Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7, Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7, and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7, were synthesized as mixed-phase catalysts (MPCs) for evaluating their potential as new photocatalytic candidates (called Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7mpc, Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc, and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc herein). Based on various physical properties, it was conﬁrmed that there are two phases, M3(PO4)2 and M2P2O7, in which a similar phase equilibrium energy coexists. These colored powders showed UV and visible light responses suitable to our aim of developing 365-nm light-response photocatalysts for overall water-splitting. The photocatalytic performance of Ni2(PO4)3-Ni2P2O7 MPC showed negligible or no activity toward H2 evolution. However, Co2(PO4)3-Co2P2O7 MPC and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7 MPC were determined as interesting materials because of their ability to absorb visible light within a suitable band. Moreover, an internal interface charge transfer was suggested to occur that would lower the recombination rate of electrons and holes. For Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7 MPC, the charge separation between the electron and hole was advantageously achieved, a water-splitting reaction was promoted, and hydrogen generation was considerably increased. The performance of a catalyst depended on the nature of the active metal added. In addition, the performance of the catalyst was improved when electrons migrated between the inter-phases despite the lack of a heterojunction with other crystals.


Since the hydrogen production performance of a TiO2 photocatalyst was ﬁrst reported by Honda-Fujishima [1–4], numerous studies have been conducted to improve the performance of photocatalysts using eﬃcient light harvesting. As a result, researchers have concluded that if electrons and holes generated by light can be advantageously separated, their recombination could be delayed to increase the frequency of participation in the oxidation-reduction reaction occurring at the interface between the catalyst and reactant [5,6]. To slow down the recombination of electrons and holes, several methods are available, including a one-step excitation system [7], a photosensitized semiconductor system [8], a two-step excitation semiconductor heterojunction system [9], and a Z-scheme system [10]. Catalysts based on such systems have achieved unexpectedly good results, and many related studies have been published [11–13].


Nasicon-type materials such as metal phosphate particles, which are relatively small with a bandgap of approximately 2–3 eV compared to TiO2, have recently attracted the interest of a few researchers [17,18]. In general, Nasicon is a crystalline solid of A1B2(PO4)3, where A is a monovalent cation and B is a single ion or a combination of tri-, tetra-, and penta-atomic ions. Here, the monovalent A ions can move within the lattice with low activation energy [19]. During the early 1980s, Susman et al. succeeded in synthesizing a compound with a formula of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 < x < 3) [20], and because Na, Zr, and Si ions exhibit unique ion conductivity by substituting other elements, this compound has been widely applied as a secondary battery material [21,22]. To date, many ion-exchanged derivatives and substituted Nasicon frameworks are known, e.g., AM2(PO4)3 (A = Na, Ca, Sr, Ba; M = Ti, Mo). These structural-type materials consist of a three-dimensional network made up of PO4 tetrahedra, sharing corners with MO6 octahedra and forming interconnected tunnels, where M+ (Na+, K+, Ag+) or oxygen ions have freedom of movement [23]. During a photocatalytic reaction, the transfer of electrons through the formation of interconnected tunnels or the transfer of oxygen atoms can increase the adsorption of the reactants, eﬀectively isolating the photo-induced charge, and consequently contributing to an improved photoactivity [24]. As examples, Fu, et al. reported the photocatalytic activity of MgTi4(PO4)6 and CaTi4(PO4)6 glass-ceramics containing Nasicon-type crystals [25], and Palla et al. suggested the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes with Sn2+and Ag+-substituted K3Nb3WO9(PO4)2 under visible light irradiation [26]. However, this remains in the early stage of research, and has thus, not shown a remarkable catalytic activity. Thus, in this study, M3(PO4)2 particles as Nasicon-type materials were prepared by binding phosphate ions to a Co, Ni, or Cu metal in a divalent oxidation state with 7, 8, and 9 electrons in a 3d-orbit of the transition metal. These particles were used as a water-splitting catalyst to compare their hydrogen production performance.


An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was conducted on Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc as a representative catalyst, the results of which are shown in Figure 3. The peaks at binding energies of 935.7, 133.1 and 530.6 eV refer to the Cu2p3/2, P2p3/2 and O1s spectra, respectively. All core peaks in Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc were recorded, and as shown in Figure 3, the core peak of Cu2p showed two main spin-orbit components at 935.7 and 955.6 eV, corresponding to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p3/2, which conﬁrmed the presence of Cu2+ [34]. Two peaks located at 942.5 and 962.5 eV are the “shake up” satellite peaks of Cu2p. The high-resolution spectra of P2p show two main spin-orbit components at 133.1 and 134.8 eV, corresponding to Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p3/2, respectively, thereby conﬁrming the presence of P5+. The O1s regions for Cu3(PO4)2 located at 530.6 and 532.4 eV are assigned to the M–O–P and P–O–P bonds, respectively [35]. In particular, a peak at 532.5 eV is shown, which was assigned to the P = O of Cu2P2O7 [36]. This is similar to the XRD result, and it was concluded that Cu3(PO4)2 coexists with the Cu2P2O7 phase in Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc.


By contrast, electrons exciting from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) are recombined with holes, and photoluminescence (PL) is a useful method for predicting the degree of recombination. The PL results for the three samples when the electrons are excited by light with a wavelength of 365 nm are shown in Figure 5. The photoluminescence spectra observed at a 365 nm excitation were found to be dependent on both the structural type and the transition metal ions. The PL spectra of Co3(PO4)2-Co2P2O7mpc, excited at 365 nm, show only one strong broad emission band centered at approximately 440 nm. It has been fairly accepted that cobalt exists mostly in a divalent state with two coordinations, namely, octahedral and tetrahedral [43]. A Co2+ ion has a d7 electronic conﬁguration, and in a tetrahedral crystal ﬁeld, presents the splitting of energy levels of a d3 electronic conﬁguration in an octahedral ﬁeld. In octahedral coordination (Co2+), the free ion ground state 4F splits into 4T1, 4T2, and 4A2 states with the 4T1 state being the lowest. In a tetrahedral symmetry, the energy levels of Co2+ ions are 4T2(4F), 4T1(4F), 2E(2G), and 4T1(4P), with a ground state of 4A2(4F).


In general, eﬀectively separated charges have shown a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the photoactivity of a catalyst [49]. If the excited electrons ﬂow well on the surface of the catalyst without loosening (that is if the electron and hole are separated well), the reduction reaction in CB and the oxidation reaction in VB will be maintained, and the photocatalytic activity will avoid deterioration. Here, the photocurrent density of the three catalysts was measured, the results of which are shown in Figure 6. For the photocurrent density cycle, the sample to be measured was prepared as a paste and coated onto a cell-type FTO glass. This cell was used as a working electrode, and a Pt-coated FTO glass was used as a counter electrode. The two electrodes were connected to form a single system. An iodolyte electrolyte (AN-50, Solarnonix) was used and suﬃciently immersed in the electrode, and a potential of 0 V was applied. The current was measured while illuminating one sunlight of a 2000 solar simulator (IVIUM STAT, ABET Technologies). After the initial 1 min stabilization period, the current was measured repeatedly after the light was applied and removed at intervals of 30 s. The cell area (0.4 cm2) was divided by the measured current, and the current density was ﬁnally calculated.


During the water-splitting reaction, the potentials of the CB and VB of the semiconductors are essential to the electron transfer mechanism, and thus, the photocatalytic performance. To establish an energy potential diagram of Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc particles, the VB spectra were obtained from an XPS analysis, the results of which are shown in Figure 8A. The VB of Cu3(PO4)2 and Cu2P2O7 was found to be 2.48 and 1.20 eV, respectively.


The synthesis procedures of the M3(PO4)2-M2P2O7mpc particles are shown in Figure 9, the speciﬁc method of which is as follows: Water in the solvent was placed in an Erlenmeyer ﬂask, and metal nitrates (99.95%, Co(NO3)2·xH2O, Ni(NO3)2·xH2O, Cu(NO3)2·xH2O, Junsei Co., Tokyo, Japan) were quantitatively added and uniformly stirred for 1 h until completely dissolved. Sodium hydrogen phosphate (99%, Na2HPO4, Junsei Co., Japan) as a phosphate source was added such that the ratio of metal to PO4 was 3:2, followed by stirring for 2 h. The chemical reaction at this time was MNO3 + Na2HPO4 → MHPO4 + Na2NO3, and the amorphous MHPO4 was precipitated. The precipitate was washed and then dried at 70 C for 24 h. The dried powder was sintered in an electric furnace at C for 4 h under air conditions. At this time, a chemical reaction occurred as 6MHPO4 + 3/2O2 → 700 2M3(PO4)2 + 3H2O, and ﬁnally, we obtained the three types of crystallized Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7mpc, Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc, and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc particles.


The photocatalytic decomposition of DI water was carried out using a liquid photoreactor prepared in our laboratory, as shown in Figure 10. First, the photocatalytic decomposition of an aqueous solution without scavengers using a UV light source was conducted using a Pyrex reactor. Next, 1.0 L of distilled water was placed into the reactor, and 0.5 g of synthesized Co3(PO4)2-Co2P2O7mpc, Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc, and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc catalyst powder was added. The light was irradiated using a UV lamp (3× 6 cm2 = 18 W cm2, length of 30 cm, a diameter of 2.0 cm, Shinan, Pochon, Korea) at a wavelength of 365 nm, and the reaction was conducted for a total of 10 h. To investigate the oxidation states of the Cu2p, P2p, and O1s components and the valence band values of the prepared sample, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (AXIS Nov, Kratos, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used. The resulting gas was analyzed through gas chromatography (GC, DS7200, Donam Co., Gwangju, Korea). For the GC conditions, a thermal conductivity detector and a Carboxen-1000 column (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) were applied, along with injection, oven, and detector temperatures of 423, 393 and 473 K, respectively.


This study focused on improving the performance of the catalyst by promoting the charge transfer through the internal interface without heterojunctions between other crystals. Metal (Co, Ni, and Cu) phosphates having 3d7, 3d8, and 3d9 valence electrons were prepared and their photocatalytic activities were compared during a water-splitting reaction. An XRD analysis conﬁrmed that the monoclinic octahedral structured Co3(PO4)2, Ni3(PO4)2, and Cu3(PO4)2 partially co-exist with Co2P2O7, Ni2P2O7, and Cu2P2O7 phases (called M3(PO4)2-M2P2O7mpc) because their phase equilibrium energies are in similar locations. Absorption peaks for Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7mpc, Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc, and Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc were observed at various wavelengths depending on the d-d electron transition of the metallic components. The intensity of the PL peak related to the recombination between electrons and holes increased in the order of Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc < Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc < Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7mpc. The photocurrent density correlated with the charge separation between the electrons and the holes decreased in the order of Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc > Ni3(PO4)2-Ni2P2O7mpc > Co3(PO4)2-CO2P2O7mpc. The water-splitting performance was found to be the best in Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc, and cumulative hydrogen production of 80.0 µmol/g was observed during a 10 h period. This is probably attributed to Cu ions in Cu3(PO4)2-Cu2P2O7mpc with high reduction potential easily capturing electrons and decomposing H2O into H+ and OH-. In addition, it was conﬁrmed that the performance of a catalyst can be improved through the eﬀective separation of electrons and holes induced by electrons migrating between the internal interfaces of M3(PO4)2-M2P2O7mpc.
