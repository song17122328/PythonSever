Solid-state lithium-ion batteries are promising candidates for energy storage devices that meet the requirements to reduce CO2 emissions. NASICON-type solid-state electrolytes (SSE) are most promising materials as electrolytes for high-performance lithium ion batteries because of their good stability and high ionic conductivity. In this study, we successfully fabricate NASICON-based Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 lithium fast-ion conductors through melt-quenching with post-crystallization. The effect of crystallization temperature on the structure of LAGP and their ionic conductivity is systematically studied using Rietveld analysis of Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction patterns, multinuclear magnetic resonance, and electrochemical analysis, revealing that the mobility of Li ion is dependent on crystallization temperature. The glass–ceramic LAGP annealed at 800 °C for 8 h exhibits the highest conductivity of 0.5 mS cm–1 at room temperature. Moreover, we report the viability of the prepared LAGP glass−ceramic as a solid electrolyte in Li-ion batteries without polymer adhesion. The cycling of Li/LAGP/LFP all-solid-state cell, provides a stable cycling lifetime of up to 50 cycles. This approach demonstrates that LAGP glass–ceramic can have good contact with the electrodes without interfacial layer and can deliver a reasonable discharge capacity after 50 cycles.

Rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly applied in today’s high-tech devices from portable electronic devices to electrical vehicles to smart grid energy storage systems because of their high energy density and long cycle life. (1−3) However, commercial rechargeable LIBs use organic liquid electrolytes which raised safety issues because these electrolytes are flammable, toxic, flowing, and volatile. (4) Moreover, formation and uncontrolled growth of needle-like Li-dendrites during repeated stripping and plating within electrode materials can lead to hazardous short-circuit in the cell and finally death of LIBs because of the organic electrolytes. Furthermore, the narrow electrochemical window of the organic liquid electrolytes limits the choice of electrode materials and, consequently, the achievable energy density of the LIBs. (5) Thus, all-solid-state rechargeable LIBs using inorganic ceramic solid electrolytes, instead of organic liquid electrolytes, have been considered because of their nonflammability, reliability, high energy density, high electrochemical stability, long cycle performance, and applicability for large-scale batteries in electric or hybrid vehicles and smart grids. (6−8) Numerous studies have been conducted on Li-analogues based on sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) type fast Li-ion conductors with the general formula of LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf, Sn, Ti, Ge, etc.) due to their high Li-ion conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and superior chemical stability with Li anodes. (9−11) Among these conductors, the NASICON-based Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP) (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4) compounds exhibit the highest ionic conductivities in the order of 10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature. (12) However, LiTi2(PO4)3-based compounds are unstable and tend to react with Li metal because of the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as a compensation to the Li insertion potential associated with large electronic conductivity. (13,14) A protective layer should be employed between LATP electrolyte and electrodes to avoid direct contact with Li metal for their use in solid-state batteries. West et al. (15) deposited a layer of lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) film with a thickness of 1 μm on LATP glass–ceramic plate Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2–P2O5–TiO2–GeO2 to study the reactivity of the LATP plate with metallic Li. Zhou et al. (13) fabricated an all-solid-state battery by employing LATP glass–ceramic membrane sandwiched with a cross-linked polymer poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (CPMEA) on both sides. The all-solid-state Li/CPMEA/LATP/CPMEA/LiFePO4 battery delivered a capacity of 130 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles. However, a protective polymer layer should be inserted between the LATP solid electrolyte and electrodes to achieve long cycle performance.

Lithium aluminum germanium phosphate [Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3] glass ceramics are potential electrolyte materials in place of Ti-free Li-analogues in the NASICON family because of the high mechanical strength and superior stability of these glass ceramics in contact with Li metal. (16) Moreover, Ti-free LAGP offers relatively high ionic conductivity of 4.2 × 10–3 S cm–1 at room temperature, which is comparable with LATP. (17,18) Furthermore, LAGP has an advantageous electrochemical stability window (1.8–7 V vs Li+/Li) because Ge4+ is more difficult to reduce compared with Ti4+. (19−21) The active cathode material LiFePO4 (LFP) is now considered as a competitive candidate of cathode material for the next-generation LIB system. LFP offers an average flat potential of 3.45 V vs Li+/Li, displays a reversible capacity of 170 mA h g–1, and has high thermal stability. (22) Zao et al. (23) prepared a bilayer structured solid-state electrolyte composed of LAGP/LATP by dry pressing and post-calcination. The final ASSLB with the configuration of LiFePO4/LATP-LAGP/Li delivered an initial discharge capacity of 130.6 mA h g–1. However, the battery with LATP/LAGP as the solid-state can be discharged only for five cycles because of the poor contact between the two hard solid materials. (23)

In this paper, we report the preparation of NASICON-based LAGP glass–ceramic using melt quenching and post-crystallization. The effects of annealing temperature on Li-ion mobility and ion conductivity were systematically studied using X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. The morphology of the glass–ceramic was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The prepared LAGP glass ceramics were successfully employed as a solid electrolyte in a LIB with LFP as a cathode to obtain a stable cycling lifetime of up to 50 cycles with high reversible capacity.

Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (LAGP) (x = 0.5) glass sheet was synthesized by melt quenching. A batch of stoichiometric composition (20 g) was prepared using reagent-grade chemicals, such as Li2CO3 (Alfa Aesar, 98.0% purity), Al2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95% purity), GeO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99% purity), and NH4H2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.0% purity). Possible Li+ vapored components were compensated by adding 10 wt % excess of Li2CO3 during the preparation. Raw materials were weighed, mixed in 2-propanol solvent, and ball-milled in Teflon jar using ZrO2 balls for 4 h at 300 rpm to homogenize the mixture. The homogeneous mixture was transferred to an alumina crucible and kept at 80 °C for 12 h to evaporate the solvent. The dried powder was ground, placed in an electric furnace, and annealed up to 380 °C at 3 °C min–1 for 2 h to decompose ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water vapor out of the precursors. Then, the powder was ground again using an agate mortar and pestle. The ground powder was transferred to a platinum crucible, and the furnace temperature was raised to 1350 °C at 3 °C min–1 to obtain a homogeneous glass. The melting temperature was maintained for 2 h. Subsequently, the homogeneous and viscous liquid was poured onto a flat stainless steel plate that was preheated at 500 °C and pressed by another steel plate. The pressed glass sheets were annealed at 500 °C for 2 h to release the thermal stresses and then cooled down to room temperature. The preannealed glass sheets were finally crystallized for 8 h at 750, 800, and 850 °C and for 12 h at 950 °C.

Formation and purity of NASICON-based LAGP were confirmed using a high-resolution X-ray powder diffractometer (Bruker D2 Phaser) employing CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å) at 30 kV and 30 mA in the range of 10° < 2 < 80°. Rietveld refinements were performed using TOPAS 4.2 software on synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD) patterns recorded from the 01C2 beamline with 25 keV X-rays at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. An X-ray with a wavelength of 0.774916 (1) Å was used, as determined using the LaB6 (SRM660c), and the data were recorded between 5° < 2θ < 45°.

Morphologies and microstructures of the LAGP glass–ceramic samples crystallized at various temperatures were examined by FESEM using a scanning electron microscope JEOL JSM-7610F operating at 15 kV. The samples were platinum sputtered to eliminate any charge effect.

The spectra of 7Li, 27Al, and 31P MAS NMR were recorded at room temperature in a Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm MAS probe head. The frequencies used for the 7Li, 27Al, and 31P nuclei were at 155.5, 104.2, and 161.9 MHz, respectively, by applying an external magnetic field of 14.1 T. The samples were spun at 12 kHz, and spectra were recorded after a single pulse irradiation (2–6 μs). Chemical shifts in the NMR signals were provided relative to the aqueous solutions 1 M LiCl, 1 M AlCl3, and 85 wt % H3PO4 at 0 ppm. The spinning rate, position, line width, and intensity of components were automatically determined.

All the LAGP pellets used in electrochemical testing were 1.0–2.0 mm thick unless otherwise specified. The LAGP pellets were repeatedly polished on both sides to obtain a mirror-polished surface and then placed into a Swagelok cell using Au|LAGP|Au for electrochemical studies. The cell was then attached with electrical wires connected to the impedance spectrometer. AC impedance of the specimen was measured in the frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz using an impedance analyzer (Solartron SI1260). The AC impedance of the cells was measured in the temperature range of 20 to 120 °C. At each temperature measurement, the cell was equilibrated for 1 h. Z Plot and Z View software packages were employed for data acquisition and analysis. All impedance data were analyzed and fitted with the R(R-CPE)Wo model.

A positive electrode slurry composed of LiFePO4, KS6 carbon black, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Alfa Aesar) and bis-trifluoromethane sulfonamide (LiTFSI) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.95% purity), lithium salt in the weight ratio of 10:2:1:7, respectively, was prepared using an appropriate amount of NMP. (24) It is worth mentioned that mixing of Li salt (LiTFSI) and binder (PVDF) can form a polymer electrolyte. (25) The slurry was well-ground using a mortar and pestle for 10 min. The obtained slurry was coated on one side of a LAGP pellet followed by vacuum drying at 120 °C for 12 h, while the other side was pressed Li foil (thickness of around 20 μm) as negative electrode. The active material loading of the cathode was 2–3 mg cm–2. For electrochemical studies, the LAGP pellet with Li foil sealed in a Swagelok cell in an argon glovebox. The cell was tested at room temperature between 2.8 and 4.15 V using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Arbin BT2000) under open air condition.

Room temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the melt-quenched LAGP powders annealed at various temperatures (750 °C – 950 °C) are presented in Figure 1. The main peaks in all XRD patterns well matched with the standard pattern of LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP, PDF #80-1924) NASICON-type structure, except for several small peaks attributed to the impurities of GeO2, AlPO4, and Li4P2O7 as secondary phases. At high-temperature heat treatment of LAGP glass, several signals were appeared at 22°, 27° and 35.2° may be assigned to the additional impurity of the AlPO4 phase. These observed signal peak intensities increased with increase in annealing temperature because of the formation of secondary AlPO4 phases at high temperature. Figure 2 shows the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns of analyzed samples annealed for 8 h at 750, 800, and 850 °C and for 12 h at 950 °C. The refined crystallographic parameters are summarized in the Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2. During Rietveld refinement, the zero shift error, background coefficients, histogram scale factor, pseudo-Voigt coefficient, half-width, and unit cell parameters were refined initially followed by the positional parameters. Finally, isotropic thermal parameters of various atoms were freely refined. The refinement results show that samples crystallized in a rhombohedral structure (space group R3̅c) with NASICON-type LiGe2(PO4)3 phase as the dominant crystalline phase along with several additional weak reflections corresponding to the secondary phases of GeO2 (space group P3121, JCPDS #83-2474), Li4P2O7 (space group P1̅, JCPDS #77-1045), and AlPO4 (space group P3121, JCPDS #48-0652). The lattice parameters for the LAGP crystalline phase were determined to be a = 8.2671 ± 0.0002 Å and c = 20.6498 ± 0.0007 Å, respectively (Table S1). These lattice parameters are consistent with the published data for LGP NASICON crystalline phase, with a = 8.250 Å and c = 20.460 Å (JCPDS 41–0034). Hence, the NASICON-type structure of the crystalline phase was verified. The increment in the lattice parameters in LAGP could be explained by the substitution of Ge4+ (0.530 Å) by the larger Al3+ (0.535 Å) in the LGP crystalline phase, and this substitution resulted in the structural alteration. The formation of the additional impurity AlPO4 phase for the sample crystallized after high-temperature heat treatment could be explained by the refinement results. The findings suggest that Al preferentially occupied the Ge site, and the increment in Al occupancy confirmed the segregation of the secondary phase formed for the sample crystallized at high-temperature heat treatment (850–950 °C). This phenomenon was also proved by the 27Al and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (vide infra). The disadvantage of the formation of secondary phases as the crystallization temperature increased and in turn the Li loss in NASICON framework are reflected in decreased conductivity (Figure 3c).

The effect of crystallization temperature on the morphology of LAGP samples was examined using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The FE-SEM micrographs were recorded at room temperature for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass ceramics annealed for 8 h at 750, 800, and 850 °C and for 12 h at 950 °C (Figure S1). Significant differences were found in the morphology of the microstructure among the four samples, which were crystallized at various temperatures. A considerable glassy phase remained, and crystalline grains formed with an irregular shape and unclear edges of the grains for the sample crystallized at 750 °C (Figure S1a). This result indicates the amorphous nature of the sample at the heat-treatment temperature of 750 °C. The size of the grains improved with increasing crystallization temperature. The grains grew rapidly and became well distinct grains and grain boundaries with the heat-treatment temperature of 800–850 °C. When the crystalline temperature was further increased to 950 °C, secondary phases appeared along the grain boundaries and formed small amounts of pores between the elongated grains because of the segregation of grains. EDX (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) mapping was then performed on the LAGP sample crystallized at 800 °C for 8 h (Figure S2) for localization of Ge, Al, and P elements and shows that Ge, Al, and P elements are homogeneously distributed among the crystal grains.

The conductivities of the LAGP glass–ceramic were evaluated using AC impedance technique. A typical AC impedance plot of LAGP glass ceramic pellet crystallized at 800 °C for 8 h were recorded at room temperature and 60 °C with Au|LAGP|Au and Li|LAGP|Li configurations are presented in Figure 3a, b and Figure S3, respectively. All LAGP samples annealed at various temperatures (750–950 °C) showed one depressed semicircle at the high-frequency region. This semicircle, which represented the total impedance including the mixed bulk and grain boundary impedances, followed an inclined line with an angle of 45° with the real (Z′) axis at lower frequencies. Total impedance can be obtained by fitting the semicircle using an equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset of Figure 3a. In the fitted circuit, Rs was interpreted as the circuit resistance external to the specimen, which originated from the intercept of the semicircle with the Z′ axis at the high-frequency region representing the bulk resistance. Rg was referred as grain boundary resistance and CPE1 was referred as the constant phase element attributed to the bulk capacitance of the solid electrolyte, and Wo was the Warburg-type impedance corresponding to the diffusion at the interface of the electrode/electrolyte. (26) The diameter of the semicircle at the middle frequency corresponded to the sum of the resistance of the grain and grain boundary response, which was further normalized with respect to the thickness and cross-sectional area of the specimen to achieve the total conductivity, σ (S cm–1). The impedance spectra reveal that the grain boundary contribution in total conductivity governed the grain contribution. The ionic conductivities of all samples crystallized at various temperatures were calculated as follows:(1)where l, A, and R denote the thickness of the electrolyte, cross-sectional area of the electrode, and ionic resistance of the electrolyte, respectively. The samples crystallized for 8 h at 800 °C showed the highest total ionic conductivity (σt) of 0.5 mS cm–1 and 1.24 mS cm–1 at room temperature and at 60 °C, respectively. The AC impedance spectra of LAGP specimen crystallized for 8 h at 800 °C was recorded for 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 5 days, and 10 days (Figure S4). The resistance of the LAGP specimen was slightly increased upon increasing time.

On the basis of the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity, the activation energy Ea can be estimated from the Arrhenius equation as follows:(2)where σ is the conductivity, K is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The Arrhenius plots for the relation between the total ionic conductivity and the inverse temperatures were obtained in the temperature range 20–100 °C, and the results are shown in Figure 3c. The Arrhenius total conductivities of the specimen show nonlinear responses, which suggests the presence of impurity phases GeO2, AlPO4. The minimum Ea was 0.28 eV for samples crystallized for 8 h at 800 °C, and the activation energy ranged between 0.28 and 0.31 eV. This observation was also shown by the XRD and solid-state NMR results by the decreased strength of the heteronuclear 7Li–31P dipole–dipole interaction (Figure 4).

Multinuclear MAS NMR studies were performed to comprehensively elucidate the changes in the local structural arrangements of LAGP. Figure 4 shows the 7Li MAS NMR spectra of the LAGP samples annealed for 8 h at 750 °C, 800 °C, 850 °C and for 12 h at 950 °C. In 7Li MAS NMR, one central transition (−1/2, 1/2 transition) appeared at 0.05 ppm along with other three satellite peaks (−5/2, −3/2, −1/2 and 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 transitions) corresponding to the spinning sidebands for all annealed LAGP powders. In general, the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the central 7Li transition was governed by the strength of the homo- (7Li–7Li) and heteronuclear (7Li–31P) dipole–dipole interactions and mobility of Li-ion. (27)Figure 4 inset shows a noticeable increase in fwhm when the sample was crystallized from 800 to 950 °C, and the small line width of the central transition at 800 °C indicates a weak interaction of heteronuclear 7Li–31P dipole–dipole interaction that facilitated increased Li-ion mobility.

The 27Al MAS spectra of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 powders are shown in Figure 5. The samples crystallized from 750 to 800 °C showed one signal at −10 ppm in the 27Al MAS spectra, which are ascribed to the AlO6 octahedral environment. The small peaks at approximately 68 ppm and −88 ppm were the spinning sidebands. Further increase in heat treatment to above 800 °C resulted in the appearance of two other signals at 10 and 40 ppm in the 27Al MAS spectra, which corresponded to the AlO5 and AlO4 environments, respectively. The observed second components mainly originated from the growth of secondary AlPO4 unit by expelling Al and phosphate from the LAGP framework. (27) These results agree well with the XRD results (vide supra), which suggest the formation of secondary phase AlPO4 at high-temperature heat treatments. Liu et al. observed the same phenomena in the solid-state NMR studies of the Li1+xAlxGe2-xP3O12 (LAGP) system. (28)

The 31P MAS NMR spectra show three closely associated signals at −41.6, – 36.4, and −32.3 ppm corresponding to the (PO4)−3 environments in the NASICON framework of the LAGP powders (Figure 6). Previous reports (28,29) showed that these signals could be associated with the P(OGe)4-n(OAl)n environments. As the crystallization temperature increased, the number of phosphorus environments increased. In addition to the main signals, a peak at approximately −26.6 ppm appeared, corresponding to the AlPO4 unit as identified by XRD pattern when the sample was crystallized at 950 °C. The additional weak reflections at approximately −10.3 and −11.3 ppm may be associated with the Li4P2O7 impurity detected in XRD patterns.

The viability of the LAGP glass–ceramic for a solid-state battery was demonstrated in a half-cell with the configuration of Li/LAGP/LFP. The Nyquist plot of the Li/LAGP/cathode cell recorded at room temperature and 60 °C is shown Figure 7. The half-cell showed two depressed semicircles and an inclined line. The solid line in Figure 7 denotes the fitting results with the equivalent circuit consisting of (R1)(R2CPE1)(R3CPE2)(Wburg-open). The first semicircle at the high-frequency region corresponded to the bulk resistance (R1) of the solid electrolyte, while the second semicircle at the middle-frequency region was attributed to the charge transfer resistance (R3) at the interface between the solid electrolyte and Li metal. (30) The fitted values of R1, R2 and R3 associated with first and second semicircle were ∼791.2 Ω and ∼5967 Ω, respectively, with a total resistance of ∼6758.2 Ω. The resistance of electrolyte (R1 + R2) of the cell is 791.2 Ω, which is almost consistent with that LAGP electrolyte obtained from Figure 3a. The cell small resistance is sufficient to perform a charge–discharge cycle in the Li-ion cell. The large charge transfer resistance of ∼5967 Ω originates from the poor contacts between the electrolyte/electrode interfaces, which plays a dominant role in the internal resistance of the cell. The surface and cross-section of the LAGP pellet with Li metal are shown in Figure S5. The bulk and total resistances of the cell decreased obviously with increasing temperature of the cell. Figure 8 shows the cycling performances of a half-cell with a LAGP electrolyte, metallic Li anode, and LiFePO4 cathode. The galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were performed within the voltage range of 2.7–3.9 V vs Li+/Li at the current rate of 0.05 C (170 mA h g–1) at room temperature (Figure 8a). The cell voltage plateau (3.46 V) was observed higher than the typical extraction/insertion reaction of LFP (3.45 V). This characteristic indicates increased interfacial polarization. The cell exhibited initial charge and discharge capacities of 126.0 mA h g–1 and 96.0 mA h g–1, respectively, corresponding to approximately 74.1% and 56.4% of the theoretical capacity (170 mA h g–1). The increment in the capacity in the first few cycles was due to the improved contact between electrolyte/electrode interfaces during cycling. Figure 8b shows that the discharge capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the cell were approximately 36 mA h g–1 and 94.4% for the 50 cycles. The gradual increase in the cell overpotential and consequential decrease in discharge capacity were due to the poor contact between solid electrolyte and electrodes during the cycle. Optimizing the electrolyte/electrode interfaces can solve this issue.

In the present investigation, LAGP was successfully synthesized through melt-quench method. The synthesized glass-sheet was annealed at various temperatures to obtain glass–ceramic plates. LAGP glass−ceramic was characterized by XRD, solid-state NMR, and SEM. Impurity phase AlPO4 was observed at high-temperature heat treatment of glass sheet. This phenomenon was confirmed by XRD refinement and NMR studies. The prepared glass–ceramic was tested for all solid-state Li-ion cell with the configuration of Li/LAGP/LFP and showed a reasonable cyclability for over 50 cycles. This approach demonstrates that LAGP glass–ceramic can have good contact with the electrodes without interfacial layer and can deliver a reasonable discharge capacity after 50 cycles.
