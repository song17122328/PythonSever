Bismuth   cobaltite   with   sillenite-type   structure   was   prepared   from   Co(OH)2 and   Bi(NO3)3·6H2O   through solid   state   reaction   at   600 ◦C.   Neutron   powder   diffraction   (NPD)   data   and   X-ray   absorption   spectroscopy revealed   the   existence   of  mixed   oxidation   states   for   cobalt   in   this   compound,   the   chemical   formula   being Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6.   The   gas   sensing   properties   of   Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 were   characterized   by   alternating   current,   at  200,   300   and   400 ◦C.  The   optimal   response   was   observed   at   400 ◦C,  using   a  frequency   of 100   kHz.

In  recent  years,  the  global  climate  change  has  caused  concern worldwide  due  to  the  intense  and  hazardous  meteorological  events produced  by  this  phenomenon.  The  emission  of  large  amounts  of CO2,  methane,  water  vapor  and  ozone  are  the  main  causes,  by means  of  the  green  house  effect  [1].   Moreover,  the  increase  in  the ocean  acidiﬁcation,  and  further  decalciﬁcation  of  marine  organisms,  is  attributable  to  the  increase  in  the  concentration  of  CO2 [2,3].

Carbon  dioxide  sensors  have  been  developed  from  several  years using  different  approaches.  Côté  et  al.  proposed  an  electrochemical cell  to  measure  CO2 at  1  atm  and  high  temperatures  (450–700 ◦C); it  had  a  K2CO3 solid  electrolyte  connected  with  gold  wires  [4].   This device  was  one  of  the  ﬁrst  CO2 probes.  Egashira  et  al.  reported  a CO2 sensor  consisting  of  a  mixture  of  K2CO3 and  polyethylene  glycol,  immersed  in  a  porous  ceramic.  They  found  that  depending  on the  composition  of  the  electrode  (Au  or  Pt),  and  the  amount  of  the mixture,  good  reproducibility  and  long-term  stability,  even  at  room temperature,  can  be  obtained  [5,6].  On  the  other  hand,  Ishihara  et  al. reported  the  results  obtained  from  mixed  oxide  capacitors  used  as carbon  dioxide  gas  sensors.  They  tested  capacitors  composed  by titanates  possessing  the  perovskite-type  structure  (ABO3;  A  =  Sr,  Ba and  B  =  Ti),  and  binary  transition  metal  oxides.  Their  ﬁndings  show that  the  capacitor  made  with  CuO–BaTiO3 exhibited  the  highest sensitivity  at  an  operating  temperature  lower  than  527 ◦C  [7–9]. Solid  state  CO2 sensors  made  with  noble  metals,  NASICON  and  alkaline  carbonates  have  been  widely  studied  for  several  years  [10–18]. These  devices  have  been  used  in  monitoring  and  control  of  ofﬁces, homes,  agricultural  facilities  and  more.  The  advantages  of  these devices  are  low  cost,  high  reliability  and  small  size.  On  the  other hand,  cobalt  oxides  having  various  crystal  structures  and  chemical  compositions  have  also  proved  to  be  satisfactory  for  carbon dioxide  detection.  Speciﬁcally,  cobalt  oxides  having  the  perovskite and  spinel-type  structures  have  been  characterized  for  this  purpose  [19,20].  Even  though  the  results  indicate  an  acceptable  gas sensing  performance,  little  is  known  about  the  gas  sensing  properties  of  cobalt  oxides  having  other  crystal  structures;  for  instance, the  sillenite-type  structure.

In  a  previous  work,  the  gas  sensing  properties  of  a  bismuth cobalt  sillenite-type  oxide  (Bi10Co16O38)  were  reported  [21].  Even though  the  measurements  made  on  that  material  were  performed in  direct  current  (DC),  selectivity  and  reproducibility  in  the  detection  of  CO2 and  O2 were  widely  observed.  Those  results  suggested that  bismuth  cobaltites  would  be  of  interest  for  gas  sensing  applications.  Herein  we  attempt  to  obtain  further  insight  into  the composition  and  structure  of  this  compound  together  with  a  more detailed  evaluation,  in  alternating  current,  of  the  response  to  carbon  dioxide  at  different  temperatures.

Samples  of  bismuth  cobaltite  were  prepared  by  solid  state reaction,  using  stoichiometric  amounts  of  Co(OH)2 (Alfa  Aesar)and  Bi(NO3)3·6H2O  (Sigma–Aldrich).  The  reagents  were  used  as received,  and  were  mixed  and  ground  with  agate  mortar  and  pestle. In  order  to  eliminate  water  and  nitrogen  contained  in  the  reagents, these  were  pre-heated  at  600 ◦C  in  air  for  5  h.  The  resulting  powder  was  pressed  into  pellets  and  ﬁred  again  at  600 ◦C  for  5  h.  A heating  rate  of  50 ◦C/h  was  used  in  all  thermal  treatments,  using a  temperature-programmable  mufﬂe-type  furnace.  Alumina  crucibles  were  used  in  each  calcination.

X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  was  performed  at  room  temperature,  using  a  PANalytical  X’Pert  PRO  MPD   (model  DY  3197) diffractometer,  with  CuK␣1  radiation  (1.5405 ˚A).  Neutron  powder  diffraction  (NPD)  data  of  the  obtained  powder  were  obtained using  the  D2B  high  resolution  diffractometer  at  the  Institut  Laue ≈   1.594 ˚A  with  a  step  size Langevin  (ILL),  Grenoble,  France,  at    domain  ranging  from  0◦ to  158.7◦.  The  proﬁle of  0.05◦ on  a  2 parameters  used  in  the  instrumental  resolution  function  (IRF)  are U  =  0.05599  deg2,  V  =  . Rietveld reﬁnement  was  carried  out  with  the  program  FullProf  (Windows version,  August  2008),  using  the  pseudo-Voigt  proﬁle  function  of Thompson  et  al.  [22,23].

XAS  measurements  at  the  Co  K and  Bi  L(III)-edges  were  carried out  on  station  9.3  at  the  Daresbury  Synchrotron  Radiation  Source (UK).  The  measurements  were  performed  at  room  temperature  in normal  transmission  mode  using  gas-ﬁlled  ion  chambers.  The  synchrotron  energy  was  2  GeV  and  the  average  ring  current  during  the experiments  was  150  mA.   The  energy  scales  were  calibrated  against metal  foils  taking  as  the  zero  the  Co  K-edge  (7709  eV)  and  Bi  L(III)edge  (13,418  eV).  The  oxides  CoO,  Co3O4 and  Bi2O3 were  used  as reference  materials  for  the  XANES  analysis.  The  samples  were  prepared  by  thoroughly  mixing  the  ground  material  with  a  polythene diluent  and  pressed  into  pellets  in  a  13  mm   IR  press.  The  amount ∼1.  Spectra of  sample  was  adjusted  to  yield  an  absorption  step  of  were  typically  collected  to  k  =  16 ˚A−1 and  several  scans  were  taken to  improve  the  signal-to-noise  ratio.  Between  scans  for  the  samples scans  of  the  foils  were  collected  ensure  the  calibration  remained unchanged.  The  data  were  processed  in  the  conventional  manner using  the  Daresbury  suite  of  EXAFS  programmes;  EXCALIB,  EXBACK and  EXCURV98  [24].

The  electrical  and  gas  sensing  characterization  was  made  on thick-ﬁlms  of  the  sample  characterized  by  NPD,  which  indeed contains  a  small  amount  of  Co3O4.  These  ﬁlms  will  be  named  hereafter  as  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 thick  ﬁlms.  The  ﬁlms  were  prepared by  sonicating  0.1  g  of  the  powder  in  1  ml   ethyl  alcohol  absolute. Then,  the  suspension  was  placed  within  a  ceramic  ring,  resulting  in  circular  ﬁlms,  which  had  diameter  of  5  mm  and  thickness ␮m).   High  purity  silver  wires  (Aldrich),  attached of  300  to  the  ceramic  ring  were  used  as  electrodes.  Alumina  discs  with  a thickness  of  3  mm  were  used  as  substrates.  The  alternating  current characterization  (AC)  was  made  by  the  two-point  probe  method. The  magnitude  of  the  impedance  (|Z|)  was  measured  by  means  of  a LCR  meter  (Agilent  4263B).  The  graphs  were  obtained  through  the LabView  8.6  software  (National  Instruments).  The  DC  polarization curves  were  recorded  with  a  Solartron  1285A  potentiostat,  using the  Corrware  software  (Scribner  Associates).  Extra  dry  compressed air  (Infra)  and  extra  dry  CO2 (Infra)  were  mixed  and  delivered within  the  test  chamber  using  a  MKS   Instruments  (model  647C) mass  ﬂow  controller.  To  avoid  the  effect  of  gas  turbulence,  the  gas sensing  measurements  were  performed  at  least  ﬁve  minutes  after the  test  gas  was  introduced.

Fig.  1  shows  the  XRD  diffraction  pattern  of  our  resulting  material.  All  diffraction  lines  can  be  indexed  within  space  group  I  2  3, in  agreement  with  the  formation  of  a  sillenite  type  structure.  The reﬁned  cell  parameter  is  a  =  10.18600(9) ˚A,   close  to  the  reported  values  for  cobalt-substituted  sillenites  [25].  A  small  amount  of  Co3O4 as  impurity  can  also  be  detected  in  the  diffraction  pattern.  Fig.  2 shows  a  typical  SEM  image  of  the  powder  calcined  at  600 ◦C.  As expected  by  the  synthetic  method  used  in  the  preparation,  parti␮m  were cles  with  irregular  shape,  having  sizes  in  a  range  of  0.5–2.5  produced.

Even  though  the  reactants  contain  only  Co+2,  partial  oxidation takes  place  during  the  thermal  treatment  in  air,  in  agreement  with the  small  amount  of  Co3O4 detected  in  the  ﬁnal  product.  In  order to  gather  information  on  the  oxidation  state  and  local  environment of  cobalt  and  bismuth  in  the  sillenite  phase  its  XAS  spectrum  was recorded.

Fig.  3  shows  the  normalized  Co  K-edge  and  Bi  L(III)-edge  XANES spectra  of  our  material.  The  spectrum  conﬁrms  the  bismuth  is  only present  in  its  +3  oxidation  state;  the  XANES  spectrum  is  almost identical  to  that  for  Bi2O3.  This  is  in  agreement  with  previous reports  concerning  sillenite  type  structures  [26].  On  the  other  hand, the  cobalt  XANES  is  shows  a  similar  edge  shift  to  that  for  Co3O4, indicating  the  cobalt  atoms  have  an  average  oxidation  state  of +2.67,  thus  indicating  the  formation  of  a  mixed-valence  sillenite.

Though  the ␥-Bi2O3 phase  has  been  known  since  1937  its structural  determination  has  long  been  controversial,  specially concerning  the  oxidation  state  of  bismuth  ions  and  the  presence of  vacancies  in  the  structure  to  maintain  electroneutrality  [27].  It ␥-Bi2O3 consists is  now  generally  accepted  that  the  framework  of  of  Bi–O  octahedra  in  which  one  of  the  apical  positions  is  occupied by  the  6s2 Bi+3 lone  pair.  These  octahedra  share  corners  to  form a  framework  within  which  some  tetrahedral  sites  are  also  occupied  by  Bi+3 ions,  forming  umbrella-like  [BiO3]  groups  and  the  6s2 lone  pair  extending  towards  the  direction  of  the  absent  oxygen atom.  The  remaining  tetrahedral  positions  are  unoccupied  and  statistically  distributed  over  the  lattice,  leading  to  a  general  formula Bi12[BiO3]0.8[O4]0.2O16 [26].

The  so-called  sillenite-type  compounds  are  formed  through  the substitution  of  bismuth  atoms  for  other  cations  with  different valence  states.  The  general  structural  formula  of  these  phases  has also  been  the  subject  of  a  number  of  controversial  investigations that  resulted  in  several  structural  models.  Indeed,  in  the  particular  case  of  cobalt  substitution,  compositions  such  as  Bi26−xCoxO40−ı (1  <  x  <  16)  have  been  reported  in  the  literature,  in  which  the  transition  metal  cation  occupies  both  tetrahedral  (2a)  and  octahedral (24f)  crystallographic  sites  [28].  However,  the  existence  of  such phases  does  not  seem  reasonable  from  a  crystal  chemical  point  of view  [29].  Indeed,  as  reported  in  the  general  stoichiometric  model given  by  Valant  et  al.,  substituent  atoms  cannot  simply  be  incorporated  by  ﬁlling  the  vacant  tetrahedral  sites,  as  the  incorporation of  oxygen  ions  due  to  charge  compensation  would  lead  to  the formation  of  [BiO4]  groups  [29].  Additional  oxygen  ions  must  be accompanied  by  a  reduction  of  bismuth  cations  in  agreement  with the  charge  of  the  substituent  ion.  Moreover,  octahedral  sites  can only  be  occupied  by  ions  with  a  lone-electron  pair  like  Bi+3.  Different  examples  are  reported  by  Valant  et  al.  for  M2+,  M3+,  M4+ and  M5+ substitutions,  whose  general  formula  can  be  generalized as  Bi12(Bi4/5−nxMn+ 5x·1/5−(5−n)x)O19.2+nx.  Interestingly,  the  existence of  mixed-valence  substitutions  is  not  mentioned  in  Valant’s  paper [29].  In  our  previous  paper,  the  chemical  formula  reported  by  Rangavittal  et  al.  Bi26−xCoxO40−ı (x  =  16)  was  used  to  describe  our material  [21,28].  Nonetheless,  since  the  calculated  diffraction  patterns  of  both  Valant  and  Rangavittal  models  are  almost  identical, the  two   compositions  could  not  be  differentiated  from  the  XRD  pattern.  Thus,  and  in  order  to  accurately  describe  the  structure  of  our material,  neutron  powder  diffraction  data  were  recorded  at  the  D2B instrument.

The  data  were  reﬁned  taking  Valant’s  formula  as  starting  model, considering  a  full  occupancy  of  tetrahedral  positions  and  a  statistical  distribution  of  Co2+ and  Co+3 atoms.  Co3O4 was  included  as  a second  phase.  Background  points  were  modeled  by  linear  interpolation  and  in  the  ﬁrst  stages  of  the  reﬁnement  the  zero  point,  scale factor,  cell  parameters  and  atomic  positions  were  allowed  to  vary simultaneously.  The  occupancies  of  bismuth  and  cobalt  atoms  in  2a positions  as  well  as  the  occupancies  of  O3  atoms  (whose  deﬁciencies  are  due  to  the  umbrella-like  environment  of  the  Bi+3 atoms  in tetrahedral  positions)  were  reﬁned  next,  without  constraints,  leading  to  a  formula  of  Bi12(Co0.41Bi0.42)O19.43.  Although  this  formula does  not  exactly  match  with  Valant’s  model,  the  composition  is not  far  from  Bi12(Bi0.57Co0.43)O19.43, that  would  correspond  to  the maximum  amount  of  M2.67+ incorporation  allowed  in  the  structure.  Reﬁnement  of  thermal  parameters  lead  to  a  very  high  value for  2a  tetrahedral  sites  that  converged  to  coherent  values  when the  bismuth  atoms  forming  the  umbrella-like  groups  were  slightly displaced  towards  oxygen  vacancies  as  previously  reported  for  sillenites  [25].  Simultaneous  reﬁnement  of  thermal  parameters  and atomic  occupancies  was  not  possible  due  to  the  strong  correlations  these  parameters  exhibit;  however,  the  reﬁnement  quickly converged  when  cobalt  and  bismuth  occupancies  in  tetrahedral positions  were  constrained  considering  a  full  occupancy  of  tetrahedral  sites.  The  reﬁnement  details  and  the  ﬁnal  reﬁned  values  can be  found  in  Tables  1  and  2  while  the  ﬁnal  Rietveld  reﬁned  proﬁle  is shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  ﬁnal  reﬁned  formula  is  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 which  would  correspond,  within  error,  to  the  formula  proposed by  Valant,  Bi12(Bi0.57Co0.43)O19.43.  A  list  of  selected  atomic  distances  can  be  found  in  Table  3.  The  obtained  values  are  fully concordant  with  usual  values  reported  in  sillenites  and  in  better agreement  with  the  sum  of  the  effective  ionic  radii  tabulated  by Shannon,  than  the  previously  reported  cobalt  substituted  sillenites  [25,28,30].   Interestingly  our  ﬁnal  model  is  in  agreement  with the  formula  Bi88Co3O136 that  had  previously  been  proposed  in  a DTA  and  XRD  study,  although  obtained  from  a  melt  of  composition (44Bi2O3:Co3O4)  [31].

The dependence temperature of Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 thick  ﬁlms  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.  These  graphs were  obtained  at  100  Hz,  1  kHz  and  100  kHz,  in  air  and  100  ppm  of CO2 (in  air).  Due  to  the  difference  of    in  these  graphs,  the  inset |Z| of  Fig.  5  shows  the  curve  obtained  at  100  kHz.  Fig.  5  shows  that  decreased  with  an  increase  of  temperature,  corresponding  to  the behavior  of  semiconductor  materials.  The  non-linear  behavior  of these  curves  can  be  attributed  to  small  polaron  hopping  between Co+2 ions  and  Co+3 ions;  where  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  Co+3 ions  produced  the  decrease  of    [32,33].  Fig.  5  also  shows  that  the curves  obtained  at  100  Hz  and  1  kHz  had  similar  shapes;  however, at  100  kHz  a  more  attenuated  curve  was  obtained.  Comparing  the |Z|   vs.  T  graphs  of  Fig.  5  is  possible  to  observe  that  at  100  Hz  and 1  kHz  a  reduction  of  |Z|  of  ∼99%  was  registered  at  250 ◦C.  However,when  the  applied  frequency  was  100  kHz,  a  decrease  of  was   recorded  at  500 ◦C.  This  difference  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact that  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 thick  ﬁlm  act  as  a  low-pass  ﬁlter  [34]. To  support  this  assertion,  Fig.  6  displays  the  variation  of    with frequency,  measured  in  air  and  100  ppm  of  CO2 (400 ◦C).  Evidently, a  decrease  in    while  increasing  the  frequency  can  be  observed in  both  curves,  where  the  larger  values  of    correspond  to  carbon dioxide.  The  explanation  of  the  latter  will  be  provided  later  in  the light  of  the  dynamic  response  of  impedance  measurements.

In  order  to  determine  the  effect  of  the  frequency  and  operation temperature  on  the  gas  sensing  response  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6, the  variation  of    with  time  was   recorded  when  air  and  100  ppm  of CO2 were  alternatively  supplied.  The  frequencies  used  were  100  Hz, 1  kHz,  and  100  kHz;  whereas  the  test  temperatures  were  200,  300 and  400 ◦C.  In  a  typical  experiment,  dry  air  was   supplied  for  about 5  min   to  obtain  stable    readings;  then,  CO2 with  a  concentration  of 100  ppm  was   introduced.  Fig.  7  shows  the  |Z|  vs.  t  graphs  recorded at:  (A)  100  Hz,  (B)  1  kHz  and  (C)  100  kHz,  at  200 ◦C.  Even  though repeatability  in  CO2 detection  is  clearly  observed  in  these  graphs, a  continuous  decrease  in    obtained  at  300 ◦C  at (A)  100  Hz,  (B)  1  kHz  and  (C)  100  kHz.  At  100  Hz  and  1  kHz  the graphs  show  a  continuous  decrease  of    with  time,  similar  to  those obtained  at  200 ◦C.  However,  at  100  kHz  a  considerable  improvement  in  gas  sensing  performance  can  be  observed.  In  these  graphs, a  near  saturation  in  the  detection  of  the  gas  can  be  noticed.  On  the other  hand,  Fig.  9  shows  the    vs.  t  plots  obtained  at  (A)  100  Hz,  (B) 1  kHz  and  (C)  100  kHz  (400 ◦C).  At  100  Hz,  the  graph  displays  high reproducible  carbon  dioxide  sensing,  although  a  positive  slope  is present.  When  1  kHz  and  100  kHz  were  used,  a  full  recovery  of  the original    value  was  recorded  after  the  introduction  of  air.  In  the latter,  the  background  slope  was  not  be  detected.

Table  4  summarizes  the  most  relevant  sensor  parameters obtained  from  Figs.  7–9.   In  this  table    corresponds  to  the |Z|o)/t average  variation  of  |Z|.  The  slope  was  measured  as  (|Z|f − |Z|f and  |Z|o have  the  meaning  shown  in  Fig.  7A.  The (t  =  16  min);  response  and  recovery  times  correspond  to  the  90%  of  the  full |Z|.  These  results  revealed  that  the  increase  in  temvariation  of  |Z|.  Nonetheless,  a  signiﬁcant perature  produced  a  decrease  of  improvement  in  reproducibility  and  stability  were  obtained  while increasing  temperature  and  frequency.  From  300 ◦C,  saturation  in the  detection  of  CO2 can  also  be  observed  in  each  air/CO2 cycle. Besides,  at  each  applied  frequency,  the  shortest  response  time  was registered  at  400 ◦C;  however,  at  200  and  300 ◦C  mixed  results were  obtained.  It  was   not  possible  to  deduce  a  trend  for  recovery  times  but,  400 ◦C  was   the  temperature  where  the  best  results were  recorded.  In  summary,  it  was  clear  that  using  400 ◦C  and 100  kHz  (Fig.  9C)  the  most  reliable  CO2 response  was   measured. Once  known  the  optimal  operation  parameters,  the  long  term  stability  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 thick  ﬁlms  is  under  investigation. These  results  will  be  reported  later.

On  the  other  hand,  the  origin  of  the  negative  slopes  of  graphs of  Figs.  7  and  8  may   be  associated  to  a  type  of  electronic  noise known  as  Flicker  noise  or  pink  noise,  which  depends  on  1/f;  where f  is  the  applied  frequency.  This  phenomenon  has  been  studied  in deep  in  metal-oxide-semiconductor  ﬁeld-effect  transistors;  however,  it  has  been  less  studied  in  gas  sensor  materials  [35].  The positive  slopes  of  Fig.  9A  and  B  may   be  associated  to  thermal effects;  however,  further  research  is  being  performed  to  conﬁrm this  hypothesis.

The  present  results  were  compared  to  those  reported  from  CO2 sensors  made  with  mixed  oxide  capacitors  [7–9].  For  the  preparation  of  the  latter,  the  authors  used  1200 ◦C  to  obtain  BaTiO3 from  TiO2 and  BaCO3.  This  temperature  is  signiﬁcantly  higher  than 600 ◦C  used  for  the  preparation  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6.  The  operation  temperature  of  mixed  oxide  capacitors  was  between  400  and 900 ◦C;  being  sensitive  to  carbon  monoxide,  ethanol  and  humidity.  However,  short  response  times  (∼25  s)  and  highly  reproducible CO2 gas  sensing  patterns  were  registered  from  these  sensors.  About the  NASICON-based  CO2 sensors,  the  authors  refer  that  the  formation  of  crystalline  NASICON  was  produced  after  calcination  at 900  or  1000 ◦C.  For  these  sensors,  the  operation  temperature  was 300–600 ◦C,  exhibiting  reliable  CO2 sensing  performance.  According  to  several  authors  these  sensors  can  be  fabricated  at  low  cost [10–18].

The  main  advantages  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 sensors  are  low preparation  temperature,  reliable  gas  sensing  performance,  low operating  temperature  (400 ◦C)  and  low  cost.  However,  the  effects of  humidity  and  carbon  monoxide  on  the  gas  sensing  properties  of Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 deserve  further  research.

About  the  gas  sensing  mechanism,  since  the  redox  behavior  of CO2 is  not  known  (because  it  is  a  very  stable  molecule),  the  increase |Z|   in  this  gas  suggests  a  change  in  the  dielectric  constant  ()  of of  the  ﬁlm.  The  formation  of  a  very  thin  layer  of  carbonate  species  involve  a  reduction  of    due  to  the  dielectric  constant  of  carbonates  is  smaller  than  the  oxides  [7].   The  decrease  of    can  be explained  in  terms  of  the  following  equation:Z =R2 +1 ωCo 2.

where  R  is  resistance,    is  the  angular frequency  and  Co is  the  capacitance  in  air  [36].  Clearly,  a  decrease |Z|;  however,  the  further  introduction of  of  air  returns    to  its  original  value  (Fig.  9C).  Some  authors  suggest  the  formation  of  bicarbonate,  bidentate  or  monodentate,  in  the case  of  MgO,  CaO  and  ZrO2;  however,  more  research  is  needed  to identify  the  carbonate  formed  on  the  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 surface [37,38].  It  is  important  to  mention  that  possible  humidity  effects were  avoided  in  our  experiments  because  extra-dry  air  and  carbon dioxide  were  used.

DC  electrical  characterization  was  performed  in  order  to  test the  capability  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 to  detect  changes  in  the carbon  dioxide  concentration.  In  these  tests,  polarization  curves were  obtained  at  400 ◦C,  using  CO2 at  concentrations  of  50,  100  and −2  V  to  2  V  because  beyond 150  ppm.  I–V  plots  were  recorded  from  this  voltage  range  reliable  measurements  were  not  acquired;  Fig.  10 shows  a  typical  I–V  graph.  These  curves  show  that  the  increase  in the  concentration  of  CO2 produced  the  decrease  in  the  current, at  both  cathodic  and  anodic  voltages.  These  results  are  in  agreement  with  the  previous  results  obtained  in  AC,  in  the  sense  that  the increase  in  the  concentration  of  CO2 produced  an  increase  in 

On  the  other  hand,  the  nonlinear  behavior  of  the  I–V  curves  of Fig.  10  is  similar  to  that  reported  for  varistor  gas  sensors.  According to  Lin  et  al.  the  increase  of  nonlinearity  of  I–V  curves  of  varistor gas  sensors  is  caused  by  the  decrease  in  the  grain  size  [39].  In  this work,  since  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 was  prepared  by  the  solid  state reaction  method,  the  nonlinearity  of  I–V  curves  is  less  pronounced than  those  reported  by  Lin  and  coworkers.

The structure and gas sensing properties of Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 have  been  studied.  This  compound  is found  to  exhibit  a  mixed  valence  oxidation  state  of  cobalt  atoms. NPD  Rietveld  reﬁnement  conﬁrms  that  the  general  formula  proposed  by  Valant  for  sillenites  can  also  be  applied  to  mixed  valence compounds,  paving  the  way  to  new  possible  formulations.  The AC  electrical  characterization  of  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 thick  ﬁlms revealed  that  the  combined  effect  of  increasing  the  operating temperature  and  frequency  improved  the  CO2 gas  sensing  performance.  The  optimal  parameters  were  400 ◦C  and  100  kHz.  The most  feasible  mechanism  for  CO2 sensing  involves  the  formation of  a  thin  layer  of  a  carbonate  specie,  which  was  removed  when air  was  introduced.  On  the  other  hand,  the  results  obtained  in  DC demonstrate  that  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 can  detect  changes  in  the CO2 concentration,  which  was  supported  by  obtaining  unique  I–V curves  for  each  CO2 concentration.  The  advantage  of  using  transition  metal  oxides,  over  some  existing  CO2 sensors,  is  that  complex solid  state  cells  are  not  needed.  In  summary,  Bi12(Bi0.55Co0.45)O19.6 may   be  considered  as  an  alternative  carbon  dioxide  gas  sensor material.
