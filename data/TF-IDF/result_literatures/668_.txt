NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C@RGO (NVPF/C@RGO) composites with interconnected 3D carbonous framework are composed of NVPF nanoparticles,coating layer of amorphous carbon and RGO nanosheets, where the RGO serves asthe main framework.
The low carbon content (4.6%) and uniform NVPF nanoparticles supported by the unique 3D carbonous architecture lead to low specificsurface area and favorable tap density.
By taking full advantage of the interconnected3D carbonous framework, the excellent electronic conductivity of NVPF/C@RGO isthree orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine NVPF/C, resulting in favorableenhanced electrochemical performance.
The initial capacity of 124.5 mAh g-1 at 0.1C-rate and a high discharge capacity of 119.2 mAh g-1 with an excellent retention of90.9% after 700 cycles at 1 C can be attained.
Most importantly, NVPF nanoparticlesconnected with 3D carbonous framework have a low specific surface area, favorabletap density, simple technical procedure, and show great potential to optimize batteryperformance, apply in large scale energy storage and extend to all polyanion-based cathode materials.
In summary, with the purpose of high electrochemical performance andfavorable tap density, we propose a general and simple strategy of interconnected 3Dcarbonous framework with NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3 material as cathodeby a mass production potential sol-gel method.
The specific capacity, rateperformance and cycling stability of NVPF are significantly improved by theinterconnected 3D carbonous framework without decreasing of the tap density.
Furthermore, this simple and traditional preparation procedure is also suitable forother polyanion-based battery cathode materials and the NVPF/C@RGO compositeswith low carbon content, excellent electrochemical performance, small specificsurface area and favorable tap density are promising to be applied to the industrialization application.
