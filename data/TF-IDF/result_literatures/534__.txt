We report on the ion transport properties of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) NASICON type nanocrystalline compounds prepared through a Pechini-type polymerizable complex method. Structural properties were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy with selected area electron diffraction. Impedance spectroscopy was utilised to investigate the lithium ion transport properties. Y3+ doped LiZr2(PO4)3 compounds showed stabilized rhombohedral structure with enhanced total ionic conductivity at 30 °C from 2.87 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 0.65 × 10−5 S cm−1 for x=0.05 to 0.20 respectively. The activation energies of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 show a decreasing trend from 0.45 eV to 0.35 eV with increasing x from 0.05 to 0.20. The total conductivity of these compounds is thermally activated, with activation energies and pre-exponential factors following the Meyer-Neldel rule. The tanδ peak position shifts to the high-frequency side with increasing yttrium content. Scaling in AC conductivity spectra shows that the electrical relaxation mechanisms are independent of temperature.

Recently, much effort has been devoted to develop the lithium ion conducting solids with high conductivities for all-solid-state lithium ion battery application, as they deliver high energy density, high safety, and reliability [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Existing solid state lithium ionic conductors (SSLC) include: Li-β alumina, Li3N, xLi2O-yP2O5-zPON where PON=phosphorous oxynitride (LIPON), Li2+2xZn1-xGeO4 (LISICON), Li2S-P2O5-LiI, Li2S-SiS2-Li3PO4, Li1+xM2-xM′xP3O12 where M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Ge and Sn; M′ = Al, Ga and In (Li-analogues of NASICON-type), Li3xLa(2/3)-x(1/3)−2xTiO3 (perovskite-type), Li5La3M2O12 where M=Nb and Ta (Garnet-type) and Li10GeP2S12 [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Among the SSLCs, the ionic conductivity of L10GeP2S12 is reported to be 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is higher than that of the conventional liquid electrolyte [12]. However, this material is difficult to handle in ambient atmosphere due to its hygroscopic nature. Hence, more attention has been paid to NASICON-type materials LiM2P3O12 (M=Ti, Ge, Hf, etc) due to their better lithium ion transport properties and high chemical stability in ambient atmosphere.

Aono et al. have studied the electrical properties of the compounds Li1+xM′xTi2-xP3O12 (M′ = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, In, La, Sc and Y). They reported a maximum ionic conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature (RT) for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7P3O12 [13]. Bruque and co-workers examined the structural and electrical properties of Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8; y = 0.8, 1.0) and reported the Li ionic conductivities of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at RT for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.8Ti0.8(PO4)3 and Li1.6Al0.6Ge0.8Ti0.6(PO4)3. This enhanced electrical conductivity was correlated to its structural parameters [14]. A main disadvantage of Ti-based NASICON-type samples in Li+ battery application is the easy reduction of Ti4+ on contact with anode materials (lithium or LiC6) [15]. So there is still motivation to develop Ti-free NASICON-type oxides.

LiZr2(PO4)3 is considered to be a promising compound which exhibits different structures. The ionic conductivity of triclinic LiZr2(PO4)3 is ~ 1 × 10−8 S cm−1 at RT, whereas the ionic conductivity of rhombohedral LiZr2(PO4)3 is ~ 1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at RT [16], [17]. Furthermore the rhombohedral phase is stable above 50 °C, while the poorly ionic conducting triclinic phase is existing below 50 °C. Recently Goodenough and co-workers stabilized the rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT by substituting Ca for Zr and also found considerably increased ionic conductivity for LiZr2-xCax(PO4)3 [18]. Balaya and co-workers achieved a stabilized rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT by substituting Sr for Zr, giving remarkably improved ionic conductivity of 3.44 × 10−5 S cm−1 at RT for Li2.2Zr1.9Sr0.1(PO4)3 [19]. Zhang et al. stabilized the rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT by adding Al, giving ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10−6 S cm−1 [20]. Shinawi et al. obtained a stable rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT through a modified sol-gel route, achieving a total conductivity of 1.6 × 10−6 S cm−1 [21].

The concentration of mobile ions, the activation energy for conduction and its dependence on structural properties, and the activation entropy are influencing the magnitude of the ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes [22], [23], [24]. Hence, it has often related the activation energies, EA, and the pre-exponential factor, σ0 of the materials by a well-known Meyer-Neldel (M-N) rule: lnσ0 = αEA+ β, where α and β are constants and α is positive value [25], [26]. West and co-workers investigated the M–N rule for several solid electrolytes; such as, various ion exchanged β-aluminas, Li2+2xZn1-xGeO4 and silver ion conducting glasses. Of these, β-aluminas do not obey the M-N rule [26]. We studied M-N rule for NASICON-type A3TiB′P3O12 and A2.6+xTi1.4-xCd(PO4)3.4-x (A=Li, K; B′=Zn, Cd), materials and found that these materials follow the M-N rule [27], [28].

The focus of the present article is to investigate the ionic conduction and dielectric properties of yttrium doped LiZr2(PO4)3 obtained through a Pechini polymerizable complex method and also to investigate the correlation between the activation energies and pre-exponential factors of the conductivity. The main advantage of the Pechini polymerizable complex synthesis route is the molecular level mixing of metal ions which would assist with the construction of polycrystalline homogeneous nano-structures with enhanced physicochemical properties [29]. Structural properties of the Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopies with selected area electron diffraction. Electrical properties were investigated by using ac impedance spectroscopy at different temperatures. As a result, the Y3+ doped LiZr2(PO4)3 compounds showed stabilized rhombohedral structure with enhanced total ionic conductivity at 30 °C from 2.87 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 0.65 × 10−5 S cm−1 for x=0.05 to 0.20, respectively.

The NASICON-type Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 samples were prepared via Pechini-type polymerizable complex route as described elsewhere [30], [31]. Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) samples were synthesized from the stoichiometric quantities of Li(NO3) (98%, Loba Chemie), ZrOCl2·8H2O (99%, Loba Chemie), Y(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%, OTTO Chemika) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Loba Chemie) as starting materials. Initially the ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in deionized (DI) water. Citric acid (CA) was slowly mixed with the solution of ZrOCl2·8H2O to form a metal-chelate at RT. The Li(NO3) and NH4H2PO4 were dissolved in DI water. These mixtures were added to the above described solution during stirring. Finally ethylene glycol (EG) was mixed with the above solution. The molar ratio of CA/metal ions was fixed at 4:1 and also the molar ratio of EG/CA was kept 4:1. The resultant solution was heated with stirring at 60 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the temperature was slowly increased from 60 °C to 150 °C to promote an esterification between the hydroxyl groups of EG and the carboxylic acid groups of CA followed by polymerization. Then, the temperature was slowly increased from 150 °C to 250 °C and held at this temperature for 5 h to promote pyrolysis, yielding a black powder precursor. The black colour indicates that the powder contains a high amount of carbon. The black powder precursors were heated at 1200 °C for 2 h to obtain the NASICON-type structured compounds.

XRD patterns were measured with a Rigaku diffractometer with monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed on the powder precursors with a simultaneous thermal analyser (Hitachi, STA7000 series). The temperature was varied from room temperature to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min in air. The microstructure of the fine powders was examined with transmission electron microscopy (Jeol JEM 2100) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Raman spectra were recorded with a Renishaw inVia confocal Laser Raman Spectrometer. In order to correlate the microstructural properties with ion transport properties, scanning electron microscopy (JEOL JSM-6390LV) studies were carried out on the cross sections of the broken sintered pellets. For AC impedance and relative density measurements, initially the fine powders of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 were pressed in a pelletizer with a pressure of 8 tons. These pellets were then sintered at 1200 °C for 10 h. The relative density of the samples was calculated from the ratio of experimental density to theoretical density of LiZr2(PO4)3 JCPDS JCPDS#84-0998). The experimental density was obtained from measurement of weight and volume of the sintered pellet. The silver electrodes were pasted on both sides of the sintered pellets. Then silver-coated pellet was sandwiched between two electrodes of a sample holder which was placed in a microprocessor-controlled furnace. Impedance data were collected for all the samples in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 20 Hz using an LCR meter (Wayne Kerr Electronics, Model: 41100) with 100 mV of AC perturbation at different temperatures from 30 °C to 300 °C.

Fig. 1(a) displays the powder X-ray diffraction patterns for Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) obtained by Pechini-type polymerization route followed by calcination at 1200 °C for 2 h. The XRD reflections of the yttrium-doped compounds are compared with those of the pure rhombohedral phase LiZr2(PO4)3. The position of the reflections is in good agreement with that of standard NASICON-type rhombohedral structure (JCPDS#84-0998) and no impurity could be evidenced. A thermogravimetric analysis was also carried on the yttrium-doped compounds in order to confirm the formation and stability of the crystalline phase. The thermogravimetric curve for the black powder precursor of Li1.1Zr1.9Y0.1(PO4)3 shows two weight losses as shown in Fig. 1(b). The first weight loss (~ 6%) from RT to 150 °C is assigned to the release of water and organic molecules. The second weight loss (~ 12%) occurs in the range of 350–580 °C and is ascribed to burnout of the remaining organic species and formation of NASICON-type Li1.1Zr1.9Y0.1(PO4)3.

The morphology and structural features were investigated by electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. Fig. 2(a-b) displays transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Li1.1Zr1.9Y0.1(PO4)3 calcined at 1200 °C for 2 h. The TEM image (Fig. 2(a)) shows agglomerated nanoparticles with a size of less than 10 nm. Furthermore, the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 2(b)) shows well-developed lattice fringes with different orientations. The SAED pattern (inset in Fig. 2(a)) shows diffraction rings with bright spots indicating the nanocrystalline structure of the compound. SEM images of the fractured surface of the Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) pellets sintered at 1200 °C for 10 h are shown in Fig. 2(c-e). The shape of the grains is irregular, but they are in good contact with each other. Pores and voids are clearly visible in the Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 pellet for x = 0.05 (Fig. 2(c)), whereas relatively less voids are seen in the pellets for x = 0.1 and 0.2 (Fig. 2(d),(e)). The relative density of the compounds is found to be 79 ± 4% for x = 0.05, 86 ± 2% for x = 0.1 and 90 ± 3% for x = 0.2. These results reveal that the relative density of the compounds increases with increasing yttrium content. Furthermore it is considerably higher than the relative densities (74–77%) for LiZr2(PO4)3 and (85%) for Li1.275Zr1.725Al0.275(PO4)3 that are reported in literature [20], [21]. However, the very high relative density (>90%) of such samples is not easily obtainable with powders synthesized via sol-gel or solution combustion methods. Hot pressing or spark plasma sintering approaches may be helpful [32], [33].

To study the local structural order and bonding of the NASICON structure, Raman spectra were recorded with 532 nm laser irradiation and 0.3 mW power. The main Raman signals were obtained from the vibrations of PO4 groups. Basically, the PO4 tetrahedral unit offers a link between MO6 octahedral units in the NASICON structure [17]. The factor group correlation method gives 29 Raman active modes for the rhombohedral NASICON compound with R ̅c space group [34]. Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) recorded in the range of 200–1300 cm−1. The internal vibrational modes ν1, ν2 and ν3 and ν4 of the tetrahedral (PO4) unit and external modes due to vibrations of Zr atoms are labelled based on the literature as tabulated in Table 1 [34], [35], [36], [37]. The bands observed in the range 900–1250 cm−1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of the (PO4) groups (ν1 and ν3). The bands observed in the range 400–700 cm−1 are ascribed to the bending vibration of the (PO4) groups (ν2 and ν4). Thus, Raman studies confirm further the existence of (PO4) unit vibration modes for NASICON-type materials.

The real part of impedance Z′(ν) and imaginary part of impedance Z′′(ν) of samples at different temperatures were calculated from the measured magnitude of impedance │Z│ and phase angle θ by using the following equation:

where ν is the applied frequency. Nyquist plots of typical complex impedance spectra of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4(a),(b). The impedance diagrams show a depressed semicircle at high frequencies in addition to the linear behaviour or part of the depressed semicircle (at higher temperatures) in the low frequency region. Similar features are observed for other compositions of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3. Generally, the impedance characteristics of most ionic conducting granular materials are expected to be composed of sample-electrode interfaces, grain boundaries and grains. In the case of our samples, the linear region or part of the depressed semicircle in the low frequency region is observed due to the ion-blocking electrode polarization effect. It is ascribed to the accumulation of the mobile charge carriers at the electrolyte/electrode interface. A single depressed semicircle is obtained in the complex impedance plots in the high frequency region, which reveals the impedance characteristics of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2). Furthermore, a single relaxation peak is observed in all bode plots. Thus the separation of grain and grain boundary resistance from the total impedance spectra of polycrystalline Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 samples is not possible in this case. Balaya and co-workers have investigated the impedance properties of Sr-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 [18]. They also reported that the deconvolution of grain and grain boundary resistances for Sr-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 are not viable. In order to compare the impedance characteristics of the samples, the complex impedance spectra at given temperature for all compositions are shown in Fig. 4(b). The radius of the semi-circular arc decreases with x and it represents the decrease of resistivity with increasing x.

The parameters of equivalent circuit models were also fitted to the complex impedance data using Zview® (version 2.70) software. The used electrical equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a) for each temperature. The electrical properties of samples are represented by a parallel combination of a resistance (R) and a constant phase element (CPE). The impedance of CPE is given by  with parameters Q and n < 1.0 and ω (=2πν) as angular frequency. R represents the long-range ionic conduction of the sample; CPE represents the sub-diffusive ion motion on microscopic length scales [23]. CPEel is describing blocking electrode phenomena in the low-frequency region. The magnitude of the sample resistance R decreases with temperature, while Q increases with temperature and n is between 0.60 and 0.67. This shows the universal characteristics of the non-Debye behaviour of these samples [24]. The magnitude of CPEel increases with temperature. The total conductivity σt of the samples was calculated from the fitted values R, d, and A, where d is the thickness of the pellets and A is the electrode area. With Y3+ doping σt of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 at 30 °C increases from 2.87 × 10−7 S cm−1 (x = 0.05) to 6.54 × 10−6 S cm−1 (x = 0.20), i.e. by a factor of ~23. Li1.2Zr1.8Y0.2(PO4)3 exhibits a higher total conductivity in comparison with the reported values for undoped LiZr2(PO4)3 and Al-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 (8.06 × 10−7 S cm−1 [21] and 1.6 × 10−6 S cm−1 for undoped LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT [19], and 3.1 × 10−6 S cm−1 for Al-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 at RT [21]). Fig. 4(c) displays the total conductivity vs inverse temperature for Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2). The temperature-dependent total conductivity can be well described by the Arrhenius equation:(3)where σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, T is the absolute temperature, EA is the activation energy, and kB is Boltzmann constant. The σ0 and EA values are calculated from the fits shown in Fig. 4(c). EA of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 decreases with increasing x from 0.45 eV (x = 0.05) to 0.35 eV (x = 0.20). The magnitude of σ0 also changes with x. Furthermore, σ0 increases with increasing activation energy EA as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(c). The yttrium doped Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 samples obey the M-N rule. Generally the LiZr2(PO4)3 structure consists of two ZrO6 octahedral and three PO4 tetrahedral units. These units share commom corner only, resulting in a 3D network structure with suitable tunnel size for hopping of the Li+ ions. Two different lithium-ion sites, I and II, exist in the structure. In LiZr2(PO4)3 with rhombohedral structure, the I sites are fully occupied, while the II sites are completely vacant. When the tetravalent ion Zr4+ is partially substituted by an aliovalent ions (M3+), the additional Li+ ions in the Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 compound occupy the II sites [19], [20]. The partial substitution can lead to an enhancement of the lithium ion conductivity due to increasing Li+ density and caused interstitial migration with lower activation energy as proposed by Nuspl et al. [38].

Fig. 5(a) displays the typical frequency dependent conductivity, σ(ν), for Li1.05Zr1.95Y0.05(PO4)3 at various temperatures. The σ(ν) spectra show the following features: The conductivity is almost frequency-independent at low frequencies in the low-temperature region and it reveals that the ions perform an uncorrelated random hopping motions that contributes to the dc conductivity. When the frequency passes the cross over or hopping frequency νp, a dispersion in the AC conductivity is observed as νn where n < 1 [23], [24]. This dispersive conductivity implies that the ions perform correlated forward-backward motions. The AC conductivity behaviour of the samples is fitted by using the Almond-West conductivity formalism  [26] and are shown in Fig. 5(a) for Li1.05Zr1.95Y0.05(PO4)3. The DC conductivity σdc, hopping frequency νp, and n parameters are extracted from NLLS fitting approaches. The fitted σdc and νp values are increasing with increasing temperature. The frequency exponent n lies between 0.58 and 0.66, independent of temperature. The conductivity data show dispersion in the low frequency region at higher temperature due to the ion-blocking electrode effects. This is in agreement with the Nyquist impedance spectra which show a linear behaviour or a semi-circular arc in the low-frequency region and the corresponding capacitance is found on the order of 10−6 F. Similar features were observed for the other compositions of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3. Fig. 5(b) shows the σdc and the νp values of the samples as a function of inverse temperature. Both σdc and νp of the samples obey Arrhenius behaviour. Activation energies of σdc and νp deduced from the fits are shown in Fig. 5(b). The activation energy of hopping frequency Ep is in agreement with the activation energy of conductivity EA. It reveals that the ions have to overcome the same energy barriers for long range conduction (DC) as well as relaxing processes (AC).

Fig. 6(a) shows the real part of permittivity ε′(ν) as a function of frequency at different temperatures for Li1.05Zr1.95Y0.5(PO4)3. ε′(ν) at low frequencies are ascribed to the contributions of ionic and orientation polarizability to the total polarization and also to the contributions of space-charge polarization at high temperatures. The real part of permittivity at high frequency ε∞ indicates the fast electronic and vibrational polarization of the compounds. Hence ε′(ν) is found to decrease with increasing frequency, i.e. due to fast periodic reversal of the applied electric field and the contribution of charge carriers to the dielectric constant decreases. It is also observed that ε′(ν) exhibits a broad dielectric dispersion and is shifted towards the high-frequency region with increasing temperature. ε′ at 689 kHz increases with temperature as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a). Similar features are observed for other compositions. The permittivity change Δε= εs − ε∞ is directly related to the relaxation of migrating cations. Migration of cations between neighbouring sites is analogous to the rotation of a permanent electric dipole and Δε is deduced from the Debye model with suitable approximation as [39];(4)where N is the total cation concentration and the quantity in parentheses is the effective dipole moment (p = qd) of the migration of cations. No remarkable change on Δε with temperature and composition was observed. Furthermore, Δε can be related to dc and ac conduction processes through the relation by Barton, Nakajima, and Namikawa (BNN), σdc = 2πνppε0Δε where p is a numerical constant order of 1 [39]. The slope in the plot of Fig. 6(b) is equal to unity and it implies that the long and short range conduction or polarization mechanisms are well correlated. The loss factor tangent, tanδ = ε′′/ε′ describes the phase difference due to the loss of energy within the sample at a particular frequency. The frequency dependent tanδ for Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) at 110 °C is shown in Fig. 6(c). The peak maximum of tanδ shifts to the high-frequency side with increasing temperature (figure not shown here). The dielectric loss peak position is shifted to the high-frequency side with increasing yttrium content.

Furthermore, in order to understand the electrical relaxation processes of the samples, we carried out an AC conductivity scaling analysis. Frequency dependent conductivities are scaled by the DC conductivity (i.e., σ(ν)/σdc) and the frequencies are scaled by σdcT (i.e., ν/σdcT) at different temperatures which corresponds to the so-called Summerfield scaling [23]. Interestingly, the scaled frequency-dependent conductivity data are superimposed into a single curve as shown in Fig. 7 for Li1.1Zr1.9Y0.1(PO4)3. This reveals that the time-temperature superposition principle is fulfilled and suggests that the conductivity relaxation mechanism is independent of temperature [23], [24]. The same scaling features are also observed for the other compositions of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3.

A stabilized rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at room temperature is obtained by substituting zirconium for yttrium. HR-TEM with SAED studies revealed the presence of nanosized crystallites. The electrical properties of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) were investigated over wide frequency and temperature ranges. A strong correlation was found between the pre-exponential factors and activation energies of total conductivity in agreement with the Meyer-Neldel rule. The conductivity of Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 increases with yttrium concentration, while the activation energy decreases with yttrium content. A maximum total conductivity of 6.54 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature is observed for Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 with x = 0.2. No remarkable change on Δε with temperature and composition was observed. The BNN relation confirmed that the DC and AC conduction or polarization mechanisms are well correlated. The dielectric loss peak position shifted to the high-frequency side with yttrium content. The scaled AC conductivity data of the Li1+xZr2-xYx(PO4)3 compounds are merged into a single curve, except for the lower frequency region where electrode polarization effects are dominant. It suggests that the conductivity relaxation mechanism is independent of temperature. The yttrium-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 is believed to be potential candidate for fast Li+ conducting solid electrolyte.
