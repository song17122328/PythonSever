Solid electrolytes are unique functional materials in which, generally, only a single ionic species acts as the conductor and no electron or hole conduction occurs. Some solid electrolytes have in batteries and already been commercialized as a component chemical sensing devices.1,2 In the solid electrolyte ﬁeld, is accepted that ion conduction in solids greatly depends on their valence state, e.g., ion conductivity decreases with an increase in the valence state of the conducting ion. While ion conductivity high enough for practical applications has been obtained for various types of mono-,3­6 di-,7­9 and trivalent ions,10,11 higher valence tetravalent cations have been believed to be extremely poor migrating species in solids due to their strong electrostatic interaction with surrounding anions, which prevents smooth ionic migration in the rigid crystal lattice. To realize smooth tetravalent cation conduction in solids, it is necessary to carefully select not only the crystal structure, but also the constituent ions that can weaken the strong electrostatic interaction. One of the effective ways to reduce the interaction is via the introduction of higher valence cations compared to the conducting tetravalent cation into the structure, because such higher valence cations may attract anions more strongly than the tetravalent cation, thus enabling tetravalent cation migration in the solid lattice. Based on the above-described concept, pure Zr4+ and Hf 4+ ion conducting MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf ) solids were successfully developed.12­14 These solids contain pentavalent Nb5+ and P5+ and have a NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor)-type structure,5 which holds a three-dimensional framework built up by cornershared NbO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. Furthermore, it was the ion conductivity of the Hf 4+ cation was demonstrated that higher than that of the Zr4+ cation in MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf ) solids. Recently, in order to enhance the Hf 4+ ion conductivity in HfNb(PO4)3 solid, the P5+ (ionic radius: 0.031 nm [coordination (CN) = 4])15 sites in HfNb(PO4)3 solid were partially number substituted with larger size and higher valence W6+ ions (0.056 nm [CN = 4])15 to intentionally expand the crystal lattice and reduce the electrostatic interaction between the Hf 4+ cation and the surround-

ing O2¹ anions. As a result, it was demonstrated that the Hf1¹x/4NbP3¹xWxO12 (x = 0.05)16 solid showed the highest conductivity among reported Hf 4+ ion conductors.

to further enhance the Hf 4+ ion conductivity, Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids were developed, where not only the P5+ sites, but also the Nb5+ sites, were partially substituted by higher valence W6+ ions, in order to weaken the Hf 4+-O2¹ bonds more effectively, and the Hf 4+ ion conducting properties were investigated.

Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids were synthesized using a conventional solid-state reaction with Hf(SO4)2, Nb2O5, WO3, and (NH4)2HPO4 as the starting materials. After mixing these materials in an agent pot at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 3 h using a planetary ball milling apparatus (Pulverisette 7, FRITSH GmbH), the mixed powder was calcined at 600°C for 6 h, 1200°C for 6 h, and 1300°C for 6 h in an air atmosphere. The obtained samples were identiﬁed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu KA radiation (SmartLab, Rigaku). The XRD data were collected using a step scanning method in the 2ª range from 10 to 40° with a step width of 0.04°. The lattice volume of the samples was calculated from the XRD peak angles, which were reﬁned using A-Al2O3 as a standard. After identifying the crystal phase of the samples, the sample powders were pressed into a pellet shape and sintered at 1300°C for 12 h in an air atmosphere.

The AC conductivity of a sintered sample pellet with a platinum layer sputtered on both center surfaces was measured using the complex impedance method in the frequency region from 5 to 13 MHz (1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer, Solartron) at temperatures between 300 and 600°C in an air atmosphere.

DC electrolysis was carried out by applying a DC voltage of 6 V to a sample pellet sandwiched by Pt bulk electrodes at 800°C for 336 h. After DC electrolysis, the elemental distribution in the electrolyzed sample was examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; SSX-550, Shimadzu).

From the XRD measurements of the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids, it was found that a single-phase of a NASICONtype structure was obtained for the samples with [y = 0.1; 0 ¯ x ¯ 0.2], [y = 0.2; 0.05 ¯ x ¯ 0.25], and [y = 0.3; 0.1 ¯ x ¯ 0.3]. In order to conﬁrm the partial substitution of the W6+ ions in both the Nb5+ and P5+ sites, the lattice volume of the NASICON-type structure was calculated for the single-phase samples (Fig. 1). For each series with the same W6+ ion content (y) at the Nb5+ sites, a linear the NASICON-type phase was observed with an increase in the W6+ ion content (x) at the P5+ sites, suggesting that the P5+ (0.031 nm [CN = 4])15 sites in the Hf(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)(PO4)3 were partially substituted with larger W6+ ions (0.056 nm [CN = 4]).15 On the other hand, with an increase in the W6+ content (y) at the Nb5+ sites in the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids, the lattice volume monotonically decreased due to the replacement of the Nb5+ (0.078 nm [CN = 6])15 sites by the smaller W6+ (0.074 nm [CN = 6]).15 Because the solid solubility limit of the W6+ ion content (x) at the P5+ sites holding the same lattice volume increased with an increase in the W6+ ion concentration (y) at the Nb5+ sites, it was concluded that the total amount of W6+ ions in the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids can be intensively varied by partial substitution of both the Nb5+ and P5+ sites. Furthermore, it is clear that the lattice volume that can hold the NASICON-type phase for the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids is between 1.476 and 1.489 nm3.

Figure 2 shows the lattice volume dependence of

the AC conductivity at 600°C for the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids. The conductivity increased with an increase in the lattice volume up to 1.482 nm3 due to the expansion of the Hf 4+ ion conducting pathway in the crystal structure. In contrast, in the case for the solids whose lattice volume was larger than 1.482 nm3, the conductivity decreased because the lattice expanded beyond the limit for Hf 4+ ion conduction. This result clearly indicates that a suitable lattice volume exists for Hf 4+ ion conduction, and it is 1.482 nm3 for the NASICON-type solid.

Figure 3 presents the total W6+ ion concentration dependence of the AC conductivity and the activation energy for ion conduction for the Hf1¹x/4(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)P3¹xWxO12 solids ([y = 0; x = 0.05], [y = 0.1; x = 0.1], [y = 0.2; x = 0.15], and [y = 0.3; x = 0.2]) with an optimum lattice volume (1.482 nm3). An increase in conductivity and a decrease in activation energy were clearly observed with an increase in the W6+ ion concentration in the solid up to 2.0% due to the successful reduction of the electrostatic interaction between the Hf 4+ cation and the O2¹ anions, because the O2¹ anions are more strongly attracted to the high-valence W6+ ions. In contrast, the sample with [y = 0.3; x = 0.2] showed a lower conductivity and a

higher activation energy compared to those with [y = 0.2; x = 0.15], because the W6+ ion content was too high in the crystal lattice. The introduction of W6+ ions into the HfNb(PO4)3 structure leads to the shrinkage of the NbO6 octahedra and the expansion of the PO4 tetrahedra caused by the differences in the ionic sizes (W6+: 0.074 nm [CN = 6], 0.056 nm [CN = 4]; Nb5+: 0.078 nm [CN = 6]; P5+: 0.031 nm [CN = 4]),15 and therefore, the replacement of too many Nb5+ and P5+ sites by W6+ ions results in a greater than optimum content and further distortion of the network structure built by the NbO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, which has a negative effect on the smooth Hf 4+ ion migration.

For the purpose of directly identifying the migrating ion species in the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid that exhibited the highest conductivity in the prepared samples, DC electrolysis was performed by applying a DC voltage of 6 V, which is higher than the decomposition voltage (the decomposition voltage at 800°C was preliminarily determined by our experiment to be ca. 1.2 V from the current-voltage relationship). After the electrolysis, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line analysis was performed for the electrolyzed Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid (Fig. 4). Only Hf segregation was observed near the cathodic surface, while such segregation was not recognized for the other cations (Nb, P, and W). This result clearly indicates that the predominant in the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 conducting species solid is only the Hf 4+ cation, which is similar to the case for the HfNb(PO4)3 solid13 that was demonstrated to be a pure Hf 4+ ion conductor.

The temperature dependence of the Hf 4+ ion conductivity in the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid is presented in Fig. 5 with

16 and the corresponding data for 13 solids. Because both the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2HfNb(PO4)3 P2.85W0.15O12 and the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solids possess the optimum lattice volume (1.482 nm3) for Hf 4+ ion migration, the Hf 4+ ion conductivities of these samples were higher than that of the HfNb(PO4)3 solid (lattice volume: 1.478 nm3). In addition, a more effective reduction of the electrostatic interaction between the conducting Hf 4+ cation and the surrounding O2¹ anions was realized for the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid compared with that of the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid, because the substitution of Nb5+ (0.078 nm [CN = 6])15 sites with W6+ ions (0.074 nm [CN = 6])15 enabled the introduction of a higher amount of W6+

ions (0.056 nm [CN = 4])15 (ca. 3 times) into the P5+ (0.031 nm [CN = 4])15 sites in the structure. Therefore, the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid results in reduction of the activation energy (53.9 kJ·mol¹1) for Hf 4+ ion conduction in the NASICONtype structure compared to the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid in the Hf 4+ ion (58.6 kJ·mol¹1), and thus further improvement conductivity to as much as 1.2 times that of the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid at 600°C. Furthermore, the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid exhibited 2.8 times higher conductivity than that of the HfNb(PO4)3 solid at 600°C.

Highly Hf 4+ ion conducting solid electrolytes were successfully developed by the partial replacement of not only P5+ sites, but also in HfNb(PO4)3 solid with high-valence W6+ ions. Nb5+ sites, Among the samples prepared, the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid, which possessed the optimum lattice volume (1.482 nm3) for Hf 4+ ion migration, exactly the same as that for the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid previously reported, exhibited the highest Hf 4+ ion conductivity due to the more effective reduction of the Hf 4+-O2¹ interaction in the Hf3.85/4(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2P2.85W0.15O12 solid, where the W6+ ion content is seven times greater than that in the Hf3.95/4NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid.
