Lithium-ion solid electrolyte disc with high conductivity even at low temperature for electrochemical devices were designed using Li1+x+yAlxGayTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (x + y = 0–0.5) with NASICON-type structure. The solidelectrolyte discs were synthesized by a solution method at 900–1000 °C. Eﬀects of Al and/or Ga dopants and crystal structures on ionic conductivity of the solid electrolytes were investigated. Almost single phase of Li1+x+yAlxGayTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (x + y = 0–0.5) systems could be synthesized at sintering temperatures above 900 °C up to x = 0.5, y = 0.25. An ionic conductivity as high as 9.3 × 10−4 S/cm at 30 °C and activation energy of 0.29 eV were obtained with the trivalent-cation double-doped Li1.5Al0.25Ga0.25Ti1.5(PO4)3 disc sintered at 900 °C.

Recently, it becomes very important to develop high conductive solid electrolytes in the ﬁelds of environmental gas sensors which should be operative at lower temperatures [1–6]. Also, the high performance ionic conductors have been requested for all solid state batteries in the ﬁelds of automobile, IoT devices, etc. [7–9]. Lithium ion conductor especially is the most promising electrolyte for these purposes. So far, lithium ion conductors based on sulﬁde-based ceramics [10–12], garnet-type Li5La3M2O12 (M: Zr, Sn, Ta) [13,14] lithium hydride [15], lithium silicate [16] and lithium phosphate [17–19] ceramics have been investigated. On the other hand, it is well known that a three–dimensional solid electrolyte such as NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) based on the parent compound Na3Zr2P3O12 (NZP) showed a good remarkable sodium ion conductivity [20–22].

The structure of the compounds is rhombohedral with space group of R3c, in which the framework is built up by M2(PO4)3 units and two MO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra phases are shared by oxygen atoms. Thus, the NASICON-type structure is very promising as also for the lithium ion conductor.

Although lithium analogues of Na3Zr2P3O12 (NZP) [23,24] exhibits a low ionic conductivity as an Li+ ion is too small in size to migrate freely in their three-dimension network structure, the ionic conductivity for the system is greatly increased when Zr4+ in LiZr2(PO4)3 is replaced by the tetravalent ions of smaller than Li+ ion in size. In this case, tunnels in LiTi2(PO4)3 become more suitable size for the lithium ion migration [24–27]. In general, it is known that Li+ conductivity becomes higher with lower activation energy in the rhombohedral phases. It is also reported that activation energies for lithium ion motion decreases when trivalent cations (Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+) replaced with Ti4+ [27–29], such as Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP), Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LGTP), (x = 0.1–0.5). So far, trivalent cations doubly replaced with Ti4+ system, such as Li1.3Al0.3-xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.3) (LASTP) [30] and Li1.3Al0.3-xYxTi1.7(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.3) (LAYTP) [31] were tried to investigated, however clear synergy eﬀects of the doubly replacement were not observed in the view points of crystal structure.

In this paper, for developing high performance soli electrolyte transducer for sensors, we tried the use of two trivalent cations as codopants, Al3+ and Ga3+ for Li1+x+yAlxGayTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (x + y = 0–0.5) (LAGTP) system, which were not investigated so far. Interestingly, we could ﬁnd that the trivalent-cation double-doped Li1.5Al0.25Ga0.25Ti1.5(PO4)3 which was prepared by a wet-chemical route at 900 °C showed remarkable high ionic conductivity. It could be also seen that the ionic conductivity of the LAGTP series has a good relationship to the crystal structures, such as the a/c lattice ratio in the LTP-based crystals.

In summary, the partial substitution of Ti4+ site with both Al3+ and Ga3+ in the LiTi2(PO4)3 system was one of the eﬀective method for increasing of the ionic conductivity. A conductivity as high as ca. 9.3 × 10−4 S/cm at 30 °C and activation energy of 0.29 eV was obtained for the Li1.5Al0.25Ga0.25Ti1.5(PO4)3 disc prepared at 900 °C.
