Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have become the highest  potential energy storage system for large-scale applications owing to  the  high  specific  capacity,  good  safety  and  low  cost.  In  this  work,  NASICON-type  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  that  modified  by  a  uniform  carbon  layer  (NVP/C) is synthesized  via  a facile solid-state method  and  exhibited  significantly  improved  electrochemical  performance  when  working  in  an  aqueous  ZIB.  Specifically,  the  NVP/C  cathode  shows an excellent rate capacity (e.g., 48 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A g-1). Good  cycle stability is also achieved (e.g., showing a capacity retention of  88%  after  2000  cycles  at  1.0  A  g-1).  Furthermore,  Zn2+  (de)intercalation mechanism in NVP cathode is determined by various  ex-situ  techniques.  In  addition,  the  Zn

NVP/C  pouch  cell  is  also  assembled, delivering a high capacity of 89 mAhg-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and  exhibiting a superior long cycling stability. 

Recently,  lithium  ion  batteries  (LIBs)  have  dominated  the  portable electronics market (e.g., smartphones, tablet computers  and  portable  laptops)  and  have  potential  application  in  electric  vehicles  (EVs)  and  hybrid  electric  vehicle  (HEVs)  owing  to  the  advantages  of  high  energy  density  and  long  cycling  performance.[1]  It  is  anticipated  that  the  demand  for  LIBs  will  continue to rise rapidly in the upcoming decade. However, most  of the electrolytes used in LIBs are flammable organic solvents,  which have high risk of fire and is not environmental-friendly, thus  limiting  the  development  of  LIBs  severely.[2]  Compared  with  organic  electrolyte,  aqueous  electrolyte  has  the  advantages  of  being non-toxic, non-combustible, low cost and low requirements  for  the  production  environment.[3]  Most  importantly,  the  ionic  conductivity of aqueous electrolyte (~1 S cm-1) is about two orders  of magnitude higher than that of organic electrolyte (~1-10 mS cm1), which greatly improves the rate and fast-charging performance of aqueous rechargeable batteries.[4] This encourages a surge in  development of superior aqueous rechargeable batteries.  


So far, lots of aqueous rechargeable batteries on the basis of  multivalent metal-ion like Mg2+, Al3+,Ca2+ and Zn2+ batteries have  sprung up for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage owing to  their  high  storage  capacity  that  originate  from  their  polyvalent  cations  and  related  multi-electron  transfer  reactions.[5]  Amongst  several types of aqueous rechargeable batteries, Zn-ion batteries  (ZIBs) gain the highest interest due to its favorable properties of  high  theoretical  specific  capacity  (820  mAh  g-1),  low  redox  potential (-0.762 V vs. SHE), mild neutral pH electrolyte, and high  stability in water.[6] Various types of electrode materials such as  Prussian  blue  analogs,[7]  polymorphous  manganese-based  materials[8]  and  vanadium-based  materials[9]  have  been  successfully used  as  a cathode  in  ZIBs.[10]  But  the poor  cycling  stability of MnO2 polymorphs and the low capacity (<100 mAh g1)  of  Prussian  blue  analogs  hinder  their  further  research  and  widespread  application.[11]  Within  the  family  of  vanadium-based  materials,  although  vanadium-based  oxides  release  high  capacities, they generally exhibit low voltage platform and inferior  cycling  performance,  resulting  in  inferior  cycling  life  for  the  aqueous  ZIBs  system.[12]  Henceforth,  a  search  for  a  stable  and  suitable  vanadium-based  cathode  material  with  high  voltage  platform  and  excellent  long-life  cycle  and  stable  property  for  aqueous ZIBs has become an imminent task. 

Recently,  Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)  with a  NASICON  structure, a  well-known  member  of  the  vanadium-based  materials,  has  become a novel and promising cathode material for aqueous ZIBs  system due to its very stable framework, high redox voltage and  plenty of vacancies for storing metal ions.[13] However, NVP has  pretty poor electronic conductivity, resulting in its inferior specific  capacity.[14]  The  reported  performance  improvement  for  NVP  in  the literatures mainly focuses on two aspects: i) coating the active  materials with a conductive carbon layer (e.g., amorphous carbon, carbon nanotube and graphene) to enhance the electrical contact  in  the  electrode;  ii)  reducing  the  dimension  to  shorten  the  electron/ion  diffusion  paths.[15]  The  modified  NVP  composites  reported thus far exhibited significantly improved specific capacity  in aqueous ZIB system but showed unsatisfactory cycle lives and  shabby cycle stability. For instance, NVP nanoparticles wrapped  by graphene-like carbon shown a high voltage platform of 1.46 V  verse Zn/Zn2+, but suffered from poor zinc storage property (e.g.,  showing only 74% capacity retained after merely 100 cycles at a  low rate 0.5 C).[16] NVP@rGO microspheres have short cycle life  (~75%  capacity  retention  after  200  cycles  at  0.05  A  g−1)  when  used in aqueous ZIBs.[17] Another related work was the C-G-NVP  synthesized  by  Huang’s  group.  Although  co-incorporated  by  reduced graphene oxide and carbon, the C-G-NVP cathode only  retains 77% of its capacity after 200 cycles, displaying a relatively  poor  cycle  stability.[13a]  It  is  essential  to  synthesize  NVP-based  composites  that  has  a  sturdy  crystal  structure  and  exhibit  long  cycling  life  for  aqueous  ZIBs.  In  addition,  zinc-ion  pouch  cells  have  drawn  ever  more  attention  as  favorable  energy  storage  devices.


MnO2  cell,[19]  which  significantly  limited  the  development  and  the  widespread  application  of  zinc-ion  pouch  cells  in  the  further.  Therefore, demonstration of a long-cycling zinc-ion pouch cell on  the basis of the modified NVP composites is highly desirable.  

Herein,  we  developed  a  feasible  solid-phase  approach  to  synthesize a composite with steady crystal structure consisting of  NVP  submicron  particles  coated  with  conductive  amorphous  carbon (NVP/C).  Benefiting  from  the  stable  NASICON  structure  and the conductive carbon layer and the tiny NVP particles, the  designed  NVP/C  composite  delivered  a  satisfactory  specific  capacity of 130 mAh g-1 at 0.05 A g−1 in the voltage range of 0.51.7  V  versus  Zn2+/Zn.  It  also  showed  outstanding  zinc  storage  property in terms of excellent rate behavior (48 mAh g-1 at 1.0 A  g-1) and superior cycle stability (88% retention after 2000 cycles  at  1.0  A  g-1).  Furthermore,  the  Zn2+  intercalation/deintercalation  mechanism in the NVP/C cathode was also studied by techniques  of  ex-situ  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  and  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD).    Finally,  NVP/C-based  pouch  cells  were  also  assembled and shown to exhibit a superior long cycling stability  (89 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 85% based on  the stable stage (50th cycle) after 1000 cycles). In addition, this  synthesis  method  is  simple  in  operation  and  can  easily  reach  industrial  output  to  satisfy  the  need  of  large-scale  application.  Therefore, this work is meaningful for the development of NVPbased applicable ZIBs for large-scale energy storage. 


The XRD pattern (Figure 1a) showed the crystalline nature of the  as-prepared composite and all the diffraction peaks are indexed  to  Na3V2(PO4)3  phase  (JCPDS  No.  53-0018)  with  a  NASICONstructure  (space  group:  R-3c).  Raman  spectroscopy  was  investigated and confirmed the existence of carbon, as shown in  Figure  1b.  It  can  be  seen  that  there  were  prominent  peaks  at  wavenumbers  around  1593  cm-1  (G-band)  and  1336  cm-1  (Dband),  which  correspond  to  ordered  sp2  hybridized  carbon  and  disordered  sp3,  respectively.  The  D/G  intensity  ratio  (ID/IG)  was  calculated  to  be  around  0.97,  indicating  that  the  citric  acid  monohydrate  can achieve a  great  degree of  graphitization  as  a 



As illustrated in  Figure 3a, the CV curves were obtained at a scan rate of 0.1 mV  s-1. An oxidation peak in the first cycle at about 1.48 V vs. Zn2+/Zn  was observed and can be ascribed to the Na+ deintercalation from  the host of NVP. Subsequent cycles showed a pair of redox peaks  (1.05 and 1.42 V), which are caused by the Zn2+ (de)intercalation  into/from  the  NaV2(PO4)3  framework  structure.[20]  Besides,  the  overlapped  profiles  implied excellent  reversibility  of  Zn2+ uptake  and removal reaction and the stable framework structure during  the cycling process.  

Additionally,  it  is  also  noted  that  the  charge-discharge  plateaus  were  consistent  well  with  above  CV  analysis.  As  displayed in Figure 3b , the first charge plateau at ~1.30 V  was  correlated  to  Na+  withdrawal  from  the  NVP,  whereas  the  subsequent lower charge plateau (1.25 V) is relatively low, which  is  originated  from  Zn2+  extraction.[18a,  20]  On  the  other  hand,  the  unique discharge voltage plateau at near 1.1 V was attributed to  the insertion of Zn2+ into the lattice. Figure 3c exhibits the cycling  performance  of  a  Zn//NVP/C  battery  at  0.05  A  g−1  between  0.5  and 1.7 V, which delivered a reversible discharge capacity of 130  mAh g-1 for the first cycle and then decreases slowly to 86 mAh g1 after 50 cycles. Notably, the capacity rapidly decreased during  the first several cycles due to the lattice distortion caused by Zn2+  insertion, thus reducing the active sites and zinc storage capacity  at early stage.[20] 

To systematically study the electrochemical performance of  our  NVP/C  electrode,  2032-type  coin  cells  were  initially  assembled  using  3  M  Zn(CF3SO3)2  aqueous  electrolyte  and   

To further explore the electrochemical kinetics of the NVP/C  electrode, CV curves at varying scan rates from 0.1 to 1.2 mV s-1  were  collected  (Figure  3d).  As  well-documented  in  previous  reports,[13a,  20]  one  pair  of  redox  peaks  can  be  attributed  to  the  V3+/V4+  the  capacitive  contribution on the surface was investigated in detail. In principle,  the current of CVs obeys an empirical power-law relationship with  the scan rate (described as: ⅈ = 𝑎𝜈𝑏), where ⅈ is current and 𝜈 is  scan rate.[21] After fitting, the b values of peaks 1 and 2 calculated  from  the  curves  are  0.57  and  0.7,  which  elucidates  that  the  corresponding  redox  reactions  are  diffusion-dominated  process  (Figure 3e). 

system, our NVP/C can be employed as a promising cathode for  zinc storage. 

Furthermore, as displayed in Figure 4, ex-situ XRD and XPS  techniques were employed to study the zinc storage mechanism  of the NVP/C electrode. For the XRD pattern measured at the first  fully  charged  state  (Figure  4a),  all  the  diffraction  peaks  were  shifted to higher 2θ positions except for the reflections  from the  carbon  nanotube  (CNT)  additive  and  current  collector  (Ti  foil),  indicating  that the lattice parameters  were  shrunk.  According  to  the previously reports,[18a, 20] this phenomenon is closely related  to the Na+ ions extraction from Na3V2(PO4)3 to form a new phase  of  NaV2(PO4)3  with  maintaining  its  parent  NASICON  structure.  (Zn2+  Furthermore,  when  intercalation), these peaks were almost returned to their original  positions. Afterwards, similar phase transition behavior was also  observed  during  the  second  cycle,  suggesting  the  excellent  structural  stability  of  the  NASICON  framework  and  the  superior  reversibility of Zn2+ storage in NVP. 
 
Meanwhile, as revealed in Figure 4b, c, the detailed valence  change of sodium and vanadium in NVP at different states were  investigated. Apparently, the normalized intensity of Na 1s region  at fully charged and discharged states was lower than that of the  original state (Figure 4b), implying that Na+ deintercalation was an  irreversible process.  On the other hand, as presented in  Figure  4c,  the  vanadium  valence  in  the  pristine  NVP  was  fitted  to  V3+  signal (517.0 eV), and it evolved into a mixed state of V3+ and 


V4+ (517.9 eV) after full charging.[18a, 22a, 22b, 23] On the subsequent  discharging  process,  V4+  was  fully  reduced  to  V3+,  indicating  highly reversible V3+/V4+ redox reaction in NVP. 


To keep pace with the increasing requirement of large-scale  energy storage devices, it is crucial to develop advanced power  supplies.  For  demonstration,  Zn

NVP/C  pouch  cells  were  assembled  by  sandwiching  the  fiberglass  separator  and  waterbased  electrolyte  between  the  NVP/C  cathode  and  Zn  foil,  and  then used for lighting a red LED lamp. As shown in Figure 5a, the  red lamp can be successfully lighted by the assembled pouch cell  at various bending states and recovered flat state, indicating that  arbitrary  bending  degree  have  negligible  effect  on  the  practical  application  of  our  soft-packaged  aqueous  zinc-ion  battery. 


NVP/C  pouch  cells,  they  were  evaluated  by  galvanostatic  chargedischarge  cycling.  Impressively,  their  GCD  profiles  within  the  voltage range of 0.5-1.7 V exhibits similarity to those of the coin cell (Figure 5b,c). Moreover, the dQ/dV curves (Figure 5d) derived  from the 2nd cycle exhibit two pairs of redox peaks at low current  density of 0.05 A g-1, consisting of   two cathodic peaks (around  1.25 and 1.05 V) and two anodic peaks (~1.28 and 1.37 V), which  are associated with the two-step Zn2+ (de)intercalation processes.  When the current density increased to 0.1 A g-1, the broadened  peaks  are  demonstrated,  indicating  relatively  high  polarization.  Additionally, the pouch cells show good capacity retention upon  cycling. As shown in Figure 5e, a specific capacity of 94 mAh g-1  was  still  available  at  the  current  density  of  0.05  A  g-1  after  100  cycles, corresponding to a 85% capacity retention. At a rate of 0.1  A  g-1,  a  reversible  discharge  capacity  of  73  mAh  g-1  could  be  maintained  after  100  cycles.  More  importantly,  at  the  relatively  high rate of 0.2 A g-1, although the capacity is rapidly decreased  at the initial stage (probably due to the  lattice distortion  and the  information of zinc dendrites[24]), it is stabilized at around 40 mAh  g-1 from the 50th to 1000th cycles with almost no capacity fading    (Figure 5g and Figure S1). Such stable performance is superior to  that of most reported aqueous zinc-ion pouch cells.[25] 



In  summary,  we  have the  outstanding  electrochemical performance of  the  NVP/C  composite  prepared  through a feasible solid-state reaction. The inventive design not  only enhanced the surface conductivity and the electrical contact  in  the  electrode  with  the  help  of  a  conductive  carbon  layer,  but  also reduced the electron/ion transport lengths and promote their  fast diffusion with the strategy of refining submicron particles. As  a  result,  the  NVP/C  composite  not  only  shows  excellent  rate  behavior (130 and 48 mAh g-1 at 0.05 and 1.0 A g-1, respectively)  and good cycling stability (88% retention after 2000 cycles at 1 A  g-1)  of  the  assembled  button  batteries,  but  also  represents  the  unique long cycling stability (89 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with a capacity  retention  of  85  %  based  on  the  stable  stage  (50th  cycle)  after  1000 cycles) of the assembled pouch cells. This work provides a  new thought and reliable intercalation mechanisms support for the  future development of cathode materials for aqueous ZIBs system.
