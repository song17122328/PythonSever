The NASICON series, with formula Bax/2Li1-xTi2(PO4)3 (0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1), has been prepared by solid-state reaction and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman, nuclear magneticresonance (NMR) and impedance spectroscopy (IS).
XRD patterns of samples indicated the formation of single phases with rhombohedral structure (space group R-3c).
The Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns was performed to deduce location ofLi and Ba ions.
FTIR, Raman, and NMR techniques showed the only presence of isolated PO4 groups in analyzed phosphates.
31P MAS-NMR spectra were used to investigate Liand Ba distribution and 7Li MAS-NMR spectra to discriminatedLi ions with different mobility in conduction paths.
Amaximum total conductivity of 2.5 × 10−7 S cm−1 and a minimum activation energy of 0.47 eV were obtained at room temperature for Ba0.3Li0.4Ti2(PO4)3 (x = 0.6).
Bax/2Li1-xTi2(PO4)3 (0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1) samples have been preparedby solid-state reaction and characterized by XRD, FT-IR,Raman, NMR, and IS techniques.
All samples display therhombohedral R-3c space group.
The vibration modes of isolatedphosphate tetrahedra have been studied by IR andRaman spectroscopies.
31P and 7Li MAS-NMR spectra ofsamples show, in agreement with structural Rietveld refinements,that Li and Ba are located at M1 positions.
In the caseof Li ions, however, they shift toward triangular windows thatrelates M1 and M2 positions (M1′ sites) and decreases Li–Odistances from 2.7 to 2.1 Å.
Structural refinements performed have been used to investigateLi coordination, bottleneck geometry and arrangementof vacancies in the NASICON Bax/2Li1-xTi2(PO4)3 series.
Liconductivity is the consequence of the lithium hopping betweenadjacent M1 sites, whose probability increases withlithium and M1 vacancy concentrations.
The incorporationof Ba increases M1 vacancy, enhancing Li mobility; however,increasing amounts of Ba reduce the charge carrier concentration,blocking conduction paths.
As a result of both facts,lithium displays a maximum of mobility at intermediatecompositions.
From electric impedance study, activation energies decreasedand conductivity increased with the Li content up tox = 0.6. A maximum total conductivity of 2.5 × 10−7 S cm−1and a minimum activation energy of 0.47 eV have been measuredin Ba0.3Li0.4Ti2(PO4)3 (x = 0.6) sample at 298 K.
