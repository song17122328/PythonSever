Rare earth (Eu3+) doped Nasicon type compositions, Ca0.5Fe1 − xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were synthesized by semi sol–gel method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. All the three compositions were crystallized in hexagonal lattice with space group R 3­. The time independent (DC) conductivity measurements were carried out in the temperature range 300–623 K. The activation energies for conduction were deduced from the Arrhenius plots. The luminescence properties and local structure of Eu3+ doped Nasicons were investigated by means of emission spectra and phonon sidebands.

The development of solid electrolytes has been given a strong improvement by the discovery of Nasicon, is an acronym for Sodium (Na) super (s) ionic (i) conductor (con). Its original composition is a solid solution of NaZr2P3O12 and Na4Zr2Si3O12 and it is represented by Na1 + xZr2P3−xSixO12 (0≤x≤3) [1]. The special attraction of the Nasicon lies in its structure. The general formula of Nasicon is written as AMM′ (PO4)3, where the site “A” can be occupied by alkali ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+), alkaline earth ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+), H+, +, Cu+, Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Al3+, H3O+, NH4 Ln3+ (Ln=rare earth), Ge4+, Zr4+, Hf4+ and it can also be vacant. The M and M′ sites are occupied by di (Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Co2+), tri (Fe3+, Sc3+, Ti3+, V3+, Cr3+, Al3+, In3+, Ga3+, Y3+, Lu3+), tetra (Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf4+, Sn4+, Si4+, Ge4+) and penta (V5+, Nb5+, Ta5+, Sb5+, As5+) valent transition metal ions. The P site can be partially substituted by Si. Thus, the structure is ﬂexible for substitution at A, M, M′ and P sites giving rise to a large number compounds for a comparative study. All these compounds share the same topology in their framework irrespective of the presence of sodium or exhibition of high ionic conduction.

Majority of Nasicon type systems can crystallize in hexagonal or lattices and few of them crystallize in monoclinic, rhombohedral langbeinite, garnet, SW type (orthorhombic scandium wolframate Sc2 (WO4)3) lattices. Its structure consists a three-dimensional rigid framework with M(M′)O6 octahedra and PO4 (SiO4) tetrahedra sharing common corners. This 3-D framework contains interconnected channels in which the mobile conducting ions are encapsulated at “A” sites. The interstitial spaces of the tunnels provide the conduction pathway for the mobile ions [2].

Initially, Nasicon has been discovered as high ionic conducting material and later explored rapidly due to its interesting properties and potential applications such as membranes, fuel cells, gas sensors, catalyst supports, near zero thermal expansion, host material for radioactive waste, ion exchange and intercalation/deintercalation reactions [3–12]. In general, properties of any material depend on its purity and composition. Most of the Nasicon type systems have been synthesized by conventional solid state method at high temperatures. The conventional method of heating the stoichiometric amounts of reactants at high temperatures leads to inhomogeneity, impurities, defects and large distribution in the particle size. The literature cites many ways to prepare phase pure materials by sol–gel, co-precipitation, molecular precursor based approach, hydrothermal and ﬂux methods [13–15].

The conventional synthesis, crystal structures and properties of numerous Nasicon type materials have been reported. However, low temperature synthesis and luminescence in crystalline Nasicon matrix have been studied in very few cases [16]. Earlier, we have explored several Nasicon type systems by solid state method [2]. In this paper, we report the semi sol–gel synthesis, temperature dependence of ionic conductivity and luminescence studies of the compositions, Ca0.5Fe1− xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2).

Three Nasicon type compositions, Ca0.5Fe1 − xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) were synthesized by Pechini type semi sol–gel method from the stoichiometric amounts of AR grade chemicals, CaCO3, Sb2O5, Fe2O3, Eu2O3 and NH4H2PO4. Initially, stoichiometric amounts of CaCO3, Fe2O3 and Eu2O3 were converted in to water soluble nitrate forms by dissolving in concentrated nitric acid (SD Fine Chemicals Ltd.). Excess nitric acid was removed by slow heating. After that, all chemicals were mixed together in water. Subsequently citric acid was added to this resultant solution in 2:1 mole ratio of citric acid to metals. Except Sb2O5, all other chemicals dissolve in water, so called it is semi sol–gel method. The pH of the resultant metal citrate solution was adjusted to 6–7 by adding dilute ammonia solution drop wise. The solution was then slowly evaporated on a hot plate with stirring till a viscous liquid was obtained. At this stage gelating reagent viz., ethylene glycol was added in 1:1.2 mole ratio of citric acid to ethylene glycol. This mixture was heated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 2–3 h with constant stirring. When the solution started solidifying and forming a gel like porous mass, the temperature was gradually increased to 160– 180 °C till a solid mass was obtained. This porous solid mass thus obtained was ground in an agate mortar using spectral grade acetone. This ground solid precursor was heated at 400 °C (10 h), 600 °C (10 h) and 800 °C (15 h) in a mufﬂe furnace with an intermediate grinding after each heat treatment for obtaining the ﬁnal product. All these steps are shown in the form of a ﬂow chart (Fig. 1).

The powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded at room temperature on Philips X'pert Analytical X-ray diffractometer using Nickel ﬁltered Co-Kα radiation of wavelength 1.7903 Å. The 2θ ranged from 10° to 80° with increments of 0.003° and a counting time of 5 s. The XRD patterns were indexed and calculated lattice parameters from the d-spacing of the powder pattern using a least squares minimization program “POWD” developed by Wu [17]. Cylindrical pellets (≈10 mm diameter and ≈4 mm thickness) of the samples were obtained by applying uniaxial pressure of 200 MPa and sintered at 750 °C for 24 h. Density of the samples in the form of well sintered pellets was experimentally measured by Archimedes principle using xylene as an immersion liquid. The DC conductivities in the temperature range 300–623 K were measured using a two-probe method on the sintered pellets coated with silver paint. A conventional sample holder and Kiethley Electrometer 610C were used. The bulk DC conductivity was calculated by measuring the bulk resistance and sample dimensions. The emission spectra were recorded with JASCO FP-777 spectroﬂuorometer. The maximum absorption was observed at ≈395 nm for all the three samples. Therefore, the excitation wave length was ﬁxed at 395 nm to record the emission spectra. Appropriate optical ﬁlters were used to avoid the noise due to the instrument and the background.

The room temperature powder X-ray diffractograms of three compositions under investigation are shown in Fig. 2. The peak positions of these compositions are similar to that of parent compound, Ca0.5FeSb(PO4)3 and free from lines due to unreacted reactants or undesired products [18]. The compound, Ca0.5FeSb (PO4)3 is crystallized in hexagonal lattice with R3̄ space group. Therefore assuming hexagonal lattice parameters are derived by least squares minimization program. The lattice parameters thus obtained are very close to that of parent compound as well as other Nasicon systems. The lattice parameters along with the observed and calculated density values are given in Table 1.

Fig. 3 shows the variation of DC conductivity with temperature for the samples Ca0.5FeSb(PO4)3 and Ca0.5Fe0.9Eu0.1Sb(PO4)3 and a linear relationship is obtained. The DC conductivity is a temperature activated property and is found to obey the Arrhenius dependence given by the equation, σdcT = σ0exp −Ea = kT where σ0 is the conductivity at inﬁnite temperature, T is the absolute temperature, Ea is the activation energy for conduction and k is the Boltzmann's constant. The activation energies and maximum conductivities obtained at 623 K are 0.84 eV, 6.21 × 10−4 S/cm and 0.76 eV, 5.86×10−3 S/cm for Ca0.5FeSb(PO4)3 and Ca0.5Fe0.9Eu0.1Sb (PO4)3 respectively. This result indicates that the doped Eu3+ enhances the ion conductivity of Ca0.5FeSb(PO4)3. The increase in conductivity could be due to two reasons i.e. (a) porosity of the sintered pellets decreases considerably by the substitution of M3+ and (b) the larger doped ions (Eu3+) can generate a small amount of secondary phase at grain boundary, which increases the pellet density [19]. The same trend is observed in their density values (Table 1). It is found that the conductivity enhancement is not that much signiﬁcant with increase in concentration of Eu3+ ion.

Fig. 4 shows the energy level diagram of Eu3+ ion. The ground state of Eu3+ (4f6) ion is 7F0. There are several low laying excited energy 5D2 and levels. The ﬁrst few excited states are 7F1, 7F2, 7F3, 7F4, 5D0, 5D1 5D3. A few more excited states exist above 5D3 followed by a charge transition region. The expected emission transitions for Eu3+ ion are 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0→ 7F1, 5D0→ 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3 and 5D0→ 7F4. These transitions generally occur at ≈17,350, 16,975, 16,310, 15,460 and 14,480 cm−1 respectively.

Fig. 5 shows the emission spectra of Ca0.5Fe1 − xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) recorded in the region 550–670 nm. The spectral futures are similar to each other and have (i) a less intense peak at 579 nm (17,270 cm−1), (ii) doublet type two intense peaks at 590 nm (16,950 cm−1) and 594 nm (16,835 cm−1), (iii) very intense peak at 614 nm (16,285 cm−1) and (iv) a less intense peak at 650 nm (15,384 cm−1). A less intense peak observed at 17,270 cm−1 is due to 5D0→ 7F0 transition. The doublet type emission peaks located near 16,950 cm−1 and 16,835 cm−1 correspond to magnetic dipole transitions, 5D0→ 7F1 and these are characteristic of orange emission expected for Eu3+ ion. An intense peak at 16,285 cm−1 is due to hypersensitivity and electric dipole nature of the 5D0→ 7F2 transitions and it is expected red emission for Eu3+ ion [20]. The integrated emission intensity ratio of transitions corresponds to red and orange regions (R/O ratio) are strongly inﬂuenced by site asymmetry and covalency of the bands with the ligand anions.

The magnitude of this ratio gives an idea about the local symmetry of the Eu3+. This ratio is found to be in the range 1.75–4.5 [21]. For centro symmetric Eu3+ ion, this ratio is 0.67 and a larger value implies larger distortion from cubic symmetry [22–25]. The relative intensity ratio (R/O ratio) for current samples is found to be ∼2.4 which is in the lower part of the above range indicating relatively symmetric near octahedral environment for Eu3+ in the Nasicon lattice. The weak emission peak observed at 15,385 cm−1 is due to the 5D0→ 7F3 transition.

The excitation spectra of Ca0.5Fe1 − xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) are shown in Fig. 6. The low intensity peaks in the high energy side of the 7F2→ 5D0 transition are identiﬁed as the phonon side bands and these are useful to investigate the local structure of surrounding rare-earth ions [26]. These low intensity transitions are found at a distance of 595 and 1215 cm−1. These transitions correspond to the sum of the energies of the 7F2→ 5D0 transition and the excess energy of the vibrational mode characteristic of the crystalline matrix. The energy gap between the phonon side band and the pure electron transition, 7F0→ 5D2, corresponds to the energy of one phonon (ℏω) and is equal to lattice vibrational energy of crystalline matrix. In the present investigation, this energy difference is equal to 1215 cm−1 (26,595–25,380 cm−1=1215 cm−1). The phonon side band spectrum could be ﬁtted into three Gaussians (Fig. 6 interior picture). The integrated intensity ratio of the phonon side band to the pure electron transition 7F0→ 5D2 corresponds to the electron phonon coupling strength, g [26]. The relative intensity ratio (g) for all the three compositions are found to be ∼0.23. This value is higher than the g value obtained in Eu3+ doped Nasicon type phosphate glasses [27,28] and close to the borate and phosphate crystals [21].

Eu3+ doped Nasicon type compositions, Ca0.5Fe1 − xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x=0.1, 0.15 and 0.2) could be synthesized by semi sol–gel method at low temperatures. Attempts to substitute with xN0.2 led to impurity phases. The powder XRD studies showed that all the three compositions are isomorphous with the parent compound, Ca0.5FeSb(PO4)3, crystallizing in the hexagonal lattice with space group R 3­. The conductivity of Nasicon increases by doping the larger ions like Eu3+ in place of smaller M3+ ions. The integrated emission intensity ratio of Eu3+ transitions corresponds to red and orange regions (R/O ratio) indicates symmetric octahedral environment for Eu3+ ion in the Nasicon lattice. The phonon assisted side bands in the excitation spectra are in consistent with the vibrational modes of phosphate group. The electron-phonon coupling strength values are found to be more in crystalline Nasicon systems in comparison to the glassy Nasicon systems.
