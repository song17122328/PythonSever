A visible-light-driven photocatalyst based on the well-known cathode material of NASICON-type Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 was prepared by a modiﬁed Pechini method. The sample was characterized by X-ray diﬀraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis absorption spectrum. The average size of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 particle is below 50 nm. NASICON nanoparticles Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 has an eﬃcient absorption in the UV-visible light wavelength region with a direct allowed electronic transition of 2.07 eV. The photocatalytic properties of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 were evaluated by the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 has an eﬃcient photocatalytic activity and could be a potential photocatalyst driven by visible-light. The photocatalytic activity was discussed on the optical absorption and special hexagonal tunnel structure connected by optical active centers of MoO4 and NiO6 and its good conductivity.

NASICON is an acronym for the compounds with for0 = Ni, Co, Mn, Fe, or V and X = Mo, W, P or S]. It is a covalent network consisting by 0 O6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra sharing common corM ners in three dimensions.1 The alkali metal ions Li+, Na+ can occupy interstitial sites, which can easily move along the conduction channels in the c-axis direction. NASICON materials have been intensively investigated as electrode materials for lithium batteries Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. Moreover, the framework can be stable to undergo a topotactic insertion/extraction of a mobile atom due to the availability of an open three-dimensional framework. Consequently, NASICON materials have been intensively investigated as electrode materials for rechargeable lithium batteries.

Among the NASICON systems, molybdenum (VI) compounds such as Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 has been paid attention due to the existence of Mo6+/Mo4+ redox couple, which can oﬀer electron transfer during the electrochemical reaction of Li+ insertion/extraction.3–5 As a new lithiated NASICONtype polyanion material, Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure (space group Pmcn), which provides a wide hexagonal tunnel for Li+ ions to move in and out of the structure. Begam et al. reported that Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 phase has a high-voltage redox behavior with a discharge capacity of 115 mAh/g.6,7 Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 is intriguing in the rechargeable lithium ion technology as a potential cathode materials for lithium batteries.4,6–9

Visible-light response semiconductors have attracted many interests as eﬃcient photocatalysts.10–12 It has been demonstrated that the Group-VA transition metals (W, Mo, Ti, et al.) containing complex oxides, can absorb incident light and present eﬃcient photocatalytic activities.13 Great eﬀorts have been made on the synthesis, characterization, structural, and photocatalytic activities of these compounds, such as Ag4V2O7,14 LiMg0.5Ti0.5O2,15 BiOCl/Ag3PO4,16 TiO2,17,18 21 Na2Ca2Nb4O13,19 g-NbO3,20 CsBiNb2O7, and CsBi2Nb5O16. 13,22–24 In this structure, there are active optical cenBiVO4. ters related to Niand Mo-containing complexes. It is reasonable that photo-induced exciton can be easily created by the possible d–d transition or by charge-transfer (CT) transition from O-2p orbital to 3d orbital of Ni2+ or Mo6+.25,26 Moreover, week or no luminescence indicates a weak recombination of the exciton in the kinetic process. A long lifetime of the exciton could be expected, which give more chances for electron–hole separations to further react with dye molecules.

Herein, NASICON lithium nickel molybdate Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanopowders as a new photocatalyst could be prepared by the Pechini method. The sample was investigated by the crystal phase, morphologies, and UV–vis absorption. The eﬃcient optical absorption and photocatalytic activity was conﬁrmed by degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible irradiation.

Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nano-powders were prepared by the Pechini method on the base of citrate-complexation route. Firstly, the stoichiometric raw materials, LiNO3, Ni(NO3)26H2O, and (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O, were dissolved in deionized water, respectively. The nitrate solution was complexed by citric acid with double molar weight of the Li+ and Ni2+ ions. The solution was neutralized by ammonium hydroxide and promoted by heat treatment at 85°C–95°C for 2 h. Then the three solutions were mixed well. And a certain amount of aqueous polyvinylalcohol was slowly added to adjust the viscoelastic of the mixed solution. The sticky mixture was spin coated on several clean glasses. The wind-dried thin ﬁlm can be obtained by natural withering the coated glasses. Finally, the spin-coated ﬁlm was annealed to the desired temperature (800°C) producing Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 powder with the heating rate of 3°C/min, held there for 6 h in the air and cooled to room temperature naturally.

The XRD pattern was collected on a Rigaku D/Max (Rigaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) diﬀractometer operating at 40 kV, 30 mA with Bragg–Brentano geometry using CuKa radiation (k = 1.5405 A). Structural reﬁnements of X/ray diﬀractogram were made using the general structure analysis system (GSAS) program. Diﬀuse reﬂection spectra were taken on a Cary 5000 UV–Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (varian, Palo Alto, CA) by using BaSO4 powder as a standard reference. The microstructure morphology of the samples was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-6700F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The surface area was measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K using a Quantachrome NOVA 1000 (Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL) Surface Area and Pore Size Analyzer. A ﬁve-point nitrogen adsorption isotherm was used to determine the BET surface area of the catalysts.

Photocatalysis experiments were carried out in a quartz beaker, ﬁlled with MB solution (100 mL and 10–40 mg/L) containing the catalyst (0.25 g/L). A 300 W Xenon lamp with a UV cut-oﬀ ﬁlter (JB450) (ﬁlter glass, Shanghai Nonferrous Glass Ltd., Shanghai, China) was positioned about 10 cm beside the photo-reactor. Prior to visible light irradiation, the suspension was ultrasonicated for 40 min in dark to favor the adsorption and desorption equilibration. The concentration of MB was analyzed by recording the absorption band maximum (664–666 nm) in the absorption spectra and taken as the initial concentration (C0). During the photocatalysis, 7 mL of the suspension was extracted at an interval of 10 min, and the absorption was measured after 5 min of centrifugation. The concentration of MB after photocatalysis was taken as C. The normalized temporal concentration changes (C/C0) of MB were obtained.

To analyze the pyrolysis behavior and crystallization process, the TG-DSC curves of the precursor of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 were measured as shown in Fig. 1. This conﬁrms the weight loss of the precursor taking place from room temperature to about 900°C in the TG curve. It is apparent that there are three rough stages in the whole operated temperature range according to TG-DSC curves. The ﬁrst stage can be assigned to the slight loss of about 15% from 20°C to approximate 300°C in the TG curve, which mostly corresponds to the loss of the water. The second stage can be found from 200°C to about 500°C with the ﬂat loss of about 5%, which is attributed to the decomposition of the organic complex. Then, the mass continue to decrease with the exothermic peak around 570°C in the DSC curve extended to 900°C. Simultaneously, Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 phase starts to be formed.

The observed diﬀraction peaks of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 are shown in Fig. 2, which well match with the standard card PDF#31-0731 selected in the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database. No impurity lines were observed. However, it is well-known that the real microstructure of a sample is not completely in coincidence with the corresponding standard card, and the real microstructure has very important eﬀects in the evaluation of the physical and the TG-DSC curves of the precursor of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3.

chemical properties. It is necessary to get real structural parameters of a real sample. Consequently, the structural reﬁnement of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 was carried out by using GSAS program on the base of the experimental XRD pattern. Figure. 2 is a representative experimental and calculated X-ray diﬀraction proﬁle of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. The reﬁned parameters and the atomic coordinates are given in Table I and II, respectively. The sample crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with the space group of Pmcn (62). The unit parameters

grains of nano nature (average size < 50 nm). Figure 3(d) is the EDS measurement to examine the elemental compositions on the sample. Several speciﬁc lines show the signals of Ni, Mo, and O elements. The average Ni/Mo ratio was calculated to be about 0.625, which is in agreement with the theoretical stoichiometric value in the chemical formulae of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. Li is the lightest metallic element and cannot be detected. The speciﬁc surface area and an average pore volume of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles were measured to be 81.7 m2/g and 0.0648 cm3/g, respectively.

The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles is shown in Fig. 5. It shows three distinct absorption bands, that is, I: <400 nm, II: 400–550 nm, and III: 600–800 nm. Absorption III can be unambiguously assigned to be the spin allowed d–d transitions from the Ni2+ ions in octahedral environment, that is, 3A2 g(F)?3T1 g(F).27 While bands II and III form the band-gap transitions, that is, one is from CT transitions inside MoO4 groups, and another is the spin allowed d–d transitions from the Ni(II) ion in octahedral environment of 3A2 g(F)?3T1 g(P).25,27

It has reported that wavelength positions of CT band from MoOx groups depend on coordination number (CN) x.28 Dutta et al.29 gave a summary on CT extension methodologies from the characteristics of tungstates and molybdates including tetragonal, hexagonal, monoclinic, orthorhombic, cubic, and triclinic structures. CNs of Mo in hosts can shift CT band to longer wavelengths. A cubic crystalline phase with MoO6 groups could provide the longer CT wavelength. So far the longest CT band edge (480 nm) has been reported in cubic molydate host, for example, (Gd,Y)6MoO6, which provides CT-absorbing groups of MoO6.29 Molydates with other structure type show shorter CT band edges, for example, 320 nm (from MoO4) in orthorhombic Gd2(MoO4)3, 330 nm (from MoO4) in tetragonal CaMoO4, 400 nm (from MoO4) in monoclinic Gd2MoO6, 430 nm (from MoO6) in hexagonal Y6MoO6.

It is reasonable that the CT edge in Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 locates in UV to near-UV wavelength region, not extending to blue region, because the host lattice is orthorhombic with MoO4 framework (low coordination number). Consequently, the absorption band I is suggested to be from CTB in MoO4

c = 5.0960(5) A, are a = b = c = 90° and V = 938.06(6) A3. This is in agreement report:9 a = 10.423(3) A, b = 17.525 with Ozima et al.’s (4) A, and V = 926.83 (39) A3.

Figure 3 displays the structure sketch map of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3, which was modeled using the Diamond Crystal and Molecular Structure Visualization software on the basis of the atomic coordinate’s data from the XRD reﬁnements listed in Table II. The structural framework is composed of metal–oxygen octahedra and trigonal prisms (where Li and Ni reside) which are interconnected by MoO4 tetrahedra. The hexagonal motif of Mo tetrahedra around Ni octahedral joined by their faces is clearly seen in Fig. 3. Lithium atoms may occupy sites between or within the layers.1

The typical SEM images of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles in two magniﬁcation are shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b). The sample nano-particles. Figure 4(c) is a representative transmission electron microscopy image. The particles reveal the formation of spherical

The photocatalytic degradation of MB by Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles under visible light is shown in Fig. 6. A blank experiment was investigated in absence of the catalyst under the visible light irradiation. It shows that only a very small quantity of dye was degraded for the blank experiment. However, the MB content shows a fast decrease of 90% in 40 min in the presence of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles. The kinetic constant was determined from the pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction rate equation of ln(C0/Ct) = kt, where C0 is initial concentration of MB, Ct is concentration of MB at time t, k is kinetic constant. Inset Fig. 6 shows the plot of ln(C0/Ct) versus kt. The good linear ﬁt indicates that the kinetics of the degradation reaction is controlled dominantly by a pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction. The kinetic constant of MB deg 1). radation by Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles (k = 0.031 min The ratio of kinetic constants to the speciﬁc surface area is  2. This value can be obtained from the 3.8 9 10 reported parameters of some photocatalysts for the degradation of MB under visible light radiation, for example, gC3N4 Bi2O3 [0.0253/7.77 = 0.0032 min [0.024/  2].38 This indicates that the photocata3.00 = 0.008 min lytic activity of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles is not enough high by taking into the speciﬁc surface area.

groups, that is, a CT from O2  ligand to Mo6+ ions,30 that inter-band energy formed by the 4d orbitals of Mo6+ is, (bottom of conduction band) to the 2p orbitals of O2  (top of valence band). According to the reported results in Nicontaining compounds, the absorption II can be assigned 3A2 g(F)?3T1 g(P) of the Ni(II) ions in octahedral environment.25,27 As shown in inset Fig. 5, the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles are deep and brilliant brown-red. The color should be generally attributed to intrinsic band-gap transitions along with some contributions from the allowed d–d transitions of the Ni2+ in octahedral environment, or defects in crystals created on the surface of the nanoparticles.

The band-gap structure of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 was suggested as shown in the schematic picture in Fig. 5(b). The conduction bands (CBs) of the compound are primarily comprised of the empty Mo-3d orbitals (t2 state in a tetrahedral ﬁeld) and some contributions from the empty Ni-3d orbitals. O-2p electrons dementedly contribute to the valance band (VB) structures of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. The split Ni-3d orbitals are inserted between O-2p and the empty Mo-3d orbitals.

The electronic structure feature of a semiconductor is a critical factor for its photocatalytic property. Usually a band-gap energy (Eg) can be evaluated by Wood-Tauc theory,31 as plotted in Fig. 5(b). The Eg is given by the relation of ahυ / (hυ   Eg)k, where a is the absorbance, h is the Planck constant, m is the frequency, and k is a constant associated to the diﬀerent types of electronic transitions (k = 1/2, 2, 3/2 or 3 for direct allowed, indirect allowed, direct forbidden and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively). The best linear relation of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles was obtained when the value of k is 1/2 shown in Fig. 5(b), indicating this is a direct allowed electronic transition. This is in agreement with the reported result that the optical transitions of molybdates are allowed direct electronic transition (k = 1/2).32

The band gap of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles is calculated to be about 2.07 eV (598 nm), which is signiﬁcantly

The high catalytic activity could be attributed to the strong optical absorption of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 in the UV to visible light region. In Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 there are eﬃcient absorption of both CT transition in MoO4 and the spin allowed d–d transitions of the Ni2+ in UV to visible light region. It can be understood that under an incident light radiation an electron gets energy and is excited to move to conduction band to form electron–hole pairs, that is, exciton, in Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. Actually no luminescence can be observed in Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 under UV-visible light indicating the possible weak recombination of the exciton. This suggests that the exciton has a long lifetime, which could provide more chances for the separations of electrons and holes. Then, the electrons stored in the CB of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 are trapped by   O2, forming reactive superoxide radical ions (O2 ), while the holes left in the VB react with adsorbed water molecules (or surface hydroxyls) near the surface of TiO2 to form OH radicals. Finally, the MB dye is oxidized due to the attack of the reactive oxygen species (OH and O2 radicals). A key feature of this NASICON framework is that the NiO6 and MoO4 polyhedra stand in lines alone with the inner wall of

the hexagonal tunnel, and inﬁnite chains of face shared (Ni, Li)O6 octahedra pass through the center of these tunnels. This tunnel structure in the framework could be in favor of transmission of the photo-induced carriers in a local structure. Consequently, it is important that the electron or hole could easily move inside the particles and enhance the photocatalytic activity.

A new visible light-driven photocatalyst was developed in NASICON material Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 by the modiﬁed pechini method with a particle-size below 50 nm. The crystal structure of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles was successfully reﬁned, indicating pure crystal formation. Ultraviolet–visible absorption study shows that Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles have a high transmittance peak at 580 nm, which is associated with the deep and brilliant brown-red color due to CT transitions in MoO4 and the allowed d–d transitions from the Ni2+ ions in octahedral environment. Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles are characterized by a direct allowed electronic transition with band gap of 2.07 eV. The methylene blue dye can be degraded under visible light irradiation in the presence of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles indicating a potential application in environmental protection. The structural features such as the hexagonal tunnels and optical active centers of MoO4 and NiO6 in the lattices could be suggested to be favorable for the photocatalytic ability.
