The electric conductivity at elevated temperatures has been measured for the series of orthophosphates LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3, where x=0, 1/18, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 5/18, and 1/3. They belong to the family of NASICON compounds, which are known to possess trivalent ionic conductivity. The method of infrared spectroscopy _ _ →P3 has been applied to determine structural transition P3 c. These data correlate well with the observed conductivity values plotted against composition.

Phosphates with the structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 (NASICON, NZP) are often considered as suitable materials for multivalent ionic conductors. The feasibility of cationic migration in solids with participation of cations with charges higher than two was ﬁrst shown for tungstates R2(WO4)3 (R=Al, Sc, Y, and Er–Lu) [1–3]. Since then extensive investigations of multivalent conductivity among different classes of compounds, including the family of NZP, have been carried out. Phosphates R1/3Zr2(PO4)3, R=Sc, Lu, Tm, Er, and Y were found to possess trivalent ionic conductivity [4–6]. The conductivity in this series monotonically increases with the decrease of ionic radius of the rare earth cations, which is due to the lanthanide contraction phenomenon [5].

Several successful attempts were made to enhance trivalent ionic conductivity of the NZP phosphates. Thus, it was shown, that synthesis with the use of a ball milling procedure leads to an increase of conductivity of R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 by approximately three times, compared to a conventional sol–gel route with inorganic reagents [7]. Increased conductivity was also found for the series (CexZr1 − x)4/4 − xNb(PO4)3 (NZP, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) [8], [(Ce1 − xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 (NZP, 0≤x≤1) [9] and for the system (PrxZr1 − x)4/(4 − x)Nb(PO4)3+NbPO5 (0.05≤x≤0.3) [10]. Similar solid solutions with R=La, Nd, and Gd were also studied [11].

Despite the available information, the problem of ionic conductivity with participation of highly charged cations in solids is challenging and is being intensively studied and discussed.

The ionic conductivity in phosphates of the general composition MxZr2(PO4)3 (NZP type) could be explained in terms of cationic movements in the three-dimensional network of channels, formed by the rigid framework of corner-linked ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra and containing the so-called M1 and M2 interstitial positions. These can be occupied by mono(x=1), di(x=1/2), tri(x=1/3), and tetravalent (x=1/4) cations. The size of the bottleneck for the conduction pathway between the M1 and M2 positions is known to be dependent on the size of the mobile cation [12]. Furthermore, additional factors might have an impact on the cationic mobility in NZP compounds, such as electronegativity, polarizability of the mobile species, ordering-disordering processes accompanying formation of solid solutions and in some cases appearing at phase transitions [9,13,14], temperature-dependent change of site occupancies [15]. In addition, NZP phosphates are known to possess thermal expansion anisotropy from room temperature and up to approximately 900– 1000 °C, which in sometimes results in structure contraction [16]. The combination of these factors complicates a priori prediction of the result of cationic mobility in the NZP compounds with mixed highly charged cations.

In the present study we made an attempt to measure and improve conduction properties of the phosphates R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R — rare earth elements) by introducing a small cation (Yb) in the presence of a bigger one (La), which could increase the bottleneck size, thus facilitating easier migration of the Yb cations. For this purpose the series of phosphates LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3 with different La:Yb ratio (x=0, 1/18, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 5/18, and 1/3) was synthesized and the electric conductivities in the system were measured.

Synthesis of the phosphates LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3, x=0, 1/18, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 5/18, and 1/3 has been carried out using a co-precipitation procedure starting from inorganic precursors [17].

The XRD patterns were collected with a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (Bragg-Brentano geometry, θ–2θ conﬁguration) equipped with a CuKα radiation source between 10 and 50° 2θ using a step size of 0.02° and a counting time per step of 0.6 s. The identiﬁcation of the diffractograms was carried out using X-ray reference data of the analogous compounds and a set of special crystallographic programs: PhasanX, PowderCell and FullProf Suite.

The IR absorption spectra were obtained on a FSP 12011 FTIR spectrometer using standard KBr disc technique in the wavenumber region of 1800–400 cm− 1. The spectral resolution was about 2 cm− 1. The conductivity measurements were carried out by the method of complex impedance. The samples were ground into ﬁne powders using a jasper mortar. Pellets with a thickness of 2–3 mm and a diameter of 15 mm were fabricated by pressing a powder in a steel die at 200–300 MPa, followed by sintering at 850 °C during 24 h. The densities of the so obtained samples were about 90% of the theoretical values. Silver electrodes were coated on the opposite sides of the pellets using silver-containing paste and annealed at 800 °C for 1–2 h. After the measurements the pellets were fractured and analyzed using an optical microscope. The traces of silver penetration into the bulk were not detected. Impedance measurements were carried out using a P 5083 AC bridge in the frequency range from 102 to 105 Hz and temperatures from 800 to 500 °C with 25° stepped cooling mode. The samples were connected into a circuit using two-electrode scheme. The amplitude of alternating current did not exceed 10 mV.

Temperature was monitored with a Pt–PtRh thermocouple and held constant with an accuracy to ±0.5 °C using a high-precision temperature controller VRT-3. In order to align temperature along the cell the latter was enclosed in a quartz tube and placed in a cut of a stainless steel pipe. The pipe was mounted into the furnace and grounded to reduce noise during measurements. Additionally, the cell was supplied with stainless steel shields for minimization of convection currents and further temperature stabilization. The resistances were determined by extrapolating complex impedance planes plotted as R versus x =1/ωC to the axis of active resistances. From these data the conductivities were calculated according to the equation: σ=L/RS, where L — sample length, S — sample crosssection, and R — resistivity.

The microstructure was observed with a SEM Vega Tescan TS5130LSH (3 nm resolution) and a Solver-Pro47H atomic force microscope (AFM). Phosphates with compositions La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 were taken for characterization. Disk shaped ceramic samples (D=15 mm, h=1.5 mm) were obtained directly from the ground powder by uniaxial pressing at ~190 MPa. Subsequently, they were subjected to a thermal treatment at 850 °C for 3 h and used for microstructure analysis. The sample for SEM analysis was coated with an ultrathin layer of graphite deposited on the surface by low vacuum sputter coating with a BAL-TEC SCD005 apparatus.

The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1. They were attributed to the structure type of NaZr2(PO4)3. Earlier it was shown, that lanthanide compounds Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystallize at room _ c [17]. An exception is realized temperature in the space group P3 _ for the phosphate La1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which adopts space group P3 at room temperature [18]. Both space groups are similar to one another and it is generally difﬁcult to distinguish them relying solely on the data of X-ray phase analysis. The difference is in the ordering of some part of two La atoms of the unit cell in additional 2d sites of the structure [18,19]. At the XRD patterns such changes are accompanied by the appearance of additional reﬂexes of low intensity, which in our case were not clearly resolved. The transition of La ions from 2d to 1b site starts above 500 °C and leads to the full occupation of only 1a and _ _ →P3 1b sites at 1000 °C, corresponding to structure transition P3 c. As this effect was only observed for the phosphate La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 among the whole series of lanthanide zirconium phosphates, one could expect the same morphotropic change to occur in the series LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3.

The information on morphotropic transition could be obtained ‘For this purpose, all studied from the analysis of the IR spectra. samples were characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The IR spectra of La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3 are similar to each other as expected from these clearly related structures (Fig. 2). In the structure of La1/3Zr2 _ (PO4)3, which belongs to space group P3 phosphorous atoms occupy three positions with site symmetry C1 (1). In the structure of Yb1/3Zr2 _ (PO4)3 (sp. gr. P3 c) the phosphorus atoms occupy two structural positions: 6f with site symmetry C2 (2) and 12g with site symmetry C1 (1). Factor group analysis predicts fourteen infrared active ν3, and four ν1 stretching vibrations, eight ν2, and fourteen ν4 bending vibrations for the phosphate unit in Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3. The number of infrared active vibrations in each spectral region of La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is increased: 6ν1, 18ν3 stretching vibrations and 12ν2, 18ν4 bending vibrations [20].

Due to close location and partial overlapping of a great number of bands in the region of stretching vibrations 1250–900 cm− 1 the observed number of the strongest signals for both compounds in this spectrum range is lower, than it is allowed by the selection rules. The bands of Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3 in this region are somewhat better resolved as compared to the spectrum of La1/3Zr2(PO4)3. The region of stretching vibrations in the spectrum of ytterbium sample _ Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (sp. gr. P3 c) is characterized by the splitting of a band at ~1100 cm− 1, by the presence of a shoulder at 1075 cm− 1, of the narrow intense band of ν1 vibrations at 916 cm− 1 and a highfrequency band at 1250 cm− 1 (Fig. 2.1). The spectrum of another end _ member La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 with the space group P3 reveals no band splittings and shoulders of ν3 vibrations in this region. At the same time an additional band at 1150 cm− 1 appears, the band of ν3 vibrations at 1026 cm− 1 becomes a shoulder at 1037 cm− 1. Moreover, the signiﬁcant difference is observed at the edges of this region: the band of ν1 vibrations shifts by 20 cm− 1 to higher frequencies 916 cm−1 → 936 cm− 1, becomes thicker and splits into two at 947 and 936 cm− 1; a band 1250 cm− 1 disappears and a shoulder at 1276 cm− 1 arises (Fig. 2.4). Some differences are also observed in the region of bending vibrations: the shoulder at ~550 cm− 1 of ν4 vibrations disappears.

Thus, in the spectra of these closely related structures a big number of overlapping bands are observed, which are realized with some certain distinctions. Concerning the intermediate compositions one can see that the spectrum of phosphate La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 is very similar to that of the pure Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3: the splitting of the bands of ν3 vibrations, the presence of a shoulder at 1240 cm− 1, the band of ν1 vibrations at 917 cm− 1, of ν4 vibrations at 548 cm− 1. The spectra of the other intermediate compositions are practically identical and have the earlier described features of the pure lanthanum compound (Fig. 2.3). Considering this, we suggest that _ phosphate La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 belongs to the sp. gr. P3 c, while the _ _ in . Thus, the space group P3 others — to the less symmetrical one P3 this case is preserved for the majority of the intermediate compositions LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3, unlike solid solutions Li1 − xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 [21], where insertion of a small amount of Li atoms into the structure of La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 already leads to ordering of lanthanum and the _ symmetry is increased to R3 .

Typical micrographs of the surface are depicted in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the grain sizes range from 90 to approximately 200 nm. Six randomly selected regions with the area of 60 μm2 each on the surface of La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 were scanned by the AFM. In order to estimate sample porosity the depth of 300 nm off the maximum proﬁle value was chosen, as illustrated by the two examples of surface proﬁles in Fig. 4. The data are summarized in Table 1; one of the examples is shown in Fig. 5. ‘On the basis of these data we concluded that, the relative surface porosity did not exceed few percents.

The conductivity of the studied phosphates is close to the data available in the literature [6,19] and amounts to 1.1× 10− 6 Scm− 1 for La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and 9.9× 10− 7 Scm− 1 for Yb1/3Zr2(PO4)3 at 598 and 596 °C, respectively. The highest value of 8.4∙10− 6 S cm− 1 was achieved for the composition La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 at T=763 °C. At the same time, higher values of conductivity are also known as, for instance, for the systems described in Refs. [8] and [9] with pentavalent niobium cation in the framework. However, our own experience and the data of other researchers show that compositions with frameworks [Zr2(PO4)3] could be obtained more easily without formation of additional phases [10,22].

The observed concentration dependences for the studied series of phosphates show minimum of activation energy and maximum of the ionic conductivity at the ratio Yb/(La+Yb) of approx. 80%. Fig. 6 illustrates temperature dependences of electric conductivity in Arrhenius coordinates for the studied phosphates. As it is seen from this plot, some points deviate from the general linear trend. This is mainly revealed for the end members with x =0 and 1/3 (in Fig. 6 open squares and circles, correspondingly) and could indicate complex behavior of these ionic conductors upon heating. Indeed, _ _ → P3 c in La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is accounted the change of a space group P3 for by the La3+ distribution in the [Zr2(PO4)3]− network over the available positions. La3 site empties at temperatures above 500 °C, leading to complete occupation of only two sites La1 and La2 at 1000 °C. On the other hand, as it was recently established in Ref. [16], phosphate Er1/3Zr2(PO4)3 containing in its composition trivalent cation of the end of the lanthanide series is slightly contracted upon heating. These structure changes are likely to be reﬂected on the temperature dependences of conductivity.

Figs. 7 and 8 show concentration dependences of activation energies and isotherms of electric conductivity, correspondingly. Usually, when introducing a second mobile cation in the composition of a solid solution the conductivity has minimum, while the activation energy has maximum at the intermediate ratios of charge carriers of different types. Furthermore, the bigger the difference of radii of mobile ions, the sharply are the extremums deﬁned. This phenomenon, known as mixed ion effect (MIE), in case of conductivity of the alkali cations is also referred to as mixed alkali effect. The increase of activation energy and decrease of conductivity in this case is caused by ordering of cations into structural positions. For example, it was shown that in K+ and Cs+ β-ferrites with β-alumina structure the alkali cations are disordered, whereas in the samples containing potassium and cesium simultaneously the charge carriers are arranged along the available positions in an ordered manner [23].

The mixed ion effect was also observed for the phosphates of NZP type and was shown for the mixed compounds Li/Na–NaZr2(PO4)3 [13], Na/Ag–NaZr2(PO4)3 [14] and Na/Cu–NaZr2(PO4)3 [24]. The minimum of conductivity in this case was attributed to structure features and was explained from the viewpoint of inhomogeneous distribution of the cations of different types around P(OZr)4 groups and blocking of the diffusion path [13] or as a result of coupling between corresponding species [14,24].

In our case an inverse situation was observed with maximum of conductivity and minimum of activation energy at the intermediate compositions of solid solutions. Similar effect in case of Ce-containing systems [(Ce1 − xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1.0) at 600 °C was observed earlier and described in Ref. [9]. In our case the maximum could be explained by cationic movement caused by the morphotropic _ transition P3 c. Lanthanum, being substituted by ytterbium, empties the 2d position in the region, corresponding to ca. 80% of ytterbium content. As a result, the enhanced conductivity is observed for the compositions La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 and La1/9Yb2/9Zr2(PO4)3.

As can be seen from Fig. 5, the position of maximum at the isotherms of conductivity depends on temperature. In conventional systems with mixed alkali effect, e.g. glasses and beta-alumina, this shift is usually not present, as long as the effect itself is more pronounced than in our case, the neighboring compositions signiﬁcantly differ in conductivity and the polytherms do not intersect in the selected temperature range. In our case the conductivity from one composition to another changes slightly, while the change of activation energy is considerable. As a consequence, the maximum at the isotherms shifts to the region of lower ytterbium concentrations, as the temperature decreases. Apparently, the next step would be to investigate temperature dependence of the space group transition and the contribution of each of the mobile cations to conductivity, depending on their content and temperature.

As it is stated earlier, the mixed ion effect in solid electrolytes is reported in a number of papers. Moreover, the mixing of cations participating in charge transfer can lead both to the decrease of conductivity, as it is observed for the phosphates Li1− yNa0.2 + yZr1.9 Mg0.1(PO4)3 [13], Na2− yAgyZr1.5 Mg0.5(PO4)3 [14], and Cu1− yNa0.2 + yZr1.9Mg0.1(PO4)3 [24], and to the increase of the latter as it was shown for the series (CexZr1 − x)4/4 − xNb(PO4)3 [8], [(Ce1 − xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 [9], and (PrxZr1 − x)4/4 − xNb(PO4)3 (0.05≤x≤0.3) [10]. The ﬁrst case is realized in the systems with monovalent cations Li–Na, Na–Ag, and Na–Cu. In the second case the ionic diffusion involved cations with higher charges (Al3+, Pr3+, and Zr4+). The results of the present paper correlate with the latter. Although our data as a particular case could be explained by structural transition, in our opinion there is still lack of empirical data that would allow to draw some conclusions regarding the appearance of the mixed ion effect for the cations of different oxidation states, ionic radii, electronegativity, polarizability and other characteristics. Additional studies are required, ﬁrst of all structure investigations, including ones at high temperatures.

The solid solutions LaxYb1/3 − xZr2(PO4)3, where x = 0, 1/18, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 5/18, and 1/3, have been synthesized by wet chemical route using inorganic reactants and their ionic conductivities have been measured by complex impedance method. The conductivity plotted against composition shows maximum at the ratio Yb / (La + Yb) of approximately 80%. This phenomenon was explained by morphotropic transition within the same structure type, accompanied by the _ change of the space group P3 c, which was conﬁrmed by the analysis of the IR spectra. The maximum value of conductivity was achieved for the phosphate La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 and amounted to 8.4 · 10− 6 S cm− 1 at T = 763 °C.
