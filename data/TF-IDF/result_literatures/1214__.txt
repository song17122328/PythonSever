The  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 series  (0.0    x    0.5)  was  prepared  by  a  sol–gel  method.  X-ray  diffraction patterns  showed  two  rhombohedral  phases  which  coexist  for  intermediate  compositions.  Despite  of  the absence  of  a  solid  solution  mechanism  for  the  whole  stoichiometry  range,  an  appreciable  cation  mixing was  observed  in  both  phases. 31P  MAS  NMR  spectroscopy  revealed  that  low  magnesium  contents  are incorporated  to  the  calcium  compound  inducing  changes  in  the  ordering  of  the  alkaline  earth  cations  in M1 sites.  Derivative  plots  of  the  voltage–capacity  curves  revealed  two  reversible  regions  ascribed  to  the reduction  of  Ti4+ to  Ti3+,  ascribable  to  the  subsequent  insertion  of  lithium  ions  into  M1 and  M2 vacant sites.  Capacity  values  as  high  as  138  mAh/g  after  the  ﬁrst  discharge  were  monitored  for  nanometric Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3 at  C/20.  Cell  cycling  under  successive  kinetic  rates  revealed  a  good  capacity retention  for  samples  with  x  =  0.15  and  0.25.  Impedance  spectra  were  recorded  in  lithium  cells discharged  after  different  number  of  cycles  at  different  C  rates.  The  increase  in  charge  transfer  resistance was  shown  to  be  an  important  factor  determining  the  electrode  behavior  on  extended  cycling.

Transition  metal  compounds  with  NASICON-type  structures exhibit  an  open  framework  which  facilitates  the  diffusion  of  alkali metal  ions  and  hence  have  been  proposed  as  possible  electrodes  for lithium  batteries  [1–5].  The  three-dimensional  framework  is usually  described  as  a  result  of  a  repeating  unit  called  ‘‘lantern’’, consisting  of  three  PO4 tetrahedra  and  two  MO6 octahedra  sharing all  corners  and  creating  two  kinds  of  interstitial  sites.  One  M1 site per  formula  unit  is  sharing  faces  with  two  adjacent  TiO6 octahedra along  the  hexagonal  c-axis.  These  chains  are  mutually  linked  by PO4 tetrahedra  sharing  corners  with  TiO6 octahedra.  Also,  three  M2 vacant  octahedral  sites  per  formula  unit  are  available  between these  chains  and  interconnect  with  M1 sites  [6–9].

Previous  reports  have  envisaged  titanium containing  phosphates  with  NASICON  structure  for  their  application  in  lithium  cells.  The  electrochemical  lithium  insertion  in LiTi2(PO4)3 leads  to  a  limiting  Li3Ti2(PO4)3 stoichiometry.  The higher  ionic  radius  of  Ti3+ as  compared  with  Ti4+ induces  an anisotropic  modiﬁcation  of  the  unit  cell.  As  a  result,  the  a parameter  decreases  while  the  c  parameter  increases  upon  lithium insertion  [10].  Further  studies  used  in  situ  X-ray  diffraction  and potentiostatic  intermittent  titration  technique  to  demonstrate  that

the  in  orthorhombic Li2TiFe(PO4)3and  Li2TiCr(PO4)3 proceeds  through  a  solid  solution mechanism  [11].  The  single  phase  mechanism  for  the  lithium insertion  was  also  in  related  Na2+xTiM(PO4)3 and Li1.6+xNa0.4TiM(PO4)3 compositions  [12].

Transition  metal  phosphates  with  a  general  stoichiometry M0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (M  =  Mn,  Ca,  Mg,  Fe,  Cu,  etc.),  exhibit  a  half occupancy  of  the  M1 interstitial  sites  by  the  divalent  M  cations [13–15].  The  resulting  open  framework  facilitates  the  diffusion  of guest  species  such  as  alkali  metal  ions,  thus  ensuring  a  good  stability of  lithium  cells  upon  prolonged  electrochemical  cycling.  Thus,  Aatiq et  al.  reported  the  insertion  of  lithium  in  Mn0.5 xCaxTi2(PO4)3 solid  solutions.  They  found  that  lithium  insertion  promotes  a redistribution  of  the  divalent  cations  in  all  M1 sites  [16].  We  also reported  the  lithium  insertion  in  Mn0.5 xCoxTi2(PO4)3 (0    x    0.5) where  manganese  enhances  the  cycling  stability  leading  to  high capacities  on  Ti4+/Ti3+ reduction  [17].

The  NASICON  structure  of  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was  ﬁrst  reported  by Barth  et  al.  as  belonging  to  the  R-3c  space  group.  The  closed electronic  shell  of  the  Mg2+ ion  induces  a  highly  symmetric  oxygen coordination,  which  contributes  to  the  stability  of  the  covalent [Ti2(PO4)3]  framework.  However,  TiO6 octahedra  and  PO4 tetrahedra  are  slightly  distorted  [18].  The  ability  of  this  compound to  electrochemically  insert  one  Mg2+ ions  per  formula  unit  has been  demonstrated.  Unfortunately,  the  low  mobility  of  the  alkaliearth  ions  into  the  host  material  revealed  a  poor  kinetic  behavior. Preliminary  results  on  the  electrochemical  lithium  insertion  in

Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were  also  included  in  this  report  [19].  We  have recently  carried  out  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  cell  parameters during  insertion/extraction.  These  data  revealed  an anisotropic  variation  of  the  unit  cell  parameters  upon  ﬁlling  the M1 sites,  while  a  continuous  increase  was  detected  when  the  M2 sites  are  occupied  by  the  incoming  lithium  ions.  [20]

The  goal  of  the  structural  and electrochemical  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 (0.0    x    0.5)  series.  The  structure  of  the  resulting  phases  and the  local  environment  of  probe  atoms  will  be  evaluated  by  X-ray diffraction  and 31P  MAS  NMR.  The  results  will  be  correlated  to  the insertion  properties  of  the  electrode  materials  in  lithium  cells.

Five  samples  of  nominal  stoichiometry  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 (0.0    x    0.5)  were  prepared  by  a  sol–gel  method.  Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Ca(NO3)39H2O,  Mg(NO3)39H2O  (Panreac),  and NH4H2PO4 (Aldrich)  were  dissolved  in  deionized  water.  Then, citric  acid  was  added  in  a  1:1  molar  ratio  as  referred  to  the  metal ion  content.  The  solution  was  slowly  added  under  stirring  to  a stoichiometric  amount  of  titanium  isopropoxide,  previously diluted  in  40  mL  of  ethanol.  The  slurry  was  homogenenized before  the  solvent  was  evaporated  in  a  rotavap  at  80  8C  during 2  h.  The  precursors  were  eventually  dried,  ground  and  annealed in  an  argon  atmosphere  at  750  8C  thermal decomposition  of  citric  acid  in  an  inert  atmosphere  provides an  in  situ  generated  carbon  phase  which  limits  the  growth  of particles  to  the  range  of  nanometers  and  also  improves  the conducting  properties  of  the  electrode  material.  The  precise carbon  content  in  these  transition  metal  phosphate/carbon composites  was  determined  by  using  an  Elemental  CHNS Eurovector  EA  3000  analyser.

X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  were  recorded  in  a  Siemens D5000  diffractometer  provided  with  a  graphite  monochromator. The  samples  were  scanned  between  108  and  1108  (degrees  2u)  by  a step  scan  mode  in  which  0.048/12  s  steps  were  applied.  Unit  cell parameters  were  calculated  using  the  Fullprof  software.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  images  were  recorded  in  a  JEOL 200CX  microscope. 31P  MAS  NMR  spectra  were  recorded  in  a Bruker  Avance400WB  instrument.  A  4  mm  diameter  rotor  sample holder  was  spinned  at  12  kHz  rate.  A  85%  H3PO4 solution  was  used as  reference.

The  electrodes  were  prepared  by  mixing  the  active  material with  carbon  black  and  PVDF  (polyvinylidene  ﬂuoride)  in  a 80:10:10  ratio,  respectively.  The  mixture  was  slurried  by  adding N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  and  stirring  vigorously  in  an  Ultraturrax disperser  at  10,000  rpm  for  10  min.  The  slurry  was  spread  onto  an aluminum  support  acting  as  a  current  collector  and  dried  at  120  8C under  vacuum  for  at  lithium insertion  was  monitored  by  assembling  two-electrode  SwagelokTM type  cells.  A  9  mm  lithium  pellet  was  used  as  a  counter  electrode and  glass  ﬁber  sheets  (GF/A-Whatman)  soaked  in  1  M  LiPF6 (EC:DEC)  as  a  separator.  The  lithium  cells  were  assembled  in  a glove  box  under  a  controlled  argon  atmosphere.  These  cells  were

cycled  at  a  constant  current  between  2.0  and  4.2  V.  The  charge  and discharge  rates  were  expressed  as  C/n,  where  n  is  the  number  of hours  needed  for  the  reaction  with  1  lithium  per  formula  unit  at the  applied  current  intensity.

Three-electrode  Swagelok  type  cells  were  assembled  using lithium  disk  as  a  reference  electrode  for  recording  the  Electrochemical  Impedance  Spectra  (EIS).  The  cells  were  cycled  up  to  the end  of  the  discharge  at  different  rates  and  allowed  to  relax  for  at least  12  h  to  reach  a  quasi-equilibrium  state.  The  impedance spectra  were  recorded  in  an  Autolab  PGSTAT12  by  perturbing  the equilibrium  potential  by  an  AC  voltage  signal  of  5  mV  which  was applied  from  100  kHz  to  2  mHz.

The  XRD  patterns  of  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 samples  are  characterized  by  narrow  reﬂections  corresponding  to  well-crystallized phases  (Fig.  1).  The  ﬁrst  reports  on  Ca0.50Ti2(PO4)3 determined  that this  structure  is  ascribable  to  the  R-3  space  group,  in  which  Ca2+ ions  and  vacancies  are  ordered  distributed  in  3a  and  3b  sites, respectively  [21,22].  Otherwise,  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was  indexed  in  the R-3c  space  group,  Mg2+ ions  being  randomly  distributed  in  M1 sites [18].  Thus,  a  solid  solution  mechanism  cannot  be  expected  in  the whole  stoichiometry  range  from  the  substitution  of  Ca2+ by  Mg2+. This  fact  must  not  be  envisaged  as  an  insurmountable  drawback  for the  study  of  these  compounds.  is  well  known  that  the combination  of  two  cathode  materials  to  form  a  composite electrode  may  improve  the  electrochemical  performance  [23]. As  examples  of  this  synergistic  effect,  we  can  mention  the  addition of  LiFePO4 to  LiCoO2 [24]  and  the  use  of  monoclinic  (C2/m) Li2MnO3 as  a  lithium  reserve  that  improves  the  cyclability  of layered  LiMO2 cathode  materials  [25,26].

by  a  S1  signal  at   25.9  ppm  and  a  shoulder  S2  at   26.6  ppm revealing  some  degree  of  cation  disorder  in  the  M1  sites.  Likely,  the lower  annealing  temperature  and  time  as  compared  to  the  material prepared  by  Delmas  et  al.  and  the  presence  of  the  in  situ  generated carbon  conductive  phase  may  induce  such  cationic  disorder  during sample  crystallization.  Otherwise,  a  more  complex  spectrum  is observed  for  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 as  a  result  of  the  occurrence  of different  local  environment  of  phosphorous  atoms  [20].

On  substituting  Ca  by  Mg,  an  increase  in  the  contribution  of  the S2  signal  is  observed  for  x  =  0.15  in  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3,  followed by  a  progressive  decrease,  S2  being  undetectable  for  x  =  0.35.  At this  substitution  level,  the  peaks  ascribable  to  the  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 phase  are  clearly  visible.  Thus,  the  incorporation  of  low  Mg  content (x  =  0.15)  to  the  R-3  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 framework  would  increase  the cation  disorder  in  M1 sites.  Further  increase  of  the  Mg2+ content would  favor  the  cationic  ordering  in  M1 sites  until  a  clear predominance  of  the  R-3c  phase  is  reached.

Two-electrode  lithium  cells  were  assembled  to  evaluate  their electrochemical  behavior.  Derivative  curves  of  the  composition  (y) versus  voltage  plots  of  the  electrochemical  lithium  insertion  were obtained.  These  curves  reveal  the  quasi-plateaus,  sometimes barely  discernible,  as  resolved  anodic  and  cathodic  bands  allowing a  clear  interpretation  of  the  mechanisms  occurring  during  the  cell discharge  and  charge  (Fig.  4).  In  all  cases,  two  different  regions  can be  easily  discerned.  These  regions  are  ascribed  to  the  reduction  of Ti4+ to  Ti3+,  while  lithium  ions  are  subsequently  inserted  into  M1 and  M2 vacant  sites.  The  ﬁrst  signal  extents  from  3.0  to  2.7  V  and  is commonly  ascribed  to  insertion/extraction  of  lithium  into  the  M1 vacant  sites.  Previous  reports  could  only  detect  this  small  plateau at  2.7  V  under  equilibrium  conditions,  once  a  severe  relaxation criterion  was  reached  [27].  Most  likely,  the  improved  electrical conducting  properties  of  the  metal  phosphate/carbon  composite prepared  in  this  work  favored  the  electrochemical  reactivity  of  the active  material  in  this  region  even  under  continuous  galvanostatic

Following  these  assumptions,  the  patterns  of  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were  indexed  in  the  R-3  and  R-3c  space  groups, respectively.  Additional  reﬂections  attributable  to  the  occurrence of  impurities  were  not  detected.  The  unit  cell  parameters  are collected  in  Table  1.  The  calculated  values  were  in  agreement  with those  reported  in  the  literature.  On  substituting  Ca2+ by  Mg2+,  the reﬂections  (0  0  3),  (1  0  1)  and  (3  0  3)  progressively  disappear because  they  are  forbidden  in  the  R-3c  space  group.  They  are completely  absent  at  the  end-composition  of  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 indicating  the  presence  of  glide  plane  c  in  the  R-3c  space  group [18].  However,  the  analysis  of  unit  cell  parameters  for  the intermediate  compositions  included  in  Table  1  reveals  a  signiﬁcant decrease  when  Ca2+ is  replaced  by  Mg2+.  The  substitution  of  large Ca2+ (0.99  A˚´ )  by  small  Mg2+ (0.65  A˚´ )  and  a  certain  degree  of  cation mixing  between  both  phases  would  explain  this  behavior.

The  analysis  of  the  TEM  images  showed  that  all  members  of  the series  present  similar  morphology.  A  close  inspection  of  a  TEM image  for  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3 reveals  primary  particle  diameters in  the  range  of  50–100  nm  of.  Also,  electron-lucent  regions  appear surrounding  the  phosphate  particles.  These  particles  are  ascribed to  a  residual  carbon  phase  generated  during  thermal decomposition  of  citric  acid  in  Ar  atmosphere  (Fig.  2).  The  nominal stoichiometry  of  the  samples  was  checked  by  Energy  Dispersive Spectroscopy  (EDS).  The  experimental  Ti/Ca  and  Ti/Mg  ratios match  very  well  with  the  theoretical  values  (Table  2).

31P  MAS  NMR  is  a  valuable  tool  to  gather  information  about  the crystallographic  sites  of  phosphorous  in  the  NASICON  structure. Delmas  et  al.  employed  this  technique  to  unveil  the  cationic distribution  in  the  Mn0.5 xCaxTi2(PO4)3 solid  solution.  They  found  a unique  signal  for  the  calcium  containing  compound  in  agreement to  the  XRD  pattern  reﬁnement.  However,  the  presence  of  a relatively  broad  and  asymmetric  signal  the  manganese compound  evidences  the  possibility  of  cation  disordering  in  M1 sites  (3a  and  3b)  [16].  The  spectra  recorded  for  our  samples  are displayed  in  Fig.  3.  The  spectrum  for  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 is  characterized

discharge  at  C/10.  This  region  is  split  in  two  signals  at  2.96  and 2.86  V  for  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3,  while  only  one  at  2.67  V  is  observed  for the  Ca  containing  compound  in  the  discharge  branches.  On substituting  Ca2+ by  Mg2+,  this  region  shifts  to  higher  voltages, probably  due  to  the  difference  in  ionic  radius  and  electronegativity between  both  alkali-earth  metals.  These  parameters  affect  the strength  of  the  Ti–O  bonds  and  consequently,  the  redox  properties of  the  Ti4+/Ti3+ redox  couple.  From  these  observations,  a  limited dissolution  of  Ca2+ in  the  Mg2+ compound  and  viceversa  cannot  be discarded.  Otherwise,  the  splitting  of  both  reduction  and  oxidation signal  in  the  Mg2+ compound  reﬂects  the  complexity  of  the insertion  reaction.  Recently,  we  have  reported  an  anisotropic expansion/contraction  of  the  rhombohedral  cell  when  lithium  ions are  hosted  in  the  M1 sites  [20].

The  second  region  extents  from  2.6  to  2.0  V.  The  integrated area  of  these  redox  bands  is  larger  than  that  of  the  ﬁrst  region, reﬂecting  the  high  M2:  M1 vacant  sites  ratio  (2.0:0.5)  to  host lithium  ions.  The  proﬁle  of  these  bands  is  asymmetric  and  clearly split  in  two  signals  at  2.35  and  2.46  V  evidencing  the  presence  of host  sites  with  different  energy  for  the  lithium  redox  reaction. Based  on  neutron  diffraction  studies,  Delmas  et  al.  [28,29]  have described  the  M2 sites  as  large  cavities  which  accommodate different  tetrahedral  sub-sites  depending  on  the  transition  metal occupying  the  M1 site  and  the  distribution  of  titanium  in  the framework.  According  to  this  model,  the  reduction  peaks  can  be ascribed  to  the  into  these  sub-sites.  On substituting  Ca2+ by  Mg2+,  the  most  remarkable  effect  is  the appearance  of  the  highly  broadened  anodic  signal  at  2.25  V replacing  the  reduction  peak  at  2.35  V.

lithium  cells  using Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 composite  electrode  materials  was  carried out  between  2.0  and  4.2  V  versus  Li0 at  several  C  rates  in  order  to determine  the  electrochemical performance.  Fig.  5  shows  the  capacity  versus  cycles  plot  for  the ﬁrst  20  cycles  at  C/20  for  all  the  compositions.  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 exhibits  capacity  values  above  110  mAh/g,  while  the  capacity recorded  for  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was  ca.  90  mAh/g.  However,  the calcium  compound  evidenced  better  capacity  retention.  High capacity  values  were  detected  for  the  nanometric  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3.  The  lithium  cell  delivered  138  mAh/g  after  the  ﬁrst discharge,  while  values  as  high  as  115  mAh/g  were  retained  after 20  cycles  at  C/20.  This  behavior  can  be  attributed  to  the  large volume  increase  induced  by  the  presence  of  small  contents  of  large Ca2+ ions  (Table  1).  Lithium  mobility  into  the  large  M1 and  M2 vacant  sites  is  favored  in  this  composition.  This  improvement  is  not observed  for  samples  with  high  calcium  contents.  Thus,  we  can assert  that  the  lithium  insertion  is  favored  in  the  R-3c  structure, which  is  predominant  for  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3.

Fig.  6  shows  the  galvanostatic  cycling  under  successive  kinetic rates.  The  lowest  capacity  values  were  recorded  for  Ca0.25Mg0.25Ti2(PO4)3.  In  turn,  the  end  compositions  delivered  capacity  values of  ca.  100  mAh/g  for  the  ﬁrst  discharge.  However,  a  marked capacity  fading  upon  cycling  was  observed  by  increasing  the cycling  rate  to  C/2.  Nanometric  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3 showed  the

highest  capacity  value  after  the  ﬁrst  discharge,  ca.  122  mAh/g. Nevertheless,  this  value  signiﬁcantly  decreased  upon  cycling  and increasing  the  C  rate.  However,  a  highly  efﬁcient  recovery  of capacity  was  observed  after  returning  at  C/10  in  the  last  ten  cycles. Thus,  the  capacity  value  of  ca.  80  mAh/g  for  C/2  rapidly  increased  to 107  mAh/g  the  33th  cycle.  Finally,  Ca0.35Mg0.15Ti2(PO4)3 performed  an  initial  capacity  of  100  mAh/g  for  the  ﬁrst  discharge. However,  a  good  capacity  retention  at  high  C  rates  was  observed for  this  sample.  Thus,  a  capacity  retention  of  80%  was  recorded after  cycling  the  cell  at  C/2.  The  capacity  fading  upon  prolonged and/or  high-rate  cycling  can  be  correlated  internal impedance  of  the  lithium  cell  [30,31].  Electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy  is  a  valuable  technique  to  monitor  the  contribution  of the  electrode–electrolyte  interphase  impedance  to  the  migration of  lithium  ions.  Fig.  7  displays  the  Nyquist  plots  obtained  from lithium  cells  after  the  ﬁrst,  ﬁfth  and  tenth  discharge  at  C/10.  These plots  are  characterized  by  two  overlapped  and  depressed semicircles  at  high  and  medium  frequencies  and  a  straight  line at  low  frequencies.  The  semicircles  are  commonly  attributed  to  the migration  of  lithium  ions  through  the  solid  electrolyte  interphase (SEI)  and  to  the  charge  transfer  (CT)  at  the  electrode/electrolyte interphase,  respectively  [32].

The  overall  impedance  of  the  interphase  could  be  visually inferred  from  the  diameter  of  the  semicircles  intersecting  at  the horizontal  axis.  However,  more  accurate  resistance  values  (RSEI and RCT)  can  be  calculated  by  ﬁtting  to  the  equivalent  circuit  included as  an  inset  in  Fig.  8  [33].  The  results  of  the  ﬁtting  are  written  in Table  3.  A  clear  correlation  can  be  observed  between  the  values  of resistance  and  capacity  retention.  Thus,  the  observed  increase  in RCT would  explain  the  enhanced  capacity  fading  of  samples  with x  =  0.0,  x  =  0.35  and  x  =  0.5  at  high  rates,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6. Especially  for  x  =  0.35  and  x  =  0.5,  RCT reaches  values  above  1  V  g after  the  5th  discharge.  Otherwise,  RCT values  lower  than  0.5  V  g were  monitored  for  x  =  0.15  and  x  =  0.25  after  the  10th  discharge. These  results  can  be  correlated  to  the  capability  of  these nanometric  electrode  materials  to  retain  the  cell  capacity  at  high C  rates  (Fig.  6).  Also,  the  results  evidence  that  the  charge  transfer phenomenon  occurring  at  the  electrode–electrolyte  interphase  is  a crucial  factor  determining  the  kinetic  response  of  these  electrode materials  in  a  prolonged  cycling.  In  all  cases,  RSEI values  were  lower than  RCT and  the  variation  upon  cycling  was  less  pronounced  than for  RCT.  A  continuous  increase  in  RSEI upon  cycling  was  not  observed for  samples  with  x  =  0.15,  0.25  and  0.5.  This  fact  has  been previously  reported  for  silicon  based  anodes  and  attributed  to  the external  organic  SEI/liquid  electrolyte  interface  and  in  minor  part on  the  charge  transfer  across  the  electrode/SEI  interface  [34].

Table  4 Electrical  resistance  of  Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 (x  =  0,  0.35  and  x  =  0.5)  as  calculated  by ﬁtting  their  impedance  spectra  for  the  ﬁrst  discharge  at  C/5  and  C/2.

Anyway,  those  samples  with  a  poor  capacity  retention  (x  =  0,  0.35 and  0.5)  showed  a  signiﬁcant  increase  in  RSEI upon  cycling.

Cell  impedance  spectra  of  electrodes  discharged  at  C/5  and  C/2 were  recorded  in  order  to  correlate  the  good  capacity  recovery observed  for  nanometric  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3 when  a  C/10  rate was  applied  for  the  last  ten  cycles  and  the  internal  resistance  of  the electrode.  Fig.  8  displays  the  Nyquist  plots  for  cells  after  the  ﬁrst discharge  at  C/5  and  C/2  rates.  A  decrease  of  the  overall  cell impedance  is  observed,  which  can  be  attributed  to  differences  in sensitivity  to  operating  rate.  The  most  signiﬁcant  diminution  of resistance  was  observed  for  samples  with  x  =  0,  0.35  and  x  =  0.5. The  RSEI and  RCT values  are  written  in  Table  4.  For  all  the  studied compositions,  a  decrease  of  the  RCT value  was  recorded  on increasing  the  C  rate,  being  more  marked  for  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3. Moreover,  RSEI values  also  exhibited  a  notorious  decrease  for  this composition,  which  undoubtedly  will  favor  the  rapid  electrode response,  and  gives  a  possible  explanation  to  the  excellent  capacity recovery  after  returning  from  C/2  to  C/10  at  the  end  of  the  long cycling  experiment.

Ca0.5 xMgxTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles  were  prepared  by  a  sol  gelmethod.  The  XRD  patterns  revealed  a  transition  from  an  R-3  phase for  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 to  an  R-3c  phase  for  Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 which  coexist when  Ca2+ is  partially  substituted  by  Mg2+.  The  continuous decrease  of  the  cell  parameters  of  both  phases  is  attributed  to  a certain  degree  of  cation  mixing.  The  incorporation  of  low  contents of  Mg  (x  =  0.15)  to  the  R-3  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 framework  led  to  an increase  of  the  cation  disorder  in  M1 sites  as  shown  by 31P  MAS NMR  and  conﬁrmed  the  cation  mixing  previously  detected  by  Xray  diffraction.

Derivative  curves  revealed  two  reversible  regions  ascribable  to the  reduction  of  Ti4+ to  Ti3+,  while  lithium  ions  are  subsequently inserted  into  M1 and  M2 vacant  sites.  The  extended  galvanostatic cycling  of  lithium  cells  showed  the  best  performance  for  the intermediate  composition  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3 which  delivered 138  mAh/g  after  the  ﬁrst  discharge  and  values  as  high  as  115  mAh/ g  after  20  cycles  at  C/20.  This  result  can  be  attributed  to  both  the large  volume  increase  induced  by  large  Ca2+ ions  and  the  favored lithium  insertion  in  the  R-3c  framework.

Impedance  spectroscopy  was  a  helpful  tool  to  unveil  the  kinetic response  of  the  electrodes.  The  increase  of  RCT has  been  correlated to  the  capacity  fading  of  samples  with  x  =  0.0,  0.35  and  0.5  at  high rates,  evidencing  that  the  charge  transfer  phenomenon  occurring at  the  electrode–electrolyte  interphase  is  a  crucial  factor  determining  the  electrode  behavior  in  an  extended  cycling.  Otherwise,  a signiﬁcant  increase  of  RSEI was  also  observed  for  these  samples, though  the  variation  upon  cycling  was  less  pronounced  than  for RCT.  Cell  impedance  spectra  of  electrodes  discharged  at  C/5  and  C/2

revealed  a  signiﬁcant  diminution  of  both  RSEI and  RCT for nanometric  Ca0.15Mg0.35Ti2(PO4)3.  This  phenomenon  promotes fast  electrode  response,  thus  explaining  the  excellent  capacity recovery  when  the  is  ﬁrst  cycled  at  C/2  and subsequently  at  C/10.
