Triple molybdate NaCoCr(MoO4)3, a phase of variable composition Na2MoO4–CoMoO4– Cr2(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.5) having nasicon structure (space group ), and triple molybdate NaCo3Cr(MoO4)5 crystallizing in triclinic space group were synthesized in the subsolidus region of the Na2MoO4–CoMoO4– Cr2(MoO4)3 ternary salt system. Crystal parameters were calculated for the newly synthesized molybdates and phases. The vibration spectra of Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı (MoO4)3 and electrophysical properties were studied. Upon Na + Co Cr(III) substitution, chromium cations are distributed to cobalt sites and additional vacancies are generated in the sodium sublattice.

Search for new compounds with high ionic conductivity has received much attention in recent years. Phases with nasicon structure show promise in this context on account of large interstices, in part occupied by low-charge cations, that form extended channels in the structure. The large extents of crystallization fields for nasicon phases are due to their extensive isomorphism in octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The thermal and chemical durability of nasicon phases and their high ionic conductivity allow them to be regarded as promising solid electrolytes [1–9]. Here, we report on phase relations in the Na 2 MoO 4 – CoMoO 4 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 system. We found individual compounds NaCo 3 Cr ( MoO 4 ) 3 (triclinic) and NaCoCr ( MoO 4 ) 3 and Na 1 – ı Co 1 – ı Cr 1 + ı ( MoO 4 ) 3 subtraction solid solutions crystallizing in nasicon structure, and determined their concentration stability fields and melting temperatures. The phases were characterized using X-ray diffraction and vibration spectroscopy.

Interactions in the Na 2 MoO 4 – CoMoO 4 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 system were studied in the subsolidus region at 400 − 800°ë . The starting components (Na 2 MoO 4 , ëÓ MoO 4 , Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 ) were synthesized by ceramic technology from Na 2 CO 3 , Co ( NO 3 ) 2 · 6 H 2 O , Cr ( NO 3 ) 3 · 9 H 2 O, and MoO 3 . The study of the interactions in the Na 2 MoO 4 – ëÓåé 4 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 system was carried out in two stages. First, the phase composition was studied for the samples whose chemical composition corresponded to the meeting points of the sections originating from the Na 2 MoO 4 –ëÓåé 4 , Na 2 MoO 4 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 , and ëÓåé 4 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 boundary subsystems. Second, the quasi-binary joins determined at the first stage were studied and the system was triangulated (figure). Triple molybdate Na ëÓ 3 Cr ( MoO 4 ) 5 (1 : 3) was found to form along the NaCr ( MoO 4 ) 2 –ëÓ MoO 4 section at 600 − 650°ë . Na ëÓ Cr ( MoO 4 ) 3 formation was found on the NaCr ( MoO 4 ) 2 – CoMoO 4 and Na 2 + 2 x Co 1 – x ( MoO 4 ) 2 – Cr 2 ( MoO 4 ) 3 (0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.2) sections within 570–650°ë . The phase of variable composition Na 1 – ı Co 1 – ı Cr 1+ ı ( MoO 4 ) 3 ( 0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.5), which is a NaCoCr(MoO4)3-base subtraction solid solution, is formed in the plane of the Na2MoO4– ëÓåoé4–Cr2(MoO4)3 triangle and along the NaëÓCr(MoO4)3–Cr2(MoO4)3 section. Samples with compositions lying along quasi-binary joins were prepared in 2.5–5 mol % steps; for refining the composition of the triple molybdate NaCoCr(MoO4)3 and the homogeneity region of the phase of variable composition Na1 − ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3, the steps were 1 mol %. Samples were annealed at 400, 500, 550, 600, 650, and 700°ë with repeated intermittent grinding every 20–30 h. The annealing time at each temperature was 80–100 h. Once annealed, samples were slowly cooled with the furnace. Nonequilibrated samples were annealed additionally. Equilibrium was considered acquired if the phase composition of a sample remained unchanged after two consecutive anneals. Synthesis products were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (FR-552 monochromator camera, CuKαradiation, Ge internal standard). Powder patterns were digitized on an IZA-2 comparator. The standard program package Rentgen was used to process X-ray diffraction patterns (Table 1). Vibration spectra were recorded from polycrystalline Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 samples on Bruker FT-IR and Specord M80 spectrometers (excitation with a near-IR laser radiation (1.06 nm), reflection geometry, 3–5 cm–1 resolution). Test samples were Nujol mulls on polyethylene substrates or KBr disks. Molybdenum-isotope-substituted samples were prepared from 92MoO3 and 100MoO3. Vibration frequencies are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed on an MOM OD-103 derivatograph (temperature elevation rate: 10 K/min; sample sizes: 0.3–0.4 g). Electrophysical properties of the phases of variable composition were studied on polycrystalline samples, which were then sintered at 650–700°ë into compact ceramics. Platinum electrodes were applied to ceramic disks 0.15–0.20 cm thick. Alternating current measurements were carried out using an E8-4 bridge and an R5025 capacitor box (to expand the dielectric loss tangent measurement range); the measurement accuracy was ±5%. Direct current was fixed with an E6-13A teraohmmeter at a set voltage of 30–50 mV. Measurement precision was monitored in the heating and cooling modes in the range 20–600°ë. The temperature of the sample during the electrophysical measurements was monitored to ±2 K using a Chromel–Alumel thermocouple connected to a V -7-21A voltmeter. 

The interaction between NaCr(MoO4)2 and ëoMoO4, as probed by powder X-ray diffraction, starts at 550–600°ë with annealing times of 100–120 h. Single-phase triple molybdate NaCoCr(MoO4)3and its base subtraction solid solution Na1 - ıCo1 - ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 were prepared at 650–700°ë and annealing times of 140–160 h. Triple molybdate NaCo3Cr(MoO4)5 was synthesized as a single-phase sample at 700°ë after 200-h annealing. Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 and NaCo3Cr(MoO4)5both melt incongruently at 850 and 860°ë, respectively, without undergoing polymorphic transitions.

Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 crystallizes in trigonal system (space group Z = 6), as shown by powder X-ray diffraction, and is isostructural to Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 [2]. The large extent of the crystallization field (0 ≤ ı ≤ 0.5) of the nasicon solid solutions is due to the possibility of isomorphic substitutions in octahedra. The octahedral sites (M) randomly occupied by Co and Cr cations contain an excess of chromium (for ı > 0) and a deficit of cobalt. Sodium, which resides in interstices, does not distort the lattice symmetry and is also in a deficit. These structural features of Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 and the cation distribution pattern increase the contribution from Cr–O bonds to the overall electrostatic balance of the structure. For balance, Na–O bonds should be weakened; as a result, the Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 unit cell volume increases with enlarging the homogeneity extent (Table 1). NaCo3Cr(MoO4)5 crystallizes in triclinic system (space group Z = 2) and is isostructural to NaMg3In(MoO4)5 [4]. Its unit cell parameters are as follows: a = 6.964(2) Å, b = 17.597(3) Å, c = 6.879(1) Å, α = 88.02(1)°, β = 101.36(1)°, γ = 92.12(3)°. The basis o f the NaMg3In(MoO4)5 crystal structure is a threedimensional framework built of åÓé4 tetrahedra and Mg(In)O6 octahedra. Closed interstices of the framework are populated by sodium atoms. This structure is distinguished by planar-rectangular units of four octahedra and twinned edge-sharing octahedra. Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 structure is a topologic analogue of corundum: Co(Cr) atoms are randomly distributed over two sets of sites with octahedral coordination by oxygen on threefold axes (symmetry ë3), and åÓé4 groups are on twofold axes (symmetry ë2). The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral interstices are united into a three-dimensional network of channels whose bores are filled by sodium cations; the site symmetry of sodium cations is ë3i. The existence of discrete distorted tetrahedral anionic groups Mo in the structure makes possible a comparative analysis of the internal vibrations of discrete Mo groups and external vibrations, that is, the vibrations of cationic sublattices and åÓé4 tetrahedra as a whole [9]. The bands associated with Mo vibrations experience an isotope shift upon 92Mo–100Mo substitutions (Tables 2, 3). The comparatively low symmetry of åÓé4 tetrahedra suggests the release of degeneracy from their doubly and triply degenerate vibrations and the IR activity of the components of full-symmetry stretching vibrations. Group-theory analysis suggests the following irreducible representation distribution for the factor group D3d of the crystal space group: ÉNa = A1u(inact) + Ä2u(IR) + Öu(IR), R3c, P1, O4 2– O4 2– O4 2–, ÉCo+Cr = A1g + A2g(inact) + 2Ög(Raman) + A1u(inact) + Ä2u(IR) + 2Öu(IR), ÉåÓ = 3A2g(inact) + 3Ög(Raman) + 3Ä2u(IR) + 3Öu(IR). The Raman spectra should contain three lines of the vibrations of Co2+ and Cr3+ cations, and IR absorption spectra should contain two bands of the vibrations of Na+ cations and three associated with the vibrations of Co2+ and Cr3+ cations. Six MoO4 vibration lines should appear in the Raman spectrum and nine lines in the IR spectrum. The bands at 960–763 cm–1 (stretching vibrations) and 408–308 cm–1 (bending vibrations) were assigned to the internal vibrations of MoO4 groups; these bands experience a shift in response to molybdenum-isotope substitution and lie in the spectra region characteristic of the vibration frequencies of åÓé4 tetrahedra. The full-symmetry stretching vibrations of molybdate groups, which are distributed over two sets of crystal sites, are degenerate, probably, because of the similarity of the geometry and dynamics of these polyhedra [4, 9]. The stretching vibration frequencies of MoO4 groups increase by 20–25 cm–1 in response to increasing ı, likely, because of increasing Co–O and Cr–O binding energies as a result of the considerable generation of extra cation vacancies. The random cation distribution, not influencing the spectral pattern as a whole, leads to a relative line broadening; in association, the distortion of MoO4 tetrahedra decreases, and the splitting of the triply degenerate stretching vibration is reduced. The Raman lines below 300 cm–1 (at 263−265 cm–1; Table 2) were assigned to Co2+ and Cr3+ cations. The band at 191 cm–1 (Table 3) was assigned to chromium vibrations. The low-frequency sets of Raman lines at 113–87 cm–1 were assigned to cobalt vibrations because sodium cation vibrations are Raman inactive. In the IR absorption spectra, bands below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to sodium cation vibrations. Conductivity in Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3 varies from 10–8 to 10–2 S/cm as temperature rises from 20 to 600°ë. Ion conductivity (ti = 0.74–0.89) is characteristic of this phase (Table 4). Activation energy values are within 1.82–2.15 eV . Conductivity increases with ı along the solid solution series because of the structural specifics of nasicon-like phases. Na+ + Co2+ = Cr3+ + ? heterovalent substitutions in the solid solution series generate extra sodium vacancies, which influence the sodium cation mobility in framework interstices united into a system of channels [1–5]. A correlation is found between variations in conductivity σ and unit cell volume of the phases of variable composition. Dielectric constant ε varies from 140 to 760 while temperature in within 20–600°ë; the dielectric loss tangent varies from 2.8 to 15.3; ε and tan δ are exponential functions of temperature without extremes, indicating the nonoccurrence of phase transitions and ferroelectric properties in Na1 – ıCo1 – ıCr1 + ı(MoO4)3.
