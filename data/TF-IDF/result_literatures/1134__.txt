Perovskite-type BaMg0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3 − δ (BMNF) and double perovskite-type Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6 − δ (BCNF) were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction at 1400 °C in air. Ex-situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and high temperature PXRD (30–700 °C) of BCNF and BMNF under CO2 and SO2 exhibited excellent chemical stability. Chemical stability under SO2 was further conﬁrmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), where no sulfur-containing compounds were detected within the detection limit of the equipment. BCNF and BMNF were tested for their sensing properties in CO2 and SO2 at 500–700 °C by applying constant DC voltage (0.1 V). Ag and Pt current collectors were employed as electrodes for BCNF and showed similar response at 600 °C (t90 = 7 min) for ppm level of CO2 in dry synthetic air. BCNF sensor was found highly stable and very selective toward CO2 in presence of SO2 (0 – 20 ppm)

Recently, detecting greenhouse gases has become essential to control the damage they cause to the environment and quality of life [1–3]. The demand for convenient and low-cost sensor for continuously monitoring gaseous emissions from various processes is steeply growing. Monitoring or detecting the concentration of gases in the environment is generally based on optical, chromatography, and spectroscopy methods. These techniques are expensive to use and real-time on-line monitoring at high temperature is not practical since gaseous species need to be cooled down and require dust-free environments to operate. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative gas sensing technologies which can provide reliable and reproducible sensing results.

A practical sensor should be compact, easy to fabricate and miniaturize, inexpensive, and should provide rapid response relative to the targeted gas in the presence of other gases [4–7]. Solid-state ionic conductor-based electrochemical sensors fall in this category, which give electrical signals that can be directly related to the gas present in the system. The best-known example is a widely used commercial O2 sensor based on oxide ion conducting yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Fast alkali ion conducting Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has highly been considered for developing CO2 and SO2 gas sensors using carbonate and sulfate auxiliary electrodes, respectively [7–10]. Yamazoe et al. [11,12] used binary carbonate and sulfate auxiliary phases such as Na2CO3–BaCO3 and Na2SO4–BaSO4 as sensing electrode to avoid humidity effect and chemical degradation [13,14]; however, the reliability, reproducibility and long-term stability have remained as major challenges. Ishihara et al. [15] reported solid state thin ﬁlm CO2 (ppm level to 10%) sensors based on semiconducting BaTiO3–CuO, where high resistivity, reproducibility and durability issues still persist. Recently, we have employed mixed conducting perovskite-type BaMg0.33Nb0.67 − xFexO3 − δ and double perovskite-type Ba2Ca0.66Nb1.34 − xFexO6 − δ for detection of CO2 (ppm level) in dry synthetic air using Au current collectors [16–18]. Here, we report the role of current collectors on sensing CO2, and investigate sensing SO2 in dry synthetic air at elevated temperature using BaMg0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3 − δ (BMNF) and Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6 − δ (BCNF).

Oxides of the nominal chemical formula of Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6 − δ (BCNF) and BaMg0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−δ (BMNF) were prepared using hightemperature solid-state (ceramic) synthesis method. Stoichiometric amounts of Ba(NO3)2 (99 + %, Alfa Aesar), CaCO3 (99% Fisher Scientiﬁc Company), MgCO3 (J. T. Baker®), Nb2O5 (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and Fe2O3 (99 + %, Alfa Aesar) were mixed together with 2-propanol in a zirconia bowl and ball milled (Pulverisette Fritsch, Germany) for 6 h at 200 rpm, followed by ﬁring at 1000 °C in air for 12 h. The samples were then ground using agate mortar and pestle until ﬁne powder of the compound was obtained and pressed isostatically into dense pellets. BCNF pellet was sintered at 1400 °C, while BaMg0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3 − δ (BMNF) was sintered at 1300 °C. BMNF samples were ball milled again by adding 2-propanol followed by isostatic pellet pressing and re-sintered at 1200 °C in air.

The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Bruker D8 powder X-ray diffractometer) (Cu Kα) (2θ = 10°–80°; scan rate of 0.02o and a counting time of 6 s per scan) at room temperature. The high temperature PXRD (HT-PXRD) patterns were collected at 30 °C, 500 °C and 700 °C (at 6 °C/min) in the presence of 1% CO2 balanced in dry synthetic air (21% O2 in N2) using PXRD equipped with variable temperature and atmosphere stage (Anton Par HTK2000). The gas ﬂow rate was maintained at 100 sccm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30 SEM) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was used for the determination of chemical composition and microstructure characterization. Samples were crushed into ﬁne powders and treated in 30 ppm SO2 gas in dry synthetic air at 700 °C for 72 h and resultant product was examined using PXRD.

Sintered pellets of BCNF and BMNF having average diameter of 1 cm were cut into ~1 mm thickness using diamond saw (Buehler, Isomet® 5000). The circular pellets were used for two-electrode electrochemical sensor fabrication. Au, Ag, and Pt pastes (Heraeus Inc., LP A88-11 S Germany) were painted on both sides of the investigated metal oxides. Au and Ag pasted perovskites (BCNF and BMNF) were ﬁred at 600 °C and Pt pasted electrolyte at 800 °C for 2 h in air to remove the organic binders. The pellets were kept inside a gas-tight quartz cell and heated using a Barnstead tubular furnace (model no. 21100) until it reached the desired temperature (Fig. 1). The required ratio of CO2 gas was prepared by diluting 3000 ppm CO2 with dry synthetic air (or N2 + O2) (Praxair, Inc., Canada). The total ﬂow rate of sample gas or the base N2 gas was adjusted at 100 sccm by means of mass ﬂow controllers (MCS-100 SCCM-D/5M, 5IN). A constant dc voltage of 0.1V was applied (Solartron, SI 1287) to obtain the response current detecting CO2 concentration.

Fig. 2 shows the in situ HT-PXRD structural patterns of Ba2Ca0.66 Nb0.68Fe0.66O6 − δ (BCNF) and BaMg0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3 − δ (BMNF) at 30 °C, 500 °C and 700 °C with the continuous ﬂow of 1% CO2 balanced in dry synthetic air (21% O2 in N2). The PXRD patterns for BCNF and BMNF are attributed to their parent compound Ba2Ca0.66Nb1.34O6 (BCN) and BaMg0.33Nb0.67O3 (BMN) structure [16,17]. Ca and Nb ordered at the B-site shows double perovskite structure with space group Fm-3m (No. 221), while Mg exhibits disordered perovskite with space group Pm-3m (No. 221). Although, both compounds vary in the structure (B-site order/disorder), they provide excellent stability under 1% CO2 at elevated temperature.

SEM images for pellet samples of as-prepared and after 30 ppm SO2 in synthetic air (700 °C for 72 h) exposed Fe-doped BCNF and BMNF are shown in Fig. 3(a). No traces of sulfur containing compound were detected using EDX combined with SEM for BCNF and BMNF samples after SO2 treatment. Furthermore, ex-situ PXRD patterns before and after exposure of SO2 show the similar diffraction patterns (Figs. 2a, 2b and 3b). The absence of secondary phase in BCNF and BMNF after SO2 treatment comparing to their parent phase (Fig. 2) indicates that both samples are chemically stable under SO2. PXRD data was also used to calculate the theoretical density (ρt) as, where, M, Z, V and N are molecular weight, number of formula units per unit cell, volume of the unit cell and Avogadro's constant respectively. ρA, Archimedes density, was calculated by, where, Mdry is dry weight of pellet in air after drying by gently wiping out water from pellet's surface. Msat is the weight of pellet in water and Msus in air before weighing Mdry. For determining ρA, the pellets were immersed in boiled water for few hours prior to measuring the weights (Msat, Msus, Mdry) for letting the water to penetrate the ﬁnest pores. The theoretical densities (ρt) are found to be 5.53 g/cm3 and 6.09 g/cm3 and the Archimedes densities (ρA) 5.12 g/cm3 and 5.10 g/cm3 for BCNF and BMNF, respectively.

BCNF's sensing properties using Pt and Ag electrodes in similar concentration ranges of SO2 in dry synthetic air. The obtained response and recovery behavior at 600 °C are shown in Fig. 5(c). The response for Pt and Ag was slower (t90 = 8 min) (Fig. 5d) compared to Au electrode at 600 °C (t90 = 3 min) (Fig. 5b). However, the issue of monitoring lower concentration of SO2 (b30 ppm) still persists with Au, Pt and Ag electrodes. Hori et al. [20] have reported CO2 reduction where the effect of Au seemed to be more pronounced comparing to that of Ag and Pt. They have shown that the CO2 can be reduced at constant – 2.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in non-aqueous electrolyte. All three electrodes predominantly yielded CO from CO2, where Au showed the highest Faradic efﬁciency than Ag and Pt.

The potential mechanism for CO2 has been described in our previous CO2 sensor studies [16–18]. Brieﬂy, the O2 produced from CO2 reduction due to catalytic activity of Fe in BCNF and BMNF as well as O2 present in dry synthetic air tend to increase the current density by creating mixed conduction. Wetchkakun et al. have further provided additional evidences for CO2 and SO2 sensing mechanisms [21].

Furthermore, an interesting CO2 sensitivity result in the presence of SO2 at similar conditions (700 °C and 0.1 V) has been obtained (Fig. 6). The ppm level of CO2 in dry synthetic air was varied in the range of 100–1500ppm (solid line). In similar manner, the CO2 sensing measurements were carried out in dry synthetic air with 10ppm (dash line) and 20 ppm SO2 (dotted line) at 700 °C. All three measurements exhibited the same trend for response and recovery transients without any rise

Fig. 4(a) shows the response to CO2 for Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6 − δ (BCNF) using Ag and Pt current collectors/electrodes at 600 °C. For this study, the maximum temperature was kept at 600°C to avoid potential diffusion of Ag in solids at temperatures ≥650 °C [19]. The time to acquire 90% steady state current (t90) was approximately 7 min at 600 °C for both Ag and Pt electrodes using BCNF. However, the current density for Pt (broken line) electrode was higher than Ag (solid line) electrode. Au electrode, in our previous study, exhibited t90 of 5 min at 600 °C [17]. The CO2 sensing properties of investigated perovskites at 600 °C using Au, Pt and Ag are shown in Fig. 4b, where the response behavior is linear against the log CO2 in ppm level.

Fig. 5(a) shows the long-term stability of BCNF using Au electrodes; however, displays no difference in steady state current density at different ppm levels of SO2. This result has led to further test or fall in the current densities. Although, the stable and reproducible response current density by BCNF for CO2 with ppm level of SO2 in dry synthetic air atmosphere is promising, further tests with higher ppm level of SO2 and other different gases at various temperatures are required to understand the sensing properties. It is very crucial to measure CO2 and SO2 in ppm range, in particular, in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), carbon capture and storage (CCS), and other industrial applications due to catalyst poisoning and safety issues.

In summary, PXRD results revealed the high chemical stability of as-prepared BCNF and BMNF against 1% CO2 in dry synthetic air and 30ppm SO2 in dry synthetic air as well. BCNF at 500 and 600°C exhibited similar sensing trends for CO2 using Ag and Pt. The t90 values were found to be ~7min at 600°C for both Pt and Ag. Sensing tests on lower range of SO2 concentration (0–20 ppm) employing BCNF showed no difference in current density despite of using different (Au, Pt and Ag) electrodes; however, it demonstrated excellent long-term stabilities. In addition, BCNF displayed its good selectivity properties towards CO2 in the presence of SO2 gas (ppm). Thus, further research is required to (i) improve the selectivity properties and develop new materials to detect lower ppm level of SO2 in SOFC operating conditions; and (ii) understand the sensing linearity relationship between logPCO2 and current density together with their chemical stability of investigated perovskites under ppm level of SO2 and CO2.
