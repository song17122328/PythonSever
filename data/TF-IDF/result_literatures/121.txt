The thermal properties of yttrium-stabilized lithium zirconate phosphate [LZP] are presented over a wide temperature range from 30 to 973 K, elucidating the interplay between structural phase transformations and thermal properties in a solid state superionic conducting material. At room temperature, the thermal conductivity decreases by more than 75% as the stoichiometry is changed from lithium deficient to excess and increases with increasing temperature, indicative of defect-mediated transport in the spark plasma sintered materials. The phase transformations and their stabilities are examined by x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry and indicate that the Y3þ substitution of Zr4þ is effective in stabilizing the ionically conductive rhombohedral phase over the entire temperature range measured, the mechanism of which is found through ab initio theoretical calculations. These insights into thermal transport of LZP superionic conductors are valuable as they may be generally applicable for predicting material stability and thermal management in the ceramic electrolyte of future all-solid-state-battery devices.
Using elemental lithium (Li) as anodes will be highly advantageous in electrochemical energy storage devices in terms of the capacity and cell voltage;1 however, the main challenge preventing this beneficial anode from use in batteries is the formation of un-wanted Li-dendrites during the charge and discharge cycles.2 The solution to this challenge is to design electrolytes that are mechanically robust enough to block dendrite propagation while simultaneously allowing fast conduction of ions.3–9 Using solid ion conducting electrolytes will enable this fast charge–discharge;1 however, cycling at high rates will be hindered if the large amount of inevitable heat generated by Joule heating is not accounted for in cell design.10,11 Relevant to applications, improved thermal stability and thermal conductivity of solid state electrolytes will mitigate the most severe limitations of these materials by allowing operation at higher temperatures and reducing hot spots.12 However, thermal conductivity (j) data for these materials are sparse and only available for a few ionic conductors such as lithium iodate (a-LiIO3) and lithium tetraborate (Li2B4O7), which show a room temperature j ~3.5–4 W m-1 K-1 that increases with increasing temperature to~450 K;13,14 lithium aluminum germanium phosphate glass–ceramics [Li1þxAlxGe2?x(PO4)3], which show a room temperature j ? 0.8–1.8 W m?1 K~1 that is nearly temperature independent to ~973 K;15 Li2SO4 and Ag2SO4, which show a room temperature that increases slightly with increasing temperature to ~650 K;16 and LiCuVO4, which shows a room temperature j ~5 W m-1 K-1 that increases with increasing temperature17 similarly to other quasi-1D superionics LiIO3 and Li2B4O7.
Among various oxides, lithium superionic conductor (LISICON)type electrolytes such as lithium zirconate phosphate (LZP) are suitable for high-voltage solid-state batteries.1,9 A general formulation for the LZP crystal structure is Li1þxZr2?xMx(PO4)3, w h e r e M ¼ Al, Ca, Cr, Ga, Fe, Sc, In, Lu, Y, or La.1,18–25 Early transition metals such as Zr4þ have no electron in their d-orbital; therefore, they will not contribute to the electrical conductivity.22 In a LISICON-type structure, MO6 octahedra are interconnected with PO4 tetrahedra by corner sharing, forming the skeleton of the structure. Lithium conduction occurs by hopping between two sites: one located directly between two MO6 octahedra and the other one positioned between two columns of MO6 octahedra. Among LISICON-type materials, LiZr2(PO4)3 ceramics have been shown to form rhombohedral (R3c) structures with promising ionic conductivity on the order of 10?4 S c m?126 although the triclinic (P1) phase of this material possesses low ionic conductivity on the order of 10?8 S c m?1.27 The dominant materials challenge for these superionic conductors is that the triclinic phase is thermodynamically favored at normal battery operating temperatures. The ion-conducting rhombohedral phase is not stable over battery operating temperature ranges as a triclinic-to-rhombohedral phase transition takes place at temperatures above 310 K (Ref. 28) [reported in the range from 300 to 340 K (Refs. 29 and 30)]. Recent advances have identified empirical evidence for defect-stabilized rhombohedral LZP–based materials using, for example, a Zr-acetate3 p r e c u r s o r o r s u b s t i t u t i o n o f Z r4þ with Y3þ26 or Ca2þ.23–25 Li et al.3 reported the development of a LZP solid electrolyte with a high effective ionic conductivity of rLi ¼ 2 ? 10?4 S c m?1 at 25 ?C and a high electrochemical stability up to 5.5 V vs Liþ/Li.3 A t h i n amorphous interfacial layer of Li8ZrO6 and Li3P was formed on the LiZr2(PO4)3 surface due to a reaction with the Li metal. This interfacial layer was wet by the Li metal and suppressed the Li dendrite propagation. These promising results motivate the present work to investigate the thermal properties of transition-metal stabilized LZP.
Here, we report the phase stability and thermal conductivity of Li1þxþyYxZr2?x(PO4)3 (x ¼ 0.15, ?0.2 ? y ? 0.4 and x ¼ 0.0, y ¼ 0.0) ceramics over a wide temperature range from 30 to 973 K. Stabilization of the rhombohedral phase is confirmed by substitution of Zr4þ by Y3þ (denoted as x) where the charge imbalance caused by this substitution is taken into account by adding x equivalent charges from excess Liþ. Moreover, various lithium concentration quantities are used in order to investigate the effects of Li excess or deficiency (denoted as y) on the phase stability.
The room temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the Li1þxþyYxZr2?x(PO4)3 samples are shown in Fig. 1. T h e c r y s t a l l o graphic structures reported for the rhombohedral structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 [R3c (167)],31 triclinic LiZr2(PO4)3 [P1 (2)],32 monoclinic LiZr2(PO4)3 [P21/c (14)],33 tetragonal YPO4 [I41/amd (141)],34 and cubic ZrP2O7 [Pa3 (205)]35 were adopted as a starting structural model in the Rietveld analysis. The peak profile and background were fitted using a pseudo-Voigt and a nine-term Chebyshev polynomial, respectively. The instrument parameters were derived from a refinement using a NIST LaB6 standard. Satisfactory structure refinements were obtained by varying the lattice parameters, phase fraction, microstrain, and crystallite size terms. Site occupancies, atomic positions,and thermal factors were fixed as the quality of the refinement was adequate for quantitative analysis. The graphics of the Rietveld analysis for the Li-deficient sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2) and the sample with excess Li (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2) are shown in Figs. S1 and S2 in the supplementary material, respectively. The crystalline phases present in each sample, refined lattice parameters, weight percentages, and reliability factors are detailed in Table S1, supplementary material.
In order to investigate the effects of Y3þ substitution, we analyzed the Rietveld refined XRD data of the samples with and without Y. In the sample with no Y3þ (x ¼ 0.0, y ¼ 0.0), only 12.9 wt. % of the sample was found to be in the rhombohedral phase, and the rest practically consisted of the triclinic phase. In contrast, the sample with Y3þ substitution (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0) was composed of 97.5 wt. % rhombohedral phase with no sign of the triclinic phase, providing evidence for the effectiveness of the Y3þ substitution of Zr4þ for stabilizing the ionically conductive rhombohedral phase. In addition, several samples with less and more Li than the stoichiometric value were synthesized and analyzed in o r d e r t o u n d e r s t a n d t h e e f f e c t s o f h a v i n g e x c e s s L i v s i t s d e ficiency. In the Li-deficient sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2), only 36.5 wt. % rhombohedral phase was detected. Triclinic was the major phase (55.5 wt. %) along with minor formation of cubic ZrP2O7 (2.5 wt. %). Thus, it can be concluded that a lack of Li can destabilize the rhombohedral phase and favor formation of the triclinic phase, a result which should be accounted for in application. On the other hand, in the case of using excess Li (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2, 0.4), the samples mainly consisted of rhombohedral phase (55.9 and 69.1 wt. %, respectively) with considerable monoclinic phase concentration (43.6 and 30.3 wt. %, respectively). Therefore, in addition to the rhombohedral phase, the deficiency and excess of Li favored the formation of triclinic and monoclinic phases, respectively.
Figure 2(a) shows a representative pellet used for thermal diffusivity (a) measurements and a representative rectangular bar used for low-temperature j measurements which have been cut from the measured pellet. The low-temperature specific heat (cp) a n d j measurement data are shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements from 75.18 to 473.15 K indicate that samples with no triclinic phase (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0, 0.4) experienced no phase transformation, and the rhombohedral phase was stable over this temperature range. In contrast, a major peak centered at 320.15 K was observed for the Li deficient sample with x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2 which was attributed to the triclinic phase transition. The x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0 . 2 s a m p l e e x h i b i t e d a s m a l l p e a k a t 3 3 8 . 1 5 K which can arise due to the larger monoclinic phase in this sample. The low-temperature j measurements from 20 to 300 K [taken perpendicular to the spark plasma sintering (SPS) direction], showed an entirely different behavior for the Li-deficient sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2) compared to the charge balanced sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0) or the sample with excess Li (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2). For the former, clear phonon–phonon scattering dominant behavior was detected, whereas for the latter cases j slightly increased with increasing temperature from 20 to 300 K. It is reasonable to attribute the different trends in j to the dominance of the triclinic phase in Li-deficient samples and the dominance of the rhombohedral phase in the other samples.
 High-temperature DSC measurements from 298 to 973 K are illustrated in Fig. 2(d). No phase transformation is observed for x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ (0.0, 0.4) over the entire temperature range. Similar to the low-temperature measurements, a major peak at 334.75 K was detected for x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2, and minor peak at 341.35 K was detected for x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2. The slight difference in the peak locations detected over the common temperature range of low and hightemperature DSC data can be attributed to the different instruments used for each measurement.36
Above-room-temperature a and j data are shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), respectively. For the Li-deficient sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2), the a decreases from 0.57 mm2 s?1 at room temperature to 0.35 mm2 s?1 at 973 K. The a of the samples with x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ (0.0, ?0.2) slightly decreases and then approaches a value of 0.34 mm2 s?1 as the temperature increased to 973 K. The a o f t h e s a m p l e w i t h x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0 . 4 ( s a m p l e w i t h e x c e s s L i ) i n c r e a s e s o v e r t h e e n t i r e t e m p e r ature range to this value. The above-room-temperature j of x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ (0.0, 0.2, 0.4) samples steadily increased as the temperature was raised from 300 to 973 K, a trend reported for single-crystalline Li-based superionics13,14,17 although in this work the magnitude of j is lower and the temperature at which j begins to increase is higher due to the polyc r y s t a l l i n e n a t u r e o f t h e m a t e r i a l s . T h e r o o m t e m p e r a t u r e j values are on the order of those reported for sintered superionics.15
For the stoichiometric sample with x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0, j increases from 0.68 W m?1 K?1 at room temperature to 1.1 W m?1 K?1 at 973 K. The Li-deficient sample (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ ?0.2) exhibited a very different trend in j in a small temperature range near room temperature, increasing rapidly to a maximum of 1.32 W m?1 K?1 at 327.6 K [Fig. 2(f)] and then decreasing rapidly with increasing temperature. This rapid change in j corresponded well to the triclinic-to-rhombohedral phase transformation that was observed to occur around 320–335 K by DSC [Figs. 2(b) and 2(d)]. After the rhombohedral phase transformation occurred, j rapidly approached that of the other samples. It should be noted that in order to obtain j at both low and hightemperatures on each individual sample, high-temperature j values are reported parallel to the SPS press direction, while low-temperature values are j reported perpendicular to the SPS press direction owing to the experimental geometry required for each technique.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate a comparison between the temperature-dependent DSC measurements of three additional stoichiometric (x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0) samples to look at the reproducibility of the experimental results. Samples 1 and 3 were measured by NETZSCH Instruments Testing Laboratory, Burlington, MA, on a NETZSCH model DSC 404 F1 PegasusVR differential scanning calorimeter, and sample 2 was measured on a NETZSCH DSC 404 C in our laboratory. Despite being different samples from different synthesis batches, the obtained data were within ?7% of one another. Figures 3(b) and 3(d) show the thermal diffusivity measurements of x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.0 samples 1 and 2, and two additional samples of x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2 representing two samples of each chemical composition from different synthesis batches. These measurements showed a maximum difference of 16.7% at 326 K and 6.2% at 573 K, respectively. Moreover, a maximum difference of 6.4% at 156 K was obtained for two thermal conductivity measurements of the x ¼ 0.15, y ¼ 0.2 samples over the entire temperature range from 30 to 312 K [Fig. 3(d)]. The sample without Y substitution showed a phase change in the range from 300 to 345 K which caused an anomaly in j (Fig. S3, supplementary material) but approached a value close to those obtained for the rest of the samples (0.72 W m?1 K?1 at 973 K).
 The primary goal of our density functional theory (DFT)37,38 calculations is to understand the stabilization of the ion-conducting rhombohedral phase over the triclinic phase of yttrium-stabilized LZP when external perturbations that may come from experimental conditions, e.g., doping and pressure, are present. The DFT version implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package39 was used for our calculations, employing the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchangecorrelation functional37,38 and a plane wave energy cutoff of 600 eV. A Monkhorst-Pack mesh of 7 ? 7 ? 7 was used to sample the Brillouin zone, which, in our case, makes a fine k-point density of no larger than 0.025 p A˚ ?1. Using this numerical scheme, the experimentally resolved rhombohedral and triclinic structures were then relaxed until atomic forces were smaller than 0.01 eV A˚ ?1. The optimized lattice parameters of the examined structures were consistent with the measured values (Table S2, supplementary material). The DFT energy of the rhombohedral phase was about 13 meV atom?1 higher than the triclinic phase, confirming that the triclinic phase is indeed the ground state in the undoped sample. This energy difference, however, is small, being just about one half of the thermal energy per atom (kBT is ?26 meV at room temperature). Therefore, temperature could be one factor for the stabilization of the rhombohedral phase as evidenced by the experimental DSC results. However, the role of temperature was not considered in this work because of enormous computational resource needed; we instead focus on other major knowledge gaps relevant to materials engineering of yttrium-stabilized LZP superionic conductors.
Metastable phases of solids are often realized,40–43 but their stabilization is normally quite complicated and hard to be traced out. For example, the metastable Pca21 ferroelectric phase of HfO2—predicted by theory and recently experimentally realized—was found to be stabilized by not any single perturbation such as doping, but by an optimal combination of many factors including surface energy, strain, doping, and external electric field.44–46 Pressure and stress were also found to stabilize numerous binary compounds of Mg and Si.4 Therefore, we consider the effects of both Y-doping and external isotropic pressure on the thermodynamic favorability of the rhombohedral and triclinic phases of LZP. For such calculations, we used a 2 ? 1 ? 1 supercell of the primitive cell of these phases, both containing 4 formula units. One Zr atom was replaced by an Y atom, leading to x ¼ 0.25, being comparable with our experimental value of x ¼ 0.15. For the rhombohedral phase, there is one inequivalent position of Zr while for the triclinic phase, there are two. In our calculations, all of these possible doping sites were considered.
The relative energy of these two phases is shown in Fig. S4 in the supplementary material as a function of pressure. Y-doping dramatically elevates the relative energy of the triclinic phase from ?13 to ?1 meV atom?1, stabilizing the rhombohedral phase. Pressure, which may be realized locally during the synthesis of the material, such as near the surface and grain boundaries, also plays a significant role in stabilizing the undoped rhombohedral phase over the undoped triclinic phase, bringing the energy difference between them from 13 to about 4 meV atom?1. We believe that the small energy differences uncovered by the theoretical calculations in this work are well within the recently introduced “amorphous limit”47 that allows metastable solid phases (in this case the undoped rhombohedral phase) to become synthesizable.
In conclusion, the relationship between thermal transport and phase stability of yttrium-doped lithium zirconate phosphate solid state superionic conductors was reported in detail. X-ray diffraction showed that in the absence of Y3þ, the sample consisted of mainly the non-conductive triclinic LZP with only 12.9 wt. % of the ionconducting rhombohedral phase. The specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity were presented over a wide temperature range from 30 to 973 K, and varied from ?0.35 to 1.5 W m?1 K?1 at room temperature, which was found to depend strongly on the concentration of lithium. Apart from the importance of a detailed understanding of thermal properties of non-stoichiometric LZP solid-state electrolytes for thermal management in practical applications of all-solid-state-batteries, we hope that the current work inspires future investigations of thermal transport phenomena in superionic conductors including during fast charge and discharge operation.
