Al substituted Li1+xAlxHf2x(PO4)3 solid electrolytes were prepared by conventional sintering (CS) and spark plasmasintering (SPS), and the Li+ ion conductivity of the sintered pellets was examined using an impedance analyzer.
All the samples exhibited arhombohedral NASICON-type structure.
SPS improved the densification compared to CS, and Al substitution further increased the sampledensity resulting in a maximum density of 90%.
The Li+ ion conductivity increased in proportion to the sample density and the highestconductivity of 1.1 was found in the Li1.5Al0.5Hf1.5(PO4)3 SPS specimen, which is comparable to the best value reportedelsewhere.
The activation energy of the total conductivity (bulk+grain boundary) reduced from 0.39 to 0.28 eV with Al substitution.
Theenhanced conductivity was discussed in terms of the densification, bottleneck size, and lithium ion content.
The Li+ ion conductivity in LiHf2(PO4)3-based solidelectrolytes was greatly enhanced by employing SPS and Alsubstitution.
Up to x =0.5 in Li1+xAlxHf2x(PO4)3, arhombohedral NASICON R3¯c structure was maintained,and the lattice parameters and unit cell volume decreasedwith increasing Al concentrations.
Both SPS and Alsubstitution improved the densification, and a maximumdensity of ¨90% was achieved in x =0.5 Al substituted,SPS specimen.
The increase of ionic conductivity byenhancing the densification was confirmed by comparingthe CS and SPS specimens.
In the SPS specimens, both bulkand grain boundary conductivities increased with Alsubstitution, resulting in the highest conductivity of1.1104 Scm1. The activation energy of the totalconductivity (bulk+grain boundary) reduced from 0.39 to0.28 eV with Al substitution.
