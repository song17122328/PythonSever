Vanadyl(V)–titanium–orthophosphate (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 is formed by solid state reactions in the temperature range 525rWr780 1C. At higher temperature decomposition into V2O5 and the hitherto unknown solid solution Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 (0r xr0.23; 0.30r xr0.43) is observed. The process of phase formation has been monitored by MAS-NMR (31P, 51V) spectroscopy. Equilibrium phase relations in the quaternary system TiO2/VO2.5/PO2.5 have been determined.

A structure analysis from X-ray single-crystal data (P63=m (No. 176), Z¼2; a¼8.4438(3) ˚A, c¼22.215(1) ˚A, 14 independent atoms, 87 variables, 2066 unique reﬂections, R1¼0.032, wR2¼0.084) shows the relationship of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 to the NASICON structure family. In marked contrast to the 2 O9] double-octahedra and strongly distorted tetrahedral [(VV¼O)O3] other members of this family [TiIV groups are observed besides isolated [TiIVO6] octahedra and phosphate tetrahedra. The structure model is in agreement with the results from MAS-NMR (31P, 51V) spectroscopy.

The close structural relationship between ortho-phosphates/ vanadates (e.g.,: LaPO4 [1]/LaVO4 [2]; LuPO4 [3]/LuVO4 [4]; b-CrPO4 [5]/CrVO4 [6]) and pyro-phosphates/vanadates (e.g.,: Mn2P2O7 [7]/ Mn2V2O7 [8]; Cu2P2O7 [9]/Cu2V2O7 [10]; ZrP2O7 [11]/ZrV2O7 [12]) suggests similar crystal chemical behavior of P5þ and V5þ , despite )¼0.17 ˚A, rather different ionic radii (tetrahedral coordination: IR(P5þ )¼0.355 ˚A [13]). On the other hand, metaphosphates and IR(V5þ metavanadates differ markedly from each other. The ability of vanadium(V) to form (V¼O)3þ groups (e.g.,: VOPO4 [14–16]) and to adopt coordination numbers C.N.44 is in striking difference to the behavior of phosphorus(V) in oxo-compounds. These differences might be related to differences in the oxide ion acceptor behavior (as expressed by Lux-Flood acid-base theory [17,18]) of the corresponding oxides V2O5 and P2O5. The concept of optical basicity L [19,20] quantiﬁes this difference (L(P2O5)¼0.40, L(V2O5)¼0.63; reference: L(CaO)¼1.0).

information on solid solutions phosphate– vanadate and on mixed phosphate–vanadates of transition metals is rather scarce, with Mn2(P1  xVx)2O7 (0rxr1) [21], Zr(P1  x Vx)2O7 [24], Sc(P1  xVxO4) [25] and YP1  xVxO4 [26,27] being the only well documented examples. Even less information is available on vanadyl(V)–phosphates containing a further transition metal.

Up to now Ag2(VVO2)PO4 [28] and Ag(VIVO)(VVO)(PO4)2 [29] are the only well characterized examples. To close these gaps we became interested in phase formation and equilibrium relations in systems MOx/V2O5/P2O5 (M: transition metal). Since V2O5 [30,31] and VOPO4 [32,33] supported on titania or on layered titanium phosphate a-Ti(HPO4)2  H2O [34] are of particular interest as catalyst materials for selective oxidation of o-xylol to phthalic anhydride, ammonoxidation of 3-picoline [35] as well as the selective reduction of NOx with NH3 in presence of O2 [36] we started our study with the system TiO2/V2O5/P2O5. The behavior of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 as catalyst in the selective oxidation of n-butane has already been reported [37].

In this contribution we report on synthesis and crystal structitanium(IV) phosphate (VVO)ture of TiIV Its thermal behavior and equilibrium relations to neighboring phases in the system TiO2/V2O5/P2O5 are described. MAS-NMR (31P, 51V) spectra of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 are discussed with respect to its crystal structure.

For the equilibrium investigations TiO(acac)2 (ABCR, 95%) and ‘‘H2TiO3 nH2O’’ (‘‘Metatitans¨aure’’, CRENOX, 26.2 %wt TiO2), respectively, have been used as starting materials. Their titania content was checked gravimetrically prior to use. As further reactants NH4VO3 (Chempur, 99þ%), (NH4)2HPO4 (Merck, p. a.),

and conc. HNO3 (VWR, Normapur p. a.) were used. The starting materials (SmE1 g) were mixed with 100 mL nitric acid and boiled to dryness (TmaxE410 K). The dried residues were then slowly heated over a period of 9 h to 720 K and kept for 6 to12 h at this temperature, then heated again over a period of 5 h to 970 K and eventually calcined for 72 h for equilibration. The products’ composition was checked by IP-Guinier photographs and in some cases by MAS-NMR spectroscopy (31P, 51V). The results of the equilibrium investigations are summarized in the phase diagram TiO2/VO2.5/PO2.5 (Fig. 1).

6 (PO4)9 have been obtained by isothermal heating of a pellet of a ﬁnely ground mixture of VOPO4 and Ti5O4(PO4)4 (molar ratio 3:1) at 1023 K for 14 day in air. Crystals of isometric habit with edge-lengths up to 0.07 mm were thus grown besides Ti5O4(PO4)4 in a melt of V2O5. In a series of experiments at 720rTr1170 K and varying heating periods the crystallization and thermal decomposition behavior of (VVO)TiIV

6 (PO4)9 was monitored by repeated Guinier photographs.

Vandium(V) oxide was used as commercially available (Merck, reinst). The phosphates TiP2O7 [38], Ti5O4(PO4)4 [39], b-VOPO4 [15], VOPO4 2H2O [40], as well as the pyrovanadate ZrV2O7 [20] were synthesized according to literature. Their Guinier photographs showed no impurity reﬂections. The solid solutions Ti(P0.93V0.07)2O7 and Ti(P0.63V0.37)2O7 as well as (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 were synthesized as micro-crystalline powders as described for sample ‘‘TiV0.45P1.55O7’’ was obtained in the same way, but avoiding higher calcination temperatures than 720 K. The Guinier photographs of the mixed pyro-phosphate/vanadates showed no impurities. The powder sample of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 contained small amounts of Ti(P0.76V0.24)2O7 (Fig. 2).

Micro-crystalline powders obtained during the investigations described in this paper, in particular products after equilibration, have been analyzed by Guinier photographs (camera FR-552 Enraf-Nonius, Cu-Ka1 radiation, quartz monochromator) using the image plate technique [41,42]. Thus, examination of the powder samples for purity and determination of lattice parameters was achieved. Details on this technique have already been reported in [43]. For the lattice parameter reﬁnement diffraction angles were corrected using a-quartz as internal standard. For this correction as well as for the least-squares calculation the program SOS [44] was employed.

6 (PO4)9 were collected on a k-CCD diffractometer (Enraf-Nonius Inc.) at ambient temperature using Mo-Ka radiation. For data reduction the diffractometer software was used (HKL2000, DENZO, SCALEPACK [45]). An analytical absorption correction [46] was applied within the WinGx software package [47]. Structure determination and reﬁnement were performed using the SHELX-97 [48] suite in the WinGX framework (Table 1). Since systematic extinctions and intensity statistics gave ambiguous results for solution and reﬁnement of the crystal structure various hexagonal, trigonal and even monoclinic space groups were attempted {P63/m (no. 176), P63(1 7 3), P3 (1 4 7), P3 (1 4 3), P21/m (11) and P21 (4)}. The structure models with different symmetries led to comparable matches between calculated and observed intensities. They all showed an atomic arrangement related to that of the NASICON type phosphates with NaZr2(PO4)3 [49] as aristotype. Eventually, we decided in favor of space group P63/m (no. 176). This decision is backed by the chemically reasonable interatomic distances, quite low electron density in the ﬁnal D-Fourier synthesis and the by far smallest number of parameters of all models. Nevertheless, we believe that the model represents an average structure only. The true symmetry of the crystal structure of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 has to be lower than P63/m (see below). Thus, resolution of the observed disorder for the [(V¼O)O3] groups would, at least in principle, be possible. However, all attempts failed to resolve the disorder of the vanadyl(V) group (Fig. 10) by using space groups of lower symmetry (P63(1 7 3), P3 (1 4 7), P3 (1 4 3), P21/m (11) and P21 (4)) in combination with appropriate twin laws. A survey of the twin laws typically occurring in NASICON related structures has been given in literature [50].

The NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian Inﬁnityþspectrometer equipped with a commercial 2.5 mm MAS NMR double-resonance probe. The magnetic ﬁeld strength was 9.4 T corresponding to a 31P and 51V resonance frequency of 162.61 and 105.53 MHz, respectively. At 12 kHz spinning frequency the 31P 901 pulse length is 1.9 ms, 200 kHz spectral width and Hahn echo pulse sequence (901–1801) [51] and 50 Hz line broadening was used in data processing. The 31P spectra have been acquired at room temperature, typically over a period of 12 h, with a delay of 120 s, which was sufﬁcient to obtain relaxed spectra.

The 51V MAS NMR spectra were acquired at 24 kHz spinning frequency using the a–t–a spin echo pulse sequence to reduce the distortion of the spectrum [52], with a being the duration of the 51V pulse and t the delay between the ﬁrst and the second pulse. This sequence was used in order to avoid the baseline distortion occasioned by the preacquisition delay. The time delay t was ﬁxed to the rotor period Tr¼1/nr¼41.67 ms. The 51V MAS NMR spectra have been acquired at room temperature in typically

12 h with a repetition delay of 20 s, which is sufﬁcient to obtain relaxed spectra. 51V 901 pulse length is 1.25 ms, 1.500 MHz spectral width and 50 Hz line broadening was used in data processing 50 Hz line broadening was used in data processing. The 31P chemical shifts refer to an 85% aqueous solution of H3PO4, the 51V chemical shifts to VOCl3.

The equilibrium relations observed for the Gibbs phase triangle TiO2/VO2.5/PO2.5 at TE970 K are shown in Fig. 1. A detailed account of all equilibrium experiments will be given separately [53]. Besides the well established phosphates TiP2O7 [54], Ti5O4(PO4)4 [39] and VOPO4 (for which in all our experiments the b-modiﬁcation [15] is observed) vanadyl(V)–titanium(IV)–phosphate (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 is the only ternary equilibrium phase. for TiP2O7 partial substitution of P5þ has been observed. According to the formulation Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 a phosphorus-rich (0rxr0.24) solid solution and a vanadium content (0.30rxr0.43) can be distinguished. The maximum vanadium content was determined to Ti(P0.57V0.43)2O7 (at TE970 K). The isomorphous substitution of phosphorus by vanadium is also evidenced by the Vegard plot (Fig. 3) and the results of the 31P –MAS-NMR study (Fig. 4e and f). It is quite intriguingly that the two ranges of solid solution formation are separated by an equilibrium line connecting (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 and V2O5(l). The latter coexistence has been checked explicitly, by heating (VVO)TiIV

6 (PO4)9 at 970 K in the presence of molten V2O5. The phosphorus-rich solid solution Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 (0rxr 0.24) shows higher thermal stability than the one with (0.30rx r0.43). The latter is completely decomposed at T41070 K into V2O5(l), Ti5O4(PO4)4(s), and Ti(P0.78V0.22)2O7(s). With rising temperature the homogeneity range for the phosphorus-rich solid solution decreases as well.

Interestingly, equilibrium experiments carried out in sealed, evacuated silica tubes showed signiﬁcantly lower solidus temperatures than those where the material was heated in air. Probably, this behavior is due to partial thermal reduction of vanadium(V) at the reduced oxygen pressures. To allow higher reaction temperatures, most equilibrium experiments were therefore carried out in open silica crucibles in air. In agreement with information in literature on the volatility of V2O5 in water vapor [55,56], longer

experiment times, a slight loss of V2O5. No evidence was found for substitution of Ti4þ in Ti5O4(PO4)4. From mass-balance considerations and the results of XRPD and 31P –MAS-NMR studies of the quenched equilibrium phases we conclude that the equilibrium melt co-existing (at TZ970 K) with TiP2O7 or the solid solution up to TiP0.97V0.03O7 shows only small (if any) solubility for titanium, while the ratio n(PO2.5)/n(VO2.5) in the melt appears to be widely variable. The 31P –MAS-NMR spectrum of the quenched melt shows broad resonances at  12.7 and þ30 ppm, which were also observed for a melt of pure b-VOPO4.

At lower temperatures (Tr720 K) even after prolonged heating (up to 6 weeks) the described experimental procedure (starting materials, heating conditions) did not yield micro-crystalline products detectable by XRPD. The 31P –MAS-NMR spectrum of an amorphous sample (T¼720 K, t¼72 h) of overall composition ‘‘TiV0.45P1.55O7’’ (Fig. 4h) shows resonances of b-VOPO4 (diso¼  11.2 ppm), VOPO4  2H2O/aI-VOPO4 (diso¼ þ3.3/þ7.1 ppm) and the strongest signal at diso¼  29.0 ppm with a shoulder at diso¼  26.1 ppm. The latter signals cannot be assigned unequivocally. A precrystalline form of (VO)Ti6(PO4)9 might cause these

two resonances. Similarly, poorly crystallized Ti5O4(PO4)4 might be responsible. The signals clearly visible in the 51V –MAS-NMR spectrum of this sample (Fig. 5h) can be assigned to b-VOPO4 (d(gV)¼  757 ppm) and VOPO4  2H2O/aI-VOPO4 (d(iV)¼  695 ppm). Even though there might be some amorphous material contributing to the spectrum, this assignment excludes the presence of a precrystalline form of (VO)Ti6(PO4)9. Ti5O4(PO4)4, however, would not show up in the 51V –NMR, unless it contains some vanadium, which we already have excluded. Apparently, our experimental conditions lead at low temperatures to a separation of titanium and vanadium phosphates which only at T4720 K begin to equilibrate.

6 (PO4)9 is closely related to that of phosphates of the NASICON structure family. The relationship to Nb2(PO4)3 (‘‘empty NASICON’’ [57]) and to NaZr2(PO4)3 (aristotype of the NASICON structure family [49]) is visualized in Fig. 6. As pointed out by Sch ¨oneborn et al. [50,58] the NASICON structure can be regarded as a hexagonal close-packing of phosphate tetrahedra with 2/3 of the octahedral voids being occupied by Zr4þ ions. In Nb2(PO4)3 the latter sites remain empty. This crystal-chemical systematization allows also inclusion of silicophosphates MIII 4 [Si2O(PO4)6] (MIII: Ti [50],

In these compounds octahedral voids of the hexagonal close-packing of phosphate anions are occupied by M3þ , and (Si2O)6þ ,

respectively. The high pseudo-symmetry of the close-packed phosphate anions leads almost inevitably to merohedrally twinned crystals, as it has been demonstrated by SCH ¨oNEBORN [50,58]. The vanadyl(V)–titanium(IV)–phosphate described in this contribution extends the NASICON-silicophosphate structure family nicely. Ti4þ ions occupy 2/3 of the octahedral voids of the phosphate packing. In contrast to the Nb2(PO4)3 structure their distribution over the voids leads to isolated octahedra [TiIVO6] (for Ti1 and Ti3; Figs. 7 and 8) and dimers [Ti2IV 2 O9] (Fig. 9). Distances d(TiIV–O) in these polyhedra are within the typical range, with [Ti1O6] being only slightly radially distorted. Octahedra [Ti3O6] and especially [Ti2O6] exhibit strong radial distortions due to electrostatic repulsion between adjacent Ti4þ cations. One half of the remaining octahedral voids is occupied by (V¼O)3þ ions (Fig. 10), leading to a fourfold coordination for V5þ with one very short and three longer distances d(V–O) (Table 3). According to our model, the (V¼O)3þ dumbbell is disordered as shown in Fig. 10. Vanadium is found at two positions above and below a triangle of oxygen atoms from phosphate groups [P2O4]. Furthermore, the vanadyl group is tilted with respect to the crystallographic c-axis, showing in total six different orientations corresponding to six alternative positions for O8 at occupancy of 1/6. The three oxygen atoms of the basal plane follow this tilting, leading to positional disorder for atom 07. Whether the disorder is dynamic or static cannot be concluded from our experimental data. While a dynamic inversion of the orientation of the (V¼O)3þ dumbbell with respect to the basal plane appears to be unrealistic, precession around the c-axis cannot be excluded. Obviously, the real symmetry of the local structure around the vanadyl(V) group is lower than assumed by space group P63/m. Since no indication for a larger unit cell was found, reﬁnement in trigonal and monoclinic space groups was attempted. In these reﬁnements (pseudo-)merohedral twinning was allowed for. None of these reﬁnements showed, however, an improvement of the structure model. Despite this ambiguity in the structure the distance d(V¼O)¼1.563(8) ˚A obtained from the reﬁnement is in good agreement with d(V¼O) in the various polymorphs of VOPO4 [14–16] and even with d(V¼O)¼1.551(2) ˚A in VOF3 [67] and d(V¼O)¼1.562(7) ˚A in VOCl3 [68], respectively.

In agreement with literature the 31P –MAS-NMR spectrum of TiP2O7 (Fig. 3a) shows several signals in the range from diso(aP)¼  38.6 ppm to diso(hP)¼  53.3 ppm as a consequence of the 3  3  3 superstructure of TiP2O7 with 11 sites for phosphorus [69,70]. Substitution of phosphorus by vanadium

according to Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 leads to a breakdown of the longrange order (LRO) in the phosphorus sites (Fig. 3e and f) and a loss of the superstructure reﬂections in the XRPD pattern for xZ0.07. For larger x just two broad signals related to phosphorus in P2O7 (diso(tP)¼  44.8 ppm) and PVO7 (diso(sP)¼  31.8 ppm) groups can be distinguished. The intensity ratio I(tP): I(sP)E1: 1.42 for Ti(P0.63V37)2O7 (Fig. 3f) is indicating a preference for the mixed anion PVO7 with respect to homonuclear P2O7 and V2O7 groups. This result is in good agreement with observations for the solid solution Zr(P1  xVx)2O7 (0rxr1) [22].

(Fig. 3c). Since the structure model reported in literature for titanium(IV)–oxide–phosphate contains just four phosphorus sites, the spectrum might point to a superstructure or lower symmetry for this phosphate. Additional, weak resonances in the spectra of the solid solutions Ti(P0.93V0.07)2O7 and Ti(P0.63 V0.37)2O7 (Fig. 4e and f) are attributed to the oxide–phosphate

as impurity. Its occurrence is in agreement with a small loss of V2O5 during thermal treatment, as already mentioned for the equilibrium experiments.

As expected from its crystal structure [15] and complying with literature reports [71] b-VOPO4 shows just one 31P-resonance (iP, diso¼  11.2 ppm; Fig. 4b). In contrast to the reported structure model ‘‘Guinier-pure’’ VOPO4 2H2O shows two strong resonances (diso(pP)¼ þ7.9 ppm and diso(qP)¼ þ3.3 ppm) and a very weak one at diso(jP)¼  11.1 ppm. The latter might be attributed to anhydrous b-VOPO4 (see Fig. 4b) as impurity. 6 (PO4)9 (Fig. 4g) two phosphorus resonances at diso(uP)¼  24.1 ppm and diso(vP)¼  33.1 ppm with an intensity ratio I(uP): I(vP)¼1: 2 are observed and readily assigned to the phosphorus sites P2 (6 h) and P1 (12i) in the structure (Table 2 and Figs. 7–10). The observed isotropic chemical shifts are in the typical range for phosphorus in orthophosphates (Q1 phosphate). Interestingly, P1 and P2 show distinctly different chemical shifts. This difference can obviously be related to the different environments of P1O4 (four [TiO6] octahedra) and P2O4 (three [TiO6] octahedra and the (V¼O)3þ group). Interestingly, the resonance related to the latter phosphate group is signiﬁcantly broader. We attribute this broadening to the disorder of the (V¼O)3þ group and the resulting lowering of the local symmetry of the affected phosphate groups.

The 51V –MAS-NMR spectra of the solid solution Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 (Fig. 5e and f) show a single intense peak with an isotropic shift of  795 to  800 ppm as well as a wide range of sidebands with low intensity. This type of spectrum is typical for vanadium(V) in tetrahedral environment as in (V2O7) and (VPO7) groups and is found for a wide range of pyrovanadates [72]. In ZrV2O7 (Fig. 5a) the main resonance in the shift range from  757 to  800 ppm shows some structure which can be related to the 3  3  3 superstructure already mentioned for TiP2O7 with 11 independent phosphorus (vanadium) sites. This structuring of the main resonance is not observed for Ti(P0.93V0.07)2O7 and Ti(P0.63 V0.37)2O7 (Fig. 5e and f) in agreement with the broken LRO (cfg. 31P –MAS-NMR of these phases).

The 51V –MAS-NMR spectra of V2O5 (Fig. 5c), b-VOPO4 (Fig. 5b), and of VOPO4  2H2O (Fig. 5c) show marked differences compared to those of the pyrovanadates. Obviously, the side bands gain much more intensity, leading to a characteristic enveloping function with similar or even higher intensities
for the sidebands compared to the central resonance. In contrast to the pyrovanadate anions in ZrV2O7 with three short and one longer distance (d(V–Ot)E1.68 ˚A, d(V–Ob)E1.78 ˚A), V2O5, b-VOPO4, and VOPO4  2H2O show one very short ‘‘vanadyl’’ bond, d(V¼O)E1.58 ˚A, four oxygen atoms in the basal plane with d(V–O)E1.90 ˚A and a sixth oxygen trans to the vanadyl bond at a distance d(V–O)42.30 ˚A. As already recognized in literature [73] the strong distortion of the local environment of vanadium(V) by the short vanadyl bond causes the observed changes of the enveloping function.

The spectrum of (VVO)TiIV

6 (PO4)9 (Fig. 5g), with the central resonance at  801 ppm shows more resemblance to the spectra of V2O5, b-VOPO4, and VOPO4  2H2O than to those of the pyrovanadates. In agreement with our aforementioned description of the structure this suggests a very strong bond within the (V¼O)3þ cation and weaker interactions vanadium–oxygen in the trigonal basal plane. This interpretation of the bonding situation in (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 is in marked contrast to the assumption of a tetrahedral VO4 group. Actually, for eleven unambiguously reﬁned crystal structures of orthovanadates of various cations included in the ICSD [74] distances in the range 1.60rd(V–O)r1.87 are reported. For no orthovanadate anion described in literature has a very short bond of d(V–O)E1.55 ˚A been reported. Since it is well known that groups (M¼O)nþ with an electrophilic oxygen atom are crucial for C–H bond activation in selective oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons [75], the catalytic behavior of (VVO)TiIV 6 (PO4)9 in such reactions will be of great interest.

In the ternary system TiO2/V2O5/P2O5 two hitherto unknown phases, the solid solution Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 and the vanadyl(V)– titanium–phosphate (VVO)Ti6(PO4)9, have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The crystal structure of (VVO)Ti6(PO4)9 is related to the NaZr2(PO4)3 (‘‘NASICON’’) structure family. A vanadyl(V) group (V¼O)3þ attached to a basal plane of three oxygen atoms is proven for the ﬁrst time by X-ray single-crystal structure analysis in a well deﬁned compound, though it has been evidenced by various spectroscopic methods in vanadium(V) oxide layers supported by silica. It will be of particular interest for the search of new selective oxidation catalysts to study which other (M¼O)nþ groups can be incorporated into NASICON type structures. Ti(P1  xVx)2O7 and (VVO)Ti6(PO4)9 demonstrate once more the crystal chemical peculiarity of V5þ ) of being able to
