The Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 NASICON-type compounds (0≤x≤1) have been synthesized in powder form by a sol-gel method and sintered for ionic conductivity measurements. In order to improve the compactness of the ceramic without decomposition of the compound, several sintering processes have been tested for one member of the solid solution (x=0.6): the use of sintering aids (ZnO, B2O3, T i O2 and LiNO3), a ball-milling of the synthesized powder, a flash heating, high isostatic pressure, and spark plasma sintering. Finally, a satisfactory compactness of 85% is obtained compared to the referenced value (63%) obtained by uniaxial and isostatic pressing. The ionic conductivity study was performed by impedance spectroscopy. It shows that, despite the formation of vacancies, the substitution Li+→ 1/3 La3++2/3 □ has unfortunately no influence on the conduction for 0≤x≤0.7 since the ionic conductivity remains identical to the LiZr2(PO4)3 one. For higher x values, the ionic conductivity strongly decreases.

The solid solution Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) recently evidenced [1] results from the substitution Li+→ 1/3 La3++2/3 □ between LiZr2(PO4)3 and La1/3Zr2(PO4)3. All the compounds of this series were synthesized every 0.1 from x=0 to x=1 by the same complex polymerizable method. They were structurally characterized from Rietveld treatment of their X-ray and neutron diffraction data. All of them belong to the NASICON family [2, 3], their structure consisting in a three-dimensional network of ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra linked by oxygen atoms. The solid solution is in fact divided in three crystallographic domains: for 0≤x≤0.5, all the compounds present a structural transition with temperature from C1 t o R3c as already observed for LiZr2(PO4)3 [4–6] with a coexistence of the two varieties at room temperature; for 0.6≤x≤0.9, they crystallize in a rhombohedral cell R3 whatever the temperature; for x=1, the structure of La1/3Zr2(PO4)3, P3 at room temperature, changes to P3c1 at high temperature [7, 8]. The slight structural differences between all of the trigonal varieties are due to the cationic La3+/Li+ distribution inside the [Zr2(PO4)]− network. The substitution mechanism of the monovalent Li+ ion by the trivalent La3+ one implies the formation of vacancies leading to the general formula Li1−xLax/3□2x/3Zr2(PO4)3. Because of the vacancies creation and knowing the ability of the Li+ and La3+ ions to move in the [Zr2(PO4)3]− network [9–11], we carried out ionic conductivity measurements on all members of this series. This was made by means of impedance spectroscopy which requires wellsintered pellets. However, it is well known that NASICON compounds are difficult to densify (classically 60% to 70% of the theoretical value) [9–11]. Therefore the optimization of the sintering process was first carried out. This has been led on one member of the series: Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.6) which at room temperature presents only one variety. The densification rate obtained by our method is compared to those obtained from conventional techniques. The different sintering processes used in this study are: the use of sintering aids, Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP), Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS), a flash heating of the pellet and a ball-milling of the powder before sintering. A reference compactness value of 63% is obtained by first uniaxially pressing (7,500 bars) powder of Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 into a pellet of ≈5 mm diameter and ≈2 mm thickness and then by isostatically pressing the resulting pellet at 4,500 bars without subsequent thermal treatment. In addition to the sintering results, ionic conduction properties are given for all the Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 compounds.

Since it has been previously shown in the literature that the synthesis route could influence the sinterability and the ionic conduction properties of a ceramic [12–14], all the members of the solid solution Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 have been synthesized by the same complex polymerizable method [15] f r o m Li2CO3, d r i e d L a2O3, Z r O C l2.8H2O a n d N H4H2PO4 added in stoichiometric proportions. The molar ratios employed for citric acid and ethylene glycol as well as the thermal program used are described in our previous paper [1]. All the resulting products are pure, well crystallized, and lead to a continuous evolution of the cell parameters versus x [1]. Despite the existence of the three crystallographic domains, the a and c cell parameters evolution can be plotted at 800 °C, since all the members crystallize in an hexagonal cell at this temperature (space group R3c for 0≤x≤0.5, space group R3 for 0.6≤x≤0.9 and space group P3 f o r x=1) . Both evolutions are linear, but the a parameter decreases while the c parameter increases. If the NASICON structure is considered as constituted of ribbons O3ZrO3AO3ZrO3 (A=Li, La, □) running along c axis, the increase of the vacancies number with x means a decrease of the cation–cation repulsion between the ribbons implying thus a shortening of the a parameter. At the same time, the increase of the c parameter is due to two additional simultaneous effects: the increase of the vacancies number and the substitution of a small Li+ cation by a larger one La3+ [1]. After each sintering test, the purity of the sample was checked by recording at room temperature an X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern on the two pellet faces with a Philips X’Pert PRO diffractometer, equipped with an X’celerator detector using Cu Kα radiation. Electrical conductivity measurements were investigated by means of impedance spectroscopy in dehydrated N2 atmosphere in the temperature range from 75 °C to 525 °C. The experiments were carried out with ion-blocking sputtered Pt electrodes in a two probes cell. The Frequency Response Analyser (Solartron 1260) and the Dielectric Interface (Solartron 1296) were used in the frequency domain from 10 MHz to 1 Hz. Before each measurement, electrochemical system linearity and stationary were checked. An ac voltage of 200 mV was used for every sample and a waiting time of 25 min was applied after each 50 °C step, to obtain thermal equilibrium of the sample. The scanning electron microscopy images have been obtained using a JEM 10CX II (JEOL).

Most of the NASICON compounds are well known to form low-densified samples. In most of the cases, this is due to the fact that the synthesis and the decomposition temperatures are very close. In the case of the phase Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3, the decomposition temperature is about 1,150 °C which prevents to obtain a well-densified sample by a conventional hot temperature sintering. It is illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows a dilatometric curve obtained from a SETARAM TMA Setsys Evolution 16 dilatometer. The geometry of the sample used is a pellet of diameter and thickness respectively close to 5 and 2 mm with the compacity reference of 63%. To avoid decomposition of the sample, the temperature is limited to 1,000 °C. After 5 h at this temperature, the shrinking of the pellet is about 0.15% only, revealing clearly the inefficiency of such a method. To favor densification, we tried then to use sintering aids as mentioned in literature: ZnO [16], B2O3 [9], TiO2 [17], or LiNO3 [18] were then added in various amounts to Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 previously synthesized. The mixture is pelletized and heated for 6 h at 900 °C. Whatever the amount of ZnO, the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2) revealed the presence of Zn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 leading us to exclude ZnO as sintering aid, while with B2O3, T i O2, o r LiNO3, no secondary phase was detected on the XRD patterns. Table 1 shows the densification rate obtained for various quantities used of the three sintering aids. We observed that the best result was obtained with 4 mol% of B2O3 (67.3%) but this compactness remains too low to retain this method for sintering the compounds. The densification of the Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 pellet can be improved by HIP . The powder is first cooled and isostatically pressed at 200 MPa for 2 min at room temperature and placed inside a silica container with a boron nitride BN protection in order to limit the reaction between the NASICON phase and the container. It is then heated at 450 °C under vacuum until 10–3 mbar for 10 h and sealed. Two tests have been performed at 900 °C and 1,000 °C with the operating conditions given in Fig. 3. T h e s e temperatures avoid the Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 decomposition but lead to 68% and 71% of densification for 900 °C and 1,000 °C respectively which are not high enough to perform ionic conductivity measurements. SPS experiments were then undertaken as it is known to be a rapid and effective heat treating method to quickly sinter ceramic powders at relatively lower temperature in a shorter time compared to conventional sintering methods. This technique has already been successfully used on NASICON compounds such as LiTi2(PO4)3 [19] o r LiHf2(PO4)3 [20]. The sample is placed into a graphite die (8 mm diameter) on which an uniaxial pressure is applied. Electric current (8,000 A) by pulses of 3 ms is then applied leading to a very high heating rate (about 600 °C/min) avoiding thus the phase decomposition. The resulting pellets are annealed for 5 h at 800 °C to eliminate graphite traces. Table 2 gathers the different tests performed by this technique. We observe a significant improvement of the densification (85% to 98%), in particular for the sample C (98%) which has been heated at 1,100 °C. Unfortunately, the X-ray diffraction pattern of this sample revealed small Zr2O(PO4)2 diffraction peaks meaning that decomposition has occurred. This was not observed for the two other samples. Nevertheless, this sintering method gives satisfactory results for the samples A and B (87% and 85% respectively). At this step, we were looking for a sintering technique which could give satisfactory results while being very accessible. Starting from the previous method, we tried to sinter the compound with flash heating by directly introducing the pellet in a hot furnace and quenching it in air at room temperature. The temperature was fixed at 1,450 °C. In order to obtain the highest densification without decomposing the phase, several heating times have been used. We observed that 5 min at this temperature was the best compromise: the sample was still monophased and the pellet densification reaches 78% which was a good improvement compared to the reference value (63%). Figure 4 shows SEM micrographs of this pellet and the reference one for comparison. In addition to the densification, the flash heating improves the crystallinity of the sample and also increases the grain size. This can be observed by the narrowing of the (hkl) lines on the XRD patterns: the half-width parameter w of the pseudo-V oigt function used to generate the line shape of the diffraction peaks is divided by a factor of 2 with the heating flash step, i.e. from 0.0369(4) to 0.0191(1). Finally, we also investigated the influence of the powder ball-milling on the densification of the pellet. A preliminary ball-milling step was performed before the pelletization and the sintering process in order to homogenize the grains size of our samples: 0.3 g of powder and six balls (10 mm diameter) were placed in zirconium jars with ethanol and grinded (500 rpm) for various times. After this step, the Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 powder was pelletized using an uniaxial pressure (7,500 bars) followed by an isostatic pressure of 4,500 bars and finally heated at 900 °C for 6 h. All the results have been gathered in Fig. 5 which gives the densification rates evolution as a function of grinding times. It shows first an increase and then a saturation of the densification above 240 min which corresponds approximately to a density of 74%. Taking into account these two last results, a preliminary ball-milling followed by a flash heating procedure has been used. The Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 powder was then ground for different times with a rotation speed of 500 rpm and then pelletized (uniaxially pressing of 7,500 bars), isostatically pressed under 4,500 bars, and then fired for 5 min at 1,450 °C. Figure 6 shows SEM micrographs of three flashsintered pellets pre-ground for different times and we observed that the most compacted surface is clearly obtained for 240 min of ball-milling. The corresponding densification (about 85%) is comparable to the A and B SPS values (87% and 85% respectively) obtained at 1,000 °C for nondecomposed samples (Table 2). This procedure, which can be easily carried out without requiring any expensive equipment, has then been applied for all the solid solution members Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 and led to comparable densification whatever the x value (83% to 86%).

Impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed for several samples belonging to the Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid solution between 75 and 525 °C. Whatever the x value, the compounds present the behavior of a solid electrolyte: a typical impedance diagram, plotted in the Nyquist plane, is given in Fig. 7. The line at low frequency is ascribed to the electrode polarization with C≈1–100 μF and confirms the ionic nature of the conductivity. Between 75 and 225 °C, two semicircles can be observed at high frequency, which correspond to two different relaxation processes due to the ionic motion in the grain (C≈10–11 F) and into the grain boundaries (C≈10–10 F). The characteristic resistances of these two contributions were determined with an equivalent electrical circuit as shown in the insert of the Fig. 7, the dipolar part of the sample and the electrode polarization being modellized with a constant phase element. Above 225 °C, the two relaxation processes can not be separately refined and are then modellized with only one resistance. For each sample, the temperature dependence of the bulk and of the total (bulk+grain boundaries) conductivities was plotted in Arrhenius fashion. Figure 8 shows the conductivity of three compounds: Li0.8La0.2/3Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.2), Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.6), and Li0.1La0.3Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.9). Table 3 shows the activation energies deduced from the Arrhenius plot and the ionic conductivities (bulk and total) determined for each sample. This table shows unfortunately no improvement for the ionic conductivity with the composition of Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 phases despite the formation of the vacancies. Indeed, even if a maximum bulk conductivity is obtained for Li0.8La0.2/3Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.2), the values determined for compounds belonging to the composition range 0≤x≤0.7 are very close and the activation energies are comparable to the LiZr2(PO4)3 one [21]. For the phases Li0.1La0.3Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.9) and Li0.2La0.8/3Zr2(PO4)3 (x=0.8), the ionic conductivities become smaller while the associated activation energies are higher. Figure 9 shows the variation of the bulk ionic conductivity, determined at 75 °C as a function of composition parameter x for the Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 phases. Both Table 3 and Fig. 9 show that bulk conductivity and activation energy remain almost constant in the composition range from x=0 to x=0.6 and close to the conductivity and activation energy of the compound before substitution LiZr2(PO4)3. For x>0.6 conductivity decreases drastically (of four orders of magnitude) and activation energy increases to finally reach the values of the totally substituted compound La1/3Zr2(PO4)3. In these compounds, it has been experimentally shown that conductivity is mainly due to lithium ions since no electrode polarization has been observed at room temperature by impedance spectroscopy when lithium electrodes are used. On the other hand, electrode polarization is clearly observed when Pt electrodes are used. Therefore, the substitution of 1 La3+ ion for 3 Li+ ions should lead to a decrease of conductivity, as expected when the number of mobile species decreases. This is not experimentally observed and such behavior can be explained by the number of vacancies available for ionic motion. Indeed, the ionic conductivity depends not only on the number of mobile species but also on the number of vacancies [22]. It has to be remembered that in NASICONtype structure, three types of sites are available for small A cations, named M1, M2, and M3. To take into account the multiplicity of these sites, the general formula of the NASICON-type phases can be written as A(M10→1)A (M20→3) A(M30→1)M2(XO4)3. The number of such sites by unit cell is then 5 (1 for site M1, 3 for site M2, and 1 for site M3). In the compounds under study, this number of available sites is much greater than the number of cations present in the structure (La3+ and Li+). Further La3+ ions partially occupy only M1 site. It is then obvious that many interstitial sites are empty and available for small cations [6, 23–25], such as Li+ ions, to move into the structure. Therefore, it can be postulated that for x<0.6, the decrease of mobile species is not a strong limiting parameter and that this decrease is largely compensated by the number of available vacancies, leading to an almost constant conductivity. However when x increases above 0.6, the number of mobile species becomes too low to insure constant conductivity.

The Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 compounds have been synthesized by a sol-gel method and sintered for ionic conductivity measurements. The low decomposition temperature of the NASICON prevents to heat them at sufficiently high temperature to allow high densification. We have then tried different sintering techniques and have compared them in order to optimize the sintering process without decomposing the phase. This study, performed on one compound (Li0.4La0.2Zr2(PO4)3), has shown that the use of the sintering aids (ZnO, B2O3, T i O2, and LiNO3) as well as the HIP technique did not lead to sufficiently well-densified pellets (<70%). Our best result has been achieved by SPS (density of about 85%) value which can also be obtained by a more simple procedure: a preliminary ball-milling step followed by a flash heating at high temperature (1,450 °C, 5 min). This simple process can be applied for every compound which can not be heated at high temperature. Lastly, the ionic conductivity study performed on all densified Li1−xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 members, revealed that the ionic substitution Li+ → 1/3La3++2/3 □ has unfortunately no influence on the conduction: for most of the samples, the ionic conductivity remains identical to the LiZr2(PO4)3 one and finally decreases when the lanthanum rate is too high. This situation results from a competition of different parameters: decrease of the total ionic mobile species number with x and in addition, substitution of small mobile Li+ ions by large La3+ ions of lower mobility, these two factors being not counterbalanced by the increase of the vacancies number.
