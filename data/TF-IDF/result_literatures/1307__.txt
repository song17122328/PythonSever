Abstract.  Ion conducting Na2NbZnP3O12 glass is investigated for the mechanism of the ion dynamics and non-Debye  relaxation.  The  impedance  spectroscopic data  of  the  sample  is  taken  for  a  frequency  range  of  100Hz  to 1MHz  for  a  temperature range of 393K to 513K. Anomalous relaxation function is used to study the microscopic mechanism of ion  dynamics through the complex relaxation time. The physical picture of the ion dynamics have studied with the trapped  and hopping charge carriers. The many particle displacement function and its scaling are used to understand the length  scale of ion dynamics.   Keywords: electric relaxation; NASICON glass; ac conductivity, non-Debye.

Ion  conducting  materials  have  a  vital  role  in  the  material  research  due  to  its  wide  application.  The  microscopic  ion  dynamics  through  the  disorders  host  lattice  of  solid  materials  are  still  challenging.   Impedance  spectroscopy  (IS)  is  an  experimental  tool  used  worldwide  for  analyzing  the  mechanism  of  ion  dynamics  and  relaxation  phenomena.  In  the  present  paper  a  strange  anomalous  relaxation  process  is  used  for investigating IS data and result are reported.      

Our  IS  data  of  NASICON  (Na+  Super  Ionic  Conductor)  type  Na2NbZnP3O12  glasses  has  been  considered  impedance  measurements were carried out in the frequency range  of 100Hz to 1MHz for temperature range of 393K to  513K. The details of preparation and characterization  were  reported  in  earlier  work  [1].  In  proposed  model  we  have  shown  the  presence  of  fast  hopping  random  and slow hopping nonrandom process. 

The  impedance  data  shows  non-Debye  behavior.  Even though there are several empirical functions and  relaxation  models  available  the  non-Debye  relaxation,  still  there  is  no  completely  satisfying  microscopic  model  for  the  ion  dynamics  through  the  disordered  lattice.  In  this  work  the  ion  dynamics  of  Na2NbZnP3O12 glass is analysed using the anomalous

Anomalous  relaxation  function  incorporates  the  non-Debye  effect  using  the  complex  relaxation  time.  function  I*(t)=exp(-t/W*)  The  complex  relaxation  where  W*=WD/(iWD)(1-g),  i=-1  and  0<gd1.  Compared  to  the  other  empirical  functions  used  for  the  non-Debye  relaxation,  this  model  have  an  advantage  that  it  have  analytical formula in both time and frequency domain.  The  frequency  domain  representation  has  a  simple  form 

where  R  is  the  bulk  resistance,  WD  is  the  fast    relaxation time, WD g is the slow relaxation time and g is  the exponent [2]. The slow relaxation  may occur due  to the structural disorder and the collective motion due  to ion-ion interaction. This collective motion is a nonrandom process and it is attributed trapping of charge  carriers in disordered host lattice and it is accounted in  terms of the exponent g. The disordered materials have  random energy barrier and the conduction may occurs  due to a series of forward-backward jumps of Na+ ion  from site to site. 

The  exponent  g=1  corresponds  to  fast  relaxation  process  and  0<g<1  corresponds  to  the  slow  process  with gncq hopping charge carriers and (1-g)ncq trapped  charge  carriers.  Even  though  the  value  of  g  remains  constant throughout the temperature range, the number  of  hopping  charge  carriers  may  increase  due  to  the

Length Scales of Ion Dynamics 

The  ac  conductivity  of  the  sample  is  frequency  independent  at  the  low  frequency  and  power-law  dependence  with  frequency  at  high  frequency.  The  linear  response  theory  gives  a  direct  connection  between  the  ac  conductivity  and  the  mean  squared  displacement  of  the  ion  in  time  domain.  The  many  particle displacement function <R2(t)> can be obtained  from the real part of the conductivity [3]  t d ')

where  kB  is  Boltzmann  constant,  N  is  the  carrier  density,  q  is  the  charge  of  the  carrier  and  T  is  the  absolute  temperature.  At  longer  time  scales  <R2(t)>  directly  proportional  the  characteristics of the ‘random walk’ motion (diffusion)  which  corresponds  to  the  frequency  independent  dc  conductivity.  At  shorter  time  scales  it  shows  a  subdiffusive nature that is <R2(t)> proportional sub-linear  with time. The average distance that the ions  have to  cover  in  order  to  overcome  the  forces  causing  backward  hopping  and  become  sub-diffusive  to  diffusive  is  called  crossover  length  [The  crossover  length  [increases  with  increase  of  temperature.  The  Summerfield scaling of <R2(t)> shows, the mechanism  of ion dynamics is independent of temperature and the  average distance of ion distribution is 1.8Å. 

Anomalous  relaxation  function  gives  a  better  physical picture for the ion dynamics in terms of fast  and slow relaxation processes. It is evident that during  the  conduction  process  the  ions  have  to  go  through  several reiterated forward backward ion hopping. The  length scales of ion hopping around a few angstroms.
