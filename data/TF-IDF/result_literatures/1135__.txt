Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (x = 0.1–0.4) compounds were synthesized by a sol–gel method and studied by X-ray diffraction, SEM and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The rhombohedral (R3 c) phase prevailed for all studied samples, while for x ≥ 0.3 an orthorhombic Pbca phase appeared. The substitution of Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ led to an increase of the unit cell parameters of the rhombohedral phase. The hyperﬁne 57Fe Mössbauer parameters showed a single signal ascribable to Fe3+ in an anisotropic distribution of charges surrounding the probe atom. The double substitution of Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ in Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 resulted in a net improvement of the ionic conductivity, as compared to pristine LiTi2(PO4)3. Ionic conductivities of 3.3 · 10−4 S cm−1 and 2.4 · 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, and 5.23 · 10−4 S cm−1 and 8.44 · 10−5 S cm−1 at 373 K were observed for Li1.3Ti1.8Fe0.1Ca0.1(PO4)3 and Li1.6Ti1.5Fe0.4Ca0.1(PO4)3, respectively.

Lithium ion conduction has been reported for a variety of crystalline metal oxides and halides with different types of structures [1–3]. Generally, the mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical stabilities of oxides are believed to be superior to those of non-oxide materials [4]. The preparation of inorganic Li-ion conductors with both, high ionic conductivity and high electrochemical stability is not an easy task, but is desirable for practical reasons in different battery applications [1–4].

The materials with a NASICON-type structure are very promising candidates to be used as solid ionic conductors. Lithium titanium phosphate LiTi2(PO4)3 has been extensively studied as Li ion-conductive solid electrolyte since Hagman et al. solved its crystallographic structure [5–7]. In fact, the origin of the conductive behavior of LiTi2(PO4)3 resides in the chemical and structural characteristics responsible for fast ion transport [8]. The framework is based in the “lantern” repeating unit consisting of three PO4 tetrahedra sharing corner with two MO6 octahedra. Each lantern is surrounded by six other lanterns generating a large interstitial space and providing an exceptional structural adaptability [9,10]. Neutron diffraction studies demonstrated that lithium ions are located in the octahedrally-coordinated M1 site of LiTi2(PO4)3 [11].

Nevertheless, the ionic conductivity of polycrystalline pure LiTi2(PO4)3 has been regarded to be too low for practical applications. The ionic conductivity could be noticeably increased when Ti4+ was substituted by other cations such as Sc3+, Ga3+, Fe3+, Cr3+, In3+ or Al3+ [6,7,12–16]. Further discussion on how different conductive properties can be achieved in NASICON-type, LiSICON or ThioLiSICON-type Li ion conductors can be found in an excellent review reported by P. Knauth [17].

The 3D framework of interconnected conduction pathways offers a degree of elasticity for accommodating compositional changes. Having in mind the exceptional adaptability to numerous chemical substitutions, this work deals with the use of Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) compounds as solid electrolyte. We were motivated to add Ca along with iron to LiTi2(PO4)3 because a recent report by Goodenough et al. showed the beneﬁcial effects on ionic conductivity of Ca in LiZr2(PO4)3 NASICON-type structure [18]. The effects on the ionic conductivity of the simultaneous presence of Fe3+ and Ca2+ ions in rhombohedral-LiTi2(PO4)3 are studied in this work for the ﬁrst time by impedance spectroscopy. Phase composition, morphology and local environment of iron atoms are studied by X-Ray diffraction, electron microscopy and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy.

Samples with nominal stoichiometry Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (with 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) were prepared by a sol–gel method. For this purpose, stoichiometric amounts of LiH2PO4, NH4H2PO4, Fe(NO3)3 and CaHPO4 were dissolved in deionized water. A second solution was prepared by dissolving the stoichiometric proportion of titanium isopropoxide (Merck, 99%) in 50 mL of ethanol. Then, the aqueous solution was added drop-wise onto the titanium solution. The resulting slurry was homogenized by vigorous stirring at room temperature, and the solvent was evaporated by gentle warming in a hot plate. The solid precursor was kept at 100 °C overnight to ensure the complete evaporation of the solvents. Then, the obtained precursors were annealed at 750 °C for 10 h in air atmosphere, by applying a heat ramp of 3 °C/min.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with CuKα radiation operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The samples were scanned between 10 and 110° (2θ degrees) by a step scan mode setting a 0.02°steps/10 s rate. Unit cell parameters were calculated using Fullprof software. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded in a JEOL-SM6300 microscope.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (EIS) were performed with an AUTOLAB PGSTAT12 equipment by applying an AC signal with 5 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz. The pellets were prepared by pressing the material into 10 mm diameter discs at 5 t. The pellets were sintered at 750 °C in air atmosphere for 30 h, and slowly cooled down to room temperature. The annealed electrodes were assembled in Swagelok™-type two electrode cells. A silver conducting paste (Cat. #12640, Colloidal silver paste, Lot 110308, Electron Microscopy Sciences P.O. Box 550, 1560 Industry Road, Hatﬁel, PA, 19440) was used to ensure the electrical connectivity to both stainless steel current collectors. The time of curing was 15–20 min before assembling the cell. The impedance spectra were transformed into Nyquist plots. Resistance values were calculated by ﬁtting these plots to an equivalent circuit described elsewhere [19]. The ionic conductivity was calculated using σ = L/R2A, where L is the thickness and A is the area of the pellet, respectively. The optimum thickness for our experimental set-up was of about 0.8 mm.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 samples. The analysis of XRD proﬁles showed that a rhombohedral R 3 c phase was predominant. For x values between 0.1 and 0.4, additional reﬂections indexed to an orthorhombic Pnma phase were detected, and attributed to the presence of minor impurities of LiTiPO5. It is worth noting that other authors have also reported the presence of minor traces of LiTiPO5 on substituted titanium phosphates. For instance, Orliukas et al. detected LiTiPO5 and YPO4 as impurities on substituting Ti4+ by Y3+ and Al3+ when studying rhombohedral Li1.3AlyYx−yTi1.7(PO4)3 [20]. Initially, the partial substitution of titanium by iron is expected to cause an increase in the rhombohedral lattice parameters (Fig. 2), due to the larger ionic radii of Fe3+ (0.785 Å) as compared to Ti4+ (0.745 Å) [21]. The results presented in Fig. 2 conﬁrm this assumption for LiTi2 − xFex(PO4)3 series. For 0.1 Ca per formula, the increase in lattice parameters is even higher. This may suggest that there is an effect of calcium on lattice parameters too, i.e. that Ca2+ ions are incorporated in the structure. However, the high ionic radius of Ca2+ (1.14 Å) and the absence of structural data for the doped solid make difﬁcult to conclude that calcium replaces Ti4+ sites. The lattice parameters of Pnma-LiTiPO5 phase remained unchanged in all samples in which it was detected (Fig. 2B). A detailed view of the ﬁtting of the XRD pattern of Li1.3Ti1.8Fe0.1Ca0.1(PO4)3 and Li1.4Ti1.7Fe0.2Ca0.1(PO4)3 is shown Fig. 1B,C. For x ≥ 0.3 additional weak peaks at 15.1º, 23.6º, 25.7º, 30º, and 31.7º (2θ) were indexed to the orthorhombic Pbca phase, which increased the complexity of the data calculation (Fig. 1A). However, a net increase of the cell volume of the rhombohedral phase could be detected [22]. In this regard, a previous work from Catti et al. report the subsequent appearance of Pbca and Pbna orthorhombic phases when Ti4+ was substituted by Fe3+ [9].

The surface microstructure of the different samples is shown in Fig. 3. For the samples containing calcium, regularly-crystallized, micrometric particles are observed. The grains are strongly coalesced and the presence of defects or intraparticle pores is not evident. For instance, Li1.3Ti1.8Fe0.1Ca0.1(PO4)3 showed grains closely in contact with others forming uniform particles of ≈4 μm in size. The present morphology resemble to that of LiTi2(PO4)3 mixed with Li3PO4 reported by Aono et al. [23]. The substitution of Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ ions must be counterbalanced by additional Li+ ions in the M2 vacant sites, along with a greater densiﬁcation of the phosphate pellets. A plausible explanation is that lithium vacancies favor lattice diffusion from/to grain boundaries as well as diffusion along grain boundaries themselves, which are common sintering mechanisms. It is evidenced that not only the structural but also the electrical properties of NASICON-type compounds vary with the composition of the framework. This particular substitution acts primarily on the grain boundaries in such way that reduces the blocking effects as will be shown next. Chen et al. studied by ﬁrst-principles calculations how the oxygen vacancy formation in mixed system LiTiPO5/LiTi2(PO4)3 is expected to improve signiﬁcantly the conductivity [24].

In order to accurately determine the oxidation state and iron atoms, 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of local environment of Li1 +x + 2yTi2xyFexCay(PO4)3 samples were recorded (Fig. 4). Before explaining hyperﬁne details of such sample is important to explain that the Ca-free compound (Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3) reported by VidalAbarca et al. [22] is characterized by a doublet signal at an isomer shift of 0.353 mm s−1 and a quadrupole splitting value of 0.961 mm s−1. This isomer shift value conﬁrmed the presence of Fe3+. However, the quadrupole splitting value is higher than that of related compounds [25,26]. This fact would be indicative of a signiﬁcant anisotropy in the local environment of the probe atom arising from the presence of Ti and Fe in close vicinity besides the excess of 0.2 Li+ ions occupying M2 sites. The spectra of Li1.2 + xyTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 samples are characterized by one low split signal with an isomer shift value ascribable to Fe3+ ions, suggesting a unique site for iron atoms in the structure. The low quadrupole splitting of this signal evidences an almost isotropic distribution of charges surrounding the probe atom. On increasing the iron content, it is observed that the isomer shift values remain basically unmodiﬁed giving values of about 0.43(2) mm s−1 for x = 0.1 or 0.424(4) mm s−1 for x = 0.4. Although the electronegativity of iron is higher as compared to titanium no drastic changes in isomer shift values are observed. An augmented population of surrounding iron atoms when x is increased leads to a decrease of electrons available for the neighbor Fe\O bonds, and hence an increase of the isomer shift values is expected, which is not observed. On the other hand, the quadrupole splitting value slightly varied around 0.34 mm s−1. This is half of the value obtained for the calcium-free sample mentioned above entailing the presence of an almost isotropic environment. Although the relationship with calcium content is difﬁcult to be unfolded, this result clearly shows the effect of calcium on the local environment of iron in the NASICON structure. This is also in agreement with the above discussion on unit cell parameters (Table 1).

In order to evaluate the effects of metal substitution on the ionic conductive properties of the studied series, electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded and compared to LiTi2(PO4)3, (Fig. 5). The Nyquist plots show a depressed semicircle instead of the two semicircles usually associated to the conductivity of polycrystalline electrolytes, representing the bulk (at high frequencies) and grain boundaries (at low frequencies) to the total impedance. Hence, the total conductivity (σtotal) calculated in this work includes bulk (σb) and grain boundary (σgb) conductivities: 1/σtotal = 1/σb + 1/σgb [27]. The ionic conductivity can be calculated by using the following equation, where L and A are respectively the thickness and area of the pelletized electrode. The intersection at the high-frequency side on the Z' axis is commonly attributed to the overall electronic resistance of the measurement system (denoted as R1). Then, a stretched semicircle is observed, which size is attributed to the resistance of the studied material (R2). A straight line at low frequencies represents the blocking electrode which corresponds to the long tail at the low frequency end of the plot. This long tail suggests that the material is an ionic conductor [4]. This method has been widely used in the literature to measure the total ionic conductivity and Arrhenius plots when electronic conductivity is also present and grain-boundary resistance cannot be separated from that of the bulk [18,28]. The reproducibility of the results in the manuscript was tested by additional experiments performed using similar conditions that gave comparable results. Also, a comparison with previous reports in the literature shows an acceptable agreement [29]. Undoubtedly, the total electrical conductivity of a solid is the sum of the partial conductivities of the ionic and electronic charge carriers. We also agree that the electronic conductivity is not particularly low in these materials. However, the values of R1 and R2 are comparable and can be determined simultaneously by EIS as is shown next.

The room temperature (RT) resistance values – R1 and R2 – shown in Table 2 were obtained by the ﬁtting of the Nyquist plot to the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5A [19]. The RT and 373 K total conductivities for the Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) series are also shown in Table 2. The un-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 exhibited 1.6 · 10−7 S cm−1. On decreasing Fe3+ content, the overall resistance (R) decreases (Fig. 5B). Thus, the enhancement in net ionic conductivity is related to the predominancy of the rhombohedral (R3 c) phases. As compared with LiTi2(PO4)3, the effect of simultaneous calcium and iron substitution leads to a net increase of the total conductivities, reaching RT values from 2.4 · 10−5 to 3.3 · 10−4 S cm−1 for Li1.6Ti1.5Fe0.4Ca0.1(PO4)3 respectively (Table 2). From the SEM data in Fig. 3, these results can be interpreted as a result of the development of a good contact between grains during the densiﬁcation of the doped pellets [30]. In addition, the partial substitution of Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ in Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 created ‘x + 0.2’ mobile Li+-ions per formula unit in the framework. Similar results have been recently observed when using B2O3 in LiTi2(PO4)3 (e.g. σLi–1.2 10−4 S cm−1) and Li1.2Zr1.9Ca0.1(PO4)3 [18,28]. The effect of doping is a two orders of magnitude decrease in electronic resistance (R1) but more than three orders of magnitude for the total ionic resistance (R2), particularly for x = 0.1, in which R2 is lower than R1.

The temperature dependence of conductivity for Li1.2 + xTi2 − x FexCa0.1(PO4)3 samples is presented in Fig. 6. A substantial increase of conductivity with temperature is observed for all substituted samples. As expected, these values obey Arrhenius-type temperature dependence. Particularly, an outstanding improvement is observed for x = 0.1, which reached about 5.23 · 10−4 S cm−1 at 373 K (Table 2). We examined that the activation energies range from 0.18 to 0.07 eV from x = 0.4 to 0.1 (see Table 2). Values below 0.1 eV are low as compared with literature. However, to the best of our knowledge no report has been published on these Ca-doped materials. These results emphasize the particular outstanding behavior of the samples with low x.

The introduction of Fe3+ and Ca2+ into LiTi2(PO4)3 increased the Li-ion concentration to give important increase in the total Li-ion

conductivity at 373 K from 1.25 · 10−6 S cm−1 observed in LiTi2(PO4)3 to 5.2 · 10−4 S cm−1 in Li1.3Ti1.8Fe0.1Ca0.1(PO4)3. The grain boundary contribution is minimized for those samples with the lowest amount of doping as determined by SEM. Moreover, the synergic effect of substituting Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ in Li1.2 + xTi1.9 − xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 created ‘0.2 + x’ mobile Li+-ions per formula unit in the interstitial space of the NASICON framework. The obtained conductivities compare very favorably with the best literature data for solid state Li batteries making them appealing candidates for use as solid electrolytes.
