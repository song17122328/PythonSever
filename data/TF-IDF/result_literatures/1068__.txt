NASICON-type structure lithium ion conductors have been considered as promising solid electrolytes due to its very high Li+-ion conductivity and chemical stability. In this paper, NASICON-type structured Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) glass–ceramics are prepared from crystallization of glass powders, which are obtained by a simple melt-quench method. NH4H2PO4, H3PO4, P2O5 and H3PO4&Al(PO3)3 are used as phosphorus sources, respectively. The obtained LAGP glass–ceramics are systematically characterized with X-ray diffraction, ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and AC impedance spectroscopy. The different impurities are formed depending on the phosphorus sources, which further inﬂuence the microstructure. As a result, the lithium ion conductivity is signiﬁcantly affected by the phosphorus sources. The highest conductivity of 5.21 × 10−4 S·cm−1 is obtained when H3PO4 is used as the phosphorus source under optimum conditions.

Lithium ion batteries have been widely used as the power source for mobile electronic devices due to their high energy density [1], and they could also be applied as power cells in electrical vehicles (EV) and energy storage devices for the smart grid in the near future. However, these batteries must meet extremely strict safety requirements for practical applications [2]. The replacement of ﬂammable liquid organic electrolyte with inorganic solid electrolyte is an effective way to ensure battery's safety [3,4], and the inorganic solid electrolyte is also considered as a promising electrolyte in future lithium–air and lithium–sulfur batteries [5].

Generally, solid electrolyte could be classiﬁed into ceramic electrolyte, glass electrolyte and glass–ceramic electrolyte. The glass phase normally exhibits higher ion conductivity compared to its ceramic phase [6]. Surprisingly, NASICON-type structure ceramic with ion migration paths exhibits very high bulk conductivity [7], nevertheless the conductivity of polycrystalline ceramics could be limited by the grain boundaries [7]. Compared with conventional ceramics, glass–ceramics have denser structure and less grain boundary effect, which possess the advantages of both ceramics and glasses [8,9]. Thus, glass-ceramics have been considered as perfect candidates as solid electrolytes in lithium-based cells.

Extensive researches have been carried out on different kinds of fast lithium ion conductors [10–14]. Among all these glass–ceramic materials, Li1+ xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 (LAGP) with NASICON-type structure is of signiﬁcantly importance due to its relatively high lithium ion conductivity, wide electrochemical window, good chemical stability and dense structure [8,15–18]. Therefore, it has great potential in high voltage solid state lithium ion battery, lithium–sulfur battery and lithium–air battery.

LAGP materials have been studied for many years [9,19–22], and NH4H2PO4 is a commonly used phosphorus source for synthesizing LAGP glass–ceramic materials [9,15,20]. J. Fu et al. have synthesized samples with NASICON structure phase, and the conductivity at room temperature (RT) reached 4 × 10−4 S·cm−1 [15]. Only a few attempts on different phosphorus source have been made [23,24]. T. Katoh et al. applied phosphoric acid and aluminum metaphosphate as phosphorus source to prepare LAGP glass–ceramics, and AlPO4 was detected as impurity phase in the sample, and the RT conductivity was 1.9 × 10−4 S·cm−1 [23]. C. R. Mariappan et al. used di-ethylphosphonoacetic acid as phosphorus source to prepare LAGP ceramics with ﬁne grains, and the RT conductivity was 2 × 10−4 S·cm−1[24]. Therefore, the phosphorus sources could be a key factor to determine the electrical properties of the samples. However, a systematic research on different phosphorus sources has not yet been reported. The effect of phosphorus sources on lithium ion conducting performance of LAGP glass–ceramics is also not understood well. In this paper, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass–ceramics were prepared with different phosphorus sources. The as-prepared samples were systematically characterized with X-ray diffraction, ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and AC impedance spectroscopy. The electrical performances were close correlated with the change of phosphorus sources.

The Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass was prepared by melt-quench method. Four kinds of precursor powders were produced. The ﬁrst three batches were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of lithium carbonate Li2CO3 (99.99%, Aladdin), aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3 (99.6%, Aladdin), germanium oxide GeO2 (99.999%, Xinyuan) and different phosphorus sources, which are ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH4H2PO4 (99%, SCRC), phosphoric acid H3PO4 (99%, Aladdin) and phosphorus pentoxide P2O5 (99%, Aladdin). The last batch was obtained by mixing stoichiometric amounts of lithium carbonate Li2CO3 (99.99%, Aladdin), germanium oxide GeO2 (99.999%, Xinyuan), phosphoric acid H3PO4 (99%, Aladdin) and aluminum metaphosphate Al(PO3)3 (98.7%, Alfa). Precursor powders were thoroughly mixed by planetary ball milling at 400 rpm, and then heated in an alumina crucible at 700 °C for 2 h to release volatile products coming from starting materials like carbon dioxide, ammonia and vapor. After cooling, the reaction products were reground and then heated up in a platinum crucible at 1400 °C for 2 h. The melts were quenched immediately after being removed from the furnace chamber to form LAGP glass. Fine glass powders were prepared through planetary ball milling for 4 h and drying. Then, the powders were pressed into 13 mm pellets with a mold. The pellets were pressed by cold isostatic pressing of 200 MPa for several minutes and sintered on a platinum plate under air at different temperatures for certain time to obtain glass–ceramics.

Thermal analysis was carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Netzsch DSC 404C, Germany) for the ﬁne LAGP glass powder in the temperature range between 30 °C and 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 K/min. The analysis was performed in air. The crystal structure were identiﬁed by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD, Bruker, D8 Advance, Germany) at RT using Cu Kα radiation at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The XRD patterns were recorded in a 2θ range of 10 –80°. The relative density was derived from experimental density and theoretical density. Experimental density was calculated from the weight and the volume of polished LAGP pellets, while theoretical density was obtained from LAGP cell parameters and molecular weight. For AC impedance measurements, gold blocking electrodes were sputtered on both sides of polished samples. AC impedance measurements were carried out using impedance analyzer (Solartron 1470E) with the frequency range of 10−1–106 Hz, and the whole process was conducted in air. The data was analyzed by using Z-View impedance software. Ionic conductivity values were obtained from, where d is the sample thickness, A is the area of the electrodes and R is the sample resistance. Conductivities at different temperatures were measured in a temperature chamber (ESPEC Corp. SU-641) at temperatures between −20 °C and 150 °C. Activation energy was calculated from the temperature dependence of conductivity. The microstructures of the glass–ceramics were characterized by the ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S4800, Hitachi, Japan) on the fracture surfaces.

LAGP glass–ceramics using NH4H2PO4, H3PO4, P2O5, Al(PO3) 3&H3PO4 as phosphorus source are denoted as NP, HP, P2O5 and AP&HP, respectively. All of the samples are sintered under four different temperatures (800 °C, 850 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C). The sample with the highest Li-ion conductivity is selected as representative sample for each kind of source materials, and Fig. 1 shows their XRD patterns. Precisely, XRD patterns of NP, P2O5, AP&HP samples sintered at 900 °C and HP sample sintered at 850 °C were presented in Fig. 1, and correspondingly these samples are labeled as NP900, P2O5900, AP&HP900 and HP850, respectively. The diffraction peaks are similar for all samples, and could be indexed as NASICON-type structure. However, small diffraction peaks arising from impurity phases were also observed in most samples. In the P2O5900 sample, diffraction peaks of GeO2 and AlPO4 impure phases were detected. AlPO4 and GeO2 were identiﬁed in the AP&HP900 and NP900 samples, respectively. In contrast, no impurity phase was found in the HP850 sample.

Microstructures of LAGP glass–ceramics were presented in Fig. 2. It can be seen from Fig. 2(a) and (b) that AP&HP900 and P2O5900 samples have large grains with average particle size over 1 μm. Grains in AP&HP900 and P2O5900 samples are irregular and exhibits wide distribution in size. HP850 and NP900 samples have similar grains, as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The average grain size of HP850 and NP900 samples is about 0.5 μm. Compared with AP&HP900 and P2O5900 samples, grains are more regular and uniform in HP850 and NP900 samples. Pores were observed between grains in AP&HP900 and P2O5900 glass–ceramics, while grains are in good contact in HP850 and NP900 glass–ceramics.

Fig. 3 demonstrates the complex impedance plots of NP900, HP850, P2O5900 and AP&HP900 glass–ceramics at RT, respectively. All samples show a single depressed semicircle at high frequencies and a tail in the low frequencies. The semicircle is related to the impedance of grain boundaries while the inclined tail is related to Warburg-type impedance [15,24]. The tail reﬂects the ionic nature of NASICON-type materials [25]. The total resistance (Rt) of sample is obtained from the right intercept of the semicircle and real axis in low frequency region, and the bulk resistance (Rb) is calculated from the left intercept of the semicircle and real axis in high frequency region. The value of grainboundary resistance (Rgb) is the difference between the total resistance and bulk resistance. Ionic conductivity values were obtained from these resistance data using Eq. (1). HP850 sample has the smallest Rb and Rgb value. AP&HP900 and NP900 samples have similar Rb values while their Rgb values are signiﬁcantly different. Among all samples, P2O5900 sample possesses the highest Rb value, and its Rgb value is comparable to AP&HP900 sample. The calculated bulk conductivities, grain-boundary conductivities, total conductivities and relative densities are demonstrated in Table 1. High relative densities are obtained for all four samples, which may have positive effect on grain-boundary conductivity.

Among all four samples, HP850 specimen possesses the highest total ion conductivity, reaching 5.21 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at RT. Its bulk conductivity reaches 6.96 × 10−4 S·cm−1, which is the highest bulk conductivity among all samples. This result is consistent with its phase composition, since no impurity phase was detected in XRD analysis. High grainboundary conductivity of 2.08 × 10−3 S·cm−1 is also obtained, which is in good agreement with the dense structure. Although NP900 specimen has a very similar density with that of HP850 specimen, the bulk and grain boundary conductivities are lower, which could be due to the presence of impurities. Depending on the phosphorus sources, different impurities could be present in the materials, which resulted in different morphology. Therefore, the density and the conductivity of grain boundaries were signiﬁcantly affected by the phosphorus sources.

In order to investigate the effect of phosphorus sources on sintering temperature, HP and NP were chosen as representative samples as they have relatively high total conductivity. HP and NP samples were sintered under four different temperatures (800 °C, 850 °C, 900 °C and 950 °C). However, both HP and NP samples sintered at 800 °C exhibited a low density between 80% and 90%, leading to signiﬁcantly low ion conductivity. After sintering at 950 °C, small cracks or even more serious defects were observed on both kinds of samples. Therefore, only specimens sintered at 850 °C and 900 °C were thoroughly characterized and analyzed. The AC impedance plots of HP850, HP900, NP850 and NP900 samples at RT are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 demonstrates the temperature dependence of conductivities of HP850, HP900, NP850 and NP900 samples. In Fig. 4, HP850 sample has lower Rb and Rgb values than HP900 sample. On the contrary, despite similar Rgb values, Rb value of NP900 sample is much lower than that of NP850. In Fig. 5, the conductivities of all samples show good linear ﬁtting results according to Arrhenius equation, where A is the pre-exponential factor, E is the activation energy and k is the Boltzmann constant. The calculated bulk conductivities, grainboundary conductivities, total conductivities, activation energies and relative densities are demonstrated in Table 2. HP850 sample possesses higher bulk conductivity and grain-boundary conductivity than HP900 sample. However, NP900 sample has superior total conductivity than NP850 sample because of its higher bulk conductivity. The conductivity results are consistent with the activation energy data and relative densities. A lower E value of 0.34 eV was obtained from HP850 sample compared with HP900 sample, but NP900 sample's activation energy is lower than NP850 sample. The density exhibits the same tendency. HP850 sample has higher relative density than HP900 sample, while NP900 sample possesses notably higher density than NP850 sample.

NH4H2PO4, H3PO4, P2O5 and H3PO4&Al(PO3)3 are used as phosphorus sources, respectively. The proper sintering temperature was found in the range of 850 °C–900 °C. Impurity phases were observed in NP900, P2O5900 and AP&HP900 samples, while highly pure NASICON phase was obtained in HP850 sample. The microstructure and density were affected by the impurities. HP850 sample exhibited the highest conductivity of 5.21 × 10−4 S·cm−1 due to the pure phase and dense structure. The exothermic peak temperatures of HP sample is 614.9 °C, which is lower than 632.6 °C for NP sample. The conductivity is consistent very well with the results of phase composition and density.

FESEM analysis on NP and HP samples was performed. Fracture surface morphology of HP850, HP900, NP850 and NP900 samples are presented in Fig. 6. Increasing sintering temperature from 850 °C to 900 °C results in notably increase in grain size. In NP850 sample, amorphous phase still remains in the structure. Compared with NP850 sample, grains of NP900 sample are well crystallized, which may lead to increase in bulk conductivity and density. The crystallinity is further proved by XRD diffractions because the XRD of NP900 sample has a high diffraction intensity compared with NP850 sample as shown in Fig. 7. By contrast, the XRD patterns of HP850 and HP900 exhibit the similar diffraction intensity. However, when temperature rises from 850 °C to 900 °C, the average grain size in HP glass–ceramics shows signiﬁcant increase, along with the presence of small cracks in grain boundary region, resulting in decreased grain-boundary conductivity and density. These observations are well consistent with conductivity and density results listed in Table 2.

Besides, DSC analysis was also used to understand the different optimum sintering temperature for NP and HP samples. Fig. 8 showed the DSC results of NP and HP glass powders. The exothermic peaks on the proﬁles resulted from the crystallization of the glass samples. The crystallization temperatures were estimated from the plots. HP glass sample has signiﬁcantly lower crystallization temperature than NP glass sample, indicating that different phosphorus source could effectively inﬂuence the crystallization temperature. In this case, using H3PO4 as phosphorus source has positive effect on reducing sintering temperature. Thus, HP sample possesses lower optimum sinter temperature than NP sample, which explained the AC impedance and FESEM results mentioned above.
