In this communication, a new trivalent Al3+ ion conductor of (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 with the NASICON-type structure was successfully realized by applying pentavalent Nb5+ ion in addition to tetravalent Zr4+ and pentavalent P5+ ions as the constituent cations whose ion valencies are higher than trivalent state and tightly bond to counteranions of oxide anions, and an extraordinary high trivalent Al3+ ion conductivity which lies in the practical application region was intentionally achieved in solids.
The starting materials of Al(OH)3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and (NH4)2HPO4 were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and then mixed in an agate mortar. The pulverized powder was pelletized and heated at 1000 °C for 12 h, 1200 °C for 12 h, and then 1300 °C for 12 h in air. The obtained (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 powder was made into pellets and sintered at 1300 °C for 12 h in air.
Platinum was sputtered on both center surfaces of the pellet as the electrode. The ac conductivity ( 243)ac) was measured by a complex impedance method with the Precision LCR meter (Hewlett-Packard) in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz at the temperature region from 300 to 600 °C in air. The dc conductivity ( 243)dc) was obtained from the voltage generated by passing the dc current of 1  237)A between the two platinum electrodes sandwiching the pellet. The polarization behavior was measured by investigating the time dependence of the  243)dc/ 243)ac ratio in air. The electrolysis was carried out by applying a dc voltage of 3 V at 800 °C for 240 h for the purpose of determining the conducting species, and the investigation of the cathodic surface of the pellet after the electrolysis was performed by SEM (SEM, S-800, Hitachi) and EPMA (EPMA-1500, Shimadzu). The experiment details were described in our previous papers.6-8
The relationship between the electrical conductivity and the Al content in (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 is presented in Figure 2. The highest Al3+ ion conductivity was obtained for (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 among the (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 series with the NASICON-type structure (The demonstration of the Al3+ ion conduction in (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 is described below). From the X-ray powder diffraction measurements, the NASICON type (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 single phase was obtained only for the (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 series of x ) 0.1 and 0.2, and the (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 series with x higher than 0.3 is in a two-phase mixture of the NASICON phase and NbPO5. This NbPO5 formation as the secondary phase appreciably decreases the conductivity.
The temperature dependence of the trivalent ion conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 is depicted in Figure 3 with the data of the Al3+ ion conducting Al2(WO4)3 with the Sc2(WO4)3 type structure reported before by us.4 The conductivity data for Sc2(WO4)3 and Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which show the optimum ion conductivity among the series introduced in Figure 1, are also plotted. The Al3+ ion conductivity considerably enhances more than 2 orders of magnitude compared with those of the Al3+ ion conducting Al2(WO4)3 solid electrolyte. The Al3+ ion conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 exceeds more than 1 order of magnitude in comparison to the similar phosphate-based Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 electrolyte which possess the optimum trivalent ion conductivity among the NASICON-type M1/3Zr2(PO4)3 series, and the Al3+ ion conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 reaches the region of the typical oxide anion conductor series of YSZ11 and CSZ.11
In summary, an extraordinary high Al3+ ion conducting solid electrolyte was realized by successfully stabilizing the NASICON-type structure which has a suitable three-dimensional Al3+ ion pass way by applying not only Zr4+ and P5+, but also Nb5+, as another lattice constituent element. The Al3+ ion conductivity enhances more than 2 orders of magnitude in comparison with the Al3+ ion conducting Al2(WO4)3 solid electrolyte reported so far. Because the Al3+ ion conductivity of the present solid electrolyte reaches the ion conductivity region of the well-known and commercially available oxide anion conducting solids, practical applications of the present Al3+ ion conducting (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x)Nb(PO4)3 solid for functional materials such as chemical sensors, rechargeable batteries, etc., are greatly expected.
