A series of NASICON type compounds A1 xZr2 xNbx(PO4)3 (A=H, Li; x=0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2) have been studied by 1H, 7Li, 31P NMR and impedance spectroscopy. Niobium substitution leads to cation mobility enhancement and favors the triclinic–rhombohedral phase transition. The phase transition and a local lithium motion are highly increased by vacancy formation, while cation conductivity is increased by interstitials formation in LiZr2(PO4)3 structure.
Lithium compounds with NASICON-type structure are their high ionic being extensively studied because of conductivity and chemical stability [1–3]. The most important system of this family is LiZr2(PO4)3, which is known to exhibit a complex polymorphism [1]. The hightemperature phase obtained above 1470 K has the NASICON structure and exhibits a structural phase transition about 310 K. This triclinic–rhombohedral phase transition leads to high conducting properties [1]. The conductivity may be increased by partial replacement of MIV ions by MIII in AM2(PO4)3 with AI interstitial formation to balance the negatively charged framework [4–7]. Partial substitution of MIV ions for MV also results in conductivity enhancement. Much less is known about proton mobility in proton containing NASICON phases [3,8].
The present paper reports solid state NMR and impethe cation mobility in A1-xZr2-xNbx(PO4)3 (A=Li+, H+) systems.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded with the use of Stoe diffractometer with Cu-Ka radiation. Thermal analysis was performed on a TGD-700 (ULVAC SINCU-RIKO) apparatus at a heating rate of 108/min. The impedance analyzer IPU-62 with a frequency range of 10 Hz–2 MHz was used for conductivity measurements. Impedance data were collected on rectangular (557 mm) pressed pellets (pressure 2d 108 Pa) with silver electrodes. The samples were studied from 298 to 720 K at approximately 15 K intervals. 7Li, 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained on an MSL-300 Bruker spectrometer at 116.6, 121.5 and 130 MHz. Samples were spun at 3–7 kHz at a magic angle, and spectra were taken after p/2 pulse irradiation (3–4 As). Chemical shifts are given relative to 0.1 M aqueous LiCl, 85% aqueous H3PO4 and TMS.
The exchange between different types of protons proceeds rather slow at room temperature. Therefore, 1H MAS NMR spectra are formed by three components with chemical shifts 0.7, 5.7 and 11.2 ppm corresponding to three different protons (Table 2). Two last components can be assigned to protons of PO4H-groups and H3O+ ions. The first one, most probably, corresponds to water molecules sorbed on the particle surface.
The substitution of Zr4+ for Nb5+in LiZr2(PO4)3 and ion conductivity this substitution leads to ion replacement [9], it is less effective for conducting properties enhancement.
A strong increase in correlation frequency (mc) with x growth in Li1-xZr2-xNbx(PO4)3 has been found (Fig. 2). Plots log(mc) vs. 1/T are straight lines (Fig. 2b,c), with slope corresponding to the activation energy 11F1 kJ/mol for x=0.02–0.1. At the same time, similar dependence for LiZr2(PO4)3 can be described by two straight lines (Fig. 2a). Ea=11F2 kJ/mol for the higher temperature range (TN333K), and EVa=65F10 kJ/mol for the lower temperature range (Tb333K). Transition temperature and the activation energy of lithium ion mobility in a low-temperature triclinic phase are in a good agreement with the data [1].
7Li MAS NMR spectra showed only one line, with chemical shift almost linearly depending on lithium content (Table 1). The asymmetry parameter (g) decreases from 0.16 to 0.02 in the 290–320 K temperature range. g is equal to 0 for rhombohedral phase. (Table 1).
The Arrhenius conductivity plot for LiZr2(PO4)3 can be described by a straight line with the activation energy 51F2 kJ/mol (Fig. 3a). At lower temperatures (Tb450 K), the doping LiZr2(PO4)3 by niobium leads to the sharp increase in conductivity (Fig. 3b,c). At lower temperatures, the conductivity depends only on the migration of extrinsic (associated with dopant) vacancies. The activation energyfor conductivity of Li0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 is equal to 15F2kJ/mol and changes slightly for the other compounds. It is determined by the activation energy for migration of cation vacancies (Em). With increasing temperature, a changeover from extrinsic to intrinsic behaviour occurs when the thermally generated defect concentration exceeds the dopant controlled extrinsic vacancy concentration. So the activation energy for the overall conductivity in this intrinsic region can be given by
