The urgency of high performance solid electrolytes has aroused considerable focus  on NASICON ceramics. Optimization of processing routes to dense, defect free materials has yet  to receive sufficient attention to date. Although traditional solid state reaction methods followed  by repetitive ball milling and sintering up to 10 h above 1200°C are common place, the resulting  average particle sizes (APSs) are usually too large to produce dense, robust structures because of  excessive  grain  growth.  In  this  study,  nanopowders  (NPs)  are  produced  that  offer  a  superior  opportunity to make dense, high phase purity sintered bodies. Here we report on the effect of  sintering  conditions  on  the  microstructures  and  phase  of  Ce4+-substituted  NASICON  samples,  Na3CexZr2−xSi2PO12  (x=0,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3).  NPs  permit  processing  fine-grained  solid-state  electrolytes with 98% relative density at 1100°C/5 h. In addition, Rietveld refinement was applied  to evaluate 3-D Na-ion diffusion channels among different NASICON samples. Also, it is found  that adding 5 at% Ce4+ does not change the phase structure but dramatically enlarges the Na+  diffusion  “bottleneck”  from  5.4  to  5.6  Å2.  This  may  be  one  reason  these  samples  to  exhibit  conductivities of 2.4×10−2 S cm−1 at 140°C.



Na-ion batteries (NIBs) were considered a preferred choice to replace LIBs in a lower cost  while  also  operating  under  essentially  the  same  fundamental  electrochemical  principles9-11.  However,  just  like  LIBs,  the  same  flammability  of  liquid  electrolytes  has  prompted  efforts  to  develop all-solid-state batteries (ASBs) with high performance.12-14 Current commercial sodium  β-alumina batteries rely primarily on β/β′′ alumina that offer high ion conductivities, 10-2 S cm-1,  but limited at temperatures ≥ 300°C.


β/β′′alumina exhibits low activation energies because the O2charge density was polarized by  adjacent  aluminum  atoms.  Furthermore  and  unfortunately,  β/β′′alumina  has  a  two-dimensional  layered structure such that Na+ can only diffuse along via this 2-D conductive pathway.15,16 In  addition, β/β′′ alumina is moisture sensitive, which affects processing and storage considerations.


Possible  alternatives  explored  to  considerable  extent  are  the  NASICON  family  of  solid  electrolytes  that  offer  with  a  3-D  diffusion  framework,  potentially  exhibiting  higher  ionic  conductivities. The general crystal structure that best describes NASICON materials has lattice  parameters of a, 15.586Å; b, 9.029Å; c, 9.205Å and β, 123.7°, with a monoclinic space group  C2/c.18,19 Three interstitial sites, Na1, Na2 and Na3 permit Na+ diffusion via hopping from Na1 to  neighboring Na2 or Na3 sites.20 is Cerium isobutyrate Ce[O2CCH(CH3)2]4 was prepared by 1 2 3 mixing cerium carbonate with excess isobutyric acid as described above. 


Na3CexZr2-xSi2PO12 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) NPs were synthesized using LF-FSP methods described  in details elsewhere.12,26-29 As prepared NPs were dispersed in ethanol with 3 wt% poly (acrylic  acid) as the dispersant. Na3CexZr2-xSi2PO12 NPs were ground and then sieved through a 80 mm  nylon mesh, uniaxially pressed at a WC die (12 MPa, φ 14.2 mm). First, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 samples  were sintered from 1050~1250°C to determine the best sintering temperature. Then the Na3CexZr2xSi2PO12  (x=0,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3)  samples  were  sintered  at  specific  temperature  for  5  h  ramped  at  5°C/min. 

The fracture morphologies of pellets were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM,  NOVA, FEI Inc) at 20 kV. TGA/SDT (Q 600) was conducted to confirm the phase transition  temperatures. AC impedance data were collected in an identical method described in our previous  research.30 Conductivities and activation energies were calculated by the following equations. Here,  resistance, electrode area, pellet thickness are represented by R, Ae and d. Absolute temperature,  gas constant, pre-exponential factor and activation energy are represented by T, Rg, A and Ea.

The slurry of TiO2, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and acetylene black (wt.%, 8:1:1) were  spread on an Cu foil to prepare the working electrode. They were dried at 110°C under vacuum  for  48  h.  1:1  vol%  EC ： PC  and  5  wt.%  FEC  were  used  as  the  liquid  electrolytes.  Na3Ce0.1Zr1.9Si2PO12 prepared in this work was used as the NASICON electrolyte. Pure sodium  foils were used as the counter electrode assembled in the CR2032 cells in a glove box filled with  argon. The measurements were performed using the range of 0–3 V.

The aims of this study were to prepare phase pure, fine grained and high density NASICON  samples. Coincidentally, an optimal nanopowder composition was explored using LF-FSP to make  NPs  with  compositions  of  Na3CexZr2-xSi2PO12  (x=0,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3)  targeting  Na  superionic  conductivity.

The following section consists of three parts. The first pertains to sintering optimization with  respect to phase purity. The second concerns characterization of Na3CexZr2-xSi2PO12 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2,  0.3) pellets vis a vis Na+ conductivity. Finally, the crystal structures of the materials were modeled,  and the Na-ion diffusion mechanism was studied based on calculating bottlenecks diameters. 

There are a few obvious aggregates. BET studies in Table S1 indicate APSs of 110  nm, consistent with SEM results.

However, some pores appear in the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 samples sintered above 1200°C. The drop  3 in  relative  density  may  result  from  migration  of  grain  boundaries  exceeding  the  rate  of  pore  4 elimination during sintering. Figure 2 microstructures show clear abnormal grain growth among  5 samples obtained at different temperatures. AGSs measured by the linear intercept method are ≈  6 110 nm for pellets obtained at 1050° or 1100°C and 200, 850, 1800 nm for pellets obtained at  7 1150°,  1200°  and  1250°C,  respectively.  With  increases  in  sintering  temperature,  the  AGSs  8 increased dramatically from 0.1 to 1.8 um. The influence of sintering temperature on NASICON  9 10 microstructure has been poorly described in the literature. By controlling the sintering temperature,  samples with quite fine AGSs and relatively high densities can be achieved. Fine AGSs appear to  11 decrease  the  activation  energy  but  also  Na+  diffusion  distance,  thus  leading  to  higher  ionic  12 conductivity compared to NASICON with higher AGSs.

The DTA/TGA curves of the as-produced Na3CexZr2-xSi2PO12 (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) NPs are  14 shown in Figures 5a, b. As for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3Ce0.1Zr1.9Si2PO12, the characteristic feature  15 of  this  DTA/TGA  corresponds  to  published  work,32  an  exotherm  appears  at  157°C  for  the  16 17 monoclinic−rhombohedral  transition.
