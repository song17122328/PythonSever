Natural kaolinite has been used as a starting material for preparing the fast ion  conductors  of  Na1+2x+yAlxSmyZr2.x.ySixP3.x012  system  (Al-Sm-Nasicon)  by  high  temperature  solid  phase  reaction.  A Nasicon  phase  with  C2/c  or  R  3 c space  group exists in a rather wide composition region of  above system. The unit-cell  dimensions  of  Al-Sm-Nasicon  change  with  changing  x  and  y.  The  maximum  conductivity  in  the  above  system  is  1.25  X 10"2 S/cm  at  400°C  for  the  initial  composition  x=  0.5,  y  =  0.3,  its  activation  energy  is  37.31  KJ/mole  in  the  temperature range 200~400°C  . 
In  the  search  for  fast  ion  conductors  to be  used  in  the  electrochemical  devices,  one  of  the  criteria  for  selecting  starting  materials  is low cost  and  abundance  in  natural resources. In recent years scientists have paid attention  to utilizing  some  natural  minerals  as  a  starting  material  to  prepare  so  called  mineral  fast  ion  conductors.  For  example,  montmorillonite  fast  ion  conductor  was  prepared  by  using  natural  montmorillonite  as  a  starting  material  and  the  montmorillonite  fast  ion  conductors  have  been  used  in  solid  state  batteries  [1-3].  Recent  years  some  other  layered  aluminosilicate  minerals  such  as pyrophyllite,  kaolinite  etc.  have been used as a starting material for preparing Nasicon type mineral fast  ion  conductors  in  our  laboratory  [4-10].  This  paper  deals  with  the  preparation,  characterization  of  Naj  +  2x+yAlxSmyZr2-A-ySix  P3.xO,2 system  which  is based  on  kaolinite and NaZr2(P04)3. 
NH4H2P04  was  dried  at  100°C, Al4[Si4O10](OH)8 and  other  ingredients  (Sm203)  Zr02 and Na2C03) were dried at 200°C just prior to use and kept in a desiccator.  Exact mole ratios of  the ingredients were weighed out and ground together in an  agate  mortar  until  thoroughly  blended.  The  entire  solid  was  then  added  to  a  platinum  vessel.  The  vessel  was  heated  at  170°C  for  4  h,  then  at  700°C  for  another  4  h  and  finally  at  900~1100°C  for  about  20  h.  The  vessels  plus  in 173) gredients were also weighed before  and after  heating to measure any weight loss  that occurred. 
The  reaction  products  were  ground  until  fine  enough  (about  300  mesh).  X-ray  powder  patterns  were  taken  with  a  computer-automated  diffractometer  (D/max-ya)  using  CuKa  radiation  (X=  1.5418A)  at  room  temperature.  The  unit-cell parameters  were  obtained  by  solving  the  simultaneous  equations  [11],  which is good for getting h, k,  1 of low symmetry crystal system. 
Electrical  conductivities  have  been  measured  by  an  ac  impedance  technique on reheated discs (13mm diameter and about 2 mm thick) from  room  temperature  to  400°C  in  the  frequency  range  20  Hz-200KHz.  The  discs  were  prepared by pressing the powders in an evacuable die at 6 ton/  cm2. They were  reheated  at  900-1100°C  for  about  15 h.  The  discs were then  coated  with  silver  paint  and  dried  at  100°C and then  heated  at 600°C for  30min. The sample was  sandwiched  between  two  silver  plates  to  ensure  good  electrode/electrolyte  contact.  The  entire  cell  assembly  was  placed  in  a  tubular  furnace  whose  temperature  could  be  controlled  to  ± 2°C with a temperature controller  (model  DRZ-4). 
Na1+2X+yAlxSmyZr2.x.ySixP3_x012system  (Al-Sm-Nasicon)  have  been  prepared  by  solid  phase  reaction  at  900-1100°C  for  about  20h.  The  temperature  of  synthesis  reactions  is fallen  with  increasing the  value of  (2x+  y). X-ray  powder  diffraction  relationship  of  Al-Sm-Nasicon.  The  results  showed  that  a  Nasicon  phase  with  C2/c  structure  can  be  found  in  the  composition  with  x=1.0,  y  =  0.4-0.7.  Another  Nasicon  phase  with  R  3 c  structure  was  observed  in  the  composition  ranges:  x=  0.5,  analysis  was  used  the  phase  identify  y=0.1~1.3; x=1.0,y  = 0-0.2.  Besides the Nasicon phase, the glass phases always  appear  in the compositions  with  greater  value of  (x+y). This probably  is due  to  the  excessive  substitution  of  Zr4+ byAl3+  and  Sm3+  in  the  Nasicon,  so  that  it  distorts the initial Nasicon structure and even break down. 
The  volume  of  unit-cell  of  composition  in  the  Al-Sm-Nasicon  system  increases  with  increasing  y  for  the  same  structure  ( R TC  or  02/'c)  and  same  x  value, this is due to the substitution  (as shown in the formula  of  Al-Sm-Nasicon)  in which  the lower  valence  of  Sm3+ with respect  to  Zr4+,  on  the other  hand,  the  greater radius of  Sm3 + (0.964A) relative to Zr4 + (0.790 A )[12]. 
The  electrical  conductivities  of  Al-Sm-Nasicons  have  been  measured  by  a.  c  impedance  technique.  The  activation  energies  for  the  ionic  diffusion  were  calculated  from  Arrhenius  plots.  Both  conductivities  and  activation  energies  of  Al-Sm-Nasicons are listed in the table 2. 
The  data  of  table  2  indicated  that  the  maximum  conductivity  is  1.25 X  10"2S/cm  at  400°C  for  the  initial  composition  with  x  =  0.5,  y=0.3,  its  activity  energy  is  37.  31KJ/mole  in  the  temperature  range  200-400°C  (473-673K)  .The  Al-Sm-Nasicons  are  based  on  the  NaZr2(P04)3 and  kaolinite.  It  is  well  known  that  NaZr2(P04)3  is not  a good  fast  ion  conductor  for  the  structural  reason [13].  As regards the kaolinite, it is a layered aluminosilicate mineral and doesn't have  any  exchangeable  ion,  so it is not  an  ionic conductor.
Most  of  Na+  ions in  the NaZr2(P04 )3 are filled "Nal  site" in a three dimension space, while the  Substitution  of  (Zr06) and (P04) in the NaZr2(P04)3 by (A106) and (Si04)  in the  kaolinite,  i.  e.  Al3+  and  Si4+  replace  Zr4+  and  P5+ simultaneously,  as  wall  as  the  substitution  of  Zr4+  by  Sm3+  in  order  to  maintain  the  charge  balance,  proper  amount  Na+  ions  would  be  introduced  and  filled  into  the  "Na2  site"  of  the  original  structural  unit  of  NaZr2(P04)3  These  Na+  ions  introduced  would  play  the  role  of  transport  ions  and  cause  cooperative  motions,  so  that  some  compositions  lower  activation energy. 
Natural  mineral kaolinite  has been used  to prepare  so called mineral  fast  ion  conductors.  Some  of  them  showed  high  conductivity  and  were  applied  to  the  manufacture  of  solid  state  cells,  which  exhibited  very  promising  applications.
