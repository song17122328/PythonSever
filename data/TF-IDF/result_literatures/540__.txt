In this study, Na3Zr2-xNb0.8xSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xTixSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xYxSi2PO12-0.5x, Na3Zr2-xZnxSi2PO12-x ceramics with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 were sintered to explore the influence of the valence state and the content of dopants on the conductivity of NASICON solid electrolyte. Archimedes method, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy and complex impedance spectroscopy were used to characterize the sintered samples. Results show that the dopant with +2 oxidation state cations improves the bulk conductivity mainly due to the less electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ ions and Na+ ions. The optimal doping content of Nb5+, Ti4+ and Y3+ doped NASICON ceramics is 0.1 mol and that of Zn2+ doped NASICON ceramic is 0.2 mol for the highest ionic conductivity. Among all the doped NASICON ceramics, Na3Zr1.8Zn0.2Si2PO11.8 ceramic displays the highest total conductivity of 1.44 × 10−3 S/cm and bulk conductivity of 3.41 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature. Furthermore, doping strategy both increases the density and decreases the sintering temperature of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic.

Recently, sodium ions batteries have attracted large attentions in the field of large-scale energy storage due to the low cost and abundant source of sodium [[1], [2], [3]]. In consideration of the battery safety, the use of stable solid electrolyte is taking the place of traditional flammable liquid electrolyte. Among all kinds of solid electrolytes for sodium ions batteries, NASICON-type Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic has shown high conductivity (10−4 S/cm) at room temperature and good stability under atmosphere, which can be a potential solid electrolyte candidate [4,5]. The NASICON structure consists of a three-dimensional rigid framework with ZrO6 octahedral and PO4 (SiO4) tetrahedral sharing common corners, which includes interconnected channels that supply fast conduction pathway for the Na+ ions [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. However, it is still a big challenge to reach Na+ ion conductivity achieved by organic electrolytes (10−3-10−2 S/cm) at room temperature.

In order to further improve the ionic conductivity, different preparation methods [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]] and doping strategies [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]] have been attempted. Some novel fabrication methods were demonstrated to enhance the conductivity by controlling the microstructure of the ceramic, such as Pechini synthesis [6], spark plasma sintering [7], microwave-assisted reactive sintering [8], use of sintering additive [[9], [10], [11]] and so on. Moreover, recent studies also showed that substitution of Zr4+ with other ions tuned the bottleneck size of Na+ ions pathways, optimized the composition of grain boundary phase and thereby increased the conductivity. M. Guin et al. [12] investigated the crystal structure and ionic transport of Sc3+ doped NASICON material and found the optimal hopping distance of Na+ ions for high ionic conductivity. Y.L. Ruan [15] and Z. Khakpour [17] reported an effective method to obtain Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics with high conductivity by rare earth metal substitutions and concluded that the conductivity strongly depended on the bottleneck geometry and the feature of the grain boundary. A.G. Jolley et al. [18,19] compared bivalent dopants with trivalent dopants and indicated that aliovalent cations substitution maximized the conductivity when the dopant was +2 oxidation state cations and had an ionic radius of about 0.73 Å. M. Samiee et al. [20] explored the bivalent doping effects on the conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic by both experiments and modeling and manifested that the chemistry of both the primary phase and secondary phase via doping had an important effect on the conductivity. Furthermore, the first-principle was used and the Materials Project database was set up to calculate the conductivity and optimize the structure of doped NASICON ceramics [26,27].

Although there are so many reports about doping effect, a comprehensively comparative study for the influence of the valence state and content of dopants on the crystal structure and conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic has not been undertaken to the best of our knowledge. The work also attempted for improving the ionic conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic. For the above aims, Na3Zr2-xNb0.8xSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xTixSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xYxSi2PO12-0.5x, Na3Zr2-xZnxSi2PO12-x ceramics with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 were prepared by solid-sate reaction. The microstructure, grain size, density, phase, lattice parameters, conductivity and activation energy of the ionic motion of the doped and undoped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics were examined to study the mechanism.

Na3Zr2-xNb0.8xSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xTixSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xYxSi2PO12-0.5x, Na3Zr2-xZnxSi2PO12-x powders with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 powders were obtained from solid state reaction of Na3PO4·12H2O, ZrO2, SiO2, Nb2O5, TiO2, Y2O3 and ZnO. The dopants were selected based on ionic radius and the stability of the valence state. All of the dopants (Nb5+ 0.63 Å, Ti4+ 0.53 Å, Y3+ 0.89 Å, Zn2+ 0.74 Å) have the similar ionic radius compared with Zr4+ (0.72 Å) and the valence states of cation are not easy to change. 15 wt% quantities of excessive Na3PO4·12H2O was added in the precursors to compensate the volatilization of sodium and phosphorus at high temperature. All compounds powders were ball milled in ethanol with agate balls in a rotary speed of 300 rpm for 6 h. The slurry was dried and calcined at 1100 °C for 9 h. After cooling, the calcined mixtures were ball milled in a rotary speed of 300 rpm for 6 h again. Then, the resultant powders were pressed into a steel die of 13 mm diameter under 200 MPa pressure. After removing from the die, the compact discs were sintered for 4 h at 1100 °C, 1150 °C, 1175 °C, 1200 °C, 1225 °C and 1250 °C respectively. The heating rate for calcining and sintering were 5 °C/min.

The density was examined by Archimedes method with water. The phase identification was carried out by X-ray diffractometry using Cu Kα radiation as X-ray source, with a step size of 0.033° and a step time of 45.72 s. Lattice parameters were evaluated from reflections by means of the Jade program. The cross-sections of the samples were polished and thermally etched at a temperature which was 100 °C lower than the sintering temperature for 30 min. Their microstructures were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The grain size was measured by Image-Pro Plus Microsoft through 10 polished and thermally-etched cross-section photos with 5000× magnification for each kind of ceramics.

For the conductivity measurements, silver electrodes were applied to both sides of the sintered discs by applying a coating of sliver paste, drying at 550 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min for 30 min. The impedance sweep went from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 0.01 V and measurements were taken every 50 °C between 50 °C and 200 °C for activation energies calculation. In order to analyze impedance spectroscopy results, a RC circuit was used to fit the value of grain resistance (Rg), grain boundary resistance (Rgb) and total resistance (R = Rg+Rgb) in Z-view software. The bulk conductivity (σb), grain boundary conductivity (σgb) and total conductivity (σ) were then calculated using,where ρ, R, L and S represented respectively the resistivity, resistance, thickness and cross-sectional area.

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.1 mol Nb, Ti, Y, Zn and undoped NASICON ceramic. All ceramics were found to be single Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase, no other phases were detected. Peak splitting at about 22.8° meant a monoclinic structure of the NASICON phase. Fig. 2 shows SEM micrographs of fractured cross-section of doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.1 mol Nb, Ti, Y, Zn. All of them were formed as a composite of NASICON and glass phases. Elemental analysis for the distribution of elements in the grain (marked by ×) is also shown in Fig. 2, which informed the realistic incorporation of dopants into the NASICON lattice.

Fig. 3 shows the typical impedance spectra at 25 °C of doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.1 mol Nb, Ti, Y, Zn and undoped NASICON ceramic. The frequency increases from right to left across the plot. The equivalent electrical is also shown in Fig. 3. It is a conventional equivalent circuit consisting of (RgCPE1) (RgbCPE2) (CPE3) [11,28]. For NASICON electrolyte, the total resistance consists of grain resistance and grain boundary resistance. The responses of grain resistance and grain boundary resistance are in the high frequency region and the intermediate frequency region, respectively. The sloping straight line in the low frequency region represents the ion blocking effect of the electrode. From Fig. 3, it can be seen that the valence state of dopants had an important influence on the conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics. The values of optimum sintering temperature, relative density, grain resistance, grain boundary resistance, bulk conductivity, grain boundary conductivity, total conductivity at 25 °C, total conductivity at 100 °C, activation energy, grain size of all the doped and undoped NASICON ceramics are summarized in Table 1.

Compared with undoped NASICON ceramic, the bulk conductivity of Zn2+ and Y3+ doped NASICON ceramics increased, Ti4+ doped NASICON ceramic kept stable, while Nb5+ doped NASICON ceramic decreased. Moreover, the total conductivity of all the doped NASICON ceramics increased, especially for Na3Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2PO11.9 ceramic, which had an obvious increase from 2.02 × 10−4 S/cm to 7.93 × 10−4 S/cm. As is well known that the bulk conductivity represents the inherent electrochemical properties and is mainly affected by the bottleneck geometry. The influence of different dopants on the bulk conductivity can be divided into two aspects. Firstly and most importantly, as the valence state of dopants decreased, the bulk conductivity increased. It inferred that lower valence state of dopants was beneficial for conductivity improvement. A lower valent cation occupying the zirconium site would decrease the coulombic repulsion between the dopant ion and the sodium ion. With less electrostatic interactions on the sodium ion, it would take less energy for the ion to navigate the bottlenecks around the zirconium ion [18]. Therefore, an increment in bulk conductivity can be seen in Zn2+ and Y3+ doped NASICON ceramics and a decrement in Nb5+ doped NASICON ceramic. Secondly, in order to maintain charge neutrality, the oxygen vacancies and zirconium vacancies were formed in Zn2+, Y3+ doped NASICON ceramics and Nb5+ doped NASICON ceramic, respectively. Na+ ions can be migrated through both interstice and vacancy. Occupied vacancies were provided for Na + ions migration, thus it was beneficial for bulk conductivity. However, the bulk conductivity of Nb5+ doped NASICON ceramic still decreased, which indicated that the electrostatic interaction between the dopant ion and the sodium ion was predominant contribution to the bulk conductivity. The reason might be that the quantity of vacancies was less, especially for zirconium vacancies in Na3Zr1.9Nb0.08Si2PO12 ceramic. The total conductivity is usually affected by Na+ ions transportation and sintering conditions, the latter includes density, microstructure and the second phase. From Table 1, compared with undoped NASICON ceramic, the relative density of all the doped NASICON ceramics had an obvious increase from 85% to approximately 92%. Therefore, the total conductivity of them was entirely improved. Moreover, the optimized pathway is helpful for the migration of Na+ ions not only in grains but also in grain boundaries. So, the total conductivity of Zn2+ doped NASICON ceramic exhibited the highest value.

The Arrhenius plots of total conductivities of doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.1 mol Nb, Ti, Y, Zn and undoped NASICON ceramic as a function of the testing temperature are presented in Fig. 4(a). Fig. 4(b) shows the EIS plots of the undoped NASICON ceramic at multiple temperatures as an example. It was difficult to separate grain and grain boundary conductivity at higher temperature (above 373 K). The reason was that the grain boundary conductivity was more influential at room temperature. So, the total conductivity contribution in Arrhenius plots has been considered. Experimental data is well fitted with straight line throughout the measured temperature. The activation energies of the ionic motion (△E) of all ceramics in Fig. 4(a) were calculated from the line slopes on (lnσT) axis at 1000/T. They were 0.40 eV, 0.40 eV, 0.36 eV, 0.37 eV and 0.30 eV for undoped NASICON ceramic and doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.1 mol Nb, Ti, Y, Zn respectively. It showed that the minimum activation energy belonged to Zn2+ doped NASICON ceramic, which demonstrated that the pathway of Na+ ions was optimized by substitution of Zr4+ ions with Zn2+ ions.

Fig. 5 shows XRD patterns of doped NASICON ceramics. The patterns were indexed to a monoclinic structure (space group C2/c) according to PDF#84-1200 (a = 15.6513 Å, b = 9.0550 Å, c = 9.2198 Å, β = 123.742°, V = 1086.54 Å3). Other compounds besides the NASICON appeared in the doped NASICON ceramics with x = 0.4, which indicated that the content of dopants had an influence on NASICON lattice parameters and impurities occurred. When the ionic radius of dopants was smaller than Zr4+, a few impurities emerged due to the serious lattice distortion. From Fig. 5(a), increasing the amount of Nb5+ to x = 0.4 led to the emergence of a little NaNbO3. Also a little ZrSiO4 was seen by increasing the amount of Ti4+ to x = 0.4 in Fig. 5(b). When the ionic radius of dopants was larger than Zr4+, the dopants couldn't be incorporated into the NASICON lattice completely, many impurities emerged due to the limited solubility of Y3+ ion and Zn2+ ion in NASICON lattice [17]. The slight differences of the lattice parameters of Na3Zr1.6Y0.4Si2PO11.8 ceramic and Na3Zr1.6Zn0.4Si2PO11.6 ceramic suggested that the solubility of Y3+ and Zn2+ doped NASICON ceramics was limited on 0.3 mol. For Na3Zr2-xYxSi2PO12-0.5x ceramics, some Y3+ ions took the Zr4+ site of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 lattice, some took the Zr4+ site of ZrSiO4 lattice by raising the amount of Y3+ to x = 0.3. While adding 0.4 mol Y3+ in composition, Na2ZrSi2O7 became the main phase and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 became the minor phase. For Na3Zr2-xZnxSi2PO12-x ceramics, increasing the amount of Zn2+ to x = 0.4 led to additional peaks of ZrSiO4 and Na2ZnSiO4, confirming that Zn2+ didn't take the site of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 lattice completely. The variations of the refined lattice parameters as a function of the content of dopants are depicted in Fig. 6. For all the doped NASICON ceramics, the change trend of a, b, β and V was nearly the same, but that of c was inverse. Furthermore, the lattice parameters varied obviously with x ≤ 0.3 and changed slightly with x = 0.4. Because of the different radius of dopants compared with that of Zr4+, the structure expanded in the a and b direction and contracted in the c direction for the substitution of Y3+, Zn2+ for Zr4+, while it was just the opposite for the substitution of Nb5+, Ti4+ for Zr4+.

Fig. 7 shows SEM micrographs of polished and thermally-etched cross-section of doped NASICON ceramics. Compared to the fractured cross-section in Fig. 2, lager pores can be seen which are mainly due to the evaporation of the liquid phase during thermal etching. It also can be seen that increasing the content of dopants led to a little decrease in grain size as listed in Table 1. From Fig. 7(c) and (d), granulated Na2ZrSi2O7 phase and lath-shaped ZrSiO4 phase were seen with x = 0.4, which was consistent with the result of XRD. Because of the difference of sintering properties between Na2ZrSi2O7 phase and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase, large pores were formed and the relative density was rather low in Na3Zr1.6Y0.4Si2PO11.8 ceramic.

Fig. 8 shows the typical impedance spectra at 25 °C of doped NASICON ceramics. The DC polarization plot of Na3Zr1.8Zn0.2Si2PO11.8 ceramic is presented in Fig. 8(d). From Table 1, the total conductivities of all the ceramics at 100 °C were at least one order of magnitude higher than those at 25 °C. The content of dopants also had a large effect on the conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic. Na3Zr1.8Zn0.2Si2PO11.8 ceramic displayed the greatest total conductivity of 1.44 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature, which enhanced an order of magnitude compared to undoped NASICON ceramic. For Na3Zr2-xNb0.8xSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xTixSi2PO12, Na3Zr2-xYxSi2PO12-0.5x ceramics, the conductivity exhibited the highest value with x = 0.1 and decreased as the content of dopants increased. From the DC polarization plot, a typical exponential decay of current was seen with the measurement time. The electronic conductivity estimated from the steady state current was about 5.05 × 10−9 S/cm, which was almost six orders of magnitude lesser than the total conductivity. Transference number of Na+ ions, defined as tNa+ = σNa+/σtotal, was found to be close 1. It confirmed that the conductivity was a result of ionic mobility rather than electronic mobility.

For all the doped NASICON ceramics, there were three similarities of them. Firstly, the optimum sintering temperature decreased as the content of dopants increased. Because of the different melting point of the dopants, the advisable sintering temperatures of different compositions were slightly different. The optimum sintering temperature was determined by mass density. Secondly, the relative density of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic increased regardless of the content of dopants ranging from x = 0.1 to x = 0.4, except for Na3Zr1.6Y0.4Si2PO11.8 ceramic. Thirdly, excessive doping reduced the conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic due to the serious lattice distortion, the change in Si/P ratio, the emergence of impurities and the decreased grain size. For the bulk conductivity, on the one hand, since the size of bottleneck for Na+ conduction directly depends on the lattice parameters, the unit cell volume has a major influence on the motion of Na+ ions [12]. Fig. 9 shows the relationship between bulk conductivity and the unit cell volume of different dopants. The optimum unit cell volume was around 1089 Å3, too large or too small volume caused unsuitable size of bottleneck for Na+ ions to pass through. On the other hand, a small depletion of Si from the bulk into the secondary Na2ZrSi2O7, ZrSiO4, Na2ZrSi4O12 and Na2ZnSiO4 phase, such as Na3Zr2-xZnxSi2PO12-x samples with x = 0.3 and 0.4 in Fig. 9, was likely to result in a decreased Si/P ratio within the bulk. It was reported that the bulk conductivity decreased as the ratio of Si/P decreased in the range of 2.2/0.8 to 1.8/1.2 [20]. For the total conductivity, the impurities at grain boundaries were undesirable to conductivity. Moreover, the quantity of grain boundary increased as the grain size decreased, thus the grain boundary conductivity reduced.

Substitution of Zr4+ ions in octahedral sites with different valent cations enhances the total conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic. Both the valence state (Nb5+, Ti4+, Y3+ and Zn2+) and the content of dopants (0.1–0.4 mol) have an important influence on the conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic. Lower valence state of the dopants is beneficial for bulk conductivity improvement mainly due to the less electrostatic interactions between dopant ions and Na+ ions. The optimal doping content of Nb5+, Ti4+ and Y3+ doped NASICON ceramics is 0.1 mol and Zn2+ doped NASICON ceramic is 0.2 mol. Excessive doping content reduces the conductivity on account of the serious lattice distortion, the decreased Si/P ratio, the emergence of impurities and the decreased grain size. Among all the doped NASICON ceramics, Na3Zr1.8Zn0.2Si2PO11.8 ceramic exhibits the highest total conductivity of 1.44 × 10−3 S/cm and bulk conductivity of 3.41 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature. Doping strategy not only increases the density of NASICON ceramic, but also decreases its sintering temperature.
