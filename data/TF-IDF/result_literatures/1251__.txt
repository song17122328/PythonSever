The temperature dependence of the heat capacity of LiZr2(PO4)3 crystal phosphate is studied in an adiabatic vacuum calorimeter in the temperature range of 6 to 358 K. A phase transition caused by the transition of a low 2)temperature (triclinic) modification to a high 2)temperature (rhombohedral) modification is observed in the temperature range of 290–338 K and its standard thermodynamic characteristics are esti 2) mated and analyzed. Standard thermodynamic functions are calculated from experimental data: heat capac 2) ity, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs function in the range of T → 0 to 358 K. Fractal dimensionality D is calcu 2) lated from the data on low 2)temperature (20 K ≤ T ≤ 50 K) heat capacity and the topology of the phosphate’s structure is estimated.

Complex  phosphates  with  NASICON  (Na  Super Ionic  Conductor)  structure  and  the  conductivity  of lithium ions have been the objects of numerous studies due to the possibility of using them as effective high 2) temperature  solid  ionic  conductors  or  high 2)capacity batteries  [1].  The  structure  of  lithium 2)containing phosphates LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ge, Ti, Sn, Hf, and Zr) is framework. Changes in the symmetry of the struc 2) tures of these compounds are due to the distortion of frameworks caused by introducing various atoms into their framework and different fillings of their cavities [2]; LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiGe2(PO4)3 have rhombohedral symmetry;  zirconium, hafnium, and tin phosphates, in addition to rhombo 2) hedral modification, the presence of other polymor 2) phous  forms  has  been  confirmed.  Their  structure depends largely on the method of synthesis, thermal treatment, and conditions of storing samples.

For  LiZr2(PO4)3,  a  transition  from  low 2)tempera 2) ture  (triclinic)  modification  to  high 2)temperature (rhombohedral)  phase  was  observed  in  the  range  of 300  to  340  K,  depending  on  the  temperature  of annealing the phosphate [3].

The authors of [4, 5] performed calorimetric stud 2) ies  of  NaZr2(PO4)3  and  CsZr2(PO4)3  crystal  phos 2) phates.  Their  heat  capacity    was  measured  in  the range of 7 to 650 K. The heat capacity curves had no noteworthy features and there were no polymorphous transitions  of  these  compounds  in  the  temperature range under study.

In  this  work,  we  present  the  results  from  experi 2) mental studies of the temperature dependence of the heat  capacity    of  lithium  dizirconium tris(phosphate) in the range of 6 to 357 K; its standard °( ) thermodynamic  functions  were  calculated:  , pC T  in the range H T H of  0  to  358  K;  the  type  of  topological  structure  of phosphate LiZr2(PO4)3 was estimated from multifrac 2) tal treatment of low 2)temperature (20 K  ≤ T  ≤ 50 K) dependence of heat capacity. Existing and new data on the phase transition of LiZr2(PO4)3 were compared.

The crystalline phosphate LiZr2(PO4)3 was synthe 2) sized by precipitating method from solutions of lith 2) ium chloride, zirconium oxychloride, and ammonium dihydrophosphate. Reagents of chemically pure grade were used as our initial reagents. During synthesis, sto 2) ichiometric amounts of aqueous solutions of lithium chloride and zirconium oxychloride were mixed under continuous  stirring.  A  solution  of  ammonium  dihy 2) drophosphate was then added with stirring in accor 2) dance with stoichiometry of phosphate. The reaction mixture was dried at T = 363 K and subjected to ther 2) mal treatment with free access to air at temperatures of 873, 1073, and 1273 K for more than 20 h at each step. The stepwise heating of sample was varied with disper 2) sion. In order to ensure maximum purity of the chem 2) ical  and  phase  composition  of  the  product  prior  to annealing at T = 1273 K, powder was pressed into pel 2)

lets that were rapidly cooled to room temperature after annealing. The sample synthesized in this way was a white polycrystalline powder whose composition and structure  were  confirmed  via  X 2)ray  diffraction  and electron microprobe and chemical analyses.

The  phase  composition  of  the  sample  was  con 2) firmed  via  X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  on  a  Shimadzu XRD 2)6000  diffractometer  with  СuKα  filtered  radia 2) tion.  The  set  of  interplanar  distances  was  compared with  the  data  given  in  [3,  6,  7].  The  X 2)ray  pattern showed the reflexes of reflection intrinsic to modifica 2) tions  of  LiZr2(PO4)3  with  rhombohedral  (I)  and  tri 2) clinic symmetry (II). The absence of a halo, the pres 2) ence of only clear diffraction maxima, and the absence of asymmetry in the profiles of the diffraction lines in the  X 2)ray  pattern  proved  there  was  no  amorphous phase or notable irregularities of the crystal structure in  sample.  According  to  quantitative  phase  analysis data  (error  of  determination,  3%),  the  sample  con 2) tained 90 wt % of phase I and 10 wt % of phase II. The parameters  of  the  elementary  cells  were  calculated according  to  the  results  from  determining  the  X 2)ray pattern of LiZr2(PO4)3 by means of linear regression , Z = 6, а = 8.835(1) Å, analysis: I, space group  с =  22.70(3)  Å;  II,  space  group  ,  Z  =  4,  а  = 15.34(1)  Å,  b  =  8.733(7)  Å,  с  =  9.105(6)  Å,  α  = 89.36(4)°, β = 123.25(5)°, and γ = 91.06(4)°.

The chemical composition and homogeneity of the sample  was  controlled  using  a  CamScan  MV 2)2300 (VEGA TS 5130MM) scanning electron microscope equipped  with  YAG  detectors  of  secondary  and reflected electrons and a Link INCA ENERGY 200C energy  dispersion  X 2)ray  microanalyzer  with  a  semi 2) conductor Si(Li) detector. PAP correction was used to calculate  composition.  The  results  from  electron probe analysis showed that a sample was homogeneous and included only Li, Zr, P, and O elements. Because microprobe analysis does not allows us to perform the quantitative determination of lithium, the molar con 2) tent ratios of phosphorus, zirconium, and oxygen were chosen as our criteria for the composition of synthe 2) sized phosphate corresponding to theoretical formula LiZr2(PO4)3.  These  relationships  are  constant  and correspond  to  the  theoretical  values  within  the  error range of method. It was determined that the P 2)to 2)Zr molar ratio = 1.49(2); O 2)to 2)Zr = 5.98(2); the theoret 2) ical values calculated for the formula LiZr2(PO4)3 are: P 2)to 2)Zr  =  1.50;  and  O 2)to 2)Zr  =  6.00.  The  chemical composition of the sample was confirmed by elemen 2) tal analysis. A known mass of the sample was dissolved in an aqueous solution of HF. Its lithium content was determined  via  atom  absorption  spectroscopy  on  a Perkin 2)Elmer 603 instrument. The zirconium content was  determined  gravimetrically  with  cupferron, according  to  the  procedure  in  [8].  The  phosphorus content was determined colorimetrically on an SF 2)46 spectrophotometer, according to the procedure in [9] using  ammonium  vanadate  and  molybdate.  The

results from our analyses showed that the stoichiomet 2) ric composition of sample was close to theoretical and corresponded to the formula Li0.97(3)Zr1.91(2)P3.00(3)O12.

A fully automated BKT 2)3 adiabatic vacuum calorim 2) eter, designed and built at AOZT Termis (Mendeleevo, Moscow  oblast),  was  used  to  study  the  temperature dependence of heat capacity  = f(T) of a sample in the range of 6 to 358 K. Liquid helium and nitrogen were used as coolants. The calorimetric ampoule containing our substance was filled to a pressure of 40 kPa at room temperature with dry helium as a heat exchange gas. The design of the calorimeter and our procedure were similar to those described in [10, 11]. The reliability of calorim 2) eter  operation  was  confirmed  by  measuring  the    of reference  sample  of  extra  pure  copper,  standard  syn 2) thetic corundum, and benzoic acid of K 2)3 grade. It was determined that the equipment and procedure of mea 2) surements enabled us to obtain the   of substances with an error of ±2% up to 15 K, ±0.5% in the range of 15 to 40 K, and ±0.2% in the range of 40 to 358 K, and to mea 2) sure the temperatures of phase transitions with an error of ±0.01 K in accordance with ITS 2)90 and enthalpies of transition of ±0.2%.

The  heat  capacity  of  the  LiZr2(PO4)3  sample  was studied  in  the  temperature  range  of  6  to  358  K (Table 1).  First,  0.7820  ×  10–3  kg  substance  under study  was  placed  in  a  calorimetric  ampoule.  In  two series reflecting the sequence of conducting the exper 2) iment,  133  experimental  values  of    were  obtained (Table 1). The heat capacity of the compound under study always assumed values of 45 to 85% of the total heat  capacity  of  a  calorimetric  ampoule  with  a  sub 2) stance. The experimental points of   in the tempera 2) ture ranges where there was no phase transition were smoothed  as  exponential  and  semilogarithmic  poly 2) nomials; corresponding coefficients were chosen using special programs. The root 2)mean 2)square deviation of the experimental points of   from the corresponding smoothed curve   = f(T) did not exceed ±0.7% in the range of 6 to 20 K or ±0.08% in the range from 20 to 290 K, and were  ±0.03% in the temperature range of 338 to 358 K.

Experimental points of   and smoothened curve °pC  = f(T) of lithium dizirconium tris(phosphate) are given in figure. It can be seen that the heat capacity of phosphate gradually increases with the growth of tem 2) perature  until  290  K.  On    =  f(T)  curve  (figure),

there is an anomaly in the range from 290 to 338 K, which  manifests  itself  in  the  positive  deviation  from normal  route  of  temperature  dependence  of  heat capacity.  Observed  endothermic  transition  is  revers 2) ible, it reproduced at repeated cooling and heating. It is  related  to  the  transition  of  low 2)temperature  (tri 2) clinic) modification to high 2)temperature (rhombohe 2) dral).  Enthalpy  of  transition    =  0.7673  ± 0.0015 kJ/mol was calculated as the difference of inte 2) grals  on  the  curves  of  apparent  and  interpolated

This  is  the  transition  of  order  disorder  type, intrinsic feature of which is that the group of symmetry of low 2)temperature phase is the subgroup of symmetry of high 2)temperature phase. Main structural changes at phase  transition  are  related  to  rearrangement  of extraframework  lithium  cations  in  elementary  cell. As is mentioned in a series of works, dynamic disor 2) dering  of  lithium  ions  on  various  positions  results  in


Temperature dependence of the heat capacity of crystal phosphate LiZr2(PO4)3, AB is 90 wt % of phase I and 10 wt % of phase II; DE is phase I; and BCD is the range of phase II 

hysteresis loop; transition occurs not in point, rather than  in  the  broad  temperature  range  (~40  K)  and phase  transition  at  cooling  proceeds  at  substantially lower temperatures (>10 K) [12, 13]. It is known [14] that  rhombohedral LiZr2(PO4)3 samples are formed only below 280 and above 360 K, respectively.

Experimental values of low 2)temperature heat capac 2) ity (Т < 50 K) were used to estimate fractal dimension D [15, 16] and the topology of the phosphate’s structure. In a multifractal model for the treatment of low 2)tempera 2) ture heat capacity [15, 16], the most important parame 2) ter (fractal dimension D [15]) allows us to make several statements on the type of topology in the structure of sol 2) ids. According to [17, 18], value D (the exponent at Т in the function of heat capacity) on the slope of linear sec 2) tion  of    vs.  lnТ  can  be  estimated;  this  follows,  in particular, from the following equation:

(1) where N is the number of particles, k is the Boltzmann constant, γ(D + 1) is the gamma function, ξ(D + 1) is the  Reiman  function,  θmax  is  the  characteristic  tem 2) perature, and D is the fractal dimension. According to [16], D can assume values from 1 to 4, depending on the structure of a solid. =°pC

 at Т < 50 K, we determined from the   vs. lnТ plot for LiZr2(PO4)3 that in the range  from  20  to  50  K,  D  =  3  and  θmax  =  212.8  K. Equation  (1)  reproduces  the  values    with  deter 2) mined  values  in  the  mentioned  temperature  range with an error of  ±1.2%. According to this model, for

Assuming that bodies with chain 2)like structure, the   vs. Т depen 2) dence in the low 2)temperature range is proportional to Т 1;  for  solids  of  layer  structure,  Т 2;  and  for  three 2) dimentional,  Т 3;  i.e.,  the  D  values  for  these  corre 2) spond to 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

According to X 2)ray structural data, the phosphate under  study  has  the  framework  structure  in  [2].  The results  from  multifractal  treatment  of  low 2)tempera 2) ture  heat  capacity  indicate  the  applicability  of  this model  for  the  analysis  of  heat  capacity  of  the  com 2) pounds of this series.

With a drop in temperature (from 20 K to the tem 2) perature at the beginning of measurements), the heat capacity  of  the  phosphate  is  described  by  the  Debye heat  capacity  function  of  solids;  this  is  intrinsic  for inorganic crystals with framework structure.

Standard thermodynamic functions of crystal phos 2) phate  LiZr2(PO4)3  (mixture  of  90  wt  %  phase  I  and 10 wt % phase II) were calculated from the   values in the range of Т → 0 K to 290 K (Table 2) and, for phase I, °pC in the range of 338 to 358 K (Table 3). Data on   in the °pC range of T → 0 to 6 K was obtained by extending   = f(T) to the Debye heat capacity function for solids:

Here, D is Debye heat capacity function, n = 6, and θD = 183.5 K are specially chosen parameters. Equa 2)
