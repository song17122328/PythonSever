Sodium zirconium silicon phosphorus with the composition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) was prepared by a facilesolid state reaction method.
The effects of the calcination temperature and rare earth element substitution onthe structure and ionic conductivity of the NZSP material were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AC impedance measurement.
The results show that the microstructureand ionic inductivity of the NZSP was strongly affected by the aliovalent substitution of Zr4+ ions inNZSP with rare earth metal of La3+, Nd3+ and Y3+.
At room temperature, the optimum bulk and total ionicconductivity of the pure NZSP solid electrolyte sintered under different conditions were 6.77×10−4 and4.56×10−4 S cm−1, respectively.
Substitution of La3+, Nd3+ and Y3+ in place of Zr4+ exhibited higher bulkconductivity compared with that of pure NZSP.
Maximum bulk and ionic conductivity value of 1.43×10−3 and1.10×10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature were obtained by Na3+xZr1.9La0.1Si2PO12 sample.
The charge imbalancecreated by aliovalent substitution improves the mobility of Na+ ions in the lattice, which leads to increase in theconductivity.
AC impedance results indicated that the total ionic conductivity strongly depends on thesubstitution element and the feature of the grain boundary.
NASICON-type solid electrolyte Na3Zr2Si2PO12 materials are successfullysynthesized by a simple solid-state reaction.
The NZSP samplesintered at 1150 °C for 12 h displays the maximum bulk and total ionicconductivity of 6.74×10−4 and 4.56×10−4 S cm−1, respectively at roomtemperature.
Doping by La3+, Nd3+ and Y3+ aliovalent element formsliquid phase during the sintering process.
The presence of liquid phaseis beneficial for the densification at high temperature which will causethe change in the NASICON structure and affect the conductivity ofmaterial.
AC impedance studies indicate that the La-doped NASICONdisplays the highest bulk conductivity and total conductivity at roomtemperature, which is 1.43×10−3 and 1.10×10−3 S cm−1, respectively.
By doping the Zr4+ site with rare earth elements of +3 valence, thesodium in the lattice can be increased, which results in higherconductivity.
It is concluded that the total ionic conductivity stronglydepends on the substitution element and the feature of the grainboundary.
