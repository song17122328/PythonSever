Sodium-ion battery is a rocking chair battery similar to lithium-ion battery and is considered to have a promising future due to low cost and extensive resources. As anode for sodium-ion battery, NaTi2(PO4)3 has attracted lots of attention due to its thermal stability and three-dimensional channels. In this work, we employed crystal doping of K ion on Na site to raise electrochemical performance of NaTi2(PO4)3/C composites. NaTi2(PO4)3/C doped with K was synthesized and used as anode for sodium-ion battery. XRD and SEM results imply that introduction of K ion has no significant change in the main crystal form and morphology of materials. Among Na1-xKxTi2(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05) composites, Na0.97K0.03Ti2(PO4)3/C (NC/K-3) shows the best rate property, outstanding cycling performance, and the lowest charge transfer resistance. It delivers capacities of −1, severally. Besides, even after 1000 cycles at 1.2 A g −1, NC/K-3 keeps 206.65, 139.14, and 94.45 mAh g −1 higher than that of bare NaTi2(PO4)3/C. In conclusion, K doping on Na the discharge capacity at 89.5 mAh g site by sol-gel route is a viable modification method to improve performance of NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite as anode for sodiumion batteries.

Fossil fuels bring a range of environmental pollution problems, and more and more new energy sources are being used in response to sustainable development requirements [1–5]. Wind and solar energy is limited by time and location and requires continuous and efficient energy storage systems to provide a sustainable energy supply [6–9]. Secondary electrochemical battery is a pivotal technology for large-sized energystorage systems [10–13]. Among them, lithium-ion batteries are suitable for a variety of electronic devices and large-sized energy storage, such as smart phones, electric bicycles, and so on [14–18]. In addition, the demand of power storage systems such as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles is also increasing [19, 20]. Lithium resources are being consumed more and more, leading to its high price and resource lack [21, 22]. Therefore, it makes sense to research and develop other new battery systems [23].

Sodium-ion batteries are expected to buffer excessive demand for lithium-ion batteries [24–26], which have attracted widespread attention from battery researchers. The cost of sodium-ion batteries is low due to abundant sodium reserves and wide range of sources [27]. Low-cost batteries also contribute to the further application and development of energy storage systems [28]. As a result, reports on sodium-ion batteries have increased incredibly in last decades [29, 30]. Many electrode materials have been studied, such as carbon materials [31, 32], TiO2 [33], SnS2 [34], Na2Ti3O7 [35], NaVO2 [36], LiTi2(PO4)3 [37], and NaTi2(PO4)3 [38] as anode materials and NaxMnO2 [39], NaxCoO2 [40], Na3V2(PO4)3 [41], and NaFePO4 [42] as cathode materials. The working process of sodium-ion batteries is realized by transfer of electrons and the intercalation/deintercalation of sodium ions. They are “rocking chair type” batteries [43, 44] like lithium-ion batteries. But in terms of ionic radius, Na is larger than Li, which tends to cause greater expansion in volume during insertion process, further resulting in unsatisfactory cycling stability and inferior specific capacity [45]. Hence, to meet increasing demand, the development of suitable electrode materials for sodium storage remains a huge challenge.


NaTi2(PO 4) 3 possesses Na superionic conductor (NASICON) structure and is a class of fast ion conductor material [46, 47]. The [TiO6] octahedron and [PO4] tetrahedron in the NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal are interconnected by oxygen atoms at the apex to form a [Ti2(PO4)3] polyanion structure [48, 49]. It has large channels inside, which are very suitable for the rapid transmission of lithium ions and sodium ions. However, its intrinsic conductivity is low, and this shortcoming is usually improved by combining with conductive additives or carbon [50, 51]. For instance, Zuo et al. [52] have proposed and manufactured reduced graphene and carbon co-modified NaTi2(PO4)3 sample by hydrothermal process and high-temperature calcination. Graphene and coated carbon can form a conductive network in this composite, which effectively improves the conductivity and sodium storage performance. At 0.1 C, the corresponding discharge capacity of modified −1. Another way to imNaTi2(PO4)3 can reach 129 mAh g prove conductivity is ion doping [53], including anion doping and cation doping. Su et al. [54] have proposed a novel nanostructured Na1-2xTi2(PO4)3-xFx anode for sodium-ion batteries. Appropriate fluorine doping increases the ion/electron transport speed, resulting in ultralong cycle life. Capacity decay of Na2.9Ti2(PO4)2.95F0.05/C at 10 °C is only 10% after 1000 cycles.

In this paper, crystal doping strategy was employed to raise the sodium storage performance of NaTi2(PO4)3/C compounds for sodium-ion battery. We used potassium instead of sodium partially and phenolic resin as carbon resource to construct Na1-xKxTi2(PO4)3/C anode materials. An easy solgel approach was utilized to prepare composites, roughly as depicted in Fig. 1. And the electrochemical behavior of all samples is reported in this paper.
