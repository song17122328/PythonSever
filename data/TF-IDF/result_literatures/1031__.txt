Facile and effective synthesis strategy is dramatically desirable for basic studies and practical applications of Eu2+ luminescent materials. In this work, facile chemical lithiation is used for reduction of trivalent Eu3+ ions into divalent Eu2+ ions in Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure using nBu-Li solution at room temperature. VUV/Vis luminescence properties, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and magnetic properties were used to characterize the valence state of Eu ions in crystal structure of host lattice. The emission light

Rare earth (RE) doped luminescent materials exhibiting fascinating optical properties are preferred over other luminescent materials for various applications. Recently, as one promising next generation illumination source, white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted much attention. Among the RE activators, Eu2+ ions present many interesting and important applications in this field because the high absorption of Eu2+ ions in wide wavelength range, tunable emission color.[1,2]

How to obtain novel Eu2+-doped luminescent materials with novel crystal structure and high light tunable emission via facile method is still one big challenge. Traditionally, high temperature and high vacuum or reducing atmosphere condition are necessary for synthesis Eu2+-doped inorganic solid compounds.[3–6] Recently, the reduction of Eu3+ ions to Eu2+ ions in inorganic crystal structure was successive achieved through facile reduction via mixed solvent of oleic acid/hexadecylamine hydrothermal process or electrochemical lithium insertions.[7,8]

to blue-green color changes [LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3], and the samples are paramagnetic after this facile chemical lithiation. The ultra-fast decay time (⬍50 ns) of Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 is attributed to the luminescence quenching effects of Eu3+ and Eu2+ co-existing in the crystal structure. All the results indicate that this chemical lithiation method is a facile and effective method for Eu2+ luminescent materials fabrication and LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 is a potential luminescent material.

Since the first report on the Na+ ion super ionic conductors (NASICON) type MZr2(PO4)3 in 1967,[9] many related zirconium phosphates have been extensively studied including the luminescence In typical NASICON MZr2(PO4)3 three-dimensional (3D) [Zr2(PO4)3]– network formed by share the corn of PO4 tetrahedron and ZrO6 octahedron. The RE ions occupy fractional M sites disorder.[14–16] Thus, some of this NASICON type materials were found to be good hosts for novel luminescent materials. The VUV luminescence properties of RE3+-doped AZr2(PO4)3 (A+ = Li, Na, K)[17] have been investigated. EuII 1/2Zr2(PO4)3 (MII = Ca, Sr, Ba)[5] were demonstrated as novel potential blue luminescent materials.

This type crystal structure shows great features for novel luminescent materials: (1) The [Zr2(PO4)3]– group in structure of NASICON structure exhibits great VUV luminescence properties,[17] (2) the 3D rigid [Zr2(PO4)3]– network is quite stable, (3) large average distance (⬎5 Å) between RE3+ ions will reduce the luminescence concentration quenching, and (4) the luminescence properties of Eu ions in this type crystal structure can be tuned by modifying the chemical elements forming the 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network.[5,6] Thus, utilizing these features of NASICON crystal structures, Saradhi et al. synthesized a single-phased phosphor containing both Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions via electrochemical lithium insertions.[7] Chemical lithiation using nBu-Li (2.5 m in hexane) at room temperature is better for Eu2+-doped luminescent materials synthesis and research.[7]

In this paper, we focus on reducing trivalent Eu3+ ions in Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure to divalent Eu2+ via chemical lithiation. The valence states of Eu ions were demonstrated by XANES and magnetic properties. The effect of the framework structural changes on luminescence properties was discussed. This effective facile reduction method will open a new door for practical applications and research of divalent Eu2+ ions doped luminescent materials.

Crystal structure is quite important for the investigation and explanation of the properties and performance of luminescent materials. In this work, this novel NASICON type crystal structure exhibits superiority for chemical lithiation at room typical 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network in temperature. The NASICON phases contains the Zr4+ and P5+ ions. All the ions hold their states and scarcely can be reduced with difficulty in a reducing atmosphere. Thus, the 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network will not decomposed by chemical lithiation procedures. The cages in 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network could accommodate cations with a larger radius including RE ions. The 3D ion-migrating pathways in NASICON type crystal structure is more appropriate for ions migration.[16] This special structure supports good crystal field for RE luminescent center and good crystal structure for lithium insertion in solid state phase.

The white Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 powder changed to light yellow after the chemical lithiation. The XRD patterns for the samples before and after chemical lithiation are shown in Figure 1. The XRD pattern for the as-prepared Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 sample is consistent with standard pattern JCPDS No. 51–0557. In the excess amount nBu-Li solution at room temperature, Li was inserted and the trivalent Eu3+ ions were reduced to divalent Eu2+ in the crystal structure. The overall mechanism of this redox reaction can be expressed as follows:

As shown in XRD pattern, the rigid 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network not fall down during this chemical lithiation. All these two XRD patterns are readily indexed with a hexagonal unit cell. One small peak appears near 10°, which indicates the crystal structure changed from P3¯C1 symmetry to R3¯ symmetry. This result is quite similar to other report.[7] Due to the special character of 3D rigid [Zr2(PO4)3]– network, the chemical lithiation processes introduce complex cations (Li+, Eu2+ and Eu3+) diffusion and distribution.[13,18] Thus, this chemical lithiation caused inhomogeneous broadening of the X-ray diffraction is probably indicates that a relatively large microstrain in particles which is difficult to model, that a larger unit cell is required, or the possibility that certain diffractions are less affected by compositional inhomogeneity.[19] For the sample after chemical lithiation, the slightly shift and broaden of XRD peaks are attributed to the radii increasing of Eu ions (Eu2+ ionic radii larger than radii of Eu3+ ions) and insertion of Li+ ions inside the vacancies sites of rigid 3D [Zr2(PO4)3]– network. The lattice constants of the samples before and after the chemical lithiation are summarized in Table 1. All parameters in Table 1 are close to the other NASICON type compounds and in good agreement with those proposed by Alami Talbi et al.[11]

The morphologies of samples prepared were characterized by FE-SEM (Figure 2). There is no great difference between the powder samples before and after chemical lithiation.

The preceding experimental results are evident that room temperature facile chemical lithation will not damage the crystal structure and morphologies. However, further investigations are necessary for the reduction efficiency of Eu3+ ions in EuIII Eu L3-edge XANES Spectra XANES spectroscopy can easily determine the valence states of Eu2+ (4f7) ions and Eu3+ (4f6) ions, due to the different threshold energies around 8 eV of their white light resonance corresponding to the transition to the unoccupied 5d states. The energy difference originates from the shielding of the nuclear potential through an additional 4f electron in Eu2+, subsequently lowering the binding energy of the respective core electrons. To further examine two valence states of Eu in

the samples after chemical lithiation, XANES was performed near Eu L3 edge with Eu2O3 as reference for Eu3+ ions (Figure 3, black line). Compared with the normalized Eu L3 edge XANES spectra of EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3, and Eu2O3, the spectrum of the sample after chemical lithiation reveals two peaks at 6972 and 6980 eV, which are attributed to the electron transition of 2p3/2 씮 5d in Eu2+ and Eu3+, respectively (Figure 3). Coexistence of two valence states in crystal structure suggests the final formula should be LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 with larger Eu2+ concentration than Eu3+, since the integrated intensity of Eu2+ is much stronger than that of Eu3+. Thus, chemical lithiation is one effective method for obtaining Eu2+ ions in inorganic crystal structure at room temperature. The exactly ratio of Eu2+/Eu3+ can be identify by magnetic susceptibility, which will be discussed below. The little amount of Eu3+ ions coexisting with Eu2+ ions in the crystal structure exhibit strong influence on the Eu2+ luminescence properties.[20,21]

Supporting Information). (cf. theoretical value of the magnetic moment μEu2+ = 7.94 μB). The dramatically difference between theoretical values and the measurement result is mainly attributed to coexisting of Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions in crystal structure. The amount of Eu2+ ions in LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 can be identified by the ratio of the measurement result and the theoretical value of the magnetic moment (Table S4, Supporting Information). The x value in LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 sample is around 0.29 (Table S4, Supporting Information), which changes with the reduction degree.

For Eu ions on monovalent sites in NASICON crystal structure, the luminescence spectra are strongly influenced by the Eu ionic valence, reduction degree (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and crystal sites. Figure 5 shows the UV/Vis

The valence of Eu ions shows great influence on the magnetic properties of materials. Compared with Eu3+ materials, divalent Eu2+ materials show obvious paramagnetism. The temperature dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility (χ), 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 measured at a constant magnetic field of H = 1000 Oe is that LixEuII 1/3–xZr2(PO4)3 shows Curie behavior. The temperature dependencies of this paramagnetic property follows the Curie-Weiss law χ(T) = C/(T – θ), where χ is the molar magnetic susceptibility, and θ is the Weiss temperature. The 2/3κB, where NA is Curie constant is expressed as C = NAμeff Avogadro’s number, μeff is an effective magnetic moment, and κB is the Boltzmann’s constant. A linear fit (adj. R2 = 0.9987) of the inverse magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature is employed (inset in Figure 4 and Table S4, Supporting Information), yielding the effective paramagnetic moment μ of 6.837 μB characteristic for Eu2+ (4f7) ions (Table S4,

excitation and emission spectra of EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (before, Figure 5a) and Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 (after, Figure 5b) samples. These luminescence spectra indicated that, EuIII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 emit bright orange-red light and blue-green light under UV excitation, respectively. These two samples emit colored light characteristic of Eu3+ ions and Eu2+ ions, respectively. The insets of Figure 5a and b show evident light color change, introduced lithiation at room temperature. The emission by chemical peaks of EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3 are dominated by the peak at 585 nm and 612 nm, which can be attributed to the electron transition from 5D0 to7F1 and 7F2 levels of Eu3+ ion, respectively. The other peaks belong to the electron transitions from 5D0 to 7F0, 7F3 and 7F4 levels of Eu3+, respectively (Figure 5a and Figure 6). Even through little amount Eu3+ ions coexist with Eu2+ structure, no obvious Eu3+ ions spectra of Li0.286EuII

Based on the fact that the emission intensity of Eu3+ ions depend critically on the Eu3+ location in the crystal structure, the Eu3+ ions are usually employed as a sensitive probe to investigate the coordination and local environment around the cations substituted in the crystalline lattice. If Eu3+ is located on a site with inversion symmetry, the orange color (O) 5D0 씮 7F1 magnetic-dipole transition is dominant; while on a site without inversion symmetry, the red color (R) 5D0 씮 7F2 electric-dipole transition is strong. Because of charge imbalance and the special NASICON type crystal structure with 3D cation-migrating pathways, multiple sites are expected for Eu3+ ions in EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure. When the sam-

ple are excited by different wavelength in UV region, multisite structures in EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure were verified (Figure 6). The main site of Eu3+ was determined to be site I for exciting wavelength at 392 nm and 360 nm (Figure 6a and c), and site II for exciting wavelength at 212 nm (Figure 6b). Based on such a comparison, it is assumed that a Eu3+ ion at site I (2a) and site II (4b) substitutes the site at the centrosymmetry and noncentrosymmetry in the lattice, respectively (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The Eu3+ ions displacements are attributed to the ionic conductivity property observed for this NASICON type phase.[10] Thus, the emission color of EuIII

For Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3, the excitation in the UV region is attributed to the 4f-5d multiplets of excited states of Eu2+ ions (Figure 5). The broad emission band in the range between 420 to 600 nm can be separated into two Gaussians with maxima at about 468 and 500 nm, respectively (Figure 7). This result suggests that there are two different sites in Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3. The splitting of 5d excitation level of Eu2+ ions in the solid-state compound strongly depends on the strength of the crystal field around the Eu2+ ions. In Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure with the R3¯ space group (Figure S2, Supporting Information), there are two different cation sites: M(1) 3a and M(2) 3b sites. Although the crystal environments of Eu2+ ions on these two cation sites are very similar, obvious shift in the emission spectra is observed (Figure 7). Usually, the crystal field strength presented as Dq is inversely proportional to the 5th power of band-length R: Dq ⬀ R–5, when the crystal environment as are analogous, the central Eu2+ ions with a shorter Eu–O distance will give a longer wavelength emission. Since the distance of M–O on the M(1) 3a site is longer than that on the M(2) 3b site, we ascribed the 468 nm emission to Eu2+ ions on the M(1) 3a site, and the 500 nm emission to those on the M(2) 3b site in the crystal structure with R3¯ space group, respectively (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Similar phenomena have been reported in the EuII 0.5Zr2(PO4)3 blue luminescent materials.[6]


The kinetic property for the luminescence of white EuIII light-yellow powder Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 powder (Figure 8b) samples were investigated by the decay curve. The decay curve for the luminescence of Eu3+ ions (monitored by λem = 585 nm and λex = 392 nm) can be well fitted into a single-exponential function with lifetime of 4.778 ms. The decay curve for the luminescence of Eu2+ ions (monitored by λem = 470 nm and λex = 340 nm) can be well fitted in to two single exponential function, which components with a lifetime of 46.33 and 13.36 ns, and a contribution to the total light output of 76.77 % and 23.23 %, respectively (Figure 8b). The decay curves that were measured for Eu2+ ions in the different host lattices were all single exponential.[19] The decay time with two components of Eu2+ ions also indicate that there two different sites in the crystal structure for Eu2+ ions (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

The decay time dramatically decreased with the valence state reduction of Eu ions in the solid crystal structure. The Eu2+ lifetime obtained in this work is in a similar range as those reported elsewhere with the same Eu2+ doped concentration.[22] We attribute the fast Eu2+ lifetimes obtained in this work to the luminescence quenching effects.[22] High Eu2+ concentration and co-doping with Eu3+ ions are two major factors in the fast photoluminescent lifetime of Eu2+ emission (Figure 8b). Based on the parameters in Table 1, the calculated Eu2+ ions concentration (see in Supporting Information) in Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure is more than 1021 per cm3.[22] The lifetime decreases lower than 100 ns at a concentration of 1021 per cm3 in glass host.[22]

Generally, fluorophors can transfer their excitation energy from one to another without radiation, provided that there is an overlap between the PL emission and excitation spectra of the donor and acceptor ion, respectively. In fact, excited Eu2+ (donor) ions can nonradiatively transfer their energy to Eu3+ (acceptor) ions, since the PL emission of Eu2+ matches well with some excitation bands of Eu3+. Therefore, cross-relaxation from Eu2+ to Eu3+ is possible, when both ions are present in sufficiently high concentration.[22–24] Thus, the photoluminescent lifetime of Eu2+ will be dramatically decreased by the coexisting of Eu3+ ions in Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 sample.

The luminescence results not only indicate the novel luminescence properties of the NASICON type compounds with permissible application, but also show the crystalline information of the crystal structures.

1/3Zr2(PO4)3 powder sample with NASICON crystal structure were synthesized via sol-gel method. Chemical lithiation was introduced for Eu3+ ions reduction in solid crystal structure at room temperature. The white powder sample turned into light yellow Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 powder. The XANES and magnetic data indicated that this chemical reduction is easy and effective. Following the typical experimental processes, most of Eu3+ ions (⬎ 85 %) in the EuIII 1/3Zr2(PO4)3 crystal structure were reduced to Eu2+. The luminescence spectra that, Eu ions and decay curves) show a solid evident occupy structure. Li0.286EuII 0.047Zr2(PO4)3 with ultra-fast decay time (⬍ 50 ns) is one potential fast decay luminescent material. This chemical lithiaiton method is quite effective to produce divalent RE luminescent materials. These divalent RE luminescent materials with novel optical properties will offer rich variety of basic studies and possible practical applications.

Experimental Section Synthesis Procedures: Pure Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 NASICON type phosphate powder samples were synthesized by the Pechini method. Stoichiometric Eu2O3, ZrOCl2·8H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were used as starting materials. All the starting reagents were analytical purity grade and were used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, stoichiometric Eu2O3 was first dissolved in diluted nitric acid, resulting in a Eu(NO3)3 solution with pH value between 3 and 4. ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in deionized water. The desired amount of citric acid (CA) was dissolved in the above solutions, respectively, as chelating reagent (molar ratio CA: Eu3+ = 1 and CA: Zr4+ = 2). The pH value of above solutions were adjusted to 7–8 by ammonia water (40 % mass), respectively. The above solutions were mixed. After homogenization of the solution containing cations under continuous stirring within 0.5 h, stoichiometric NH4H2PO4 was added. The excess water was evaporated at 80 °C to produce a viscous gel. This gel was heated at 200 °C in air more than 10 h to obtain a black solid that was ground into powder called “the precursor” by ball milling. The as-prepared precursors were maintained at 600 °C for 1 h and progressively heated to 900 °C (10 h) to get the final finely crystalline white powder products.

Chemical lithiation was carried out using nBu-Li (2.5 m in hexane) in an argon filled glovebox. The white Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 powder sample is taken in a wide-mouth bottle, and an excess amount nBu-Li solution was added. Keep the wide-mouth bottle airtight and take outside the glovebox. The contents of the wide-mouth bottle were kept under constant stirring for more than 1 d. The compounds were recovered by vacuum filtration, repeatedly washed with hexane, and alcohol in air. During this chemical lithiation process, the color of the powder sample changed from white to light yellow.

Sample Characterization: The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for phase identification and structure refinement were collected at ambient temperature by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction using BL14B1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, Shanghai, China) and the wavelength of X-rays employed is 1.2398 Å. BL14B1 is a bending magnet beamline and the storage ring energy of SSRF is 3.5 GeV. The beam is first collimated using a Rh/Si mirror and then is monochromatized using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator.

After that, the beam is further focused by an Rh/Si mirror to the size of 0.5 mm ⫻ 0.5 mm. Higher order harmonics are also reflected by the Rh/Si mirror. NaI scintillation detector was used for data collection. The morphology was determined by using field emission scanning electron (FE-SEM) (JEOL JSM-6700F) microscopies. Magnetization measurements (field cooling) were performed with a physical property measurement system (PPMS) at applied fields (H) up to 1000 Oe. The ex-situ XANES studies were performed at BL14W1 of SSRF and a Si (111) double crystal monochromator, cooled by liquid nitrogen, was employed to monochromatize the energy. The measurements were performed using transmission mode. The XANES data were analyzed using the Athena program of IFEFFIT for background removal, E0 selection and normalization, etc.[25] UV/Vis emission and excitation spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotometer. The VUV/UV excitation spectra and the VUV excited emission spectra were measured at the VUV spectroscopy station of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The electron energy of the storage ring is 2.5 GeV and the beam current is from approximately 160 to 60 mA in measurement. An ARC-VM-502-S monochromator (1200 g·mm–1) was used for the excitation spectra; an ARC SP-308 monochromator (1200 g·mm–1) for the emission spectra and the signal was detected by a Hamamatsu H7421–50 photomultiplier. The pressure in the sample chamber was 2 ⫻ 10–5 mbar. The resolution of the instruments is about 0.2 nm. The relative VUV/UV excitation intensities of the samples were corrected by comparing the measured excitation intensities of the samples with the sodium salicylate (o-HOC6H4COONa) in the same excitation conditions. The transient decays measurements of the obtained phosphors were recorded with an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorimeter equipped with both continuous (450 W) and pulsed xenon or hydrogen lamps. All of the luminescence spectra were recorded at room temperature.
