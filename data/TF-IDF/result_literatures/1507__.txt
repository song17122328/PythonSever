Tetravalent hafnium ion conducting solid electrolytes with a NASICON-type structure, HfNbP3¹xVxO12 and Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12, were developed by partially replacing the P5+ site in a HfNb(PO4)3 solid with larger V5+ or W6+ ions. Although the Hf4+ ion conductivity monotonically increased with increasing V content in the HfNbP3¹xVxO12 solids, the electronic conduction appeared to be due to the valence change of V5+. In contrast, the Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 series maintained a high ionic transference number, above 0.995 for single-phase NASICON-type samples (y ¯ 0.15). The optimum lattice volume for Hf4+ conduction was determined to be 1.482 nm3, which was obtained for samples with x = 0.1 or y = 0.05. The Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid, which contains the higher valence W6+ ion rather than the V5+ ion, showed the highest conductivity of 2.8 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 600 °C, approximately 2.5 times that of HfNb(PO4)3.

Solid electrolytes are unique functional materials, in that the solid generally conducts only a single ionic species and shows no electron or hole conduction. Some solid electrolytes have already been commercialized as components of battery and chemical sensing devices.1,2 In these electrolytes, it is believed that the ion conduction in the solids greatly depends on their valence state. For example, ion conductivity decreases with increasing valence of the conducting ion. While ion conductivities high enough for practical application have been obtained for various mono-, di-, and trivalent ions, higher valence tetravalent cations have been regarded as extremely poor migrating species in solids, due to the extraordinarily strong electrostatic interaction between the tetravalent cation and the surrounding anions, which inhibits ionic conduction in the solid lattice. To realize tetravalent cationic conduction in a solid requires not only a suitable crystal structure, but the constituent ions must also be able to reduce the strong electrostatic interaction. One eﬀective method of weakening this interaction is the introduction of pentavalent or higher valence cations into the structure. Such cations may attract anions more strongly than the tetravalent cations, enabling tetravalent cation migration in the solid lattice.

In our previous work, we successfully developed pure Zr4+ or Hf4+ ion conducting MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf)3­6 solids based on the above concept. These solids contained pentavalent Nb5+ and P5+, and had a NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor)-type structure, which is well known to be a threedimensional network suitable for ion migration.7 Furthermore, the Hf4+ ion conductivity we have also demonstrated that was higher than the Zr4+ ion conductivity in NASICON-type MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf) solids.

In this study, the tetravalent Hf4+ ion conductivity in a NASICON-type solid was enhanced by an intentional expansion of the lattice volume of the HfNb(PO4)3 solid by doping large cations into the structure. This expanded the conducting pathway, which improved the ion conduction in the solid. We selected V5+ (ionic radius: 0.050 nm [coordination number (CN) = 4]8) and W6+ (0.056 nm [CN = 4]8) as the large cation for the partial replacement of the P5+ (0.031 nm [CN = 4]8) sites, and investigated the electrical conductivity of HfNbP3¹xVxO129 and Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids.

A conventional solid-state reaction was applied to prepare HfNbP3¹xVxO12 and Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids. HfNbP3¹xVxO12 was synthesized by heating a stoichiometric mixture of HfO2, Nb2O5, V2O5, and (NH4)2HPO4 at 1100 °C for 12 h and then 1200 °C for 12 h in synthetic air (N2:O2 = 79:21).9 For Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids, stoichiometric amounts of Hf(SO4)2, Nb2O5, WO3, and (NH4)2HPO4 powders were mixed in an agent pot at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 3 h using a planetary ball milling apparatus (Pulverisette 7, FRITSCH GmbH). The mixed powder was calcined at 600 °C for 6 h, 1200 °C for 12 h, and 1300 °C for 12 h in synthetic air. The samples obtained were identiﬁed by X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) analysis using Cu K¡ radiation (MultiFlex, Rigaku). The XRD data were collected by step scanning in the 2ª range from 10 to 70° with a step width of 0.04°. The lattice volume of the samples was calculated from the XRD peak angles, which were reﬁned using ¡-Al2O3 as a standard. After identifying the crystal phase of the samples, the sample powders were pressed into a pellet and sintered at 1200 °C (HfNbP3¹xVxO12) or 1300 °C (Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12) for 12 h in air.

The AC conductivity (·AC) of the sintered sample pellets with a platinum layer sputtered on both center surfaces was measured by complex impedance method in the frequency region from 5 Hz to 13 MHz (precision LCR meter 4192A, Hewlett Packard) at temperatures between 300 and 600 °C in an air atmosphere (oxygen pressure [Po2] = 2.1 © 104 Pa). The ionic transference number (tion) in air was calculated from the equation, tion = 1 ¹ (·DC/·AC). the DC conductivity (·DC) was measured from the DC Here, voltage over the sample generated by passing a DC current of 1 ¯A between platinum electrodes sandwiching the sintered pellet. The DC electrolysis of the sintered Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 pellet was carried out by applying a DC voltage of 4 V between ion-blocking platinum bulk electrodes at 800 °C for 336 h in atmospheric air. The cathodic surface of the electrolyzed sample pellet was analyzed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA-1500, Shimadzu).

The relative density of the sintered sample was measured by pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Shimadzu).


XRD patterns of the HfNbP3¹xVxO129 and Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids are shown in Figure 1. Although samples with x ¯ 0.3 maintained a single phase of NASICON-type structure in HfNbP3¹xVxO12 solids, the sample with x = 0.45 was a twophase mixture of NASICON-type phosphate and HfP2O7. On the other hand, the Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids possessed a single phase of NASICON-type structure in the compositional region of y ¯ 0.15, while samples with y > 0.15 had a multiphase mixture of NASICON-type phosphate, HfP2O7, and NbPO5. Figure 2 depicts the compositional dependence of the lattice volume of the NASICON-type phase in the prepared samples. A linear lattice expansion of the NASICON-type phase was clearly observed within the single-phase regions of both series (x ¯ 0.3 or y ¯ 0.15). No meaningful lattice expansion of the NASICON-type phase for samples with x > 0.3 or y > 0.15 was observed, compared with the lattice volume of samples with x = 0.3 or y = 0.15, respectively. the HfNbP2.7V0.3O12 Furthermore, (x = 0.3) and Hf385/400NbP2.85W0.15O12 (y = 0.15) solids, with compositions at the solid solubility limit for each series, were nearly identical (ca. 1.489 nm3). These results clearly indicate that larger V5+ (ionic radius: 0.050 nm [CN = 4]8) or W6+ (0.056 nm [CN = 4]8) ions successfully replaced the P5+ (0.031 nm [CN = 4]8) sites in the HfNb(PO4)3 solid when x ¯ 0.3 or y ¯ 0.15, respectively.

Figure 3 presents the compositional dependencies of the AC conductivity and the ionic transference number (tion = 1 ¹ (·DC/·AC)) at 600 °C for the HfNbP3¹xVxO12 (0 ¯ x ¯ 0.45)9 and Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 (0 ¯ y ¯ 0.2) solids in an air atmosphere (Po2 = 2.1 © 104 Pa). The ion transference number was estimated from the ·DC/·AC ratio after 30 min. In the single-phase region of NASICON-type Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 (0 ¯ y ¯ 0.15), the conductivity increased with the W content (y) up to 0.05, due to expansion of the lattice volume, in other words, the Hf4+ conducting pathway (Hf4+ ion conduction is demonstrated below). Although the lattice volume of samples with y > 0.05 expanded linearly up to y = 0.15, the conductivity decreased because a lattice volume too large for Hf4+ ion conduction was reached. If a solid has a larger than optimal lattice volume for Hf4+ ion conduction, the Hf4+ ion cannot be located at the center of the ideal Hf site while surrounded by O2¹ ions, because of the resulting elongation of Hf4+­O2¹ bonds. Therefore, Hf4+ ions will be preferentially situated near certain O2¹ ions, generating strong electrostatic interactions which prevent smooth Hf4+ migration. Figure 3 indicates that the lattice volumes of Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids with y > 0.05 were too large to realize smooth Hf4+ ion conduction, and that the optimum lattice volume (ca. 1.482 nm3) for Hf4+ ion conduction in NASICON-type solids was obtained in Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 (y = 0.05). the suitable lattice volume for Hf4+ ion conduction in a NASICON-type structure is ca. 1.482 nm3, then HfNbP2.9V0.1O12 (x = 0.1) with a lattice volume of 1.482 nm3 should have the highest conductivity of the HfNbP3¹xVxO12 series. However, the conductivity of increased monotonically with increasing HfNbP3¹xVxO12 vanadium content (x). Since the ionic transference number of HfNbP3¹xVxO12 monotonously decreased with x, the linear enhancement of AC conductivity by HfNbP3¹xVxO12 solids was caused by electronic conduction because of the valence change of V5+. On the other hand, the Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 solids maintained high ionic transference numbers, above 0.995 for single phase NASICON-type samples with y ¯ 0.15, while the ionic transference number of Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 (y > 0.05) slightly decreased with increasing y. This reduction of in the Hf1¹y/4NbP3¹yWyO12 (y > 0.05) solids was mainly due to the decrease of ionic conductivity caused by having a lattice size too large for ion conduction.

In order to directly demonstrate Hf4+ ion conduction in a Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid, which had the highest conductivity and the highest ionic transference number of the prepared solids, DC electrolysis was carried out by applying a DC voltage of 4 V for 336 h at 800 °C, as shown in Figure 4a. From preliminary investigation of the I­V relationship of the sample, it was found that the DC current abruptly increased over ca. 1.2 V, suggesting that the sample began to decompose around 1.2 V. When applying a DC voltage higher than the decomposition voltage, conducting cations generated by sample decomposition on the anodic side should migrate toward the cathode along the potential gradient. Since the cationic species cannot enter the ion-blocking Pt bulk electrode, they should segregate on the cathodic surface of the sample pellet. After DC electrolysis, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) line measurement was performed for electrolyzed Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solids (Figure 4b). Only Hf segregation was clearly observed near the cathodic surface, although the other cationic elements were homogeneously distributed within the sample, even after the DC electrolysis. This strongly indicates that only Hf4+ was conducted by the sample, and that the present Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid is a pure Hf4+ ion conductor (tion = 0.999).

The temperature dependence of tetravalent Hf4+ ion conductivity in Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid (tion = 0.999) is presented in Figure 5, along with the corresponding data for HfNb(PO4)3 (tion = 0.998) and HfNbP2.9V0.1O12 (tion = 0.997). Although the Hf4+ ion conductivity of HfNbP2.9V0.1O12 and Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12, whose lattice volumes (1.482 nm3) (1.478 nm3) of HfNb(PO4)3, were were larger successfully enhanced by lattice expansion, the Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid exhibited a higher Hf4+ ion conductivity. Because the valence of the V5+ ion is the same as that of the P5+ ion in the HfNb(PO4)3 solid, the enhancement in conductivity of the HfNbP2.9V0.1O12 solid must have been mainly because of the expansion of the conducting pathway for Hf4+ ions into the NASICON-type structure. Therefore, the further enhancement of conductivity realized in Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 was most likely due to the eﬀective reduction of the electrostatic interaction between the conducting Hf4+ cation and the surrounding O2¹ anions, which was caused by the higher valence of the W6+ ion compared to the V5+ ion. Although it is well known that the ion conduction is also inﬂuenced by the sample sinterability for the polycrystalline sample, the relative density of both samples are the same (0.99), suggesting that the main factor for higher conductivity of the Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 is the higher valence state of W6+ compared to V5+. From these results, it is clear that the hexavalent W6+ ion is a suitable dopant into the P5+ site for the realization of pure, high Hf4+ ion conduction in NASICON-type HfNb(PO4)3. The conductivity of Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 was approximately 2.5 times that of HfNb(PO4)3 at 600 °C.

Highly Hf4+ ion conductive solid electrolytes were successfully developed by intentionally expanding the Hf4+ ion conducting pathway in a NASICON-type solid by the partial substitution of the P5+ site in HfNb(PO4)3 by larger W6+ or V5+ ions. Although the Hf4+ ion conductivities for both HfNbP2.9V0.1O12 and Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solids, which lattice volume (1.482 nm3) for Hf4+ ion had the optimal migration, were higher than that of HfNb(PO4)3, Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid in which the P5+ site was partially replaced with higher valence W6+ ions possessed the highest ionic transference number and the highest Hf4+ ion conductivity of the samples prepared. This was due to an eﬀective reduction of the electrostatic interaction between Hf4+ cations and the surrounding O2¹ anions. As a result, the W6+ ion is a superior dopant cation for the enhancement of Hf4+ ion conductivity in NASICON-type HfNb(PO4)3, which has no electronic conduction, and the Hf395/400NbP2.95W0.05O12 solid was about 2.5 times as conductive as HfNb(PO4)3.
