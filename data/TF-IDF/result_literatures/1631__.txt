Trivalent rare earth ion conductors of the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 (R: rare earths) series with NASICON-type structures were successfully prepared and the optimum size of ion-conducting pathways for rare earth ions in (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids was investigated.
The most suitable ion-conducting pathway for rare earth ion conduction in this series was realized for R ¬º Dy and the highest conductivity of 3:2  10 4 S cm 1 at 600 C was obtained for (Dy0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids.
Since R3√æ ion conduction was strongly dependent on the ratio of conducting R3√æ ion size to crystal lattice size (VR3√æ=Vlattice; we denote this ratio as A ratio in this article), it was clear that the A ratio is a key factor to optimize R3√æ ion conduction in NASICON-type structures.
Solid electrolyte is a functional material in which only single ion species conduct in solids accompanying electric charge.
This is diÔ¨Äerent from electronic conducting solids such as metals and semiconductors whose charge carrier is electrons or holes.
Because of this outstanding characteristic, solid electrolytes are greatly expected to be applied to various kinds of electrochemical devices such as chemical sensors and all solidstate-type rechargeable batteries.
 Up to now, many kinds of monoand divalent ion conducting solids have been developed, and among them, Na√æ ion conducting -alumina and O2  ion conducting yttria-stabilized zirconia have been already commercialized as key components of Na/S batteries (sodium/sulfur batteries, which consist of sodium at the negative electrode and sulfur at the positive electrode separated by a -alumina solid electrolyte) for electric power storage and oxygen sensors for vehicle emission control, respectively.
In contrast, trivalent ions have been regarded as poor migrant species in solids because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the trivalent ion and the lattice forming anions surrounding the trivalent ion.
In order to realize trivalent ion conduction in solids, the framework of the solid electrolyte should possess a large conducting pathway enough for migration of the relatively bulky trivalent ion.
In addition, it is also necessary to reduce the above-mentioned strong electrostatic interaction by introducing higher valence cations than the trivalent state into the structure.
Furthermore, contamination by cations lower than trivalent should be avoided because monoor divalent cations can easily migrate in solids compared with the target trivalent cations.
Since 1999, pure trivalent cation conducting R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 (R ¬º Sc, Y, and Eu‚ÄìLu)solid electrolytes with a NASICON8 (Na√æ super ionic conductor, which is a tailored solid electrolyte and has a three-dimensional network structure where PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra are linked by sharing corner oxygens) structure have been successfully developedby the above-described concepts.
Although the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids contain high-valence cations of Zr4√æ and P5√æ and have NASICON-type structures, their trivalent ion conductivities in R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids are considerably lower than those of commercially available divalent oxide anion conductors such as yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and calcia-stabilized zirconia (CSZ) due to low crystallinity which results from low thermal stability (the decomposition temperature of the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids: ca.
950 C), indicating that they are not satisfactory for practical application.
Moreover, the single phase of the NASICON-type R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids were obtained for only some rare earth ions with small ionic radius (0.0885‚Äì0.1087 nm).
Recently, we have successfully improved trivalent rare earth R3√æ ion conduction in NASICON-type solids for solids,whose electrostatic interaction between the conducting trivalent R3√æ ion and the surrounding oxide anions was intentionally reduced by additionally introducing a pentavalent Nb5√æ cation into the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 framework as the constituent high-valent cation.
These solids exhibited considerably high-trivalent R3√æ ion conductivity, which was comparable to those of the representative divalent oxide anion conductors of YSZ and CSZ.
However, while a few light rare earth ion species have been demonstrated to migrate in solids, heavy rare earth ion conducting solid electrolytes have not been obtained for this composition  because the ionic size of heavy rare earths are too small to hold the single phase of the NASICON structure in this composition and the resulting materials were usually a multi-phase mixture of NASICON-type solids, NbPO5, and RPO4.
In this study, for the purpose of systematically investigating the trivalent ion conducting characteristics in NASICON-type solids, we have synthesized a single phase of NASICON-type (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 (R = rare earths: Sc, Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, and Lu) solids, whose conducting trivalent cation species were from the smallest Sc3√æ to the largest La3√æ, by reducing the rare earth ion concentration (x) from 0.1 to 0.05 in (RxZr1 x)4=√∞4 x√ûNb(PO4)3, and ion conducting properties in the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series were studied.
Starting materials were mixed in an agate pot at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 6 h by ball milling (Pulverisette 7, FRITSCH GmbH).
The mixed powder was pelletized and heated at 600 C for 12 h, and then 1300 C for 12 h in air.
The resulting powder was made into pellets and sintered on an alumina plate at 1300 C for 12 h in air.
The samples obtained were identiÔ¨Åed by X-ray powder diÔ¨Äraction (XRD) using Cu K radiation (MultiFlex, Rigaku).
The lattice parameters were calculated by reÔ¨Åning the XRD patterns using -Al2O3 standard powder.
Thermogravimetric and diÔ¨Äerential thermal analysis measurements (TG-DTA, DTG-50H, Shimadzu) were performed with a heating rate of 3 C min 1. 
Electrical conductivity of the samples was measured by an ac method, using the sintered sample pellet with two Pt electrodes.
The ac conductivity measurement was performed by a complex impedance method using a Precision LCR meter (4192A, Hewlett Packard) in a frequency range between 5 Hz and 13 MHz at temperatures from 600 to 300 C in air.
All (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 (R ¬º Sc, Y, La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Ho, and Lu) solids prepared were conÔ¨Årmed to possess the same single-phase rhombohedral (R33c) NASICON-type structure as NaZr2(PO4)3 (typical NASICON-type Na√æ ion conductor) from XRD analysis.
The lattice volumes of all samples are depicted in Figure 1 as a function of trivalent ionic radius.
The lattice volume monotonically expands with increasing R3√æ ionic radius, indicating formation of a solid solution.

These results show that NASICON-type (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids were successfully obtained for a series of rare earth ions from the smallest Sc3√æ to the largest La3√æ while the conducting ion species in the conventional trivalent ion conductors R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 and (R0:1Zr0:9)40=39Nb(PO4)3 were limited to heavy or light rare earth ions, respectively.
From the thermogravimetric analysesthe (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series, all the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids were found to be stable up to 1300 C, the same as the previously reported (R0:1Zr0:9)40=39Nb(PO4)3 series.
 Since the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids decomposed at ca.
950 C, it was clear that the thermal stability of the NASICON-type trivalent rare earth cation conductors was greatly improved by introducing the pentavalent Nb5√æ cation into the lattice, which caused the formation of strong bonds between Nb5√æ cation and the lattice forming O2  anions.
Figure 2 shows the trivalent ionic radius dependence of the A ratio (VR3√æ=Vlattice)14 for the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids, which is deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of the migrating trivalent cation volume (VR3√æ) to the crystal lattice volume (Vlattice).
The corresponding data of conventional NASICON-type R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 solids are also depicted in the same Ô¨Ågure.
The A ratios monotonically decrease with reducing trivalent ionic radius for both series, and the values are almost the same for each trivalent R3√æ ion species.
Furthermore, change in A ratio slope for both series is also the same, which indicates that similar lattice volume change occurs for both series by changing R3√æ ionic size.
These phenomena appear by the countervailing eÔ¨Äect of lattice shrinkage by substituting the Zr4√æ (0.086 nm; 6-coordinate)15 site with smaller Nb5√æ (0.078 nm; 6-coordinate)15 in the solid and lattice expansion due to the decrease of R‚ÄìO bonding that is caused by the reduction of R3√æ cation concentration.
The A ratio dependencies of the conductivity at 600 C and R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 for series are depicted in Figure 3a.
The conductivity of the ((R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids depends on the A ratio (VR3√æ=Vlattice) and (Dy0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 (A ratio = 3:29  10 3) shows the highest conductivity of 3:2  10 4 S cm 1 among the samples prepared.
For A ratio regions smaller than that of R ¬º Dy, the trivalent R3√æ ion conducting pathway, which is strongly related to lattice volume, becomes larger with decreasing A ratio.
In such a large conducting pathway, the R3√æ ion cannot be located at the center of the ion pathway by the strong electrostatic interaction with the nearest lattice-forming oxide anions, resulting in the decrease of ion conduction.
On the other hand, with increasing the A ratio from Dy3√æ to La3√æ, the conductivity decreased due to contraction of the trivalent ion conducting pathway.
From this result, it becomes clear that the most suitable A ratio for trivalent R3√æ ion conduction in the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series is obtained for R ¬º Dy.
In contrast, the optimum A ratio for trivalent R3√æ ion conduction is realized for R ¬º Sc in the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 series, which has a smaller ionic radius than Dy3√æ.
In the case of the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 series, the highest ion conductivity was obtained for the smallest Sc3√æ due to the small bottleneck which is caused by the strong R‚ÄìO bonds in the NASICON-type framework.
On the other hand, for the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series, the R‚ÄìO bonds were weakened by the high-valent Nb5√æ cation in the R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 lattice, resulting in enlargement of the bottleneck.
Furthermore, as we described before, lowering the R3√æ concentration also help to enlarge the bottleneck, and the most suitable interaction between R3√æ and O2  was obtained for the larger ion species of Dy3√æ compared to Sc3√æ.
As a result, the trivalent Dy3√æ ion can be located at the center of the ion pathway, achieving the most suitable ion conducting circumstance for R ¬º Dy in the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series.
Figure 3b presents the A ratio dependencies of the activation energies (Ea) for ion conduction for the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 and R1=3Zr2(PO4)3 series, which are calculated from the log√∞T√û‚Äì1=T relationship.
Since the (Dy0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solid possesses the lowest activation energy in addition to the highest ion conductivity in the NASICON-type (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series, the Dy3√æ ion is in such a cir-cumstance to conduct most smoothly in solids.
This result clearly supports the idea that the optimum ion conducting pathway in the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series was obtained for R ¬º Dy.
Furthermore, although the R3√æ ion concentration in (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series is lower than that in R1=3Zr2(PO4)3, the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 series shows both higher conductivity and lower Ea.
These results indicate that the R3√æ ion conduction in the (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids becomes easier by introducing the high-valent Nb5√æ ion in the crystal lattice, which can reduce the electrostatic interaction between R3√æ and O2  ions.
Trivalent rare earth ion conducting NASICON-type (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 (R: rare earths) solid electrolytes were successfully developed for a variety of rare earth ions from the smallest Sc3√æ to the largest La3√æ.
Among the NASICONtype (R0:05Zr0:95)80=79Nb(PO4)3 solids, the most suitable trivalent rare earth ion conducting pathway was found to be obtained for R ¬º Dy from the relationship between the A ratio (VR3√æ=Vlattice) and the trivalent R3√æ ion conductivity.
Since the R3√æ ion conductivity depends on the A ratio, the A ratio is one of the key factors to optimize the individual ion conduction in the NASICON-type phosphate series.
