The silver±hafnium phosphate (AgHf2(PO4)3), belonging to the Nasicon-type structure, was synthesized by a sol±gel method and characterized by several techniques. The Ag cations were found to be, as in zeolite frameworks, easy to reduce to metallic silver. This reduction was investigated by STEM/EDX which showed that, under an intense electron beam, the Ag ions diuse toward the surface of the sample and form metallic particles of sizes varying from 3 to 15 nm. The X-ray diraction patterns con®rmed that the reduction does not damage the phosphate structure. The Ag ions were replaced in the structure by protons giving rise to (PO±H) acid groups.

The catalytic behavior of AgHf2(PO4)3 was studied in butan-2-ol conversion. In the absence of O2, the reaction leads to an abrupt decrease of the dehydrogenation activity and a dehydration reaction that reaches a pseudo-stationary state. Concomittantly, the Ag cations are reduced to Ag0. In the presence of O2, the dehydrogenation reaction undergoes a complex transitory state which can be decomposed into two steps. During the ®rst one, the activity decreases in concert with the reduction of Ag ions. In the second step it increases as the amount of oxidized silver species (AgxOy), which are the active sites for the alcohol dehydrogenation, increases. UV±VIS characterization of AgHf2(PO4)3 in dynamic conditions similar to those used in the catalytic tests con®rmed that butan-2-ol reduces Ag ions to metallic silver which, in the presence of O2 in the reaction mixture, are oxidized to (AgxOy).

The Nasicon-type phosphates (Na super-ionic conductors) denomination covers a large family of materials that are crystallographically related to Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The basic structure of these compounds was ®rst described by Hagman and Kierkegaard [1]. It derives from NaZr2(PO4)3 and can be formula M0M00(PO4)3. These phosphates have been widely studied in many ®elds for their various properties such as their conductivity, low expansion coecients, ceramics and catalysis [2,3]. Their ¯exible structure can easily accommodate on sites M0 and

This metal is next to Pd in the periodic table and is consequently expected to exhibit analogous chemical properties. Moreover, the catalytic activity of both metals was shown to depend on their morphological characteristics. The literature has reported that the size of the silver crystallites aects their reactivity and selectivity in ethylene epoxidation. It is also believed that these size-dependent properties are closely related to the dierent oxygen species that might exist on Ag0 [8]. The role played by all these parameters in the catalytic behavior of silver is not completely understood as yet. Recent studies of transition metal phosphates such as M0Zr2(PO4)3 (where M0  Cu, Cu2 or Ag) showed that the cations hosted by the M0 sites can be reversibly reduced without damaging the structure. The resulting loaded metallic particles on the phosphate exhibited an oscillatory activity during propylene oxidation into acrolein when the ratio O2/C3H6 exceeded 10 [9]. A similar behavior was observed with CuIZr2(PO4)3 in the butan-2-ol conversion. The phenomenon was attributed to the kinetic competition between the redox processes that the loaded copper particles undergo during the reaction [10].

The present work is devoted to the characterization and the study of the catalytic properties of the new phase silver±hafnium phosphate (AgHf2(PO4)3) in butan-2-ol conversion. X-ray diraction (XRD), IR, 31P-NMR and STEM/EDX analysis were performed to trace, in the phosphate, the mobility of Ag ions and relate their behavior to

the catalytic activity. 

AgHf2(PO4)3 was synthesized by a sol±gel technique which allows to precipitate an amorphous precursor that leads to a monophasic composition at temperatures lower than those of the conventional solid state preparations. Aqueous solutions of hafnium chloride (HfCl4), silver nitrate (AgNO3) and ammonium phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) were mixed in stoichiometric proportions. The gelatinous precipitate formed was kept under stirring for 2 h, then dried at 120°C until the complete evaporation of water. The recovered solid was heated progressively, with intermittent grinding, up to 500°C and ®nally calcined at 900°C for 24 h. The AgHf2(PO4)3 obtained was white in color. Its speci®c surface area measured by N2 adsorption at  196°C was 7.6 m2 g 1.

For comparison purposes the phase NaHf2 (PO4)3 was also prepared by precipitation using aqueous solutions of HfCl4 and NaHPO4. The phase AgZr2(PO4)3 was obtained by an analogous method described elsewhere [11].

XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on a Siemens 500 high-resolution diractometer using monochromatic CuKa1 (k  1:540598) radiation. Silver titration was performed by a potentiometric method after dissolving the sample in HCl and adding a solution of NH4SCN (0.1 N). The amount of phosphorus was determined by UV± VIS spectrometry at k  440 nm. Hafnium was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy after dissolution of the AgHf2(PO4)3 in HCl (1.2 N).

IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin±Elmer 750 FTIR spectrometer using KBr disks contain-ing 1±3 wt.% of the phosphate. This technique was principally employed to verify the absence of pyrophosphates (P2O7)4  which are characterized by a P±O±P vibration located around 725 cm 1.

31P-MAS-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker MSL 300 spectrometer operated at 121.5 MHz. The chemical shifts were measured using H3PO4 as the reference.

Micrographs of the sample were taken with a JEOL-JEM 100CX transmission electronic microscope (TEM) equipped with a high resolution analyzer (EDX). The observations were carried out after phosphate dispersion on a graphite grill. UV±VIS spectra were recorded at dierent temperatures with a Varian Cary 5 spectrometer. The experiments were performed in situ in a special accessory manufactured by Harrick and referred to as the praying mantis or diuse re¯ection attachment (DRA) [12]. It is constituted of two ellipsoidal mirrors that capture the diuse component of the re¯ected light [13]. The DRA also includes a stainless-steel chamber equipped with quartz windows and openings to supply and evacuate gases. This chamber was used as the catalytic reactor. The temperature of the sample was monitored by a Harrick ATC-30D programmer. The thermocouple was positioned above the sample. The reference lines of the spectra were recorded at dierent working temperatures using BaSO4.

The catalytic tests were carried out in a Ushaped dynamic micro-reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst AgHf2(PO4)3 was sieved to 120 lm and maintained in the reactor between two quartz wool plugs. The butan-2-ol was supplied to the reactor diluted in nitrogen or air at a partial pressure equal to 8:4  102 Pa and at a total ¯ow rate of 60 cm3 min 1. Prior to the reaction, 100 mg of the sample was evacuated for 2 h at 300°C under a pure stream of N2.

Analysis of the reaction mixture was performed by an on-line Varian 3600 chromatograph equipped with an FID and catharometer detectors. The reaction products were identi®ed and separated on 4 m (1/8 in.) stainless-steel columns packed with

carbowax 1500 (15%) on chromosorb PAW (60/80 mesh) and Porapak Q.

The catalyst activity was calculated in terms of percentages of butan-2-ol converted into butenes (aene), methyl ethyl ketone (aone) and carbon dioxide (aCO2

XRD patterns of AgHf2(PO4)3 displayed in Fig. 1 show that the phosphate is isostructural with the Nasicon-type materials with the formula M0M00(PO4)3, where M0 is generally a monoor a di-valent cation. It crystallizes in the rhombohedral system and belongs to the R 3 c space group (Z  6). The crystallographic parameters of the

The real composition of the AgHf2(PO4)3 synthesized was determined by chemical analysis and electronic microscopy (EDX-STEM). Table 1 summarizes the results and shows that the composition of the sample is in agreement with the formula AgHf2(PO4)3. Under an intense electronic beam AgHf2(PO4)3 shows the same behavior as AgZr2(PO4)  3 and AgTi2(PO4)3. Crystallites of silver with homogeneous distribution and sizes varying between 3 and 15 nm were observed to appear on the phosphate surface (Fig. 2). The particle dimensions increase

The catalytic activity of AgHf2(PO4)3 in butan2-ol conversion was measured as a function of time at dierent temperatures and in the absence of oxygen in the reaction mixture. The conversion to methyl ethyl ketone decreased rapidly from 12% to a pseudo-stationary value and remained around 1% independently of the reaction temperature (Fig. 4). The butenes production also decreased, but less abruptly. For instance, at 240°C it decreased from 60% to 30% (Fig. 5). The selectivity, at all temperatures, was in favor of the dehydration reaction. A comparison of the performance of AgHf2(PO4)3 with that of AgZr2(PO4)3 showed that AgHf2(PO4)3 was as a whole, more active than the silver±zirconium phosphate. The dehydration activity of AgHf2(PO4)3 was higher than that of AgZr2(PO4)3, presumably because hafnium enhances the acid properties of the phosphate more strongly than zirconium. Moreover, as will be shown later, the catalytic reaction was accompanied by a reduction of Ag ions and an intercalation of protons in the lattice in order to balance the negative charge of the framework. These protons enhanced the acidity of the catalyst by forming PO±H groups which were the active sites for the dehydration reaction. Their eciency probably depends on their location. Those exchanged in the bulk of the phosphate are not accessible to the reactants and do not intervene in the dehydration reaction.

Substitution of N2 by air in the reaction mixture resulted in a complex behavior. The dehydrogenation activity dropped rapidly in the beginning of the reaction like it did previously in the absence of O2. After going through a minimum, it increased towards a maximum and then decreased again to a pseudo-stationary state (Fig. 6). The same transitory behavior was observed at all temperatures. It was associated with the redox changes of the Ag ions in the presence of the reaction mixture. The duration of the transitory state increased as the reaction temperature was increased. The minimum conversion surprisingly decreased when the temperature was increased. Alcohol conversion to carbon dioxide varied between 1.1% and 6.6% in the temperature range investigated. Concurrently, the dehydration also depended on the reaction temperature. Below 200°C it decreased continuously and above, after going through a minimum, it increased (Fig. 7). As a whole, the addition of O2 to the reaction mixture improved the conversion, particularly the dehydrogenation activity. Both phosphates AgHf2(PO4)3 and AgZr2(PO4)3 exhibited comparable activities [3]. However, the shape and the length of their transitory states, which constituted the response of the phosphate structures to the reaction mixture, diered.

The in¯uence of the oxygen concentration on the activity was studied at 220°C. Fig. 8 reports the results achieved in the pseudo-stationary states. In the range 0±2.5 vol.%, the dehydrogenation activity increased rapidly and then decreased slowly. Above 2.5 vol.%, O2 had a minor in¯uence on the activity. The reaction became of zero order with respect to oxygen. Production of carbon dioxide only started at high O2 concentrations but never

activity reached is comparable to that previously obtained when air is present in the reaction mixture at the start of the reaction. In addition, the transitory state that was previously described disappeared. Simultaneously, as expected, the dehydration activity decreased. If the oxygen is again replaced by N2, the dehydrogenation activity drops abruptly while the dehydration increases and the phosphate recovers approximately all of its initial catalytic features.

XRD patterns of the sample recorded after the catalytic tests did not show any modi®cation of the phosphate structure (see Fig. 1a).

In order to trace the catalyst modi®cations while it is working, in situ UV±VIS spectroscopic investigations were carried out under experimental conditions similar to those used for the catalytic tests. The same reaction temperature, gas ¯ow and composition were realized, but the conversion achieved was slightly lower than the one obtained in the catalytic tests, probably due to the reactor design. Fig. 10 displays the spectra recorded at

220°C versus time in the presence of a feed stream free of oxygen (butan-2-ol/N2). The spectrum of the fresh phosphate (Fig. 10a) exhibits only a band located at 249.2 nm which is attributed to charge transfers from oxygen to hafnium O2  ! Hf 4 and oxygen to silver O2  ! Ag. The band that characterizes the electronic transitions 4d101S ! 4d95s13D of isolated Ag ions normally appears around 220 nm. In the case of AgHf2(PO4)3, it is overlapped by the luminescence emission of the phosphate. After 25 min on stream, the spectrum showed two new overlapping bands centered on 372 and 428 nm, respectively. They can be attributed to the appearance of metallic silver particles of dierent sizes dispersed on the surface of the phosphate [16,17]. The reduction of Ag ions occurs concurrently to butan-2-ol dehydrogenation. The kinetics of this reduction seem to be quite fast since only a few minutes are required for the emergence of silver crystallite bands in the spectrum. The intensity of the band due to the Ag electronic transitions (220 nm) increased slightly over time as the luminescence emission of the sample decreased. A similar behavior was reported in the literature for silver±zirconium phosphates and zeolites [3,5]. After 2 h on stream, the spectrum showed a decrease of the intensity and a slight broadening of the bands. This decrease is probably due to the agglomeration of silver particles.

Fig. 11 displays the in situ UV±VIS spectra of a new sample submitted in the praying mantis to a reaction mixture containing oxygen at 220°C (butan-2-ol/air). The resulting pro®les dier from that recorded in the absence of oxygen. The intensity, wavelength and shape of the bands changed. They all underwent a shift towards the visible region, as the catalyst working time increased. However, their intensity versus time seemed to grow less rapidly than in the absence of O2. The oxidation of silver particles producing (AgxOy) species is not clearly evidenced by the spectra. The reason for that is probably that bulk Ag2O is not detectable by UV±VIS spectroscopy [18]. However, the existence of these (AgxOy) species might be associated with the increase with time on stream of the intensity of the band located at 220 nm. This band contains a contribution of the charge transfer from

the absence of oxygen the dehydrogenation reaction is not purely catalytic. It results from to the exchange of protons between the phosphate and the alcohol and stops once this exchange, which is limited by the silver transfer processes towards the surface, is over. Therefore, AgHf2(PO4)3 having slightly wider conduction channels than AgZr2 (PO4)3 will exhibit a lower apparent activation energy for methyl ethyl ketone production.

The XRD patterns of AgHf2(PO4)3 recorded after the catalytic tests carried out at 220°C did not show any signi®cant modi®cation of the intensity of the peak located at 2h  39°80 attributed to re¯ections on Ag0 (1 1 1) metallic silver (Fig. 1a). This is probably due to the small percentage of silver in the phosphate undetectable by this technique. In the case of AgZr2(PO4)3, such particles were seen by XRD [22]. It was also shown that this phosphate undergoes a protonation evidenced by the appearance in its IR spectrum of a band located at 820 cm 1 and characteristic of PO±H acidic groups [23]. Such a band was not clearly observed with AgHf2(PO4)3. Nevertheless, it is believed that the protonation occurs as illustrated by the following equation:

The protons intercalated increase the acidity of the phosphate framework as well as its activity in butan-2-ol dehydration. This increase was observed during the transitory state, and it coincides with the reduction of Ag ions.

Transition metals are generally used for their hydrogenation and dehydrogenation properties. Metallic silver is an exception. It also exhibits a dehydration activity, presumably because during the reaction it grows sub-surface OH species [24]. However, without oxygen it does not directly catalyze the dehydrogenation of butan-2-ol. Oxygen improves the methyl ethyl ketone production and instigates a transitory state which might be decomposed into two stages. In the ®rst one, the activity decreases and is associated with the rapid reduction of Ag ions. This step is not a catalytic one since it only involves an irreversible electronic exchange between the alcohol and the silver cations as illustrated by Eq. (3):

oxygen to silver cations O2  ! Ag [19]. Therefore, it is obvious that the reducing ability of butan-2-ol, during its conversion, kinetically prevails over the oxygen eect. The latter probably favors the agglomeration process of silver particles [20]. Moreover, the slow decrease of the dehydrogenation activity which was previously observed in the catalytic tests can also be associated with the growth of these particles rather than with a poisoning by coke formation (Fig. 6).

AgHf2(PO4)3 can be easily prepared by coprecipitation. Its characterization showed that it is isostructural with the Nasicon-type phosphates belonging to the R 3 c space group.

· Electron microscopy evidenced that silver cations in the material are mobile and reducible under an electron beam to particles with a size varying between 3 and 15 nm.

· In the absence of oxygen, the AgHf2(PO4)3 activity in the butan-2-ol conversion was found to decrease abruptly. It stops after the total reduction of Ag ions which leads to small silver crystallites dispersed on the surface of the phosphate. Introduction of oxygen in the reaction mixture oxidizes the reduced silver and forms (AgxOy) species that act as the active sites.

· The in situ UV±VIS investigations con®rmed all of the assumptions and evidenced that the morphology of the particles depends on the gas phase composition.

· The in¯uence of the central cation (Hf4) of the phosphate skeleton on the catalytic properties was illustrated by the comparison of the activation energies of the dehydrogenation reaction on AgZr2(PO4)3 and AgHf2(PO4)3.
