The importance of developing solid electrolytes for solid-state batteries attracts great interest in Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type LiTi2(PO4)3 for its high ionic conductivity, excellent stability at high potential and In this study, Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 materials with the formula of great stability in atmosphere. Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) are successfully prepared by hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction (HA-SSR). The inﬂuence of Al3+ doping content on the crystal structure, morphology, ionic conductivity, as well as activation energy of Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 is investigated. Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 powders with well-organized morphology and homogeneous size distribution are successfully achieved. The solid electrolytes prepared with Al3+ doping exhibit larger particle size and higher crystalline property than that of the sample without Al3+ doping. High ionic conductivity (4.63 × 10−4 S cm−1) and low activation energy (0.28 eV) are obtained for the sample with optimum substitution level (x = 0.3, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3); while the bare LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte delivers conductivity of 1.40 × 10−5 S cm−1 and activation energy of 0.38 eV. The signiﬁcantly increased ionic conductivity and reduced activation energy indicate that Al3+ doping is a good strategy to enhance the performance of LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte for solid-state batteries.

Solid-state batteries are considered as one of the most important next-generation technologies for energy storage.

Therefore, it shows high potential for fabricating practical solidstate batteries, including solid-state lithium ion batteries and solid-state lithium (metal) batteries. During the past few years, many attempts are made on solid-state lithium-ion batteries employing of NASICON-type materials as solid electrolytes [9–12]. Naga and Nano reported that NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 is an appropriate solid electrolyte for phosphate-based active materials such as LiCoPO4 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 through sintering process to construct solid-state lithium-ion batteries [10]. Recently, Yu et al. reported a phosphate-based solid-state battery employing LiTi2(PO4)3 as solid electrolyte, Li3V2(PO4)3 as cathode and LiTi2(PO4)3 as anode [12]. As is known, the electrochemical performance of the Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 with Li metal is not stable. A buﬀer layer between Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 solid electrolyte and Li metal in the solid-state lithium (metal) Li/PEO/ Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12/LiCoO2 cell with a high operation voltage of 3.8 V and a high capacity above 150 mAh g−1 at 50 °C [13].

Li/PEO/ also Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 Li/PEO/ Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12/LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 batteries. Recently, Yoon et al. reported a solid-state lithium (metal) battery based on 1 μm LiPON ﬁlm coated on the surface of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 solid electrolyte to prevent direct contact of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 with Li metal [16]. Additionally, NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 is a good Li+ conductivity membrane in lithium-air and lithium‑sulfur batteries to prevent the unwanted reaction of lithium oxidation or suppress the diﬀusion of polysulﬁde [17–19]. NASICONtype LiTi2(PO4)3 as a solid electrolyte for fabricating lithium-ion, lithium-air and lithium-sulfur shows a certain prospect for future application.

As a solid electrolyte suitable for lithium-ion, lithium-air and lithium-sulfur batteries, the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 is required to reach 10−4 S cm−1 magnitude at room temperature. However, it suﬀers a poor ionic conductivity (< 10−6 S cm−1) at room temperature [20,21]. Two strategies are reported to improve the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 ceramic solid electrolyte. First, LiTi2(PO4)3 has been shown to have high ionic conductivity by aliovalent substitution [22–25], which is attributed to the increasing concentrations of Li+ introduced by aliovalent substitution. Second, controlling the grain boundary resistance through adding lithium salts [20,21] or adopting various sintering methods [26–28] can also obtain a high ionic conductivity.

Currently, LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte materials can be synthesized by various synthesis techniques, such as solid-state reaction and wet chemical method (sol-gel method, co-precipitation or hydrothermal reaction) [29]. Solid-state reaction is the most widely used conventional method. However, the particles synthesized by this method show irregular morphology and diﬀerent particle sizes, which are believed to limit its electrochemical performance [30–32]. Hydrothermal method oﬀers an eﬃcient way to produce materials with well-organized morphology and uniform size distribution. Until now, only one work [31] reported the synthesis of LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte materials by hydrothermal method. However, the particle aggregates still exist. In this study, we report a hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction to synthesize Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 materials with the formula of Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4). The morphology, crystalline and electrochemical properties of the prepared samples are investigated and discussed. The highest ionic conductivity has been obtained in Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 solid electrolytes. Solid electrolytes prepared with Al3+ doping have larger particle size and higher crystalline property than that of the sample without Al3+ doping. The highest ionic conductivity (4.63 × 10−4 S cm−1) and the lowest activation energy (0.28 eV) are obtained for the sample with optimum substitution level (x = 0.3, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3).

The thermal gravimetry (TG) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were conducted in air atmosphere at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min on a Mettler-Toledo thermal analyzer (TGA/DSC 1/ 1600, Switzerland). The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a X'Pert PRO diﬀractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10° to 60°. The ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Quanta 250) was used to characterize the morphology and microstructure of all samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed with an Axis ultra spectrometer (Kratos) using Mono Al Kα (1486.71 eV) radiation at the power of 225 W (15 mA, 15 kV). All binding energies of XPS were referenced to the C 1s neutral carbon peak set at 284.6 eV to compensate for surface charging eﬀects.

The ionic conductivities were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which was performed employing a Versatile Multichannel Galvanostat 2/Z (VMP2, Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstation with an AC amplitude of 20 mV in the frequency ranging from 0.2 MHz to 10 Hz. Au was sputtered on both surfaces as ion-blocking electrode. DC polarization was performed to evaluate the electronic conductivity. A constant voltage of 0.2 V was applied. The electrochemical stability of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 pellet was evaluated by Li/Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/Li symmetrical battery. The Li stripping/plating studies were carried out in on a LAND battery test system (Wuhan, China) at 30 °C. Solid–state lithium (metal) batteries were assembled by the following process. LiFePO4 was mixed with acetylene black, and PVDF with a mass ratio of 80:10:10. Then, NMethyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to form uniform paste. The paste was coated with an aluminum foil and dried at 120 °C overnight. Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 pellet with a thickness of (750 μm) was put between the LiFePO4 cathode and the lithium metal anode. 1 μm thick of PEO based solid polymer electrolyte (PEO18-LiTFSI) was coated on the surface of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 pellet to improve its stability against Li metal, marked as PEO-Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. 10 μL liquid electrolyte was applied and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 pellet according to the method reported by Wang et al. [33]. The batteries were tested by galvanostatic cycling in the voltage range of 2.5–4.3 V vs Li/Li+ at 0.1 C at 30 °C on the LAND battery test system.

Nominal composition Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) were synthesized by hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction (HA-SSR) according to our previous report [23]. Stoichiometric amounts of and Al (NO3)3·9H2O are used as starting materials. First, mixture solution containing LiOH and NH4H2PO4 was strongly stirred for 1 h. Second, (CH3CH2CH2CH2O)4Ti was added by dropping into the above solution and formed white slurry. Then Al(NO3)3·9H2O and NH3·H2O were added to the above white slurry with continuous stirring for 3 h. The ﬁnal white slurry was then transferred into a stainless-steel Teﬂon-lined autoclave (100 mL). The precursors were achieved by hydrothermal process at 180 °C for 24 h. The resultant white powders were collected and dried overnight at 80 °C. Afterwards, the as-prepared precursors

XRD patterns of Al3+-doped powders obtained with heating treatment at 600 °C for 6 h are shown in Fig. 1(c). All samples are well matched with the standard pattern of NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 (PDF#: 00-035-0754), and no secondary phases related with Al3+ are observed, indicating that the Al3+ successfully incorporated into the LiTi2(PO4)3 lattice. It can also be seen that the diﬀraction peaks slightly shift to higher angle as the Al3+ doping content increasing. For instance, (113) peaks position shift to higher 2θ angle. Moreover, the lattice parameters for all investigated compounds are shown in Fig. 1(d). The a and c parameters of Al3+-doped samples obtained with heating treatment decrease according to the Al3+ content increasing in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4, further indicating the incorporation of Al3+ into the NASICON structure.

The SEM images of the precursors obtained through hydrothermal method and Al3+-doped powders obtained by heating treatment are shown in Fig. 2. The diﬀerences in morphology of un-doped and Al3+doped samples are reﬂected from these ﬁgures. As shown in Fig. 2(a–e), the doping of Al3+ is obviously eﬀect on the morphology of precursors. The precursor without Al3+ doping displays peanut-like morphology whereas the Al3+-doped samples exhibit rhombus-like morphology. Additionally, with the increasing of Al3+ doping content, the outline of rhombus-like morphology becomes clearer. Notably, all precursors obtained through hydrothermal process display well-organized morphology and uniform size distribution. The rhombus-like intermediate species of Al-0.3 was further analyzed by TEM. The rhombus-like grain is composed of small rhombus-like slice of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 with Li3PO4 nanoparticles (~5 nm) absorbed on the edge (Fig. S1). 

The nanoparticles have larger speciﬁc surface area and larger speciﬁc surface energy, which is beneﬁcial to lower reaction temperature. As can be seen in Fig. 2(f–j), all samples of bare and Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 powder still remain the same morphology as that of their precursors. The bare LiTi2(PO4)3 sample shows peanut-like morphology with length of 6.5 μm; while the Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 samples display rhombuslike morphology with length of about 7 μm. Therefore, we can conclude that the Al3+ doping results in diﬀerent composition and diﬀerent morphology. The EDS spectra of bare LiTi2(PO4)3 and Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 powder of Al-0.3 samples are shown in Fig. 2(k and l), which show the uniform distribution of all elements.

The grains of bare LiTi2(PO4)3 pellet is small in size. Comparatively, the Al3+-doped samples show cubeshaped morphology with much larger grain size than that of the bare LiTi2(PO4)3 ceramic, indicating that the Al3+ doping leads to grain growth thus decrease the number of grain boundaries. The decreased number of grain boundaries can lead to a higher ionic conductivity [20,38]. Moreover, most grains remain uniform size distribution and show good contact with each other for all ceramic samples, which are favorable prerequisites for ceramics with high ionic conductivity.

The XRD patterns of the bare and Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 pellets sintered at 1000 °C are shown in Fig. 4. All samples exhibit main LiTi2(PO4)3 phase of NASICON structure. The Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 samples exhibit higher relative intensity of diﬀraction peaks, indicating that the crystalline of Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 samples are enhanced. However, all samples contain a small amount of impurity phase of LiTiPO5. The occurrence of these impurities might be due to the decomposition of LiTi2(PO4)3 during high sintering temperature. Small amounts of AlPO4 phase is emerged in Al-0.4 pellet with the highest Al3+ doping content. Fig. 5(a) shows the XPS survey of Al-0.3 ceramic sample, and the peaks corresponding to Li 1s, Al 2p, P 2p, O 1s and Ti

LiTiOPO4 improves grain boundary structure and leads to an enhancement in ionic conductivity of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 solid electrolyte. In addition, LiTiPO5 is an ionic conductor [42]. The increase of the lithium content at the grain boundaries is also eﬀective in the conductivity enhancement. Moreover, AlPO4 is another concern regarding the microstructure of grain boundaries, because it as a dielectric phase can adsorb/desorb the Li+ in the grain boundaries and leads to a spacemediated eﬀect [43]. The space-mediated eﬀect plays a beneﬁcial role in the enhancement of ionic conductivity to some extent. However, an increased concentration of AlPO4 and TiO2 lead to a blocking eﬀect and deteriorate the Li+ transport. This may be the reason for the grain boundary conductivity decrease for Al-0.4 pellet. Additionally, the increase of grain boundary conductivity is larger than that of bulk conductivity with Al3+ doping, indicating that Al3+ doping plays an important role in increasing the grain boundary conductivity. Apparently, the Al-0.3 sample conductivity of 4.63 × 10−4 S cm−1; this conductivity is comparable to the value of literatures which is listed in Table 2. Moreover, beneﬁtting from the well-organized morphology and uniform particle distribution of bare LiTi2(PO4)3 powder, the bare LiTi2(PO4)3 ceramic has a good packing density and the total ionic conductivity improves to 10−5 S cm−1 in this study, which is higher than that of bare LiTi2(PO4)3 in literatures (< 10−6 S cm−1) [20,21,44]. The Arrhenius plots of conductivity for Al3+-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 samples are shown in Fig. 6(b). It can be clear seen that the logarithm of total conductivities of all samples has an excellent linear relationship with the absolute temperature.
