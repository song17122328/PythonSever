A Na3V2(PO4)3 sample coated uniformly with a layer of 6 nm carbon has been successfully synthesized by a one-step solid state reaction. This material shows two ﬂat voltage plateaus at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na and 1.63 V vs. Na+/Na in a nonaqueous sodium cell. When the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample is tested as a cathode in a voltage range of 2.7–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na, its initial charge and discharge capacities are 98.6 and 93 mAh/g. The capacity retention of 99% can be achieved after 10 cycles. The electrode shows good cycle performance and moderate rate performance. When it is tested as an anode in a voltage range of 1.0–3.0 V vs. Na+/Na, the initial reversible capacity is 66.3 mAh/g and the capacity of 59 mAh/g can be maintained after 50 cycles. These preliminary results indicate that Na3V2(PO4)3/C is a new promising material for sodium ion batteries.

Among advanced energy storage technologies, lithium ion batteries have been explored as power sources for various types of important applications, such as portable electric devices, electrical vehicles and smart grid. Due to the low abundance of lithium in the earth's crust (0.0065%), large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries become questionable [1–3], especially if low cost and high efﬁcient recycling technology could not be developed. Alternatively, sodium ion batteries are bound to being come up for energy storage, particularly as stationary batteries for smart grid, solar and wind energies, for which the demand on energy densities of the power sources is not so serious. Actually, many electrode materials such as, NaxCoO2 [4], Na4Mn9O18 [5], NaFeF3 [6], NaMPO4 [7], Na1.5VOPO4F0.5 [8], Na2FePO4F [9], NaCrO2 [10], carbon [11–13], NaxVO2 [14], Na2Ti3O7 [15], and NaTi2(PO4)3 [16] have been tested recently, as active materials in cathodes and anodes for sodium ion batteries.

Li3V2(PO4)3 and Li2NaV2(PO4)3 with rhombohedral structure (S. G.: R-3c) had been investigated as cathodes for lithium ion batteries with a voltage plateau at about 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li [17,18]. Its analog, Na3V2(PO4)3, exhibits an open NASICON framework [19,20] wherein the sodium ions could diffuse through the interstitial sites. The ﬁrst charge/discharge of pure Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode for sodium extraction/insertion has been reported [21,22], where two plateaus located at about 3.4 V and 1.6 V can be observed. A full symmetric cell based on pure Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes was constructed, but the cycling performance is not good [22]. No further electrochemical data on this material were reported. Therefore, it is worthy to reinvestigate sodium storage behavior of this material in sodium ion batteries. In our contribution, we ﬁrst report the use of carbon to coat Na3V2 (PO4)3 material by one-step solid state reaction approach. The resulting Na3V2(PO4)3/C composite exhibits signiﬁcantly improved Na storage performance.

The Na3V2(PO4)3/C samples were synthesized by a one-step solid state reaction as follows: the stoichiometric NaH2PO4⋅2H2O (99.9%, Alpha) and V2O3 (99.9%, Alpha) powders were put in the agate jar as precursors and then the precursors were ball-milled in a planetary ball mill (PM 200) at 400 rpm in a stainless steel vessel for 8 h. During the ball milling, for the carbon coated sample, the sugar (99.9%, Alpha) was also added as the carbon precursor and the reductive agent which prevents the oxidation of V3 +. After ball milling, the mixture was pressed into a pellet and then heated at 900 °C for 24 h in Ar atmosphere. The reaction process is shown in Eq. (1). 3NaH2PO4 2H2O þ V2O3→Na3V2 PO4.

The structures of the resulting material was characterized by an X'Pert Pro MPD X-ray diffractometer (XRD) (Philips, Netherlands) using Cu Kα radiation (1.5405 Å). The morphologies of the materials were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800). The high-resolution transimission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were acquired using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2010). The thermogravimetric(TG) analysis of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample was obtained using a Diamond TG thermoanalyzer.

The working electrode was prepared by spreading the slurry of the active materials (70 wt.%), acetylene black (20 wt.%) and polyvinylidene ﬂuoﬁde (10 wt.%) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone as the binder on an Al foil and dried at 100 °C in vacuum for 10 h. The Swagelok-type cells were assembled to characterize the Na3V2(PO4)3/C electrode with pure sodium foil as the counter electrode, and a glass ﬁber as the separator in an argon-ﬁlled glove box. The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out on a CHI600D Electrochemical Workshop (Shanghai, China) at a scan rate of 0.05 mV/s between 1.0 and 3.8 V vs. Na+/Na. The charge and discharge measurements were carried out on a Land BT2000 battery test system (Wuhan, China) at room temperature. When the sample was used as a cathode, its voltage range was between 3.8 and 2.7 V vs. Na+/Na, while for the anode measurement, a voltage range of 1.0–3.0 V vs. Na+/Na was used.

The XRD pattern of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample is shown in Fig. 1a. The pattern is in good agreement with previous reports without electrochemical data [17, 18], indicating a phase-pure material. The diffraction peaks can be indexed in an R-3c space group (in a rhombohedral unit cell) in the framework of NASICON structure with a=8.738 Å and c=21.815 Å [10]. Each primitive cell of Na3V2 (PO4)3 contains six Na3V2(PO4)3 formula units. The structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 can be regarded as each VO6 octahedron cornersharing with three PO4 tetrahedrons, and the Na+ ion occupying in the M1 (octahedral sites) and M2 (tetrahedral sites) sites of the interstitial sites, where M1 sites are situated between two adjacent [V2(PO4)3] units in the same [V2(PO4)3]∞ ribbon while M2 sites are located between adjacent [V2(PO4)3]∞ ribbons in Fig. 1b. Note that Na+ ions occupy M1 and M2 sites with different occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the [V2(PO4)3]3− units are aligned along c axis forming [V2(PO4)3] ∞ ribbons. The ribbons are connected together by PO4 tetrahedral along a axis to create an open 3D framework structure.

Fig. 2a shows the SEM image of the resulting Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample. It can be seen that the particle size is about 3 μm on average. From HRTEM image as shown in Fig. 2b, a uniform amorphous coating layer on the surface of particles can be observed and the thickness is ca. 6 nm. The stripe space, d=0.62 nm, corresponds to the (012) plane. From XRD pattern and TEM image, the obtained sample is well crystallized. The D-band around 1346 cm− 1 and G-band around 1602 cm− 1 can be seen clearly in Raman spectra of the coated Na3V2 (PO4)3 sample (Fig. 2c), suggesting the existence of carbon in the composite [23]. Fig. 2d presents the TG curve of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample under oxygen atmosphere. Accordingly, the carbon content is 9.4 wt.%.

The CV curves of the ﬁrst three cycles for the Na3V2(PO4)3/C electrode are displayed in Fig. 3a in the voltage range of 1.0–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na at a scanning rate of 0.05 mV/s. Two sharp redox peaks can be observed. In the high voltage range, the oxidation (Na extraction) and reduction (Na insertion) peaks are located at 3.44 and 3.34 V. The average voltage is 3.40 V vs. Na+/Na, which could be closed to the equilibrium voltage of V4 +/V3 + redox couple in this compound. In the low voltage range, peaks at 1.66 and 1.60 V are observed. The average voltage is 1.63 V vs. Na+/Na, which could correspond to V3 +/V2 + redox couple.

The voltage polarizations are about 0.1 V for the V4 +/V3 + redox couple and 0.06 V for the V3 +/V2 + redox couple, respectively. In addition, the subsequent CV curves are similar to the initial one, which indicates the good reversibility for Na extraction and insertion. Fig. 3b shows the charge/discharge curves of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C/Na cell at a current rate of 0.05 C in the voltage range of 2.7–3.8 V (Note that 0.05 C refers to two Na extraction from the Na3V2(PO4)3 per formula unit in 20 h.). The obvious ﬂat voltage plateau was observed at 3.4 V with a polarization of ca. 0.07 V, which is higher than voltage plateaus of NaxCoO2 (average voltage ca. 2.8 V) [4], Na2FePO4F (ca. 3.0 V) [9] and NaCrO2 (ca. 3.0 V) [10]. The Na3V2 (PO4)3/C electrode delivers initial charge capacity of 98.6 mAh/g and discharge capacity of 93.0 mAh/g, and the initial coulombic efﬁciency is 94.2%. The capacity is slightly lower than those of NaxCoO2 (ca. 110 mAh/g), Na2FePO4F (ca. 110 mAh/g) and NaCrO2 (ca. 120 mAh/g). We believe that the capacity can be further enhanced by optimizations such as reducing the particle size and decreasing the carbon content (Note that the theoretical capacity of this material is 117.6 mAh/g, presuming two V3 + are oxidized to V4 +). The reversible capacity keeps at 91.8 mAh/g after 10 cycles. The good cycling performance may be due to the open NASICON

structure and/or the carbon coating layer. These features are similar to the promising cathode material of LiFePO4 for lithium ion batteries. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the rate performance for the Na3V2 (PO4)3/C sample with reversible capacities of 93, 90, 89, 70 and 29 mAh/g at current rates of 0.05 C, 0.1 C ,0.2 C, 0.5 C and 1 C respectively. The intrinsic electronic and ionic transport properties of this material are still unknown. However, it is safe to say that the particle size of 3 μm could be too large for Na storage in this material at high rate. This could be optimized simply by reducing the particle size.

It can be seen clearly from the CV curves that Na3V2(PO4)3 also exhibits a redox couple at a low voltage. Therefore, it could also be used as anode for sodium ion batteries. Fig. 3c shows the charge/ discharge proﬁles of the test cells at a current rate of 0.025 C for the Na3V2(PO4)3/C electrode at a voltage range from 1.0 to 3.0 V. The voltage plateau is at 1.63 V vs. Na+/Na and nearly no polarization can be observed. The initial reversible capacity is 66.3 mAh/g and the capacity can be remained at 59 mAh/g after 50 cycles. From ﬂat voltage plateaus shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3c, it seems that the Na-storage mechanism could occur through a two-phase reaction, needing future clariﬁcation.

In conclusion, we introduce a novel electrode material, Na3V2 (PO4)3 with NASICON structure, as not only a promising cathode but also an anode for sodium ion batteries. The Na3V2(PO4)3 sample coated with carbon (ca. 6 nm in thickness) shows ﬂat voltage plateaus at 3.4 V and 1.63 V, which could correspond to V4 +/V3 + and V3 +/V2 + in this material. The initial reversible capacity for the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample is 93 mAh/g and the capacity can be maintained at 90.9 mAh/g after 10 cycles when the electrode is cycled between 2.7 and 3.8 V. At the current rate of 0.2 C, the capacity of 89 mAh/g can be achieved. The Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample also shows good cycling performance when it is cycled between 1.0 and 3.0 V, whose initial reversible capacity is 66.3 mAh/g and the capacity retention is 89 % after 50 cycles. Further work on the optimization of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample and clariﬁcation on Na-storage mechanism will be carried out in future.
