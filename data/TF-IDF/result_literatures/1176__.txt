The Na+ 2)ion conductivity σ of double phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 in the region of the β–γ transi 2) tion  has  been  studied  using  impedance  spectroscopy  (1–106  Hz).  The  polycrystalline  sample  of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 has been prepared by solid 2)phase synthesis and ceramic technology. It has been found that, upon the β–γ transition, the conductivity σ of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 suffers a ~1.5 2)fold jump at 470 ± 2 K upon heat 2) ing and a ~2.5 2)fold jump at 430 ± 4 K upon cooling (the temperature hysteresis of the jump in σ is 40 K). For double sodium–scandium phosphate γ 2)Na3Sc2(PO4)3 in the superionic state, σ attains 0.07 S/cm at 700 K and the ion transport activation enthalpy is 0.42 ± 0.02 eV.  

The crystal structure of double sodium–scandium phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 was studied for the first time in [1]; later, a high ion conductivity of this compound (σ ~ 0.2 S/cm [2]; 0.05 S/cm [3] at 573 K), caused by Na+ cations, was found. In subsequent years, the ion transport,  the  structure,  and  phase  transitions  in Na3Sc2(PO4)3 were repeatedly studied [4–18]. 

A characteristic feature of the atomic structure of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 is the statistical population of crystallo 2) graphic  positions  with  Na+  ions  in  channels  of  the three 2)dimensional  framework {[Sc2(PO4)3]3–}∞.  Sodium  cations  have  weak  bonds with the ions forming the rigid framework and possess high  mobility.  In  Na3Sc2(PO4)3,  the  crystalline  state with a high ion conductivity is realized as a result of structural transitions that lead to positional disorder of the  sublattice  of  singly  charged  cations.  There  are three  forms  of Na3Sc2(PO4)3. Upon the α–β transition [4, 5, 9, 11, 12],  the  structure  of  the  compound  changes  from monoclinic  to  trigonal  (rhombohedral);  the  latter belongs to the NASICON type (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, space  [19]). Upon the β–γ transition [9,11,12], group  the  trigonal  structure  of  Na3Sc2(PO4)3  does  not change. The X 2)ray diffraction patterns of the γ 2)phase differ from those of the β 2)phase by the absence of very weak superstructure reflections. In the γ 2)phase, dou 2) ble sodium–scandium phosphate is in the superionic state and has a high ion conductivity. 

Since we failed in obtaining large single crystals of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 suitable for studying ion transport pro 2) cesses, all the studies were performed on ceramic sam 2) ples. However, the results of electrical studies of dou 2) ble  sodium–scandium  phosphate  contain  contradic 2) tory  data  on  the  Na+ 2)ion  transport  activation enthalpy,  the  temperature  and  type  of  the  α–β  and β ⎯γ  transitions,  and  the  structural  mechanisms  of Na+ 2)ion redistribution over crystallographic positions in the course of phase transitions. The main reason of the  disagreement  in  the  data  is  different  thermody 2) namically  nonequilibrium  states,  in  which  sodium– scandium phosphate is synthesized. Depending of the conditions of synthesis and thermal prehistory [13, 14, 17],  at  room  temperature,  both  the  monoclinic  and rhombohedral forms of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 can be obtained as  well  as  their  mixture  with  different  percentage ratios. 

In the present work, we studied the electric charge transport processes in double phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 near  the  β–γ  transition,  which  converts  this  com 2) pound into the superionic state. 

Sodium phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 in the form of a fine 2)grained powder was provided to us by Kalinin; it was obtained at the Chemical Faculty of the Moscow State University by the method described in [1]. For electrical measurements, samples with a thickness of ~2 mm and diameter of 7 mm were prepared by the ceramic technology. Tablets compacted at a pressure of  5  ×  108  Pa  were  annealed  at  a  temperature  of ~500°C for 1–2 h. The relative density of the ceramic exceeded  90%  of  the  X 2)ray  density.The description  of  the  experimental  device  is  presented in [20]. 

The  electrical  conductivity  σ,  which  reflects  as  a whole  all  ion  processes  of  electric  charge  transfer inside crystal grains and at the intergrain boundaries was determined by extrapolating the hodograph of the impedance to the resistance axis. The ion conductivity activation  enthalpy  ΔH  was  found  from  the  Arrhe 2) nius–Frenkel equation, where A is the pre 2)exponential factor of the electrical conductivity. 

The temperature dependence of the ion conductiv 2) ity for ceramic samples of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 in the course of  the  heating–cooling  cycle  is  shown  in  the  figure. During  the  heating,  the  dependence  σ(T)  suffers  a ~1.5 2)fold jump at 470 ± 2 K. A change in the direction of  the  variation  in  temperature  allows  us  to  detect  a temperature hysteresis of ~40 K in σ. Upon the cool 2) ing, a ~2.5 2)fold jump in σ is observed at 430 ± 4 K. 

The  anomalies  (jumps  in  σ)  in  the  temperature dependence  of  the  electrical  conductivity  correlate with  the  differential  scanning  calorimetry  data  [12], which  indicate  the  existence  of  a  thermal  effect  at 442 K  with  the  transition  enthalpy  of  1  kJ/mol  and hysteresis of 35–40 K. 

The low 2)temperature modifi 2) cation α 2)Na3Sc2(PO4)3 belongs to the monoclinic sys 2) tem, whereas the β 2) and γ 2)forms belong to the trigonal system (rhombohedral symmetry). The high 2)temper 2) ature transition is a transition to the superionic state: Ttr = Tβ–γ. The presence of jumps in σ in the tempera 2) ture dependence of the electrical conductivity in the heating–cooling  cycle  indicates  that  the  superionic transition in Na3Sc2(PO4)3 is a first 2)order transition. The  results  of  structural  studies  [9,  11]  (a  jump increase in the lattice parameter at the transition point Tβ–γ) and calorimetric studies [12,16] (the existence of the transition heat) confirm this conclusion. 

Outside the interval 430–470 K, the conductomet 2) ric  data  in  the  heating  and  cooling  regimes  are  in  a good  agreement.  In  the  superionic  state  (T  >  Ttr),  σ attains 0.07 S/cm at 700 K. The temperature depen 2) dence of the ion conductivity satisfies the equation, where the electric 2)charge transfer activation enthalpy is expressed in electron 2)volts. Our data on the conduc 2) tivity (σ = 1.7 × 10–2 S/cm at 573 K) for the high 2)tem 2) perature modification γ 2)Na3Sc2(PO4)3 agree well with the results of [3, 8, 10, 11]: σ = (1–5) × 10–2 S/cm. At the same time, our result on the enthalpy of activation ΔH =  0.42  eV  for  γ 2)Na3Sc2(PO4)3  is  below  δH  = 0.56 eV from [3] or significantly exceeds ΔH = 0.14– 0.15 eV from [8, 10, 11]. 

The value of σ at 298 K is small and equal to 1.3 × 10–6 S/cm. Below the superionic transition (T < Ttr), we have not observed in our study the additional phase transition  corresponding  to  the  α–β  transformation. This  fact  gives  evidence  that  double  sodium–scan 2) dium  phosphate,  apparently,  preserves  its  trigonal modification  in  the  low 2)temperature  region.  The rhombohedral form of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 at room temper 2) ature was found in the structural studies [6, 7, 14, 15, 17]  (see  the  table).  The  crystalline  framework {[Sc2(PO4)3]3–}∞  forms  of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 is formed by fragments consisting of two scandium–oxygen  octahedra  [ScO6]  and  two  phos 2) phorus–oxygen tetrahedra [PO4], connected by verti 2) ces.  Due  to  different  packings  of  these  fragments, 2[ScO6]–2[PO4],  the  framework  {[Sc2(PO4)3]3–}∞ possesses different symmetries: the “parquet” packing of fragments (for details, see [21]) leads to the mono 2)clinic  or  orthorhombic  symmetry  of  the  framework and the “stacking” leads to the rhombohedral symme 2) try. The structure of the β 2) and γ 2)modifications is of the  NASICON  type  (space  group  ).  In  the β 2)form,  a  commensurate  modulation  of  the  crystal structure, connected with the Na sublattice and disap 2) pearing  upon  the  transition  to  the  γ 2)form,  has  been found.  The  structural  transitions  affect  mainly  the sublattice of sodium cations, leading to its disordering in the high 2)temperature modification. 

Thus,  the  β–γ  transition  in  double  phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3  is  the  first 2)order  transition  and  is accompanied  by  a  small  (1.5–2.5 2)fold)  jump  in  the ion  conductivity.  In  the  superionic  state  of  double phosphates  Na3Sc2(PO4)3  (our  data),  Na3Fe2(PO4)3 [22],  and  Li3R2(PO4)3  with R  =  Sc,  Fe  [23],  the  ion transport  parameters  have  close  values:  σ  =  (1–3)  × 10–2  S/cm  at  573  K  and  ΔH  =  0.3–0.4  eV.  It  is explained  by  the  common  feature  of  γ 2)Na3R2(PO4)3 ) and γ 2)Li3R2(PO4)3 (trigonal system, space group  (orthorhombic  system,  space  group  Pcan)  for  R  = Sc, Fe: these compounds are characterized by statis 2) tical  population  of  crystallographic  positions  with singly  charged  cations  in  channels  of  structurally similar  three 2)dimensional  crystalline  frameworks {[R2(PO4)3]3–}∞.
