The title compound, rubidium ditin(IV) tris(phosphate), RbSn2(PO4)3, belongs to the NASICON-type family of phosphates and crystallizes in the space group R3. The structure is composed of PO4 tetrahedra (1 symmetry) and two slightly distorted SnO6 octahedra, both with 3. symmetry, which are interlinked through corner-sharing O atoms to form a 31[Sn2(PO4)3] framework. The Rb+ cations are located on threefold inversion axes in the voids of this framework and exhibit a coordination number of 12. The crystal studied was twinned by merohedry with a component ratio of 0.503:0.497.

In recent years, the AM2(PO4)3 (A = alkali metal; M = Ti, Zr, Ge, Sn) family with NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12; Boilot et al., 1987) -type structures attracted a growing interest due to their intriguing properities, e.g. ionic conductivity of the A cations located in the voids of the three-dimensional NASICON-type framework. This framework is composed of isolated PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with MO6 octahedra (Fig. 1), and is amenable to a wide variety of chemical substitutions at the various crystallographic positions, thus yielding a large number of closely related compounds, such as NaFeNb(PO4)3 (Zatovskii et al., 2006), Rb2Ca2(SO4)3 (Boujelben et al., 2007) or Al0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 (Zhao et al., 2011). In order to augment this family of compounds, we prepared crystals of the compound RbSn2(PO4)3 using a solid state reaction route. Unlike the analogous Ti compound RbTi2(PO4)3 which crystallises in space group R3c (Duhlev, 1994), RbSn2(PO4)3 crystallises in space group R3. A projection of the crystal structure of RbSn2(PO4)3 is given in Fig. 2. It is characterized by the presence of isolated PO4 tetrahedra (1 symmetry) and two different SnO6 octahedra (both 3. symmetry), linked by sharing corner O atoms, to establish a three-dimensional 3∞[Sn2(PO4)3]- framework. This framwork delimits two types of channels in which the twelve-coordinate Rb+ atoms (site symmetry 3.) are located to compensate the negative charges. The PO4 tetrahedra are quite regular, with P–O distances ranging from 1.523 (4) to 1.537 (4) Å. The two SnO6 octahedra exhibit Sn—O distances ranging from 2.015 (4) to 2.033 (4) Å.

Single crystals of RbSn2(PO4)3 have been prepared by a high-temperature method in air. A powder mixture of RbNO3, SnO2 and NH4H2PO4 in the molar ratio of Rb: Sn: P = 10: 1: 15 was first ground in an agate mortar and then transferred to a platinum crucible. The sample was gradually heated in air at 1173 K for 24 h. After that, the intermediate product was slowly cooled to 673 K at the rate of 2 K h-1. It was kept at 673 K for another 10 h and then quenched to room temperature. The obtained crystals were colorless with a prismatic shape.

The RbSn2(PO4)3 crystal studies was twinned by merohedry. For refinement the twin law (0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1) was used; the twin component ratio refined to 0.503: 0.497. The highest peak in the difference electron density map is at a distance of 1.38 Å from Rb2 while the deepest hole is at a distance of 1.77 Å from O2.

All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.

Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating Rfactors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- factors based on ALL data will be even larger
