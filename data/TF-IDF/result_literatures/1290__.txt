NASICON (sodium super ion conductor)-related compounds, for instance, Li3V2(PO4)3 [1e4], Li2NaV2(PO4)3 [5] and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 [6], have been proved to be promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, exhibiting high ion mobility and reasonable discharge capacity. In these NASICON-related compounds, lithium is essential as ion conductor. However, if other alkali metal containing material could work as cathode in lithium ion battery system, it will be signiÔ¨Åcant for the developing of secondary batteries. The non-lithium containing cathode material Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was a successful case that used as cathode material in a steady hybrid lithium ion battery system [7].

The non-lithium containing material Na3V2(PO4)3 was NASICON structured [8] and formerly used as electrode for sodium ion battery [9] or mid-product to obtain rhombohedral NASICON structured Li3V2(PO4)3 via ion exchanging [5,10,11]. In this work,

Na3V2(PO4)3 was applied directly as cathode material to compose a so-called hybrid ion battery with lithium anode and lithiumcontaining electrolyte. An electro-catalysis [12,13] ion exchange reaction occurred on the cathode/electrolyte interface when the  1 based battery was working. The theoretical capacity is 176 mAh g √æ ions extracted from the material lattice. on all of the three Na √æ ) ion is kinetically However, extraction of the third Na difÔ¨Åcult due to the much lower electronic/ionic conductivity of the √æ √æ (or Li end-member of V2(PO4)3. Therefore, two-thirds of the Na ) ions which can be reversibly extracted/inserted give rise to a theo 1 [5,14]. We found that, in this hybrid retical capacity of 118 mAh g ion system, the non-lithium containing NASICON-related material, Na3V2(PO4)3, showed excellent electrochemical performance.

Na3V2(PO4)3 was prepared via solid state carbothermal reduction reaction (CTR) assisted by mechanochemical activation. Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, V2O5 and glucose were reacted in stoichiometric proportion at 600e800 C in argon atmosphere for 12 h after a preliminary heating treatment of the mixture at 400 C for 6 h. In

order to make the V (V) completely reduced to V (III), 35 wt.% extra glucose was added.

The crystallographic structure and phase analysis were provided from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/max-r A type Cu Ka). JADE software program was used to determine peak locations and intensities. The particle morphology of the products was observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM6360LV). The thermogravimetric analysis the samples was obtained using a Diamond TG thermo-analyzer. The concentration of sodium, lithium, vanadium and phosphorous of the samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Optima 4300DV).

To test the electrochemical performances, the cathode slurry (80 wt.% of the active material) was coated onto an aluminum foil followed by drying in vacuum at 120 C for 12 h. The cells (CR2025) were assembled and disassembled in an argon Ô¨Ålled glove-box using lithium metal foil as the anode. The electrolyte was  1 LiPF6 in a mixture of ethyl carbonate (EC), diethyl 1.0 mol L carbonate (DEC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (volume ratio 1:1:1). The cathode Ô¨Ålms removed from the cells were washed by DMC. The cells were charged and discharged at 0.1 C in the voltage range of 2.5 Ve4.6 V on charge/discharge apparatus (Land-BTL10) (Note that 0.1 C refers to two Na extraction from the Na3V2(PO4)3 per formula unit in 10 h.). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were conducted by using an electrochemical working station (CHI660D). The amplitude is 5 mV  2 Hz for the and the frequency ranges between 1  105 and 1  10  1 and the voltage ranges between EIS. The scan rate is 0.05 mV s 2.5 V and 4.6 V for the CV.

precursor (V2O5 √æ NH4H2PO4 √æ Na2CO3 √æ glucose) are shown in Fig. 1(a). According to the DSC curve, the sharp endothermic peak between 100 C and 200 C is mainly caused by the evaporation of water, carbon dioxide and ammonia from the precursor. The endothermic effects between 300 C and 600 C are attributed to the decomposition of the glucose (between 300 C and 400 C) and the reduction of vanadium from V (V) to V (III) (between 500 C and 600 C). The sharp exothermic effect between 650 C and 700 C corresponds to the formation of the Na3V2(PO4)3 phase. The TG curve becomes Ô¨Çat above 750 C, indicating the completion of the entire reaction. Fig. 1(b) presents the TG curve of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample under air atmosphere. Accordingly, the carbon content is 1.8 wt.%.

The diffraction peaks is in good agreement with previous reports [5,8].

The Na shown in Table 1. The characteristic diffraction peaks of crystallized graphite carbon are not observed from the XRD pattern. This provides evidence that residual carbon in the material is in amorphous state. The morphology of the material was studied by SEM as shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the irregularly shaped particles are distributed in the range of 1e5 mm due to the mechanochemical activation before sintering. Some of the particles are agglomerated to form larger secondary particles.

To investigate the possibility of ion-exchange taking place between the Na3V2(PO4)3 and Li electrolyte phase, the elements contents of the Na3V2(PO4)3 at different stages are analyzed by ICPAES, which are listed in Table 2. S1 is the as-prepared powder sample and S2 is from the positive electrode of the assembled cell that has stood by for 4 h; S3 and S4 represent the sample after the Ô¨Årst and tenth charge/discharge cycle.

Fig. 6(a) shows the charge/discharge curves of the Ô¨Årst three cycles for the Na3V2(PO4)3/Li cells at a current rate of 0.1 C in the voltage range of 2.5e4.6 V. Two voltage plateaus approximately near 3.70 V and 3.80 V in the charge curves were observed. For the discharge curves, one voltage plateau near 3.65 V was observed and the other near 3.55 V was not that obvious. The charge/discharge curves correspond to the CV curves well. The voltage plateau of the material in this hybrid ion battery system is generally higher than that in the sodium ion battery system, which is 3.40 V reported by Jian et al. [9]. It is also higher than that of the traditional LiFePO4 material, which is approximate 3.40 V reported previously [21,22]. Fig. 6(b) displays the initial charge/discharge curves at different current rates. The cells were charged/discharged at a 0.1 C rate over the Ô¨Årst one hundred cycles and at a 0.5 C rate over the following Ô¨Åve cycles; then over the next cycles, charged at 1 C and discharged respectively at 1 C, 2 C, 5 C and 10 C; Ô¨Ånally charged/discharged back to 0.1 C over the last Ô¨Åve cycles. The corresponding data of initial discharge capacities are listed in Table 4. It indicates an excellent rate performance of the material with the discharge speciÔ¨Åc capacity retention of 73.9% while the current rates rise up from 0.1 C to 10 C.
