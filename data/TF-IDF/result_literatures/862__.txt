A new layered metal phosphate, Li2Sr2Al(PO4)3, was synthesized in the form of either asingle-crystal or polycrystalline powder using the molten hydroxide flux method or a solidstate reaction, respectively.

Li2Sr2Al(PO4)3 crystallizes to the P21/n (Z = 4) monoclinic spacegroup with lattice parameters a ≈ 4.95 Å, b ≈ 22.06 Å, c ≈ 8.63 Å, and β ≈ 91.5°.

Thestructure is composed of stacked [LiSrAl(PO4)2] layers alternating regularly with [LiSrPO4]layers.

In the [LiSrAl(PO4)2] sublattice, the AlO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are tiltedcooperatively to form an anionic, corrugated, two-dimensional [Al(PO4)2]3-framework thatcan be regarded as a “distorted-glaserite” structure.

The [LiSrPO4] sublattice is that of alayered block containing a six-membered ring formed from alternating linkages of LiO4 andPO4 tetrahedra.

The six-membered rings show a boat-type arrangement with the up(U) ordown(D) pointing sequence, UUDUUD.

The interspace between the two sublattices generatesa two-dimensional pathway for Li+ion conduction.

The impedance measurement indicatedthat Li2Sr2Al(PO4)3 had a moderate ion conductivity (σ ≈ 1.30 × 10-4S cm-1at 667 K), with anactivation energy Ea ≈ 1.02 eV.

The tetrahedral phosphate group (PO43-) has a remarkable ability to combine withvarious structural units to generate a large number of phosphate derivatives with distinctproperties [1-4].

Metal phosphates have attracted great interest in materials science due totheir structural variety and use in a wide range of applications.

Recently, there has been agrowing interest in lithium metal phosphates due to the demand of new materials forapplications in display devices and secondary batteries.

For example, LiMPO4 (M = alkalineearth metal ion) compounds were reported as effective host materials for blue-emittingphosphor with an excellent thermal stability [5-9].

The transition metal-containing phosphates,LiMPO4 (M = Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+), have also attracted particular attention as electrodematerials for lithium ion batteries due to their high energy density, low cost, and goodenvironmental compatibility [10-15].

The crystal structure of LiMPO4 depends on the size ofthe M atom.

 The phosphates containing large M ions (e.g., Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) adopt theKLiSiO4-related structure [16], while the olivine structure is preferable for small M ions (e.g.,Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) [17,18].

The phosphate group can combine with the trivalent Al3+ ion to form secondary buildingunits with diverse stoichiometries, including [Al(PO4)2]3-, [Al2(PO4)3]3-, [Al3(PO4)4]3-, and[Al4(PO4)5]3-[19-21].

These aluminophosphate groups deduce a variety of anionicframeworks with a 3-dimensional (3-D) framework, 2-D layer, and 1-D chain.

There weremany attempts to use these anionic frameworks in the design of new solid-state structuraltopologies [22-24].

Considering the rich variation in the structure of lithium metal phosphates, we haveundertaken an exploratory synthesis for the Li–Sr-Al–P–O system.

We employed the moltenlithium hydroxide flux method, in which lithium hydroxide is melted at elevated temperaturesand acts as the flux for crystallization, to grow new complex metal phosphate crystals.

Wereport the synthesis, crystal structure, and ion conductivity of a new complex metal phosphate,Li2Sr2Al(PO4)3.The crystal structure of Li2Sr2Al(PO4)3 consists of a layered structurecomprising two alternating sublattices: [LiSrPO4] and [LiSrAl(PO4)2].

This is a novelexample of a 2-D phosphate that contains a lithium metal orthophosphate between thealuminophosphate layers.
