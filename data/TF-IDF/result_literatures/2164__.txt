Nasicon-type phosphates have been extensively studied in the context of various  222)elds of solid state chemistry: fast alkali—ion conductors (1), low thermal expansion ceramics (2), luminescence (3), and host structure for radioactive wastes (4). More recently, introduction of 3d ions as copper in this structure extends the potential application of such materials to various catalytic process, e.g., dehydrogenation and exchange reaction (5) and periodic catalytic activity (6). Within this scope a detailed investigation of the physical properties of the new Nasicon-type phosphate Co0.5Ti2 (PO4)3 was undertaken.

This phosphate can be prepared without detectable impurities only by a low temperature method. The resulting low crystallinity makes such samples active in catalytic process

but excludes an extended structural investigation. In this context, the object of this study—reported in two successive papers—will be to discuss the optical and magnetic properties in relation to a hypothetical cobalt environment. First, the crystallographic data will be discussed in relation to the crystal chemistry of the Nasicon-type phosphates. Then the optical absorption spectrum, the paramagnetic susceptibility, and the EPR parameters will be analyzed by the classical models deriving explicitly from the formalism of the Tanabe—Sugano diagrams and leading to a rough estimation of the crystal  222)eld parameter Dq and of the Racah parameter B.

In a second paper the physical properties will be simulated by using the Racah algebra calculation techniques. Such calculations have been carried out in the context of the simple overlap model developed by Malta (7) which have been successfully applied for reproducing the crystal  222)eld parameters of a great number of lanthanides as well as some 3d element compounds (8). This theoretical approach makes possible an exact determination of the cobalt—oxygen surroundings in so far as a slight change of the Co—O distance can be associated with a small variation of the crystal  222)eld parameters.

starting materials were diluted solutions of Co(NO3)2, 6H2O(I), (NH4)2HPO4 (II) and TiCl4 in ethanol (III). A slow addition of (III) in a (I)#(II) mixture at room temperature induces a precipitation. After drying at about 100¡ C the obtained amorphous violet powder is

progressively heated up to 750¡ C. The beginning of crystallization observed by X-ray di⁄raction (XRD) occurs at 660¡ C but the compound is stable only below 800¡ C. The lines of the XRD pattern remain broad even after a long annealing at 750¡ C which excludes a re 222)nement of the crystal structure.

The XRD pattern can be indexed assuming a rhombohedral cell (Table 1). The order of magnitude of the parameters in the equivalent hexagonal cell is typical of a Nasicon-type structure: a"8.510$0.003 A , c"21.04$ " 3.04 g ) cm~3, 0.005 A "2.94 g ) cm~3) imply six Co0.5Ti2 (PO4)3 formulae per d#!-#. unit-cell. The indexation of all re 223)ections is consistent with the R31 or R32 space groups (Table 1). According to these data the structure of Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 consists of a tridimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra sharing corners. The cobalt (II) ions are located in half of the usually labeled M(1) sites, i.e., within the antiprism elongated along the c-axis and sharing faces with two TiO6 space group, Co2‘ is found at the octahedra. In the R3 center of M(I) site (D3) point symmetry) (Fig. 1) whereas in the context of the R32 space group, the cobalt atom can be displaced along the c axis giving rise to three short Co—O distances and to three longer distances (C3v point symmetry) (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with the stability of the

Recently the structure of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 , which can be prepared at high temperatures, has been reported and "8.510$0.003 A solved in the R3 ; "21.09$0.05 A ) (9). The Mn—O distance in the M(1) ch site is 2.262 A , i.e., close to the sum of the ionic radii (2.23 A ) (10). Assuming identical atomic coordinates for the cobalt phosphate, the calculated Co—O distance is 2.25 A which is higher than the sum of the ionic radii (2.17 A ) . Therefore the selection of the space group cannot be deduced only from these crystallographic data.

The absorption spectrum was recorded using a double monochromator Cary 2400 spectrometer at 300 K and 12 K (Fig. 3). The spectrum can be divided into three regions labeled I, II, and III as the energy decreases. In Region I the beginning of the charge transfer is observed at j"350 nm (3.56 eV); this value can be compared to those of TiO2(11), SrTiO3(11), and titanium phosphates of Nasicon-type structure (12—16) listed in Table 3. The origin of this absorption can be understood in terms of transition between orbitals mostly localized on oxygens and antibonding orbitals mostly localized on titanium. In SrTiO3 the Ti—O bonds are more covalent than in TiO2 due to the better overlap between 3d titanium and 2p oxygen orbitals in addition to the reinforcement of the Ti—O bond by the competing Sr—O bond. In the case of the phosphates, the rigid phosphotitanium framework involves a strong Ti—O bond and accordingly high E values.

The other regions correspond to the crystal  222)eld transition of Co2‘: Region II exhibits an intense and broad

The EPR spectrum of a polycrystalline sample of Mg0.49Co0.01Ti2(PO4)3 has been recorded at 4.1 K, using a BRUKER ER 200tt X band spectrometer with a 100 KHz modulation. The dilution of cobalt in the isostructural

This degeneracy is lifted in presence of an external magnetic  222)eld. The energies and g values can be calculated as a function of the spin—orbit coupling constant m, of the axial distortion d of the octahedral site, and of the applied magnetic  222)eld H by using the hamiltonian (23,24)

where c satis 222)es !3/24c4!1 (!3/2 in a weak  222)eld and !1 in a strong  222)eld). In the case of a ligand (p)—metal (d) mixing that can be considered as an indication of the coin H, L by balt—oxygen bond covalency we replace, kL (k(1) and 2/3 by 2/3 k2.

The g factors are calculated from the matrix elements

By introducing these data in the diagram of Fig. 4 a slight discrepancy is observed with theoretical calculation involving a low crystal  222)eld. The value of d/f can be calculated assuming a pure ionic Co—O bond (k"1). The best agreement is obtained for d"1170 cm~1, gDD"7.53, and go" 2.28. These new data are consistent with the weak  222)eld prediction.

Ligand Field Parameters Deduced from the Absorption Spectra of Octahedral Co(II) Compounds

The magnetic susceptibility of Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was recorded between 4.2 and 280 K using a Faraday balance. The X~1 " f („ ) curve is linear at high temperature and deviates slightly from the linearity at low temperature. The experimental Curie constant 3.16 is close to the value calculated assuming an orbital contribution (C " 3.38) . Such a curve is typical of a paramagnetic behavior of an isolated Co2‘ ion located in a distorted octahedral site. The magnetic properties of a 4„ 1 term in an axially symmetric crystal  222)eld have been described previously by Figgis et al. (25) who considered a simultaneous perturbation by the spin—orbit

coupling j and the axial crystal  222)eld variable d. The terminal variation of the magnetic moment k %&&. is expressed in terms of d, k, and c. Assuming k"1 and c"!1.5 the d value giving the best  222)t to the experimental magnetic moment is 900 cm~1, a value in good agreement with the distortion parameter inferred from EPR (Fig. 5).

Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 belongs to the Nasicon-type family. The cobalt ions are located in half of the antiprismatic M(1) sites in a centered or o⁄-centered position. The value of the crystal  222)eld intensity deduced from the absorption spectrum "815 cm~1 is rather low for an oxide and evidences an Dq ionic character of the Co — O bond. The deviation from the cubic symmetry of the cobalt site is consistent with the EPR and magnetic data: in this phosphate Co2‘ has a high spin electronic con 222)guration and the g values can be interpreted in the context of the weak  222)eld limit. Finally, as it was demonstrated in a previous study describing a family of cobalt cyclophosphates (22), Co2‘ behaves as a probe extremely sensitive to its close environment and a clear analysis of the spectroscopic properties needs a precise determination of the crystal  222)eld parameters, which is the object of the forthcoming paper.
