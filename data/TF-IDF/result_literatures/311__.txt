The tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries suffers from issues of manganese dissolution and surface layer outgrowth during cycling, that lead to poor electrochemical performances. It is found by ex-situ scanning and transmission electron microscopies that applying a coating of NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) on the surface of Na0.44MnO2 particles can markedly suppress the surface layer growth phenomenon  and  improve  the  cycling  stability  and  rate  capability  of  this  cathode material. The 2 wt% NTP-coated sample delivers a capacity retention of 99.0% after 100 cycles at 1C and a capacity of 82.2 mAh g-1 at 20C (71% of 0.1C capacity).


Over  the  past  decades,  lithium-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  have  been  widely  applied  in  rechargeable electronic devices owing to their high energy density and long service  life.1,2 However, they hardly meet the growing demands for large-scale energy storage  systems and electric vehicles due to the limited lithium resources and thus high cost.3,4  On the other hand, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), with similar electrochemical properties  but lower cost of sodium compared to lithium, are attracting more and more attention  as a next generation energy storage system.5-7 Nevertheless, the ionic radius of Na ions  (102 pm) is larger that of Li ions (69 pm) so that it is difficult to find electrode materials  that allow fast sodium ion diffusion and accommodate the structural degradation during  the  electrochemical  cycling.8-10  Thus,  finding  a  suitable  active  material  with  long  cycling stability and high rate performance is a main challenge.

Among the SIBs cathode materials, the transition-metal oxides (TMOs) are the most  attractive candidates. The tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 stands out from TMOs because of  its  unique  crystal  structure,  which  consists  of  MnO6  octahedra  and  MnO5  square  pyramids, and its capability to tolerate some stress during structural changes.11-15 The  Na0.44MnO2 has large S-shaped tunnels which provide pathways for the diffusion and  insertion/extraction of Na-ions.16 Nevertheless, it usually shows rather poor cycling and  rate  performances  even  after  various  ways  of  modification  such  as  nanosizing  and  cationic doping.17,18 Fu et al. reported a Na0.44MnO2 nanorod with very good cycling  stability  (with  nearly  no  capacity  decay  at  0.42C  after  100  cycles)  but  poor  rate  performance (only 19 mAh g-1 at 10C). Their another sample, Na0.44MnO2 nanofiber,  showed a good rate performance of 70 mAh g-1 at 10C, but the capacity retention was  only 50.8% at 0.42C after 100 cycles.19 Hence it is still a challenge to find a way to  improve both cycling stability and rate performance.

In  general,  surface  coating  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  an  effective  strategy  to  improve the electrochemical performance because the coating layer may inhibit the side  reactions  between  the  electrolyte  and  the  active  materials.20-24  A  promising  coating  material is preferably not only dense and stable to protect the electrodes but also Naion  conducting  to  facilitate  the  charge  transfer.25  In  this  respect,  NASICON-type 


NaTi2(PO4)3  (NTP)  has  been  identified  with  a  high  Na-ion  conductivity  and  good  stability.26 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of applying a NTP coating  layer on Na0.44MnO2 for SIBs.

In this work, we first discover a surface layer growth phenomenon as the main reason  for  the  poor  electrochemical  properties  of  Na0.44MnO2.  Then  we  employ  NTP  as  a  surface coating material by using a simple wet-milling method. A great improvement  in the electrochemical properties of Na0.44MnO2 is achieved with both excellent cycling  stability (capacity retention of 99.0% at 1C after 100 cycles) and high rate performance  (82.2 mAh g-1 at 20C).


The  Na0.44MnO2  samples  were  prepared  by  a  thermo  polymerization  method  as reported  previously.27  Stoichiometric  amounts  (calculated  based  on  0.05  mol Na0.44MnO2) of NaNO3 (Sinopharm AR) and Mn(CH3COO)2•4H2O (Sinopharm AR) were dissolved in 80 ml deionized water to obtain an aqueous solution. Then, 10 ml HNO3 and 50 ml acrylic acid (Sinopharm AR) were also added into the solution to avoid hydrolysis and act as a monomer for polymerization, respectively. After stirring for 1 h, the solution was heated at 180 °C for 10 h in an oven to complete the thermo polymerization process. The product was grinded and calcined at 500 °C in air for 6 h to remove organic residues. Finally, the powdered precursor was sintered at 900 °C for 10 h in air to obtain the target material Na0.44MnO2, which was then grinded into a fine powder (named as P0).

The NaTi2(PO4)3 coating was prepared by a sol-gel method. Stoichiometric amounts of sodium benzoate (0.05 M, C6H5COONa, AR), titanium butoxide (0.1 M, Ti(OC4H9)4, AR)  and  tributyl  phosphate  (0.15  M,  PO(C4H9O)3,  AR)  were  mixed  together  and dissolved in ethyl alcohol to form a transparent solution, in which the homogeneous dispersion of the three components at molecular level is achieved. A few minutes later, the solution becomes a viscous gel without precipitation. Subsequently, 0.6 g active material (P0) was mixed with different amounts of above gel and wet-milled for  30 min in a mortar with a proper amount of ethyl alcohol. After the ethyl alcohol was evaporated, the obtained powders were sintered at 650 °C for 4 h in air. The samples coated with NTP (0.5 wt%，1 wt%，2 wt%，3 wt%) were marked as P0.5, P1, P2, and P3, respectively. 

The investigation of the electrochemical performances was carried out using coin-type  half-cells  (CR2032  size)  assembled  in  an  argon-filled  glovebox  (MBraun Labmaster 130). The active materials, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene difluoride) were mixed with a mass ratio of 80:10:10 in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to produce  a  slurry  and  then  casted  on  an  aluminum  foil  to  fabricate  the  electrode laminates. An electrolyte solution was obtained by dissolving 1.0 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1, v/v) with 5.0 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate as an additive. The counter electrode was a sodium disc and the separator was a glass fiber (Whatman  Gf/D).  Cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  and  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy  (EIS)  measurements  of  the  cells  were  performed  with  a  CHI  660B electrochemical workstation. The cells were also galvanostatically cycled on a multi-channel battery test system (NEWARE BTS-610).

In summary, NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) has been successfully employed as a coating material to modify the tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 cathode material for SIBs. The NaTi2(PO4)3 coating can greatly improve the cycling stability and rate performance of Na0.44MnO2 with 2 wt% as the optimal content. The NaTi2(PO4)3-coating can largely suppress the side reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes so that it has cured the unfavorable surface layer growth phenomenon. Besides, the coating of a pure Na-
