Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 arsenate was prepared and structurally characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and by Raman and infrared spectroscopies. Its structure, which belongs to the Nasicon-type family, was refined by the Rietveld method in the R-3 space group, from X-ray powder diffraction data. The hexagonal unit-cell parameters were determined to be ah= 8.965?2? Å, ch= 23.955?6? Å, V = 1667.43?6? Å3, and Z= 6. The structure is formed by an ionic three-dimensional network of AsO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra linked by corners with Sr2+ ions occupying half of the M1 sites in an ordered manner. Raman and infrared spectra were recorded and assignments of the stretching and bending vibrations of the AsO43− tetrahedra were made. The number of the peaks observed is in good agreement with that predicted by the factor-group analysis of the R-3 space group. © 2009 International Centre for Diffraction Data. 

Nasicon-type materials have been extensively studied as solid electrolytes, ionic conductors, electrode materials, low thermal expansion ceramics, sensors, etc. ?Hagman and Kierkegaard, 1968; Hong, 1976; Goodenough et al., 1976; Cherkaoui et al., 1986; Delmas et al., 1988; Rodrigo et al., 1989; Bussereau et al., 1992; Brian et al., 2001; Aatiq et al., 2001?. Their structure, first described for NaZr2?PO4?3 ?Hagman and Kierkegaard, 1968?, consists of a three-dimensional ?3D? network formed by PO4 and ZrO6 polyhedra linked by corners. The site occupied by sodium ions is an elongated trigonal antiprism formed by triangular faces of two ZrO6 octahedra along the c axis of the hexagonal cell ?Caglioti et al., 1958; Dowty, 1997?. This site is usually called M?1?. The framework also creates a large eight coordinated site referred to as M?2? site. The two sites may be completely empty as in NbTi?PO4?3 ?Masse et al., 1972?, partially occupied as in NaZr2?PO4?3 ?Hagman and Kierkegaard, 1968? and Na3CaTi?PO4?3 ?Krimi et al., 2000?, or fully occupied as in Na5Ti?PO4?3 ?Krimi et al., 1993?. In contrast to the extensive studies of the Nasicon-type phosphates and silicates, only few investigations have been reported for the arsenates analogues. To our knowledge only X-ray powder diffraction patterns have been reported for MTi2?AsO4?3 ?M =L i,N a,A g,K?, M0.5Ti2?AsO4?3 ?M =M g,C a,S r? ?Yaakoubi et al., 1991? and MeZr2?As1−xPxO4?3 ?Me= Na, K? ?Mazza et al., 1998?. The structures of KZr2?AsO4?3 ?El Brahimi and Durand, 1990? and Na3Sc2?AsO4?3 ?Harrison and Philips, 2001? have been determined from single-crystal X-ray dif fraction data. Structural, electrochemical, and vibrational studies of A3M2?AsO4?3 ?A= Li, Na; M =A l,F e,I n? have been reported ?Masquelier et al., 1995; Lii and Ye, 1997; Masquelier et al., 1998; Khorari et al., 1997; Winand et al., 1990?. The structure of NaZr2?AsO4?3 ?Chakir et al., 2003? was refined by the Rietveld method in the R-3c space group from X-ray powder diffraction data. The structure is formed by a three-dimensional network of AsO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra linked by corners. Na atoms occupy totally the M1 sites. Raman and infrared spectra were recorded and assignments of the stretching and bending vibrations of the AsO43− tetrahedra were made. Substitution of Na+ by divalent ions in NaZr2?AsO4?3 led to the synthesis of new arsenates M0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 ?M=C a,C d,S r,...?. The present paper reports the synthesis, crystal structure, and vibrational spectra of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3.

Crystalline powder of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 was prepared from solutions of SrCO3 ?or SrCl2·H2O? ?I?, ZrOCl2·8H2O ?II?, and ?NH4?H2AsO4 ?III?. Stoichiometric proportions of these reagents ?amounts necessary to obtain 2 g o f Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3? were dissolved in 20 ml of dilute nitric acid solution ?6M? for the carbonate and in 20 ml of distilled water for the other reagents. After addition of a solution of ?III? to a solution of ?I+I I? at room temperature and heating at 60 ° C until complete evaporation, the white solid obtained was successively sintered at 100, 300, 500, and 700 ° C, for 24 h with intermediate grinding, to obtain microcrystalline powder of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Philips PW 3040 ??-?? diffractometer ?40 kV , 40 mA?. The structure of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 was refined with the Rietveld method using the FULLPROF program ?Rodríguez-Carvajal, 1990?. The experimental conditions are given in Table I. Raman spectra were recorded using a LabRam microspectrometer from Jobin Yvon coupled with an argon ion laser. We used the 515.5 nm emission line for excitation with an incident power of 1 mW at the sample. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 113 v FTIR spectrometer as KBr pellets.

Figure 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction spectra of NaZr2?AsO4?3 ?R-3c space group? ?Chakir et al., 2003? and Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3. The latter shows extra peaks at low angles ?10° ?2??13°? that could not be indexed in the R-3c space group. The Miller indices of ?003? and ?101? are premited in R-3 and R32 space groups. As the isostructural phosphate Sr0.5Zr2?PO4?3 ?Fischer et al., 2004? crystallizes in the R-3 space group, the structure of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 was refined in this space group. The initial atomic coordinates used for the refinement were those of Sr0.5Zr2?PO4?3 ?Fischer et al., 2004?. The refinement, using 44 parameters, resulted in the conventional reliability factors Rp= 0.082, Rwp= 0.106, RF = 0.036, and RB= 0.067. The formula calculated from the occupancy values of Sr and Zr is “Sr0.495Zr1.985?AsO4?3.” The parameters of the equivalent hexagonal cell are ah = 8.965?2? Å and ch= 23.955?6? Å. The atomic positions and the most important interatomic distances and angles are given in Tables II and III, respectively. Figure 2 shows good agreement between the observed and calculated patterns. The structure of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 ?Figures 3 and 4? is similar to that of Sr0.5Zr2?PO4?3 ?Fischer et al., 2004?. I t consists of a 3D network of AsO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra linked by corners. The divalent ion Sr2+ fully occupies the 3b site of the R-3 space group ?the M1 site ?6b? in the R-3c space group splits in two M1 sites in R-3 ?i.e., ?3a? and ?3b???. The observed Sr–O distance ?2.604 Å? is slightly larger than that calculated ?2.54 Å? from the ionic radii of Sr2+ and O2− ?Shannon, 1976? indicating an ionic character of the Sr–O bond. The ordered occupation of the M1 site induces two types of ZrO6 octahedra: Zr?1?O6 octahedron which shares one face with the empty M1 site and Zr?2?O6 octahedron which shares one face with the M1 site occupied by Sr. The observed Zr–O distances ?Zr?1?−O?1?:3 ?2.072 Å; Zr?1?−O?3?:3?2.036 Å; Zr?2?−O?2?:3 ?2.030 Å; Zr?2?−O?4?:3?2.111 Å? are close to those calculated ?2.08 Å? from the ionic radii of Zr4+ and O2− ?Shannon, 1976?. The zirconium is off centered in the octahedron. Within the Zr?2?O6 octahedron, the Zr?2?–O?4? distance ?2.111 Å? is greater than the Zr?2?–O?2? distance ?2.030 Å? due to the O-O repulsions in the empty M1 site, along the c axis. Within the Zr?1?O6 octahedron, the Zr?1?– O?3? distance ?2.036 Å? is a little smaller than the Zr?1?–O?1? ?2.072 Å? distance because of the attraction between the O?1? oxygen atoms and the Sr2+ ions. The AsO4 tetrahedron is a little distorted with As-O distances and O-As-O angles that vary between 1.648 Å and 1.691 Å, and between 103.1° and 111.8°, respectively. Bond valence sums ??i =? exp??Rij−dij?/b? with b= 0.37 Å, dij: distance between i and j atoms, Rij is relative to O2−: 1.928 Å for Zr4+, 2.118 Å for Sr2+, and 1.767 Å for As5+? ?Brown and Altermatt, 1985; Brese and O’Keeffe, 1991? are in good agreement with the formal oxidation state expected for Zr4+ and As5+ ?Table II?. The low value in the case of Sr2+ may be due to the relatively high isotropic temperature factor of this ion. The cell parameters of the arsenate Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 ?ah = 8.965?2? Å, ch= 23.955?6? Å? are greater than those of the phosphate Sr0.5Zr2?PO4?3 ?ah= 8.6937?7? Å; ch = 23.299?1? Å? ?Fischer et al., 2004?. This variation can be explained in the context of the Nasicon-type structure, which is built of ?O3ZrO3M1O3ZrO3?? infinite rows connected by XO4 tetrahedra ?X=A s, P? in three dimensions. As the ionic radii of As5+ ?rAs5+= 0.335 Å? is larger than that of P5+ ?rP5+= 0.17 Å?, the lengths of the O-O tetrahedron edges increase when X= As, and consequently the cell parameters of arsenate Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 are larger than those found for phosphate Sr0.5Zr2?PO4?3.

Vibrational analysis for the isolated AsO43− anion with point group Td leads to four modes: A1??1?, E??2?, 2F2 ??3 and ?4?. All of them are Raman active, whereas only ?3 and ?4 are infrared active. The ?1 mode is the totally symmetric stretching vibrational mode of the AsO43− anion, ?2 is the doubly degenerate bending mode, ?3 is the triply degenerate stretching mode, and ?4 is the triply degenerate bending mode. In the free AsO43− anion, they are found at 837, 349, 878, and 463 cm−1, respectively ?Nakamoto, 1986?. I n Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 ?R-3 space group with Z= 6 f.u. per primitive unit cell? the arsenic and oxygen atoms occupy general positions ?C1 symmetry?. Therefore, from classical factorgroup analysis, we expect eight Raman-active modes, 2?1?Ag+Eg?+6?3?3Ag+3Eg?, and eight IR-active modes, 2?1?Au+Eu?+6?3?3Au+3Eu?, for the stretching vibrations and for the bending vibrations, we expect ten Raman-active modes, 4?2?2Ag+2Eg?+6?4?3Ag+3Eg?, and ten IR-active modes, 4?2?2A1u+2Eu?+6?4?3Au+3Eu?. The external modes consist of the translational vibrations of the Sr2+, Z r4+, and AsO43− ions and the rotational vibrations of the AsO43− ions.

Infrared and Raman spectra of Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 ?Figure 5? are similar to those obtained previously for NaZr2?AsO4?3 ?Chakir et al., 2003?. The high frequency parts ?800 to 1200 cm−1? of these spectra correspond to the stretching vibrations of the AsO43− tetrahedra. The Raman bands observed in the 800 to 1100 cm−1 region could be decomposed into five peaks located at 824, 854, 862, 942, and 970 cm−1, whereas five infrared bands are observed at 832, 874, 900, 947, and 1011 cm−1. The distinction between the ?1 and ?3 modes is no longer possible since the AsO43− anion site does not contain any symmetry element. These results are compatible with the factor-group analysis, which predicts eight Raman-active modes and eight IR-active modes; also, we notice that no overlap occurs between the IR- and Ramanactive modes, as expected for the centrosymmetric space group R-3. The four Raman peaks observed between 300 and 600 cm−1 ?i.e., 365, 412, 463, and 480 cm−1? are assigned to the different components of the ?2 and ?4 bending vibrations, whereas the predicted ones are ten. The peaks situated below 300 cm−1 are attributed to the external modes; four Raman peaks are observed between 150 and 300 cm−1 ?i.e., 160, 181, 211, and 252.5 cm−1?.

The arsenate Sr0.5Zr2?AsO4?3 has been synthesized and characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman, and infrared spectroscopies. Its structure, which belongs to the Nasicon type, has been refined in the R-3 space group. The structure is formed by a 3D network of ZrO6 octahedra and AsO4 tetrahedra linked by corners. The strontium ions occupy half of antiprismatic sites ?i.e., the M1 sites? located between two ZrO6 octahedra. Assignments of internal modes of the AsO4 tetrahedra have been made. The number of peaks observed in Raman and infrared spectra is in good agreement with that predicted by the factor-group analysis of the R-3 space group.
