NASICON-type Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 samples (0 B x B 0.2) have been synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction. Structural factors that affect Li conductivity were investigated with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The increment in lithium enhances Li–Li repulsions and increases Li conductivity of x = 0.1 samples with two orders of magnitude with respect to that of the stoichiometric x = 0 sample. In LiTi2(PO4)3 phase, Li ions mainly occupy sixfold M1 sites (CQ * 40 kHz), while in Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 samples, Li ions are also allocated near triangular windows that connect M1 and M2 cavities (CQ * 60 kHz). The Li rearrangement increases long-range motions of lithium. XRD and 31P MAS-NMR patterns showed variable amounts of secondary LiTiPO5, TiP2O7 and Li4P2O7 phases besides NASICON compounds. The formation of non-conducting secondary phases at the surface of NASICON particles decreases overall conductivity of x = 0.2 samples. The Li1.4Ti1.9(PO4)3 (x = 0.1 sample) prepared at 800 °C displays at room temperature high ‘‘bulk’’ conductivity, 1.6 9 10-4 S cm-1, low activation energy, 0.30 eV, and good overall DC conductivity, 2.7 9 10–6 S cm-1. The small amount of secondary phases detected in this sample makes it a good candidate for solid electrolyte in all solid-state batteries.

In next decades, Li-ion batteries (LIBs) will play an important role in a wide variety of energy storage applications, such as portable electronic devices, electrical energy storage systems (ESSs) and electric vehicles (EVs). At present, the improvement of batteries passes through the substitution of organic liquid by solid-state electrolytes and solving problems related to safety and durability [1, 2]. Thus, the development of new solid-state electrolytes, with enhanced Li transport properties will offer the possibility for developing new energy storage technologies [3].

Various types of inorganic solid-state electrolyte based on perovskite [4], garnet [5, 6], sulﬁdes [7] and NASICON-type materials [8, 9] have been used as solid-state electrolytes in Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Among them, NASICON-type materials have attracted increasing interest because of its high ionic conductivity at room temperature and chemical stability in air and water atmospheres [8].

In general, LiM2(PO4)3 materials (M = Ti4?, Ge4?) display rhombohedral symmetry (S.G. R3C) [8–10], but in some cases (M = Sn4?, Zr4?, Hf4?), it displays a triclinic symmetry at low temperature (S.G. C1) [11–13]. In NASICON compounds, M2(PO4)3 units are linked to form three-dimensional networks. In rhombohedral phases, Li cations can be allocated at two different sites: (1) in M1 sites 6b (0, 0, 0), lithium is sixfold coordinated at ternary axes, and (2) in M2 cavities, lithium adopts different positions around 18e (x, 0, 1/4) sites [8]. M1 and M2 positions alternate along three-dimensional conduction channels.

The LiTi2(PO4)3 framework is suitable for partial substitution of Ti4? by trivalent Al3?, Sc3?, Cr3?, Ga3?, In3? or Fe3? [8, 9, 14–18], tetravalent Zr4? [19] or pentavalent Nb5? cations [20]. In rhombohedral (M3? = Al3? or Sc3?) phases, Li1?xMxTi2-x(PO4)3 several groups have reported an important increment in conductivity (* 10–3 S cm-1) that makes NASICON compounds one of the best Li? ion conductors among inorganic solid compounds at room temperature [8, 9, 14]. In these phases, Li ions are located at 6b (M1) and 36f (M3 sites of M2 cavities) along conduction pathways [8, 9, 17, 18]. However, the substitution of Ti4? by Sc3? or Al3? favors the formation of secondary phases that limit overall conductivity.

In several works, the preparation of Ti-defective phases derived from LiTi2(PO4)3 has been reported [21, 22]. In previous works, the preparation of Tidefective Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 conductors was reported but the lithium arrangement was not discussed [21]. The preparation of Ti-defective Li1?xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 (LTAP) samples by the ceramic route has also been described [22]. Recently, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) has been used as a template for hydrothermal preparation of LATP-defective samples [23].

In the present work, titanium-defective Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 (0 B x B 0.2) samples have been prepared by solid-state reaction at 800 and 900 °C. The formation of secondary phases was followed by XRD and NMR techniques, but 31P and 7Li MAS-NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze structural modiﬁcations that accompany the creation of Ti defects in NASICON phases. Finally, Li mobility was investigated with 7Li MAS-NMR and electric impedance techniques.

Li14xTi2-x(PO4)3 (0 B x B 0.2) samples have been prepared by solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of high purity Li2CO3 ([ 99%, Merck), TiO2 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and (NH4)2HPO4 ([ 97%, Roth) reagents were used as starting materials. The reagents were ﬁrst dried at 120 °C for 10 h to remove any trace of water, and then mixed and ground in an agate mortar before heating at 800 or 900 °C for 2 h in platinum crucibles (crystallization step) [9, 20].

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at room temperature using the Cu Ka radiation in a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (40 kV and 30 mA). These patterns were recorded on the 2h 10°– 70° range, with an angular step of 0.02° and a counting time/step of 0.5 s. Crystalline phases were identiﬁed using data reported by International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD). Unit cell parameters were deduced with the Fullprof program [24, 25]). In a second stage, structural models of phases were investigated [8].

6Li, 7Li and 31P MAS-NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature in an AVANCE-400 Bruker spectrometer (9.4 T magnetic ﬁeld). The frequencies used for 6Li, 7Li and 31P NMR signals were 58.88, 155.45 and 161.97 MHz.

NMR spectra were recorded with the MAS technique (rotation of samples at 10 kHz around an axis inclined 54°440 with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld). The number of scans was chosen in the range 100–800. 7Li and 31P NMR components were referred to 1 M LiCl and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solutions.


The ﬁtting of NMR spectra was performed with the Winﬁt program (Bruker) [26] that allowed the position, line width and intensity of components to be determined with a nonlinear least square iterative method. In quantitative determinations, spinning sidebands of all components were considered. In 31P MAS-NMR spectra, the presence of secondary phases was discussed on the basis of the Li2O–TiO2–P2O5 diagram (Fig. 1) In 7Li MAS-NMR spectra, quadrupole CQ and asymmetry g parameters were deduced with trial and error procedures.

The microstructure of pellets was investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Sintered pellets were deposited on a metallic support and coated with a gold ﬁlm before analysis in a JEOL 6400 electron microscope, operating at 20 kV.

Electrical measurements were performed on ceramic pellets, obtained by applying an uniaxial pressure of 120 MPa and 12 h sintering at 800 °C. In all cases, density of pellets was above 85%. Ceramic pellets were polished and opposite faces metalized with gold pastes. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed under vacuum atmosphere with a 4L-conﬁguration upon heating and cooling runs (10 K intervals) in a JANIS VPF 750 cryostat. An automatically controlled Agilent Precision LCR low-frequency E4980-A analyzer was used for

XRD patterns of Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) samples, crystallized at 800 and 900 °C, are shown in Fig. 2. In analyzed samples, main detected peaks correspond to the rhombohedral R3c NASICON phase reported by JCDPS (File No. 035-0754).

The formation of LiTi2(PO4)3 phase can be described by the reaction Li2CO3 þ 4TiO2 þ 6ðNH4Þ2HPO4

However, during formation of Ti-defective Li1?4xTi2-x(PO4)3 samples, XRD peaks of LiTiPO5 (JCDPS No. 044-0083), TiP2O7 (JCPDS No. 052-1470) and Li4P2O7 (JCDPS No. 013-0440) phases were detected

The presence of TiP2O7 in the x = 0 sample heated at 900 °C has been ascribed to the incomplete reaction of starting reagents. Secondary LiTiPO5 and Li4P2O7 phases are almost absent in Li1.4Ti1.9(PO4)3, but increased with the Li content and preparation temperature. The presence of these phases indicates that not all lithium is incorporated in NASICON phases.

As a consequence of ionic radii of Li? and Ti4? ions (rLi? = 0.730 A˚ , rTi4? = 0.605 A˚ ), unit cell a and c parameters increase with the Li content, increasing more when going from x = 0 to 0.1 than from 0.1 to 0.2 in samples prepared at 800 °C [30]. In samples prepared at 900 °C, changes detected in unit cell parameters were not similar in two compositions.

In 7Li MAS-NMR spectra of NASICON phases, two signals were detected at * 1 ppm. The narrow (CQcomponent displays quadrupole * 35 kHz and g = 0) of lithium at M1 sites [8]. The broad component, displaying higher quadrupole constants (CQ * 55 kHz and g = 0.3), was assigned to Li ions at more distorted M12 sites. Both components become visible in external spinning sidebands of spectra (left inset of Fig. 4). The enlargement of the last component suggests the presence of higher Li–P or Li–Li dipolar interactions at M12 sites.

In x = 0.1 sample prepared at 800 °C, local motions of lithium decrease line width of central components (Fig. 4). In samples prepared at 900 °C, however, the central components become broader, indicating that Li ions reside longer times at more distorted M12 sites where dipolar Li–P interactions are higher [8] (Table 3). At 150 °C, Li exchanges between M1 and M12 sites become faster reducing the line width (0.34 ppm) of (Fig. 5, Table 4).

In 7Li MAS-NMR spectra, a third broad component was detected near 0.5 ppm that displayed a larger quadrupole constant, 90 kHz. The detection of this component was favored in 6Li MAS-NMR spectra, where quadrupole and Li–Li dipolar interactions decreased considerably (Fig. 5). Based on NMR and XRD results, this component was ascribed to LiTiPO5 and Li4P2O7 phases, where Li displays lower mobility (Table 4).

Precise density measurements were performed in analyzed samples. Densities (qrs) of sintered disks were measured with the Archimedes method, using distilled water as intrusion medium. Density values

Li1?xTi2-x(PO4)3 (0 B x B 0.2) phases, prepared at 800 and 900 °C by solid-state reaction, were characterized with XRD, SEM and NMR techniques. In Lipoor (R3c) phases, Li ions are preferentially allocated at M1 sites but in Ti-defective Li-richer samples, Li ions are also disposed at distorted M12 windows. In these samples, the creation of vacant M1 sites increases Li mobility along conduction paths.

The detection of TiP2O7 in x = 0 sample suggests the presence of Li-poor boundaries that hinder 2 lm particles to grow. In Li-richer x = 0.1 samples, the particles size increased from 4 to 10 lm, remaining only 10 lm particles in x = 0.2 samples.

The formation of secondary LiTiPO5 and Li4P2O7 phases at the NASICON particles surface decreases overall conductivity of ceramic pellets. The small amount of secondary phases detected in x = 0.1 makes this sample a good candidate for solid electrolytes in ASS batteries.
