Sodium super-ionic conductor (NASICON) structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), benefits by its unique three-dimensional (3D) channel structure. However, the inherent characteristics of NVP (such as low electrical conductivity) usually lead to inferior rate and long-cycling performance, which miss the requirements of practical application in electrical energy storage systems (ESSs). Herein, we propose the synthesis of porous high-crystalline Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanoplates (NVP/C-P) via hydrothermal method and post-calcination. The porous nanoplate structure provides increased specific surface area and shortened diffusion pathway for ion/electron transport. Consequently, NVP/C-P cathodes exhibit a high specific capacity (117 mAh g−1, 0.2 C), exceptional rate performance (76.5 mAh g−1, 100 C) and long cyclic stability (10,000 cycles).

Recently, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered as one of the most promising high-performance energy storage devices, owing to abundant sodium resources, suitable redox potential, and similar intercalation chemistry compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, suffering from larger cation radius of Na+ compared to Li+, SIBs usually exhibit poor rate capability, low energy density and short cycle life [9], [10]. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop novel cathode materials with open structure and large interstitial space for Na+ migration. Cathode materials are a key component to determine the electrochemical performance of batteries [11], [12]. Therefore, cathode materials for SIBs, such as layered transition-metal oxides (TMO) [13], [14], [15], [16], tunnel-type oxides [17], phosphates [18], [19], fluorides [20], hexacyanoferrates [21] and organic compounds [22] have been widely investigated. Among these materials, NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) shows unique advantages due to its good thermal stability, moderate potential plateaus and 3D-open frameworks with large interstitial channels etc [23], [24]. However, the practical application of NVP is hampered by the inherent low electronic conductivity, which usually results in inferior rate capabilities and poor cycling stability.

To solve this problem, various strategies, such as introducing surface-coated carbon network [25], [26], [27], [28], nanocrystallization [29], [30], doping [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], and morphology control [36], [37], [38] have been developed to optimize the performance of NVP. Zhang et al. [39] designed honeycomb-type hierarchical porous microballs, which are composed of hierarchical pores and abundant nanochannels. This material displayed a high rate capability of 80.2 mAh g−1 at 20 C and good cyclic performance. The capacity retention was 93.6% at 1 C after 200 cycles and 81.9% at 20 C after 100 cycles. It reveals that hierarchical porous nanostructures and 3D continuous conductive frameworks have fast reaction kinetics and superior crystal stability upon cycling. Additionally, Cao’s group successfully prepared porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes [40], which showed a good rate capability (87.7 mAh g−1 at 100 C). Significantly, a good cyclic stability with 0.0048% capacity fading per cycles over 10,000 cycles can be obtained by the porous carbon-coated NVP cathode. Previously reported works suggest that particle morphology and porous structure may significantly affect the electrochemical properties of NVP-based materials.

In this work, we design and prepare porous high-crystalline Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanoplates (NVP/C-P) by a hydrothermal reaction method. This high crystalline nature, nanolayer carbon coating and porous nanoplate morphology could provide easy accessibility of electrolyte into the active materials, reduce the diffusion pathways for ions, and therefore improve utilization ratio of active materials, which lead to superior rate capacities and cyclic stability. When applied as cathodes for SIBs, NVP/C-P delivered a high specific capacity (117 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capacity (76.5 mAh g−1 at 100 C) and superior long-term cycling stability (10,000 cycles).

All chemicals were purchased from Aladdin (China) and were not purified during use. The NVP/C-P was prepared via a hydrothermal method with post-calcination. In a typical synthesis process, 1 mmol V2O5 was dispersed into 30 mL N, N-dimethylformamide (C3H7NO, DMF) followed by stirring for 0.5 h at 70 °C (denoted as solution A). Then, de-ionized water (10 mL), NaH2PO4 (3 mmol), Na2CO3 (0.05 mmol) and oxalic acid (5 mmol) were added into above solution A. Subsequently, the obtained solution was removed into a 50 mL Teflon reactor for a 24-hour hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C. Next, the precursor was collected by filtering after sonicating for 2 h and dried at 70 °C overnight to remove de-ionized water and DMF. Finally, the NVP/C-P was obtained after calcining the precursor under flowing H2/Ar (5/95 in vol.) atmosphere at 750 °C for 8 h. Bulk Na3V2(PO4)3/C particles (NVP/C particles) was synthesized following the same route of NVP/C-P except using water as the sole solvent. Bare Na3V2(PO4)3 (bare NVP) were prepared using less oxalic acid (3 mmol) with the same route as NVP/C particles.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was tested through a Bruker-AXS/D8 Advance powder diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were performed by SU8010 and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were collected via JEM-2010. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) were conducted using Tecnai G2-F20. Roman spectra were performed using HR-800 spectrometer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) were measured via a NanoMan VS atomic force microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded via a Thermo Fisher Scientific/Escalab250Xi spectrometer to analyze the chemical state of samples. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area were carried out via a Tristar II 3020 instrument. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA/DSC7 in air at temperature range from 25 °C to 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 heating rates.

The electrochemical performance was investigated by fabricating CR2032 half cells in an Ar-protected glove box. The slurries were made by mixing samples, acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene (weight ratio = 7:2:1) with N–methyl–2–pyrrolidone and grinding for 0.5 h. Then, working electrodes were obtained by pasting the above slurries on the aluminum foils and drying at 80 °C under vacuum oven overnight. The mass loading of cathode materials was 1.0–1.2 mg cm−2. Glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/D) were selected to be separators. The electrolyte was a hybrid of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate with equal volumes containing 1 M NaClO4 with 5 vol% fluoroethylene carbonate additive. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out using electrochemical workstations (CHI 660E), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 0.01 Hz–100 kHz). Battery testers (Land CT2001A) were used for galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles, rate performance and cyclic life capability.

The as-prepared NVP/C-P was obtained through hydrothermal synthesis followed by annealing process (seen in the Scheme 1). Excess oxalic acid not only plays a role as the primary chelating agent and carbon source but also produces pores during hydrothermal process and high-temperature calcinations [41]. In addition, a small amount of sodium carbonate was added to the solution system, which can compensate for sodium loss within the high temperature calcination. Meanwhile, the decomposition of sodium carbonate can generate carbon dioxide and facilitate the formation of pore structure. As an “anti-solvent” reagent, DMF has been reported to decrease the polarity of solvent and limit the solubility of raw materials, therefore suppressing the growth of particles and facilitating the crystal nucleation, which is helpful for the construction of nanostructure [25]. Meanwhile, Ostwald ripening process may help nanoplates grow into large size [29], [30]. Excess oxalic acid synergizes with DMF reagent to construct this carbon coated porous nanoplate structure, which is expected to provide a larger electrode-electrolyte contact area and shorter diffusion distance, leading to the enhanced reaction kinetics. In addition, NVP/C particles and bare NVP were also prepared for comparison. NVP/C particles was prepared using a similar route as NVP/C-P except for using water only. Bare NVP was synthesized via the same route as NVP/C particles except for the application of a smaller amount of oxalic acid.

XRD was performed to examine crystal structure and phase of materials (Fig. 1a). It can be seen that all three NVP-based materials have similar diffraction peaks, which correspond to the R-3c space group and NASICON-type structure [42] (JCPDS No. 53-0018). Impurity phase is not found in XRD patterns, which suggests the successful synthesis of NVP cathode materials. Notably, the synthesized NVP/C-P shows sharper and more intense diffraction peaks than other two samples, indicating its high crystallinity. Fig. 1b presents the crystal structure of NVP. It’s worth noting that this NASICON-type structure contains numerous open frameworks with 3D channels for Na+ migration. Therefore, the NVP-based materials generally exhibit higher sodium ion mobility than other cathode materials, thereby showing improved sodium storage performance. Moreover, XPS measurement was conducted to detect the valence states of elements in the materials. All elements in the as-prepared NVP/C-P (including Na, V, O, P and C) are marked on overall XPS spectrum (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). Fig. 1c shows the binding energy of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 at 516.3 and 523.4 eV, respectively, corresponding to V3+ in NVP [43]. This suggests that V5+ from V2O5 precursor is successfully reduced to V3+. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement was introduced to verify the porous structure of the synthesized materials. Figs. 1d and S2a, b (Supporting information) demonstrate that NVP/C-P and NVP/C particles have the similar characteristic with a typical H3 hysteresis loop within a P/P0 range of 0.5 to 1.0, revealing the existence of mesopores and micropores. Furthermore, the BJH pore-size distributions of NVP-based materials are shown as insets in the Figs. 1d and S2a, b (Supporting Information), respectively. The pore sizes are mainly distributed at the range of 1–50 nm. The BET results prove that the addition of excess oxalic acid can effectively facilitate the formation of porous structures. The surface area of three samples are about 33.3 (NVP/C-P), 27.1 (NVP/C particles) and 16.2 m2 g−1 (bare NVP), respectively. The NVP/C-P has the largest specific surface area compared with other two materials, which indicates that nanoplate structure can provide increased contact area with more active sites. This will improve accessibility of electrolyte ions to the electrode.

The morphology of the as-prepared materials was observed by SEM. As displayed in Fig. 2a, b, NVP/C-P shows nanoplate-like morphology. Combining with AFM (Fig. S3, Supporting Information) results, the thickness of NVP/C-P is at the range of 20–50 nm and the size is determined to be in the range of 200–500 nm. Instead of forming nanoplate structure, the NVP/C particles and bare NVP show bulk-particle morphology (Fig. S4a, b, Supporting Information). Therefore, we can conclude that DMF plays a pivotal role in obtaining nanoplate-like structure by acting as a solvent and a stabilizer to limit the growth of particles [24].

HRTEM images exhibited the details of the microstructure and crystallinity of the material. As shown in Fig. 2c, NVP/C-P possesses the porous architecture as highlighted by the white circles. In Fig. 2d, we can clearly see lattice fringes of amorphous carbon, which is derived from the carbonization of excess oxalic acid. The thickness of carbon layer is about 3 nm. Moreover, we conducted Raman spectrum test for all three samples. As shown in Fig. S5 (Supporting Information), all Raman spectra of the three samples show two broad peaks which should be assigned to the disorder-induced phonon mode (D-band) and graphite band (G-band) at 1356.98 and 1604.45 cm−1, respectively. The ID/IG ratio of NVP/C-P is 0.94. It indicates the presence of amorphous carbon. The carbon content measured by TGA is about 2.9% (shown in Fig. S6, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, Fig. S7 (Supporting Information) shows the XRD patterns of the burnt products of NVP/C-P at different temperatures (including 400, 600 and 800 °C) in air. When the temperature increases to 250 °C, the weight begins to decrease as a result of the oxidation of carbon and carbon is burnt out until about 400 °C, while there is nearly no change for Na3V2(PO4)3 according to the XRD pattern. After 400 °C, the weight increases because Na3V2(PO4)3 reacts with oxygen and is oxidized to form Na2(VP2O8). Fig. 2d also shows the lattice fringes with d-spacing of 2.79 Å, which can be assigned to (1 1 6) lattice plane of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3. Meanwhile, highly arrayed diffraction spots in selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) image (Fig. 2e), which are indexed to (0 1 2), (1 0 4) and (0 2 4) along the [4 2 –1] zone axis, suggest the single-crystal nature of the individual NVP/C-P nanoplates. The elemental mappings of NVP/C-P (Fig. 2f) indicate that Na, V, P, O and C elements are uniformly dispersed throughout the NVP/C-P.

The electrochemical performance of all NVP-based electrodes was studied using CR2030 coin cells. The CV curves of three samples as shown in Fig. 3a were collected at the voltage window at 2.5–4.0 V (vs. Na+/Na) within a scanning speed of 0.1 mV s−1. All electrodes exhibit a pair of redox peaks at about 3.4 V, which are ascribed to V3+/V4+ redox couple [44]. The potential gap between the anodic and cathodic peak of NVP/C-P is 12.7 mV, which is lower than those of NVP/C particles (13.9 mV) and bare NVP (17.8 mV), indicating NVP/C-P possesses the lowest electrochemical polarization among three samples. Moreover, the NVP/C-P electrode delivers the highest current density compared with NVP/C particles and bare NVP electrodes, suggesting enhanced redox kinetics and reversibility. This can be ascribed to the optimization effect for the porous nanoplate structure. Fig. 3b presents the first galvanostatic charge-discharge voltage profiles of three as-prepared materials tested at 0.5 C. All charge-discharge curves have a typical plateau at around 3.4 V, revealing that the electrochemical process involves a two-phase reaction mechanism, as described in following Eq. 

In addition, the initial specific capacity of NVP/C-P is up to 113.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C, corresponding to 96.7% theoretical capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3. It is higher than those of NVP/C particles (103.4 mAh g−1) and bare NVP (79.3 mAh g−1). Furthermore, Fig. 3c demonstrates the galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of NVP/C-P at different rates ranging from 0.2 C to 50 C. As revealed in Fig. 3c, stable voltage profile can be retained, even at 50 C, which indicates the fast kinetics of NVP/C-P cathode material. Fig. 3d compares the rate capabilities of three samples. The NVP/C-P electrodes delivered specific capacity of 117, 113.5, 109.5, 105, 103.7, 101.7, 99.5, 98.0 and 87.3 mAh g−1, respectively, corresponding to a rate increase from 0.2 C to 50 C. Notably, a specific capacity of 76.5 mAh g−1 (about 65% of its theoretical capacity) is still retained at an ultra-high rate of 100 C. Moreover, once the current density reverses back to initial 0.2 C, the specific capacity of 117 mAh g−1 is attained as well, demonstrating the high reversibility of NVP/C-P. By contrast, the NVP/C particles and bare NVP samples show inferior rate performance. It is obvious that the NVP/C-P shows the best electrochemical performance among three samples both in rate capacity and cyclic stability.

Cyclic stability is a key factor to assess the merits of the electrode materials. Fig. 4a presents the cycling data of three electrodes. The capacity retention of NVP/C-P is 97.2%, which is much better than those of NVP/C particles (91.5%) and bare NVP electrodes (79.5%) at 0.5 C after 100 cycles. Moreover, the retention of NVP/C-P still reaches 90.4% after 2000 cycles when increasing the current density to 5 C. This demonstrated that NVP/C-P shows the best cycling performance among three samples (shown in Fig. 4b). The Coulombic efficiencies of all samples maintain at approximately 100% at 0.5 C and 5 C (illustrated in Figs. S8 and 9, Supporting Information), indicating the rigid structure of NVP crystals. Notably, the NVP/C-P electrode exhibits a super long cyclic stability. As shown in Fig. 4c, ∼ 82.6% of initial capacity is retained for over 10,000 cycles even at an ultra-high rate of 50 C, which is much higher than reported cathode materials for SIBs as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Furthermore, from SEM and TEM images of NVP/C-P before and after 200 cycles at a rate of 30 C (Fig. S10, Supporting Information), we can confirm that there is nearly no morphology change during cycling, which indicates the good cyclic stability of NVP/C-P. In addition, we compared the cycling performance of the NVP/C-P with 10%, 15% and 20% of conductive agents at rates of 1 C and 30 C. As shown in Figs. S11 and S12 (Supporting Information), the capacity retentions of NVP/C-P with different amounts of conductive agents are similar at both high and low current density. It can prove that the cycling performance of NVP/C-P does not closely relate to the amount of conductive agent.

EIS were measured to investigate the electrode kinetics for the three samples. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots collected after 2-cycle activation and the corresponding equivalent circuit. All three samples display a depressed semicircle at high-frequency region, corresponding to charge-transfer impedance (Rct) and an inclined line at low-frequency region, assigned to Warburg impedance (Zw) [46], [47]. Based on the fitted results of simulated equivalent circuit (Table S2, Supporting Information), NVP/C-P demonstrates the lowest impedance Rct (119.8 Ω) compared with other two samples (bare NVP 297.3 Ω and NVP/C particles 138.6 Ω). This indicates that carbon-coated porous nanoplate structure greatly enhances the electronic conductivity of electrode materials. Furthermore, the presented Na+ diffusion coefficients were calculated based on the straight line at low frequency region presented in Fig. 5b and Note S1 (Supporting Information). The calculated Na+ ion diffusion coefficient value of electrodes are 1.26 × 10–11, 6.59 × 10–12 and 4.51 × 10–12 cm2 s−1 for NVP/C-P, NVP/C particles and bare NVP, respectively. Because of the formation of a suitable carbon coating and porous nanoplate structure, NVP/C-P shows the highest Na+ diffusion coefficient among all samples, illustrating faster diffusion kinetics and electron transport.

In summary, we have successfully prepared carbon coated porous high-crystalline Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanoplates (NVP/C-P) as cathode material for the sodium-ion batteries. The NVP/C-P electrode demonstrated an excellent electrochemical performance, in terms of a high specific capacity with 117 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a superior rate capacity with 76.5 mAh g−1 at 100 C. Furthermore, NVP/C-P also revealed an ultralong cycling stability with 82.6% of initial capacity retention over 10,000 cycles at 50 C. These superior electrochemical properties are ascribed to the following factors: (i) nanolayer coated carbon increases the electronic conductivity for electrode materials; (ii) the porous structure facilitates the electrolyte diffusion in electrodes. These features synergistically improve the electrochemical properties of NVP/C-P and then endow it a promising cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.
