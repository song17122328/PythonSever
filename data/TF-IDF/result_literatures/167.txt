NASICON-structured sodium vanadium fluorophosphate has caused widespread concern for sodium energy conversion and storage because of its high voltage platform and high theoretical energy density. However, the inferior electrical conductivity is still a big problem, which greatly prevent the applications of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 material. Herein, the nitrogen-doped graphene-encapsulated Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C (NG-NVPF@C) has been prepared using the sol-gel approach. The physical and electrochemical performances for the resulted NG-NVPF@C composite have been systematically characterized and compared with that of Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C (NVPF@C) in this study. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that the as-fabricated NG-NVPF@C displays higher capacity, superior rate property and better cyclic life than NVPF@C. It displays the discharge capacity of 108.6 mAh g−1 at 5C. Moreover, it also possesses the high capacity of 101.6 mAh g−1 at 10C over 300 cycles with the capacity retention of about 96.5%. The improved properties of NG-NVPF@C electrode are assigned to the constructed conductive network by nitrogen-doped graphene, which can modify the conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)2F3.
Na-ion battery has been researched as the alternative to Li-ion battery due to the abundant sodium resource and low cost [1–3]. Nevertheless, the ionic radius of Na-ion is bigger than that of Li-ion, which can increase the diffusion barrier during the charging/discharging procedure. As a result, this reason greatly prevents the practical applications of Na-ion battery. Thus, it is a big problem to explore ideal electrodes with superior electrochemical properties for Na-ion battery. In the past decade, many materials such as Na2FeSiO4 [4,5], Na3V2(PO4)3 [6], NaCoPO4 [7], Na3V2(PO4)2F3 [8,9] as well as Na2FeP2O7 [10], have been widely prepared and studied as the novel cathodes for sodium energy conversion and storage.
Typically, NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has caused widespread concern for rechargeable Na-ion battery due to its high voltage platform (3.95 V) and high power density (0.507 kWh kg−1) [11–13]. Two Na-ions can be extracted/inserted from/into the lattice of Na3V2(PO4)2F3, leading to a high theoretical capacity of 128 mAh g−1 [14]. Nevertheless, the inferior electrical conductivity is still a big problem, which greatly prevent the applications of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 electrode in sodium energy storage [15,16]. Up to the present, the effective strategies to address this obstacle of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 have focused on reducing the particle size [12,17], doping with other ions [18–20] and coating with carbon materials [8,21–24]. Typically, construction of conductive networks by various carbon materials is a promising strategy to modify the apparent conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 material. For example, Wang's group prepared the carbon-decorated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanocomposite which exhibited the 100th capacity of about 112 mAh g−1 at 1C [22]. Recently, Du's group reported that the designed Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C exhibited the specific capacity of 41 mAh g−1 at 100C over 5000 cycles due to the enhanced bicontinuous electron pathway [16]. Although great advances have been developed, the poor high-rate property and bad cyclic stability remain the big challenges and need to be further improved. Recently, two-dimensional graphene sheet has been considered as the promising additive to improve the rate capabilities of electrodes due to the excellent chemical stability, large surface area, good flexibility and high electronic conductivity [12,25,26]. Liang's group [15] reported that the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 microcubes embedded in graphene sheets were fabricated through a one-step hydrothermal approach and the obtained cathode displayed a high capacity retention of about 95% after 400 cycles at 10C. The results reveal that the conductive graphene plays a key role in improving the battery property of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 material. Meanwhile, it has been proved that nitrogen-doping in graphene is a promising strategy to tailor the performance of pristine graphene [27].
In this research, we have designed and prepared the NG-NVPF@C nanocomposite as an advanced electrode for electrochemical energy storage through the sol-gel route. The resulted material is studied by XPS, Raman spectrum, XRD, TEM, HRTEM, SEM and several electrochemical measurements. The obtained result demonstrates that the high-purity NVPF@C nanocrystals are anchored on the nitrogen-doped graphene sheet. Benefiting from the formed conductive networks by nitrogen-doped graphene and carbon coating, the NG-NVPF@C electrode displays superior battery properties such as high specific capacity, stable cyclic property and good rate capability, making it a novel cathode for Na-ion battery.
Nitrogen-doped graphene was fabricated by using a simple route using NH3 as the dopant source. Firstly, the graphene oxide was prepared by the modified Hummers route from the natural graphite flake as reported in the literature [28]. Secondly, the resulted graphene oxide sheets were irradiated in the microwave oven (1.1 kW, 60 s) and then heated at 850 °C for 90 min in the NH3/Ar atmosphere. Finally, the asfabricated nitrogen-doped graphene was washed with ethyl alcohol and heated at 70 °C overnight.
The designed NG-NVPF@C composite for sodium energy storage was synthesized via the sol-gel route. Firstly, stoichiometric amounts of sodium fluoride, ammonium metavanadate and ammodium dihydrogen phosphate were put into the distilled water with stirring. Secondly, the appropriate contents of glucose and nitrogen-doped graphene were put into the distilled water under stirring at 25 °C for 30 min. The two solutions were then mixed slowly under stirring for 5 h. After heating at 75 °C for 8 h, the obtained gel was sintered at 700 °C for 12 h in N2/H2 condition to obtain the NG-NVPF@C. The NVPF@C composite was synthesized using the same process except for the addition of nitrogendoped graphene.
The phase structures for the resulted powders were investigated with XRD with CuKα radiation. Raman spectrum was also investigated through a Raman spectroscope. The nanostructures for the two composites were analyzed by TEM. The morphologies for the composites were analyzed by SEM. XPS was also performed to analyze the compositions of NG-NVPF@C powder. The carbon contents for the composites were measured using an elemental analyzer.
The sodium storage performances for the synthesized electrode materials were measured by the CR2016 cells. The cathode was synthesized by mixing PVDF, carbon black and positive material (10:15:75) in NMP. The resulted slurries were covered on the Al film and dried at 80 °C. The mass loading of the prepared active material is about 2.7 mg cm−2. The coin-cell was prepared in the glovebox with sodium film as the negative electrode. The glassfiber and 1 M NaClO4 in EC/DEC (1/1) were used as the separator and electrolyte. EIS test was performed to study the battery performances for the electrodes by using the CHI660C electrochemical workstation. CV curves for the as-fabricated cathodes were also tested using this electrochemical workstation. The rate capabilities for the electrodes were measured by the LAND tester between 3.0 and 4.6 V. Note that the reversible capacities of NVPF@C and NG-NVPF@C electrodes were calculated based on the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 material.
To investigate the structures of NVPF@C and NG-NVPF@C, XRD measurement was carried out as shown in Fig. 1a. All the patterns of both composites reveal that the tetragonal NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 phase has been formed using the simple sol-gel route. No other impurities can be observed, demonstrating the well-crystallized and high-purity of the two composites. The above results are consistent with the formerly published literatures [12,15,16,29]. What's more, no diffraction patterns of the residual carbon coating or nitrogendoped graphene sheets are detected for the fabricated composites, which can be assigned to the amorphous condition.
Fig. 1b illustrates the Raman spectra of the obtained powders. Clearly, two peaks can be detected at 1346 and 1586 cm−1, which correspond to the D- and G-peak respectively [17]. Herein, the D- and G-peak represent to the sp3 and sp2 hybrids of carbon atoms, indicating the existence of carbon material in the designed composite [11,17]. The intensity ratios between D-peak and G-peak of the resulted NVPF@C and NG-NVPF@C are calculated to be about 1.02 and 0.97, respectively. The result demonstrates that the carbon materials exhibit a high degree of graphitization in the designed NG-NVPF@C powder. The V2p,C1s and N1s high-resolution XPS spectra of NG-NVPF@C sample are presented in Fig. 1c–e. The V2p spectrum (Fig. 1c) shows two typical peaks located at 517.5 and 524.7 eV, which correspond to the energy level of V2p3/2 and V2p1/2 respectively [30]. The result demonstrates that the V5+ has been reduced to V3+ after sintering under N2/H2 condition. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the typical peak at 284.7 eV is C1s emission [8,12], suggesting the presence of carbon in NG-NVPF@C. Fig. 1e shows the XPS spectrum of N1s (400.0 eV), revealing that nitrogen element has been doped into the lattice of graphene sheets.
SEM images for the resulted powders are displayed in Fig. 2. A s presented in Fig. 2a–c, it is observed that the average particle size for the NVPF@C powder is about 185 nm. These small crystals play an important role in reducing the diffusion distance for Na+ and thus improve the extraction/insertion of Na+ [12]. For the NG-NVPF@C sample (Fig. 2d–f), the NVPF@C crystals are dispersed in the nitrogendoped graphene sheet, which can modify the conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 [15,17]. TEM and HRTEM images for the resulted composites are illustrated in Fig. 3. As displayed in Fig. 3a and b, the NVPF@C sample shows a regular morphology with the particle size of about 80–240 nm. HRTEM image shown in Fig. 3c indicates that the surface of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 nanocrystal is covered by a thin carbon coating decomposed from the added glucose. After adding the nitrogendoped graphene sheets (Fig. 3d–f), the NVPF@C crystals are anchored on the nitrogen-doped graphene. Note that the content of residual carbon of NVPF@C and NG-NVPF@C powders are 3.4 wt% and 5.5 wt %, respectively.
The 1st charge/discharge profiles and cycling stabilities for the asfabricated cathodes at 0.1C are displayed in Fig. 4. Based on the results of Fig. 4a, the designed NG-NVPF@C cathode displays the 1st charging and discharging capacities of 125.7 and 122.5 mAh g−1 with the high Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%. Nevertheless, the NVPF@C electrode shows the low discharge capacity of 119.4 mAh g−1, corresponding to the 93.3% of its theoretical capacity. It is observed from Fig. 4b that the NVPF@C shows the capacity of 114.9 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles. For the NG-NVPF@C electrode, the 20th specific capacity of 121.7 mAh g−1 is reached, revealing a good reversibility of Na+ extraction/insertion [8,15]. The above cycling behavior indicates that the designed NGNVPF@C electrode presents a stable cycling performance for Na-ion battery.
Fig. 5a shows the rate properties for the fabricated NVPF@C and NG-NVPF@C cathodes. The NG-NVPF@C cathode shows superior rate capability than NVPF@C at each current rate. The cycling stabilities for the obtained cathodes are displayed in Fig. 5b. The NVPF@C electrode displays low discharge capacities of 117.2, 114.0, 109.7, 104.1 and 94.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5C, respectively. For the designed NG-NVPF@C cathode, it displays high capacities of 121.6, 119.4, 116.5 and 112.8 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2C, respectively. Even at 5C, the 1st discharging capacity of 108.6 mAh g−1 can still be reached. Moreover, the capacity of NG-NVPF@C can recover to 120.4 mAh g−1 while the rate returns to 0.2C. Fig. 5c illustrates the long-cycle capability for NG-NVPF@C at 10C for 300 cycles. The NG-NVPF@C electrode displays the initial capacity of 105.3 mAh g−1 at 10C. It also displays the capacity of 101.6 mAh g−1 over 300 cycles with the low capacity fading ratio of about 3.5%, indicating a superior cycling stability. The good battery performances for the NG-NVPF@C cathode material can be assigned to the small Na3V2(PO4)2F3 crystals and the conducting networks constructed by nitrogen-doped graphene and carbon layer, which can reduce the diffusion path for Na+ and modify the electronic conductivity. The rate properties for the Na3V2(PO4)2F3based cathodes in the present research and other published literatures are compared and displayed in Fig. 5d. The rate capabilities for the NGNVPF@C cathode in this study are comparable or superior to these of the previously published literatures.
To study the electrochemical kinetics for the fabricated cathodes, EIS measurements were tested as displayed in Fig. 6a. Obviously, both EIS curves display similar sharps with a semicircle and a line in the profiles, corresponding to the charge-transfer impedance and Na+ diffusion resistance [31]. Based on the analysis of EIS results, the NGNVPF@C electrode shows the lower value of charge-transfer impedance (249.5 Ω) than NVPF@C (398.6 Ω). The EIS results demonstrate that the as-fabricated NG-NVPF@C electrode possesses a high electronic conductivity which is benefit to increase the depth of Na+ intercalation and deintercalation [32].
Fig. 6b illustrates the CV results for the fabricated electrode materials at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Three typical peaks located at 3.42, 3.70 and 4.21 V can be detected in the charging procedure, corresponding to the deintercalation of two Na+ from the lattice of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 [13,14]. On the contrary, there are also three reduction patterns in the discharging procedure which can be assigned to the insertion of two Na+ into the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 lattice [14]. The twophase reactions can be ascribed via this Equation: Na3V2(PO4)2F3 – 2Na+ -2e− ↔ NaV2(PO4)2F3. The results of CV profiles are consistent well with that of charging and discharging profiles. Differently, the NGNVPF@C electrode shows the lower potential interval and higher intensity of the redox peaks than NVPF@C, suggesting a smaller polarization and a superior reversibility.
Herein, the NG-NVPF@C sample has been synthesized using the solgel method and researched as the new cathode for rechargeable Na-ion battery. SEM and TEM images reveal that the high-purity NVPF@C crystals are homogeneously anchored on the nitrogen-doped graphene sheet. XRD result shows that the fabricated NG-NVPF@C composite exhibits the tetragonal NASICON-type structure without any other impurities. Benefiting from the conductive nitrogen-doped graphene, the resulted NG-NVPF@C shows superior sodium storage performances including excellent high-rate capacity and stable cyclic property. It presents the reversible capacity of 101.6 mAh g−1 at 10C after 300 cycles with a high capacity retention of around 96.5%. Therefore, the as-fabricated NG-NVPF@C is a superior electrode for high-capability Na-ion battery.
