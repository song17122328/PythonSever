AC electrical conductivity σac of PVA/PVP blend filled with MWCNTs was studied using impedance spectroscopy over a  wide frequency range of  10−1 to  107 Hz at different fixed temperatures. It was observed that the frequency-dependent nature  of the ac electrical conductivity followed the Jonscher’s law and the increasing of MWCNTs content in the polymeric matrix  leads to form a percolating network through the composite. On the contrary, a conductivity reduction is observed for the  composition of 5 wt% of MWCNTs, which may be ascribed to the aggregation occurred in nanotubes and consequently loss  of percolation. The CBH model has been suggested to agree with the conduction mechanism of σac for the present system.  Also, the maximum barrier height over which the electrons hop decreases with increasing temperature. Impedance data  were studied in terms of electrical modulus formalisms M* and impedance formalisms Z*. The relation between real and  imaginary parts of complex impedance shows an inclined spike at low frequency and a semicircular arc at high frequency  with radius decrease with increasing the temperature and could be best fitted to two equivalent circuit models. The analysis of  M″ and Z″ spectra indicates that the distribution of relaxation times is independent of the temperature. The non-coincidence  of peaks corresponding to M″ and Z″ indicates the deviation of non-Deby relaxation and short-range movement of charge  carriers. The activation energy values, which are determined from the bulk conductivity and electric modulus, are very close.

Elastic  and  lightweight  polymeric  dielectric/conducting materials are becoming a necessity in microelectronic  devices these years. The electrical properties of the polymers are generally known to be improved by filling them  with a lot of conducting types of filler [1]. The filling of  conductive fillers such as metallic particulates/fibers and carbon black to the polymer matrices, above a percolation  threshold, increases the conductivity abruptly. Percolation  appears because of the buildup of three-dimensional conductive paths in the polymeric matrix [2, 3]. Functional studying of such polymeric composites required the continuous  practice to allow enhancement of their electrical conductivity at small filler concentrations. Consequently, mechanical  features of pure polymers could be kept without suffering  from fragile behavior. Furthermore, the addition of fillers  with a high aspect ratio exhibit percolation at a very low  filler content [4].

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied  because of their outstanding physical, mechanical and electronic properties. Electrical percolation of CNTs/polymer  composites was recently studied by Bauhofer and Kovacs  [5]. They found that the percolation threshold depends on  different parameters such as synthesis method, CNTs type,  dimensionality and polymer matrix type.

Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a polar polymer with hydroxyl  groups linked to methane carbons with a carbon chain backbone. PVA composites formation is because of the OH  groups, which can be shared in hydrogen bonding. PVA  has a good charge storage capacity, high dielectric strength, and filling dependent optical and electrical properties. The  improvement of the electric, dielectric, and optical features  of the host matrix was observed by filling the PVA with  chalcogenide semiconductors and metal oxide semiconductors. This has led to making the PVA polymer a potential  candidate in electronics and optoelectronics industry [6].

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has excellent physiological  compatibility, good film forming, good environmental stability, and moderate electrical conductivity. Both of the PVA  and PVP are miscible and soluble in water in all proportions  [7]. PVA/PVP blend is used in medicine as a skin dressing  component and in the electrochemical area as a polyelectrolyte or membrane [7].

Structural investigations combined with optical measurements were previously investigated [8] by the same research  group concluding the intermolecular interaction between  polymeric matrix and filler with the formation of polarons  and/or bipolarons in the polymeric matrices. They also indicated that the refractive index follow the anomalous dispersion within the wavelength range (190–866) and normal  dispersion in the wavelength range (866–2500) using single  oscillator model. Critical variations was also observed on  single oscillator energy  Eo and the dispersion energy  Ed at  the 0.5 MWCNT’s concentration.

The recent study examines developing elastic and lightweight polymer nanocomposites with enhanced electrical  properties prepared by solution casting technique for electronic applications. In this work, PVA/PVP blend has been  selected as host polymer matrix with multi-walled carbon  nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a conducting filler. The complex  impedance spectroscopy and AC electrical conductivity can  be used to study the effect of MWCNTs on the electrical and  dielectric properties of PVA/PVP blend filled with different  MWCNTs contents. The behavior of the samples studied was  analyzed by the impedance data as a function of frequency   (10−1 to  107 Hz) at different temperatures (303 to 343 K). In  addition, the conduction mechanism was also studied.

In the present work, PVP and PVA were provided. These polymers were used as a blend  matrix material for MWCNTs filling developed by chemical  vapor deposition (CVD).

Nanothinx  functionalized  MWCNTs  (NTX10)  were  added to distilled water and sonicated for 15 min. Equal  quantities of PVP and PVA were blended with this solution  and stirred at 70 °C until a suitable viscous solution had  formed. To prepare the filled polymeric films, this viscous  solution is then transferred to Petri dishes and dried in an oven for 2 days at 60 °C. During drying, the films were  detached from Petri dishes and stored in vacuum desiccators  until they are used. The amounts of MWCNTs inside the  PVA/PVP mixture are 0, 1, 3, 5 wt%. The samples thickness  was between 0.005 and 0.01 cm.

AC electrical studies were done in a frequency range of   10−1 to  107 Hz, by using Novocontrol Technologies Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy. The measured temperature  range was from 303 to 343 K. All the measurements were  done in an evacuated system to eliminate the effect of  moisture.

The  conductivity  frequency  dependence  is  a  popular  response of amorphous polymers because of the large  increase in the mobility of charge carriers inside the polymeric matrix. The frequency variation studies were done to  realize the electrical homogeneity of the material by characterizing the nature of electrical conduction and relaxation  mechanism. Using impedance spectroscopy, a sinusoidal  voltage of different frequencies in AC conductivity measurements was applied across the sample. If f is the frequency  of the signal applied, then the AC conductivity σac can be  calculated by the following relation: (1) ac = 2f � where ε0 and ε′ are the dielectric constant of the free space  and the material respectively and tanδ is the loss tangent or  dissipation factor.

It can be seen that the electrical conductivity σac increases  with the frequency. In addition, composites with filler loading higher than percolation threshold exhibit two regions.  The first region has the conductivity nearly constant in the  low-frequency range (as plateau region), and the second  region (dispersion region) has the conductivity dependent  on the frequency at the high-frequency range, obeying the  power law.

The plateau region is associated with the DC conductivity σdc and ascribed to the bulk conductivity of the sample  occurring due to the displacement of charge carriers [10].  The σdc value was calculated by extrapolating the plateau  regions to the Log σac axis and measuring the intersections  at zero frequency. In the high-frequency range (dispersion  region), the conductivity raises linearly with the frequency.  The mobility of charge carriers is higher in the high-frequency range [14]. As the MWCNTs content increase, it has  been found that the conductivity increases and the high-frequency dispersion is shifted towards the highest frequency  side.

Zhang et al. [9] explained the frequency dependence  of σac in terms of the polarization effects by establishing  an analogy between the composite samples and a resistor–capacitor equivalent circuit, in which there is capacitance between the conductive filler clusters. According to their reports, the conductivity for composites with MWCNTs  higher than the percolation threshold is generally determined  by the numerous paths of the percolating clusters rather than  the capacitors.

Thus the composites conductivity does not change with  the variation of the frequencies up to a certain frequency,  above which the contribution of the capacitors becomes  dominant, and so a plateau is observed in AC conductivity–frequency diagram below this frequency. Moreover, in  the composite whose MWCNTs content is near the percolation threshold, there are only a small number of percolating  cluster paths, so that the AC conductivity contribution of  the capacitors between the clusters becomes important. As  the frequency increases, the current flowing through each  capacitor increases, which improves the conductivity of the  composites.

The exponent “s” indicates the degree of interaction  between the lattice and mobile ions, and its change with the  temperature and frequency represents the type of conduction mechanism that exists in the material. Different theoretical models, like quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT),  correlated barrier hopping (CBH), non-overlapping small  polaron tunneling (SPT) and overlapping large polaron tunneling (OLPT) are used to identify the conduction mechanism of the AC conductivity [16]. The QMT model is based  on phonon-assisted electron tunneling and predicts a little  increase of s with increasing temperature or independent of 

Particularly, the direct separation of the bulk and bulk/ electrode interface phenomena is allowed by using Z* formalism [21].

Investigation of ionic conductivity of the polymeric  material is done by impedance spectroscopy. The shape of  impedance spectra gives the information on the electrode  polarization and the kind of charge carriers electrons or  ions. Figure 8 shows the Nyquist curves (Z″ vs. Z′) of the  investigated system at temperatures of 303 K and 343 K in  the frequency range  10−1–107 Hz with the equivalent circuit  elements. It has been found that the impedance plane plot i.e.  Cole–Cole plots of the films consists of the inclined spike  at low frequency and depressed semicircular arc at high frequency. The inclined spike and the semicircle together represent the characteristic behavior of ionic conducting materials  [22]. The semicircle represents the parallel combination of  bulk capacitance (because of the immobile polymer chains)  and bulk resistance (because of ions migration). Therefore,  the frequency of the present sample response can be indicated by a parallel combination of the circuit element R  (resistance) and capacitance as an equivalent circuit.

The inclined spike refers to double layer capacitance formation at the electrode/electrolyte interface because of ions  migration at low frequency. The capacitance values are in  the range of PF, which indicate to the sample bulk response  [23]. At each interface, the electrode double layer possesses  an increase of impedance against ion transfer with decreasing frequency, which was represented by an inclined spike  in the Nyquist plot of impedance spectra [24]. Moreover,  the spike inclination at an angle lower than 90° to the real  axis is because of the roughness of the electrode/electrolyte  interface [25].

It is found that in the investigated temperature range  the diameter of semicircles (represent the bulk resistance   Rb) decrease with the temperature increase, showing the presence of activated conduction mechanism [26]. Also, it is  observed that the spike is elongated and the semicircle diameter is decreased with MWCNTs content increase. According to these results, when the filler content is increased, only  the resistive component of composite prevails. The capacitive nature vanishes because of the random orientation of  the dipoles in the polymer side chains [27]. The presence  of the depressed semicircle, which its center below the real  axis, imply that the relaxation process is non-Debye type.  This deviation is because of the potential well for each site,  through which the ion transport takes place, not being equal  [28].

Modeling of impedance data can be usually represented  by an equivalent circuit composed of resistant and capacitance to clarify the relation between microstructure and  electrical properties. Using EIS software, the obtained  impedance data was fitted with an equivalent circuit. This  circuit composed of a parallel combination of resistance  Rb  and fractal capacity  CPE1  (Rb 

The AC electrical conductivity of PVA/PVP blend samples  filled with different MWCNTs contents was studied over a  wide frequency range of  10−1 to  107 Hz at different temperatures. The electrical conductivity of the composite is shown  to depend on the filler type and concentration and complies  with Jonscher’s law. The conductivity improvement is maximum for 3 wt% of MWCNTs content, but for 5 wt% of  MWCNTs, the conductivity is shown to be decreased.
