Solid electrolytes are unique functional materials in which only single ion species can generally migrate in the solid as a charge carrier, and some have already been commercialized as components of batteries and chemical sensing devices.1,2 Although a large number of solid electrolytes have been found to obtain high ion conductivity that enters into the practical application range, such high ion conductivity is realized only for solids whose conducting species are mono-, di-, and trivalent ions. The high-valence tetravalent cation has been regarded as an extremely poor migrating species in solids because of strong electrostatic interaction between the tetravalent cation and surrounding anions, which prevents smooth ionic conduction in the solid lattice. To realize tetravalent cation conduction in solids, it is necessary to strictly select not only the crystal structure but also the constituent ions, in order to reduce such strong interactions. One of the most effective ways is the introduction of the cations with higher valence than the tetravalent ion into the structure, because such higher valence cations may attract anionic species more strongly than the tetravalent cation, enabling tetravalent cation migration in the solid lattice. Recently, the tetravalent Zr4+ ion conducting ZrM(PO4)3 (M ) Nb, Ta)3,4 and Hf4+ ion conducting HfNb(PO4)35 were successfully developed based on this concept. These solids contain two kinds of pentavalent M5+ (M ) Nb, Ta) and P5+ and possess the NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor)type structure having a three-dimensional network, which is well-known as a suitable structure for ion migration, with various kinds of NASICON-type solid electrolytes that conduct divalent6-8 and trivalent9-11 cations having been developed. Furthermore, the enhancement of Zr4+ ion conductivity for the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid,12 which contains three high-valence cations of Ta5+, P5+, and W6+ has also been demonstrated. However, the tetravalent cation species expected to conduct in these solids were limited to Zr4+ and Hf4+, and the conduction of other tetravalent cations have not been reported. In this communication, we report the conduction of the tetravalent Ti4+ ion in a solid. NASICON-type TiNb(PO4)3 was selected as the mother solid, similar to the case for Zr4+3,4 and Hf4+6 ion conductors, and W6+ was partially substituted onto the Nb5+ site in an attempt to obtain high Ti4+ ion conductivity by reduction of the strong electrostatic interaction between the Ti4+ cation and the surrounding counter O2-anions. The Ti4+ion conducting properties of Ti(Nb1-xWx)5/ (5+x)(PO4)3 were then investigated.

From X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the Ti(Nb1-xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids prepared, it was found that the single-phase rhombohedral (R3jc) NASICON-type structure was obtained for the samples with x e 0.2 (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Furthermore, linear lattice shrinkage of the NASICON-type phase was observed with increasing W content (x), as shown in Figure 1. In contrast, the samples with x > 0.2 were multiphase mixtures of the NASICON-type solid, TiP2O7 and WO3 without any lattice shrinkage of the NASICON-type phase compared to that with x ) 0.2. This indicates that the smaller W6+ (ionic radius ) 0.074 nm [coordination number (CN) ) 6]13) ion successfully replaces Nb5+ (0.078 nm [CN ) 6]13) in TiNb(PO4)3 for samples with x e 0.2, and the solid solution limit composition of Ti(Nb1-xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 for the single phase NASICON-type structure was identified to be around x ) 0.2. Figure 1 also presents the electrical conductivity of the Ti(Nb1-xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids at 800 °C. The conductivity increased with the W content up to x ) 0.2, the composition limit for the single-phase solid solution, to the highest conductivity of 3.65 × 10-4 S c m-1. In the multiphase mixture region (x > 0.2), the conductivity decreased because of the appearance of impurity phases of TiP2O7 and WO3. For the purpose of identifying the conducting species in the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid, which exhibited the highest conductivity among the samples prepared, the oxygen partial pressure dependence of the AC conductivity was investigated at 800 °C (Figure 2). In the PO2 range between 1 × 10-11 and 1 × 105 Pa, the AC conductivities had a constant value independent of the oxygen pressure change, whereas the AC conductivity significantly increased with lowering of PO2 below 1 × 10-11 Pa because of the appearance of electronic conduction caused by the reduction of Ti4+. The constant AC conductivity in a wide oxygen partial pressure range clearly indicates that the predominant migrating species is an ion without any valence change. The polarization behavior was also investigated by measuring the time-dependent DC to AC conductivity ratio (σDC/σAC) in oxygen (PO2 ) 1 × 105 Pa) and a CO-CO2 gas mixture (1 × 10-13 Pa) at 800 °C and the results are presented in Figure 3. This procedure can provide information regarding the type of charge carrier in the solid.14 In low PO2 atmospheres (in this case, a CO-CO2 mixture), high DC conductivity was obtained because of the appearance of electronic conduction. In the case of the oxygen atmosphere, the σDC/σAC ratio abruptly decreased and reached values less than 0.013 after 30 min, suggesting that no electronic species was conducted in the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid. Polarization behavior in an oxygen atmosphere where sufficient O2- can be supplied to the sample strongly indicates that O2- ions do not migrate in the sample. From these phenomena, it was clear that the conducting species in the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid is limited to cation species such as Ti4+, N b5+, P5+ and W6+ in the PO2 range higher than 1 × 10-11 Pa.

To directly demonstrate Ti4+ ion conduction in the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid, DC electrolysis was carried out by application of 4 VDC for 360 h at 800 °C. From preliminary investigation of I-V relationship, the decomposition voltage of the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid was determined to be ca. 1.2 V. By applying a DC voltage higher than the decomposition voltage, only the conducting cation species is forced to continuously and macroscopically migrate toward the cathode according to the potential gradient, and as a result, evidence of which cation species is migrating in the sample can be obtained by investigating the elemental distribution at or near the cathodic surface. After the DC electrolysis, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) line analysis measurements of the electrolyzed pellet were performed, and clear segregation of only Ti near the cathodic surface was observed, as depicted in Figure 4, whereas other cations were distributed homogeneously over the sample. This result explicitly demonstrates the fact that tetravalent Ti4+ ions migrate in the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 bulk and deposit on the cathodic surface of the electrolyzed sample by application of a DC voltage. The temperature dependency of the tetravalent ionic conductivity for Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 is presented in Figure 5 with the corresponding data for TiNb(PO4)3 (Ti4+ ion conduction was also demonstrated in this work. (see the Supporting Information)), ZrNb(PO4)3, and HfNb(PO4)3. The activation energy (Ea), lattice volume, and the relative volume ratio of the tetravalent cation to lattice volume (A ratio ) Vion/Vlattice) are also listed in Table 1. For ZrNb(PO4)3 and HfNb(PO4)3 with the same lattice volumes, the activation energies are almost the same, whereas the conductivity of HfNb(PO4)3 is slightly higher than ZrNb(PO4)3. The Ea for ion conduction in these solids may be significantly influenced by the bottleneck size of the conducting pathway; therefore, similar Ea values were obtained for these solids with the same lattice volume. However, because the conductivity itself is also influenced by the strength of the electrostatic interaction between conducting tetravalent cations and surrounding O2 anions, the interaction for the Hf4+ ion, with electronegativity of 1.3, should be weaker in comparison to Zr4+ (electronegativity ) 1.4), resulting in ease of migration from the original crystallographic position. In the case of TiNb(PO4)3, Ti4+ cations migrate smoothly through the bottleneck, because the ionic volume of Ti4+ is relatively small compared with the lattice volume, which can easily be derived from the A ratio (The A ratio represents the Vion/Vlattice, which indicates the relative size of the conducting ion to the bottleneck of the ion-conducting pathway in an indirect sense). However, because the electronegativity of Ti4+ is 1.5, which is higher than those of Zr4+ and Hf4+, the ion conductivity in TiNb(PO4)3 is lower than ZrNb(PO4)3 and HfNb(PO4)3. On the other hand, for the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/ 5.2(PO4)3 solid, the electrostatic interaction between Ti4+ and O2- should be reduced by the introduction of W6+, so that easy migration from the original position is expected. As a result, the Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 solid exhibits 2.2 times higher Ti4+ conductivity than TiNb(PO4)3, whereas the activation energy is almost equal, because the A ratios of both Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 and TiNb(PO4)3 are almost the same. In conclusion, we have successfully developed pure Ti4+ ion conducting Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5.0/5.2(PO4)3 without electronic conduction for the first time by strict selection of both the three-dimensional NASICON-type crystal structure and the constituent elements. High Ti4+ ion conductivity was obtained, similar to that for Zr4+ and Hf4+ ions in ZrNb(PO4)3 and HfNb(PO4)3.
