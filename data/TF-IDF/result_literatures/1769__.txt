CuZr2(PO4)3 crystallises with the Nasicon-type structure and is a copper(I) ion conductor.
Thepossibility of a solid solution between CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 has been a controversialissue for many years.
As part of a continued study, CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 wereprepared by solid state methods and used to investigate the copper stoichiometry and phaserelationships between these two materials as a function of copper content, temperature andoxygen fugacity.
The following reversible reaction: Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (s) + 12CuO (s) ↔ CuZr2(PO4)3(s) + 14O2(g) was studied by thermogravimetry in an atmosphere of PO2= 0.22 atm and wasfound to occur at 475±10◦C.
Thus, CuZr2(PO4)3 is a thermodynamically stable phase in airabove ∼475◦C, which places a lower temperature limit on its use as an electrolyte in air.
Theresults of X-ray powder diffractometry on materials with various copper contents that had beenannealed in argon at 750◦C indicate that there is no evidence for a significant solid solution between CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 nor, a reductive decomposition of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3. 
Thecoexistence of CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 as discrete phases is also supported by evidencefrom electron spin resonance spectroscopy on these materials, which indicate the presence ofcopper(II) ions in CuZr2(PO4)3 at a dopant and dispersed level of concentration.
The results from energy dispersive X-ray analysis, as well as, the novel use of the fluorescent behaviour of CuZr2(PO4)3 in ultra-violet light as an analytical tool, support the above conclusions.

The resulting mixture, after the evaporationof the acetone in air, was placed in an aluminacrucible and slowly heated in a box furnace (VecstarFurnaces VF 1 SP) to 400◦C and held at that temperatureovernight in order to decompose the NH4H2PO4 and initiate the first stage of the reaction .
The productmaterial was slowly cooled to room temperature, thenground with an agate pestle and mortar.
The powderedmaterial was placed in a boat-shaped alumina crucibleand introduced into a tube furnace (Lenton FurnacesLTF 16/50/180) attached with a recrystallized aluminaworktube.
The material was heated to 1200◦C for 16 h, ina flowing argon (99.99%, Hede Nielsen A/S) atmosphere,with heating and cooling rates both set at 5◦C/min.

The precursor material comprised a finely ground powder of CuZr2(PO4)3 as prepared above.
This material was placedinside an alumina crucible and oxidized in air, inside a box furnace at 400◦C, then cooled to room temperature.
The product material was ground with an agate pestleand mortar.
The above oxidation process was repeatedto ensure complete oxidation of the material.
Finally, thepowdered product was washed with warm dilute nitricacid to remove the copper(II) oxide, followed by a washwith distilled water, then subsequently dried in air.
Theproduct was analysed by powder XRD using a SiemensD5000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα1 radiation.
The instrumentwas operated with a controlled atmosphere, which wassupplied by mixing oxygen (99.5%, Hede Nielsen A/S)with argon (99.99%, Hede Nielsen A/S) in different ratios.
The contents of the atmosphere were determinedby ‘on-line’ mass spectroscopy.
A powdered sample of CuZr2(PO4)3 was placed in a miniature alumina crucibleand heated with a rate of 1◦C/min from room temperatureto 1000◦C in an atmosphere of PO2= 0.22 atm, and maintainedfor one hour, then followed by cooling to roomtemperature at the same rate.
Powders of colourless CuZr2(PO4)3 and pale-blue Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 were weighed together with formula-unitratios of 3:1 and 1:1 respectively.
In each case, the thoroughly mixed powder was placed inside a silicon rubbermould (manufactured in-house) which in turn was heldand tied inside a condom, before being pressed at 15 kbar for 30minutes using an oil-press (20 kbars Pressure ReactionSystem, supplied by PSIKA Pressure Systems Ltd.
The pelletwas then heated to 750◦C for 16 hours in 99.99% argon.
These conditions should be sufficient, in terms of temperature,time, and pellet density to enable any envisagedformation of a solid solution to take place, by the interdiffusionof copper ions within this two phase mixture.
After heat treatment, the pellet was quenched to roomtemperature and then ground using an agate pestle andmortar.
The powdered material was analysed by ESR andpowder XRD.
A third pellet was prepared by a method for making‘double-layered’ pressed powdered pellets.
A layer of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 powder was placed in the bottom halfof the silicon rubber mould, and followed by a layer ofCuZr2(PO4)3 powder in the top half of the mould.
This was then pressed at 15 kbar for 30 minutes into a singlepellet using the oil press as described above.
The pelletwas first heated at 750◦C in flowing argon (99.99%) for 16 hours and then cooled to room temperature.
Observations were made on the pellet before re-annealingunder identical conditions for a further 160 hours.
Afterthis time, the pellet was dissected longitudinally, such thatthe cross-section was observed under ultra-violet lightand also analysed by electron microscopy and dispersiveX-ray analysis (EDXA) using a Jeol JSM-35CF scanningmicroscope.
In this work, CuZr2(PO4)3 was obtained as a colourlesspowder whilst, Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was obtained as apale-blue powder.
The powder XRD patterns for thematerials, CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 as preparedhere, are shown in Figs 4 and 5 respectively.
Their dvaluesand relative intensities for these phases correspondclosely to those reported in the ICDD card numbers 81-0526 and 42-1057 respectively.
Interestingly, one additionalpeak (2θ = 25.75◦, relative intensity = 17) appearsin the powder pattern for the CuZr2(PO4)3 materialprepared in this work, with a d-value = 3.457 Å;but it has not been possible to either index this peak or,account for its presence.
Fig.6 shows the thermogravimetric profile forCuZr2(PO4)3 in an oxygen partial pressure of 0.22 atm.
This shows a gradual and continuous gain in massfrom room temperature upwards, which is interpretedin terms of oxidation of the material until 475±10◦C.
Above this temperature the material gradually loosesmass, which is interpreted in terms of a loss of oxygenfrom the system and is associated with the reductionof the material.
Later in the heating-cycle, whenthe sample is eventually cooled below 475±10◦C,there is a regain in mass corresponding to the additionof oxygen to the system.
This mass-temperatureprofile is therefore interpreted in terms of a reversible uptakeand release of oxygen from the material.
Similar observationshave been reported for CuHf2(PO4)3 andCuSn2(PO4)3 , whereby the redox-transition equilibriumtemperatures are approximately 500◦C and 480◦C respectively.
Given the close structural similarities betweenthese three compounds it is quite reasonable toexpect a similarity in their redox-transition equilibriumtemperatures.
This analysis confirms that CuZr2(PO4)3 is ametastablephase at room-temperature and under atmospheric conditions(T = 298 K and PO2= 0.22 atm).
Therefore, as the temperature increases, CuZr2(PO4)3 begins to oxidize to Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and CuO.
However, once the temperaturerises above the redox-transition temperature (Tredox),the material (an intimate mixture of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 andCuO) begins to revert back to CuZr2(PO4)3, with a correspondingloss of oxygen from the system.
It is thereforeconcluded that CuZr2(PO4)3 is a thermodynamically stablephase at a temperature, T≥475±10◦C (at PO2=0.22atm).
To investigate this system further, a powdered sampleof CuZr2(PO4)3 was annealed at 700◦C in air (PO2 =0.21 atm) for 2 hours, then poured immediately onto alarge block of aluminium in order to quench the materialto room temperature.
The product materialwas essentially a colourless powder with a pale-green tinge in places.
Thepowder XRD pattern is shown in Fig.7. 
Besides an additionalpeak (2θ = 25.75◦) which has previously beencommented on in Section 3.1, this pattern indicates that CuZr2(PO4)3 was the only phase detectable by this technique.
This shows that the material exists essentially inits reduced (cuprous) form, CuZr2(PO4)3 at 700◦C in air.
From the electrochemical studies of Schaffer et al,one is left to infer, from their interpretation of electrochemicaldata, that the material should exist in its oxidizedform under these conditions; in other words, asa two phase mixture of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and CuO.
Thisis in contradiction to the observations made here in this present work.
Perhaps the Cusicon ‘electrode’ as usedby Schaffer et al.is not at a state of equilibrium orfunctioning in a manner, as they have presumed in theirwork.


It is therefore concluded that a solid solution does notexist at 750◦C.
Neither is there evidence of any reductivedecomposition of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 under these conditions.
Figs 10a and b show respectively, pictures taken undernormal white light of the ‘double-layered’ pellet, beforeand after the 16 hours of annealing as described in Section 2.5; revealing colourless CuZr2(PO4)3 on theleft and pale-blue Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 on the right.
Fig.10c shows the same as Fig.10b, but is taken under ultra-violetlight (λ = 366 nm); revealing the green-fluorescencefrom CuZr2(PO4)3 on the left and non-fluorescence fromCu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 on the right.
The presence of two clearlysegregated regions suggests there is no significant interdiffusionof copper between these two layers after 16hours of annealing at 750◦C.
Fig.10d shows a picture taken under normal whitelight after annealing for a further 160 hours at 750◦Cin argon; revealing pale-green material on the left anda pale-blue material on the far-right with a colourlessmaterial in the interfacial region.
These observations suggest thatsome inter-diffusion has occurred between CuZr2(PO4)3and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 after prolonged annealing, althoughthe original segregation is still clearly visible in Fig.10e.
Table I shows the results from the energy dispersive X-rayanalysis (EDXA) performed on this cross-section of thepellet.
These results indicate a difference in copper concentrationacross the pellet longitudinally, correspondingto a high copper content in both the colourless and palegreenregions and, a significantly lower copper concentrationin the pale-blue region, as described above.
Aftersuch prolonged annealing, it is evident that the material isstill very inhomogeneous.
In terms of microstructure, theinter-diffusion region of the pellet is more appropriatelydescribed as a fine-grained mechanical mixture of two distinct phases (CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3) ratherthan a solid solution.
The results of aseries of ESR measurements performed on the variouscompositional mixtures investigated in this present workare shown in Fig.11.
 The absolute concentrations aredifficult to quantify by this technique, but nonetheless,the copper(II) signal in CuZr2(PO4)3 is particularly weak.
This indicates the presence of copper(II) ions asa dopant and at a dispersed level of concentration in thecolourless to pale-green material.
The Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 material gave a very broad peak similar to that reportedby Taoufik et al, whilst the CuZr2(PO4)3 materialgave a very sharp peak.
Intermediate compositions gavevery broad peaks.
These aspects concerning the peakwidth are used here to show that there is no evidence of asolid solution in these intermediate compositions.
If any significant solid solution did occur, then progressive linebroadening would be expected across the compositionalseries.
The results from thermogravimetry performed on this materialunder an atmosphere of PO2= 0.22 atm.
CuZr2(PO4)3 shouldtherefore function as a copper(I) ionic conductor in airabove ∼475◦C, even after a long exposure time to air;but not below this temperature.
This is different to the situation when CuZr2(PO4)3 is used under an inert atmosphere;in which a lower temperature restriction on its useis then, normally, dictated by the magnitude of its ionicconductivity.
This presentwork has indicated that there is no evidencefor a continuous solid solution between CuZr2(PO4)3 andCu0.5Zr2(PO4)3; and especially not within the compositionalrange Cu1−xZr2(PO4)3 (0.125≤x≤0.25) at 750◦C.
However, the results suggest that the pale-green to colourlessmaterial corresponds to a solid solution of a very limitedextent, described by, CuI/II1−xZr2(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x 0.125), which is more akin to the presence of copper(II)ions at a dopant and dispersed level of concentration.
Thepresence of these copper defects is not expected to affectthe ionic conducting properties of this material by anygreat extent.
The absence of a solid solution may be due to the peculiarco-ordination environments of the copper(I) andcopper(II) ions in these materials.
Although the substructuralframeworks of CuZr2(PO4)3 and Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 areclosely related, the co-ordination of copper(I) and copper(II) ions in the M(1) position are very different, whichleads to local distortions.
This might explain why copper(I) and copper(II) ions cannot be accommodated simultaneouslywithin a single Nasicon-type phase, exceptwhen present at a defect level of concentration.
Itwould beinteresting to compare these aspects with related systems,such as, CuTi2(PO4)3 − Cu0.5Ti2(PO4)3, CuHf2(PO4)3 −Cu0.5Hf2(PO4)3 and CuSn2(PO4)3 − Cu0.5Sn2(PO4)3, as well as, to obtain single crystal X-ray diffraction or, neutrondiffraction data for the cupric phase, Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3.
The fluorescent behaviour of CuZr2(PO4)3 under ultravioletlight has proved to be useful as a simple analyticaltool in this work.
