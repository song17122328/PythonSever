In this article, highly Na+ ion conducting glass samples based on Na3+x[CrxTi2-x(PO4)3] (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mol%) (NCTPx) system was prepared via melt quenching technique. The as-formed precursor glasses were transformed into glassceramics by heat treating at and above Tc for different time schedules. Powder XRD indicates the formation of NASICON type phase (Na3Ti2(PO4)3) which is known for its higher stability and ionic conductivity. This phase is precipitated due to the partial replacement of tetrahedral Ti4+ ions by trivalent Cr3+ ions in the NCTP glass-ceramic network. The NCTP0.5 glass-ceramic −4 S/cm) and minimum activation energy sample heat treated at 1066 K for 9 h exhibited best bulk conductivity (σ = 8.52 × 10 (0.448 eV). For Tc > 1066 K, impure phases such as Cr2O3 and NaCrP2O7 were precipitated along the grain boundaries which resist the migration of Na+ ions between the grains. The best conducting NCTP0.5 sample after crystallization (glass-ceramic) exhibited good chemical stability in ambient atmosphere for 60 days.

Although Li-ion batteries are commercially successful for use in medium and large-scale energy storage applications, however, it will be progressively difficult to meet the future demand due to dwindling lithium supplies and escalating costs [1, 2]. Recently Na-ion batteries are considered as an alternative choice to LIB in view of the following advantages: (i) similar fundamental electrochemical principle to LIBs; (ii) manageable redox potential (2.71 V vs SHE); (iii) low cost due to vast sodium sources and easy recycling [1, 2].

In order to realize practical applications of Na-ion battery, solid-state inorganic electrolytes would appear to be an excellent choice since they offer high Na+ ion conductivity at room temperature, chemical stability against elemental Na, wide electrochemical window, good interfacial contact with solid electrodes, and long cycle life [3, 4]. Successful results by Zhu et al. on the correlation between the chemical stability against electrochemical window along electrode and electrolyte interface, inspired us to be aimed along these lines [5, 6]. Several attempts have been made by different groups on variety of crystalline and amorphous electrolytes; however, no class of materials exhibits all the abovesaid characteristics [7–12]. Among possible materials for solid electrolytes, glass and glass-ceramic electrolytes are considered as potential material systems as they exhibit homogenous microstructure with controlled grain size and boundaries [13–15]. Experimental investigations found that glass-ceramic composites precipitated with conducting NASICON phase are the most favorable glass network. Also, this network stands for porous free and can be synthesized in any desired shape. This will improve ionic conductivity by at least two orders compared with their crystalline counter parts. We have been inspired by our latest work on the Na-ion conductivity based on Na1+xSnxGe2-x(PO4)3 glass-ceramic electrolyte system [16]. However, ionic conductivity and voltage window are yet to meet the expected order which remains an area of challenge for researchers in this field. Hence, efforts are aimed in this investigation to synthesize glass and glass-ceramic composition having general formula Na3+x[CrxTi2-x(PO4)3] (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mol%). The significance of this system can be explained in two ways: (i) similarity in the size of octahedral Cr+3 (0.0755 nm) ions and tetrahedral Ti+4 ions (0.0745 nm); (ii) formation of stable crystal structure in the NCTP glass-ceramic system due to the partial substitution of Ti+4 ions by Cr+3 ions. There is a possibility to create a wider active center with positive charge deficiency due to the substitution each tetravalent Ti+4 ion by a trivalent (Cr+3) ion with which the mobile Na+ ion can react very easily. It is important to understand the target heat treating temperature and schedule along with compatibility between the electrodes, in order to achieve the best bulk conductivity and stability in this material, which is the prime objective of this investigation.

NCTP glass samples are synthesized by Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, Cr2O3, and TiO2 in molar ratio based on Na3+x[CrxTi2-x(PO4)3] (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mol%) (NCTPx) system via meltquenching technique. Green glass samples are subjected to high-energy ball milling for 30 h in order to form nano-scaled homogeneous powder. The thermal parameters (Tg, Tc, andT m) are obtained by differential thermal analysis (DTA) (SII EXSTAR 6300). Further, the glass samples are crystallized at and above Tc for different heat schedules (3, 6, 9, and 12 h). XRD analysis was obtained with PANanalytical Diffractometer B.V fitted with Cu target (both K(α1+α2) wavelengths) and Ni filter at 40 kV and 30 mA (2 h range). High-resolution FESEM micrographs were recorded using Gemini Zeiss SupraTM 35 VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany. Impedance spectroscopy is employed to explore the variation of electrical properties as

Powder XRD patterns of all NCTPx glass samples after heat treating them at corresponding Tc (obtained from DTA analysis) for 3 h are shown in Fig. 3. The amorphous nature of NCTP0 glass sample (before heat treatment) is directly confirmed due to the absence of peaks. The Rietveld refinement of the full powder XRD pattern evolves ~ 90% of precursor composition. XRD patterns are well fitted with data of major crystalline NASICON phase (Na3Ti2(PO4)3(COD-4106515) and also minor phases, (Cr2O3 (ICSD-25781) and Cr(PO3)3 (ICSD-39410) respectively (Fig. 3) [20–22]. However, a NASICON type phase (Na3Ti2(PO4)3) is regarded for higher stability and ionic conductivity compared with all other phases

DTA analysis pointed out that the best conducting NCTP0.5 sample gained the best thermal stability parameter (ΔT) when it is heat treated before (ΔT = 160 K) and even after heat treatment (ΔT = 158 K) at and above Tc for 3 h (glassceramic sample). This is a significant factor to understand electrical properties as a function of different heat treatment temperature and holding time schedules. Powder XRD patterns are well fitted with data of major crystalline NASICON phase (Na3Ti2(PO4)3(COD-4106515) and also minor impure phases, (Cr2O3 (ICSD-25781) and Cr(PO3)3 (ICSD-39410) respectively. Intensity of major crystalline NASICON phase in the best conducting NCTP0.5 sample appears to be maximum for 9 h compared with other heat treatment schedules, causing for further improvement of the Na+ ion conductivity. The presence of impure phases Cr2O3 and NaCrP2O7 (ICSD-31291) along the grain boundaries lowers unit cell volume (1477.17 Å). This will hinder easy migration of Na+ ions in the glass-ceramic network due to blocking effect as evident in SEM micro−4 S/ graphs. The maximum conductivity ((σ = 8.52 × 10 cm) and minimum activation energy (0.448 eV) are achieved for the NCTP0.5 (Na3.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3) glassceramic sample heat treated at 1066 K for 9 h which has a wide electrochemical window and higher chemical stability when it is kept in ambient atmosphere up for 2 months.
