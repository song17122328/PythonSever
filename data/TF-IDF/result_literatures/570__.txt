All-solid-state (ASS) lithium-ion battery has attracted great attention due to its high safety and increased energy density. One of key components in the ASS battery (ASSB) is solid electrolyte that determines performance of the ASSB. Many types of solid electrolytes have been investigated in great detail in the past years, including NASICON-type, garnet-type, perovskite-type, LISICON-type, LiPON-type, Li3N-type, sulfide-type, argyrodite-type, anti-perovskite-type and many more. This paper aims to provide comprehensive reviews on some typical types of key solid electrolytes and some ASSBs, and on gaps that should be resolved.

Lithium-ion batteries have achieved great market share since their commercialization by Sony in 1990. Compared with other energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries have demonstrated a lot of advantages, including high energy density, long cycle life etc [1]. Currently, lithium-ion batteries have been used in many products, such as consumer electronics, electric/hybrid electric vehicles, stationary energy storage systems etc.

However, traditional lithium-ion batteries have critical safety issues because of use of highly flammable organic liquid electrolytes or polymer electrolytes which have low thermal stability and low flame point so that it is easy to cause fire accidents and explosion if they are improperly used [2,3]. To thoroughly address the safety issues, use of highly flammable organic liquid electrolytes should be entirely avoided as such all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) become a good choice because the organic liquid electrolytes are replaced by inorganic solid electrolytes that have high thermal stability. At the same time, ASSBs also have many other advantages [4,5]. Firstly, as no liquid electrolyte is used, packaging for ASSBs can be much simplified so that dead weight in battery packaging can be largely reduced, resulting in increased energy density. Secondly, compared with organic liquid electrolytes and polymer electrolytes, inorganic solid electrolytes have much better electrochemical stability and are compatible with higher potential cathode materials to increase energy density. Thirdly, ASSBs have excellent mechanical properties.

Organic liquid electrolyte and separator in the traditional battery are replaced by inorganic solid electrolyte in the ASSB, which is the main difference [5,6]. Working principles of these two types of batteries are the same. During charging, Li-ions deintercalate from cathode and transport through electrolyte and electrolyte-electrode interfaces into anode, and electrons move from cathode to anode through external circuit. During discharging, movement of Li-ions and electrons are reversibly reversed. Main functions of solid electrolytes are the same as liquid electrolytes and separators that only allow Li-ions to crossover between cathode and anode, and prevent electron conduction and short-circuit. Thus, several basic requirements for solid electrolytes are essential. Electrolytes should possess high ionic conductivity of above 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, have negligible electronic conductivity with a high ionic transference number, and have wide electrochemical stability windows [7].

Several types of Li-ion solid electrolytes can provide above needs, including NASICON, garnet, perovskite, LISICON, LiPON, Li3N, sulfide, argyrodite, anti-perovskite etc [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. The advantages and future improvements of these solid electrolytes are discussed in this section.

The name of NASICON was initiated from sodium super ion conductor with formula NaM2(PO4)3 where M is cation and one of examples is Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) [12,13]. This type of solid electrolyte has a rhombohedral structure with space group of R-3c, except for the range 1.8 ≤ x ≤ 2.2, where the structure exhibits a small distortion to monoclinic space group of C2/c [13]. The rhombohedral structure is shown in Fig. 1 [14] where XO4 (PO4 or SiO4) tetrahedrons and MO6 (ZrO6) octahedrons are connected to each other to form a 3D framework and pathways for ion diffusion, and oxygen-ions are shared by the tetrahedrons and octahedrons. Mobile ions (Na-ions) occupy A sites and diffuse along c-axis by jumping between A1 (6b) and A2 (18e) sites. Monoclinic distortion could lead to separation of A2 (18e) sites in the rhombohedral structure (R-3c, Z = 6) into 4e and 8f sites in the monoclinic structure (C2/c, Z = 4) [13,15]. When x = 0, only A1 sites are occupied, each of which is octahedrally coordinated by six oxygen-ions from two neighboring MO6 octahedrons. In this case, activation energy for transport of mobile ions is high because of inequality of site-preference energies of A1 and A2 sites. When x > 0, partial A2 sites are occupied by extra mobile ions, and activation energy is decreased due to electrostatic interaction between mobile ions [13]. At the same time, the diffusion is restricted by size of bottlenecks along the pathways, which is determined by the framework ions. Diameter of the narrowest bottleneck should be larger than twice the sum of radii of mobile ion and oxygen-ion [13]. Thus, it is important to choose appropriate framework ions according to mobile ion's radius to benefit ion diffusion and improve ionic conductivity. Goodenough et al. [15] demonstrated that NASICON Na3Zr2PSi2O12 with monoclinic structure showed ionic conductivity of 2 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 300 °C, which is comparable to β’’-alumina, an excellent Na-ion conductor. Furthermore, Na-ion in Na3Zr2PSi2O12 could conduct in three dimensions, addressing the problem of 2-dimensional conduction of β’’-alumina.

NASICON-type Li-ion solid electrolyte LiZr2(PO4)3 can be prepared by replacing Na-ion in NaZr2(PO4)3 by Li-ion. However, LiZr2(PO4)3 showed much lower ionic conductivity than that of NaZr2(PO4)3 [16]. LiZr2(PO4)3 prepared at 1200 °C (named as high temperature phase, because prepared at high temperature) showed a NASICON-type monoclinic structure with space group of Cc and ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature. The high temperature phase exhibited a phase transition from monoclinic (Cc) to rhombohedral (R-3c) when heated to about 40 °C, leading to a high conducting phase with ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 300 °C. LiZr2(PO4)3 prepared at 900 °C (named as low temperature phase, because prepared at low temperature) showed a β-Fe2(SO4)3-type monoclinic structure with space group of P21/n and ionic conductivity of 10−10 S cm−1 at room temperature. The low temperature phase also exhibited a phase transition from monoclinic (P21/n) to orthorhombic (probably Pcan) when heated to 300 °C, leading to a high conducting phase with ionic conductivity of 5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 300 °C. Aono et al. [17] studied NASICON-type LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ge, Ti, Hf), and found that LiTi2(PO4)3 showed the minimum activation energy and the highest ionic conductivity. Among the NASICON-type electrolytes, skeleton of LiTi2(PO4)3 was the most suitable one for Li-ion diffusion; however, its conductivity was still low because of low sinterability. By partially replacing M4+ ions by trivalent ions, Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3, Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 and Li1+xFexHf2-x(PO4)3 were obtained with low porosities and enhanced ionic conductivities of higher than 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 revealed the highest ionic conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is comparable to other high Li-ion conducting materials. However, Ti4+ in Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 could be reduced by lithium, thus, Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 and Li1+xFexHf2-x(PO4)3 are more promising because of their excellent stability. By adding Li3PO4 or Li3BO3 to LiTi2(PO4)3, dense electrolytes could be obtained, and high ionic conductivity of 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was achieved for LiTi2(PO4)3-0.2Li3BO3 because of enhanced grain boundary ionic conductivity and contact between grains [18]. With increase in lithium-salt addition, activation energy of bulk ionic conductivity remained constant, while that of grain boundary ionic conductivity was noted to decrease. Both bulk and grain boundary ionic conductivities were enhanced by lithium-salt addition. The enhancement of grain boundary ionic conductivity was due to decrease of porosity and activation energy, which in turn increased bulk ionic conductivity since bulk ionic conductivity is dependent on grain boundary ionic conductivity. Substitution of Ti4+ in LiTi2(PO4)3 by trivalent elements was studied in detail [[19], [20], [21]]. For Li1+xMxTi2-x(PO4)3 (M = Al, Sc, Y, La), ionic conductivities of electrolytes were observed to increase with increase in Li concentration until x = 0.3, and the mechanism of the increase in ionic conductivity should be attributed to increased Li-ion concentration and decreased porosity [19]. For Li1+xMxTi2-x(PO4)3 with M to be Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, Sc, In, a single phase could be obtained, while for M to be Lu, Y, La, mixed phases of LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3M2(PO4)3 were obtained [20,21]. For all M3+ substituted Li1+xMxTi2-x(PO4)3, porosity was decreased, and Cr3+ substituted electrolyte showed the highest porosity, close to that of LiTi2(PO4)3 (34%). It was assumed that the substitution could cause formation of some glassy second phase which increased density. While Cr3+ has close ionic radius with Ti4+, Ti4+ could be replaced by Cr3+ easily, and no more Cr3+ could help form glassy second phase at grain boundaries. Ionic conductivity of Li1+xMxTi2-x(PO4)3 has been observed to increase with increase in M3+ substitution, even for the ones with mixed phases (M = Lu, Y, La). This was due mainly to densification of electrolytes, and the highest ionic conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was obtained for Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (M = Al, Sc). Fu et al. [22] used melt-quench method to prepare glass-ceramic solid electrolytes 2[Li1+xTi2SixP3-xO12]-AlPO4. Lattice parameters of major conductive phase (based on LiTi2P3O12) increased with Si concentration until x = 0.1 due to substitution of P5+ by Si4+, followed by decreased when x was further increased from 0.1 to 0.4, which was due to substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+. For x > 0.4, the lattice parameters remained almost unchanged, probably because the substitutions reached saturation. For x = 0.4, the maximum ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature was obtained, which meets the requirement for application in ASSBs. By melt-quench method, Goharian et al. [23] prepared glass-ceramics in 100 part [Li1+xCrxTi2-x(PO4)3] and 5 part SiO2 system, and the one with x = 0.5 attained extremely high ionic conductivity of 2.14 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C. With x increased from 0 to 0.5, Cr3+ was incorporated into LiTi2(PO4)3 to substitute Ti4+, and crystallinity of the NASICON increased with decrease of TiO2 impurity. The x = 0.5 glass-ceramic also showed tight contact between grains that could lead to high grain boundary ionic conductivity. These effects together with increased Li-ion amount led to the high ionic conductivity. However, Eckert et al. [24] reported that this high ionic conductivity in Ref. [23] could not be reproduced, thus, this needs further examination.

Although Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP) showed high ionic conductivity, it suffered a redox reaction at 2.5 V vs. Li/Li+ because of reduction of Ti4+, making it incompatible with many low potential anode materials, including lithium [[25], [26], [27]]. Reduction of LATP by lithium or C6Li may induce electronic conductivity in solid electrolyte and cause short-circuit for battery [25]. Li insertion into LiTi2(PO4)3 was conducted [26]. Intercalation and deintercalation could process reversibly, and two solid solutions Li1+xTi2(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.23 and 1.72 ≤ x ≤ 2) were found separated by a two-phase domain (0.23 ≤ x ≤ 1.72). Both the end products LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 exhibited rhombohedral NASICON structures, but lithium distributions were different in these two structures. In LiTi2(PO4)3, Li-ions fully occupied A1 (6b, Z = 6) sites with empty A2 (18e, Z = 6) sites, while in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 A2 (18e, Z = 6) sites were fully occupied with empty A1 (6b, Z = 6) sites. This peculiar lithium distribution in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 increased repulsion between neighboring TiO6 octahedrons and extended c axis. Structure of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 was further studied by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction and 7Li MAS NMR, and it was found that Li-ions occupied two subsites in the A2 (18e, Z = 6) cavities [27].

Another kind of NASICON-type solid electrolyte is Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (LAGP), showing high ionic conductivity of above 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [28,29]. LAGP glass-ceramics were prepared by melt-quench and recrystallization [28]. Ionic conductivity reached the maximum value of 4.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature for x = 0.5, which is higher than LAGP prepared by conventional sintering. Crystalline in glass-ceramic form could have dense microstructure and close contact between grains, which is the main reason for the enhancement of ionic conductivity. Based on Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic, excess Li2O was added to prepare Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3-xLi2O glass-ceramics [29]. It was believed that some excess lithium was incorporated into crystal lattice of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, and secondary lithium-containing phases were formed from excess lithium, which could act as nucleating agents for crystallization of glasses. Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3-0.05Li2O reached the maximum ionic conductivity with bulk and total values of 1.18 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 7.25 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. This composition showed excellent electrochemical stability with lithium deposition and dissolution at voltage between 0.5 V and 0.4 V vs. Li/Li+ and was stable up to 6 V vs. Li/Li+. Thokchom et al. [30] prepared glass-ceramic with composition of 19.75 Li2O·6.17 Al2O3·37.04 GeO2·37.04 P2O5 by melt-quench and crystallization. The one crystallized at 850 °C for 12 h showed the highest ionic conductivity of 5.08 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C, and the superionic conducting phase was Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. Higher crystallization temperature (950 °C) led to dielectric impurity phase AlPO4, which could interact with Li+ to form space charge that mediated ion transport and caused higher activation energy. Simultaneous doping of Ge by Al and Cr in LiGe2(PO4)3 was investigated with designed compositions of Li1+x+yAlxCryGe2-x-y(PO4)3 (x + y = 0.5) [31]. The samples with y = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.4 and 0.5 showed main phases related to NASICON LiGe2(PO4)3, and the one with y = 0.1 contained no secondary CrPO4 phase and the least amount of GeO2. Accordingly, Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 demonstrated the highest ionic conductivity of 6.65 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 26 °C. Thus, proper amount of Cr doping could induce high ionic conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 glass-ceramic. Furthermore, Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 exhibited lithium deposition and dissolution at voltage between − 0.53 V and 0.44 V vs. Li/Li+ and was stable up to 7 V vs. Li/Li+. Kunshina et al. [32] developed a liquid-phase method to synthesize Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte. Compared with solid-phase method, the liquid-phase method could obtain GeO2 existed in highly active amorphous state, which could decrease temperature and duration of synthesis. A single-phase Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte could be obtained by the liquid-phase method, which showed higher conductivity than the counterpart prepared by solid-phase method. A cold sintering process (CSP) was reported to densify Li1.5Al0.4Cr0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolytes at low temperatures, which could avoid lithium loss and second phase formation caused by high-temperature heat treatments [33]. Through CSP at 120 °C for 20 min, relative density of the electrolyte reached 80%, and further heat treatment at 650 °C for 5 min led to ionic conductivity of 5.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Reversible deposition and dissolution of lithium were observed at voltage between − 0.8 V and 0.8 V vs. Li/Li+, indicating that Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 maintained Li-ion conducting property though being reduced by lithium. Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 was tested as anode material and showed good retention with reversible capacity of 300 mAh g−1 at 150 mA g−1 for 100 cycles and coulombic efficiency of almost 100%. It was presumed that Li3PO4 and AlPO4 produced during reduction of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 surrounded Ge, which could buffer volume change of Ge during alloying and de-alloying with lithium. Excellent rate performance was also obtained for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, which showed capacity of about 180 mAh g−1 at current of 1500 mA g−1. However, the reversible charge-discharge only happened for reaction (2), and it is not clear yet whether reaction (1) could also process reversibly.

LAGP is a very promising solid electrolyte for applications in ASSBs. However, GeO2, one of precursors for preparation of LAGP, is expensive, which can significantly increase cost of LAGP-based ASSBs [35]. Thus, it is important to replace Ge with other cheaper elements, which at the same time may also reduce ionic conductivity. Balance between the property and the cost should be considered for application of LAGP in ASSBs.

Lithium-containing garnets were firstly discovered in 1968 with composition of Li3Ln3M2O12 (M = Te, W; Ln = Y, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) [36]. For Li3Ln3Te2O12, lattice constant is greatly influenced by ionic radius of Ln element, compared with garnet Ln3Ga5O12. Li3Ln3Te2O12 could form garnets with more types of Ln elements than Li3Ln3W2O12, which was due possibly to relatively stable regular TeO6 octahedrons formed inside Li3Ln3Te2O12 garnets, while for Li3Ln3W2O12 distorted WO6 octahedrons formed. Thangadurai et al. [37] firstly reported the garnet, Li5La3M2O12 (M = Ta, Nb), showing lithium ionic conductivities in the magnitude of 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Li5La3Nb2O12 showed slightly higher ionic conductivity and lower activation energy than Li5La3Ta2O12. These compounds were isotropic conductors, and Li-ions could diffuse in the 3-dimensional framework. At the same time, Li5La3Ta2O12 was found to be stable in contact with molten lithium, which was probably because Ta is less reducible than other transition metals including Ti, Nb etc. Doping strategy has also been used to modify the garnets. For instance, Ba-doped Li6BaLa2Ta2O12 showed ionic conductivity of 4.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 22 °C [38]. For Li6BaLa2Ta2O12 and Li6SrLa2Ta2O12, total ionic conductivities showed the same magnitude as bulk ionic conductivities, and they are superior to other types of oxide electrolytes. Li6BaLa2Ta2O12 was found to be stable against molten lithium as well, and to be stable up to 6 V vs. Li/Li+, exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability. Nb-doped Li6BaLa2Nb2O12 showed dark color after contact with molten lithium, indicating reduction of the electrolyte. Thus, Ta is an important transition metal element to enhance electrochemical stability of oxide solid electrolyte. Crystal structure of Li5La3M2O12 (M = Ta, Nb) is cubic with a space group of Ia-3d (#230). Its framework is composed of La, M and O ions, and Li-ions distribute inside the framework, as shown in Fig. 2 [39]. For Li5La3Ta2O12, Li-ions occupy 24d sites inside tetrahedrons with occupancy of 0.802(4), and 48 g and 96 h sites inside octahedrons with occupancies of 0.139(8) and 0.147(9), respectively. Thus, occupancy of Li-ions inside octahedrons is 0.433(1), and 67.9% of the octahedral Li-ions are displaced. The octahedrons are connected by shared edges, and distances between Li-ions in neighbouring octahedrons are irregular due to the displacement of Li-ions. The shortest separation between Li-ions can lead to facile Li-ion hopping and high ionic conductivity. Li5La3Nb2O12 shows similar structure and Li-ion occupancies as Li5La3Ta2O12, thus, ionic conduction in Li5La3Nb2O12 should originate from the same mechanism as Li5La3Ta2O12.

Murugan et al. [40] prepared a new garnet-type of solid electrolyte, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), showing ionic conductivity of about 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, and its crystal structure was cubic, the same as that of Li5La3M2O12 (M = Ta, Nb) [39]. Grain boundary resistance was found to be less than 50% of total resistance, thus, total ionic conductivity was in the same magnitude as bulk ionic conductivity, leading to high total ionic conductivity. Geiger et al. [41] discovered that Li7La3Zr2O12 underwent a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic at 100–150 °C, and the cubic phase exhibited higher ionic conductivity than the tetragonal phase. Therefore, stabilization of cubic phase at room temperature becomes critical. It was noted experimentally that a cubic phase could be achieved when Li7La3Zr2O12 was sintered in an alumina crucible [41]. Detailed studies showed that Al3+ doping in Li+ sites could stabilize the high temperature cubic phase to room temperature. Ohta et al. [42] partially doped Nb5+ on Zr4+ sites to obtain Li6.75La3(Zr1.75Nb0.25)O12, resulting in an ionic conductivity of 8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a wide electrochemical stability window of 0–9 V vs. Li/Li+. Bulk resistance contributed to main part of total resistance, and variation of ionic conductivity upon variation of Nb doping amount was presumed to be due to change of Li-ion mobility inside grains. An ASSB was constructed using Li6.75La3(Zr1.75Nb0.25)O12 as solid electrolyte with lithium as anode and PLD prepared LiCoO2 as cathode, which realized charge-discharge capacities of about 90% of theoretical capacity, demonstrating that Li6.75La3(Zr1.75Nb0.25)O12 was appropriate for application in ASSBs. Murugan et al. [43] used Y3+ to dope Zr4+ site in Li7La3Zr2O12, and the obtained Li7.06La3Y0.06Zr1.94O12 showed high bulk and total ionic conductivities of 9.56 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 8.10 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively, which were higher than those of Li7La3Zr2O12. One of the key requirements to achieve high total conductivity is to obtain a dense microstructure so that the grain boundary conductivity can be largely increased. Li et al. [44] prepared Li7-xLa3Zr2-xTaxO12 for x = 0.6 by solid-state reaction in alumina crucibles, and achieved ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The prepared Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 was electrochemically stable at voltage between 0 and 5 V vs. Li/Li+. Certain amount of Al element was detected in grain boundaries of the pellet. Al was obviously from alumina crucible and acted as sintering aid to induce a good bonding between grains and hence promoted Li-ion conduction in the grain boundaries. Ga-substituted Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 was prepared in a dried O2 atmosphere, and showed ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 24 °C and 2.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 42 °C [45]. Ga atoms located in tetrahedral positions, which could promote random distribution of Li-ions and increased ionic conductivity. However, when the amount of Ga is higher than 0.15, Li-ions transportation in the tetrahedral positions could be blocked, leading to a decrease in ionic conductivity. The dry sintering atmosphere could avoid Li+/H+ exchange due to moisture, while Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12 (x = 0, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3) prepared in the ambient atmosphere showed relative density of lower than 70% and Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 showed ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 24 °C, which was about three magnitudes lower than that of the counterpart prepared in dry atmosphere. Rettenwander et al. [46] co-substituted Al and Ga in Li7La3Zr2O12 to prepare Li6.4Al0.2-xGaxLa3Zr2O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2). Structures of the electrolytes showed phase transition from garnet space group of Ia-3d (x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.10) to non-garnet space group of I-43d (x = 0.15, 0.20). This phase transition led to decrease of activation energy from ∼0.28 eV (x = 0.05, 0.10) to ∼0.26 eV (x = 0.15, 0.20) and increase of ionic conductivity from 2.63 × 10−4 S cm−1 (x = 0.00) to 1.18 × 10−3 S cm−1 (x = 0.20) at 20 °C. The one of x = 0.20 tested with Li electrodes showed ionic conductivity of 1.32 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 20 °C. Wu et al. [47] investigated influence of Ga doping on Li7-3xGaxLa3Zr2O12. For x < 0.20, the garnets showed both cubic and tetragonal structures, while for x ≥ 0.20, there existed only cubic structure, which showed higher ionic conductivity. Li6.25Ga0.25La3Zr2O12 (x = 0.25) showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.46 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Buannic et al. [48] prepared Li6.55+yGa0.15La3Zr2-yScyO12 by a dual substitution strategy. The Ga substitution could stabilize cubic crystal structure, and the Sc substitution could increase Li-ion number. Li6.65Ga0.15La3Zr1.90Sc0.10O12 (y = 0.10) showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C, which was related to Li-only occupation of Li96h sites. Wu et al. [49] doped Rb at La sites in Li6.10Ga0.30La3Zr2O12, and achieved high ionic conductivity of 1.62 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature for Li6.20Ga0.30La2.95Rb0.05Zr2O12. The high ionic conductivity was possibly related to a structural change and a higher Li+ concentration caused by Rb doping.

The gartnet-type of Li-ion conductors is very promising for application in ASSBs. However, it was not stable in the ambient atmosphere due to moisture and CO2 [50,51]. Thus, it is important to increase stability of LLZO in the ambient atmosphere.

Inaguma et al. [52] firstly prepared perovskite-type solid electrolytes Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3 (LLTO), which showed bulk ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 and total ionic conductivity of higher than 2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature for Li0.34(1)La0.51(1)TiO2.94(2). Crystal structure of LLTO is shown in Fig. 3 [53] where Li and La ions occupy centre A sites, and Ti-ions occupy corner B sites. Oxygen-ions form bottlenecks causing potential barriers for Li-ions migration from one A site to a neighboring A site. Since size of the bottlenecks can be changed by changing lattice parameters, many attempts tried to enlarge lattice parameters of the perovskite-type solid electrolytes. Inaguma et al. [54] doped 5 mol% Sr2+ in A sites of Li1/2La1/2TiO3, and achieved bulk ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C. Substitution of La and Li by Sr increased lattice constant of perovskite structure, thus, diffusion space of Li-ion was increased and ionic conductivity was improved. However, doping by Sr also caused decrease of Li-ion concentration, and would decrease ionic conductivity when amount of Sr was higher than 0.1. At the same time, research on Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3 showed that ionic conductivity was influenced by fractions of Li-ions and vacancies at A sites.

Despite the high bulk ionic conductivity, the grain boundary ionic conductivity of LLTO was only in the magnitude of 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, resulting in low total ionic conductivity [52]. At the same time, LLTO was not stable at voltage below about 1.8 V vs. Li/Li+, making it incompatible with many low potential anode materials, including lithium [55]. The low electrochemical stability was caused by Ti4+ in LLTO since it can be reduced at low voltage vs. Li/Li+. Two lithiation steps of 1.8–1.1 V and 0.6–0 V vs. Li/Li+ were observed for Li0.35La0.55TiO3, and the step of 1.8–1.1 V was assigned to lithium insertion into Li0.35La0.55TiO3. About 0.75–0.9 Li could be inserted into Li0.35La0.55TiO3 during the first lithiation step, but amount of reversibly inserted/extracted Li was 0.48. A possible phase transition from ABO3 perovskite phase to A2BO3 monoclinic phase was proposed for Li0.35La0.55TiO3 with 0.24 Li insertion. Thus, it is necessary to substitute Ti by other elements to increase the electrochemical stability.

To address this issue, Chung et al. [56] substituted Ti4+ with Sn4+, Zr4+, Mn4+ and Ge4+, and found that ionic conductivity was increased by substitution of Mn4+ and Ge4+. However, to avoid formation of second phase, only partial Ti4+ could be substituted and the remaining Ti4+ could still be reduced. Thangadurai et al. [57] synthesized a new perovskite-type solid electrolyte LiSr1.65Zr1.3Ta1.7O9 that was stable in contact with lithium because oxidation states of Zr4+ and Ta5+ are stable against reduction. However, ionic conductivity of LiSr1.65Zr1.3Ta1.7O9 was as low as 1.3 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C, which is lower than the 10−4 S cm−1 requirement for solid electrolytes. In order to improve ionic conductivity, Chen et al. [7] further investigated composition Li2x-ySr1-xTayZr1-yO3 and found that Li3/8Sr7/16Ta3/4Zr1/4O3 (LSTZ) showed the highest ionic conductivity with bulk and grain boundary ones of 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.33 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, respectively. Though its bulk ionic conductivity is one magnitude lower than that of LLTO, its grain boundary ionic conductivity is one magnitude higher than that of LLTO, leading to better total ionic conductivity. At the same time, LSTZ was stable at voltage above 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+, making it compatible with many low potential anode materials, including Li4Ti5O12, TiO2, Nb2O5 etc. At voltage below 1 V vs. Li/Li+, about 0.08 Li could be inserted into LiSr1.65Zr1.3Ta1.7O9, which is much lower than 0.48 of Li0.35La0.55TiO3. Inada et al. [58] prepared LSTZ by powder-bed sintering, and the obtained electrolyte showed high ionic conductivity with bulk and total ones of 3.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 27 °C, respectively. Compared with LSTZ sintered without mother powder, LSTZ sintered with mother powder showed less amount of impurities and Li loss during high temperature reaction was largely suppressed. Density and grain size of LSTZ were also improved by powder-bed sintering method. Due to these effects, total conductivity was improved to about 3 times of previously reported value (8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C). Li2x-ySr1-xTayZr1-yO3 (x = 0.75y) was further studied in detail [59]. Almost single perovskite LSTZ phase could be obtained for y = 0.60–0.75, and ionic conductivity increased with increase of y. The maximum ionic conductivity with bulk and total ones of 2.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 27 °C was obtained for Li3/8Sr7/16Ta3/4Zr1/4O3 (y = 0.75). By replacing Zr with Hf, Li3/8Sr7/16Ta3/4Hf1/4O3 (LSTH) was prepared by solid-state reaction [60]. It showed higher ionic conductivity (3.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) than LSTZ. The electrochemical stability window was from 1.4 V to at least 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+.

While LSTZ and LSTH are promising solid electrolyte for ASSBs, there are still some bottleneck issues restricting their applications. Firstly, preparation temperature of LSTZ/LSTH was 1300 °C, which is very harsh and incompatible with electrode materials for battery construction using co-sintering method. To decrease processing temperature, Chen et al. [61] studied Li3/8Sr7/16Nb3/4Zr1/4O3 (LSNZ) electrolyte, and found that the highest ionic conductivity could be achieved at the sintering temperature of 1200 °C, 100 °C lower than that of LSTZ/LSTH. LSNZ was electrochemically stable at voltage above 1.2 V vs. Li/Li+, showing similar stability with LSTZ/LSTH. However, ionic conductivity of LSNZ was only 2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C. Kong et al. [62] reported that by adding excess lithium (20%) and sintering aid (1 wt% B2O3), ionic conductivity of LSNZ could be increased. However, the best sample showed only 1.98 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C. La doping at Sr sites could further increase ionic conductivity to 3.33 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C for Li3/8Sr7/16-3x/2LaxZr1/4Nb3/4O3 (x = 0.05) [63]. However, the ionic conductivity is one magnitude lower than that of LSTZ/LSTH. Secondly, interfacial problems between LSTZ/LSTH/LSNZ and electrode materials have been less studied, which are important factors influencing performance of ASSBs [64].

LISICON is abbreviation of lithium super ionic conductor. Hong et al. [65] firstly reported a LISICON-type solid electrolyte Li14Zn(GeO4)4, which showed ionic conductivity of 1.25 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 300 °C. Two factors for fast alkali-ion (Li-ion) conduction were proposed, including size of bottlenecks between neighboring alkali-ion (Li-ion) positions and bonding energy between mobile alkali-ion (Li-ion) and network anion (O2-). In the case of Li14Zn(GeO4)4, [Li11Zn(GeO4)]3- forms the network, and the other three Li-ions can diffuse freely between interstitial positions in the network. Bottlenecks between the interstitial positions are large enough for Li-ions to transport, and each O2- is bonded to four network cations (Li+, Zn2+, Ge4+) and has weak bonding with mobile Li-ion. However, Li-ions in Li14Zn(GeO4)4 can only diffuse in two dimensions because of parallelogram shape of the bottlenecks. Detailed study revealed ionic conductivity of 2 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 50 °C and 1.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 33 °C [66,67]. Crystal structure of this type of solid electrolyte is related to γ-Li3PO4 [68]. For pure γ-Li3PO4, since there is no Li-ion occupying interstitial positions, Li-ions can only diffuse by vacancy mechanism, causing low ionic conductivity. Li-ion vacancies form in Li14Zn(GeO4)4, if all P5+ and partial Li+ are replaced by Ge4+ and Zn2+ in the pure γ-Li3PO4, respectively. Three mobile Li-ions in Li14Zn(GeO4)4 occupy 4c and 4a interstitial positions inside the framework, thus, Li-ions can diffuse through both vacancy and interstitial mechanisms, and ionic conductivity is hence improved [65]. However, ionic conductivity of Li14Zn(GeO4)4 was still too low to be used and it should be further studied for ASSBs and other devices.

Kuwano et al. [69] prepared new LISICON-type of solid electrolytes Li3+xGexV1-xO4 (0 < x < 1), among which two compositions Li3.5Ge0.5VO4 and Li3.6Ge0.6V0.4O4 revealed high bulk and total ionic conductivities of 4 × 10−5 S cm−1 and ∼10−5 S cm−1 at 18 °C, respectively. Li3+xGexV1-xO4 is a solid solution between γⅡ-Li3VO4 and Li4GeO4, which shows the same structure as γⅡ-Li3PO4. For γⅡ-Li3VO4 there is no interstitial Li-ions, while in Li3+xGexV1-xO4, partial V5+ is replaced by Ge4+ and Li+, and extra Li-ions occupies interstitial positions leading to high ionic conductivities. Furthermore, Li3+xGexV1-xO4 showed good thermal stability and was stable in contact with CO2 in the ambient atmosphere. Hu et al. [70] prepared solid solutions between Li4SiO4 and Li3PO4, Li4-xSi1-xPxO4 (0 < x < 1). The highest ionic conductivity of Li3.5Si0.5P0.5O4 and Li3.4Si0.4P0.6O4 was about 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature. Li4SiO4 and Li3PO4 could form solid solutions over the whole composition range. However, because the two end members have different structures, there existed a structural change at x = 0.5 for the solid solutions. At x = 0.5 and 0.6, with Si4+ partially substituting P5+, interstitial Li-ions are introduced to the Li3PO4 structure, leading to increased ionic conductivities compared to Li3PO4. Song et al. [71] partially doped O2- with Cl−, and obtained LISION-type solid electrolytes Li10.42Si1.5P1.5Cl0.08O11.92 and Li10.42Ge1.5P1.5Cl0.08O11.92 with ionic conductivities of 1.03 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 3.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 27 °C, respectively. At the same time, these two solid electrolytes were stable with lithium and up to 9 V vs. Li/Li+. Ionic radius of Cl− is larger than that of O2-, thus, partial substitution of O2- by Cl− could increase lattice constants and size of bottlenecks for Li-ion diffusion. At the same time, because electronegativity of Cl− is smaller than that of O2-, bonding between Li+ and Cl− is weaker than that between Li+ and O2-. Due to these effects, the Cl− doped electrolytes showed high ionic conductivities. Deng at al [72]. studied Li4SiO4, Li3.75Si0.75P0.25O4, Li4.25Si0.75Al0.25O4, Li4Al0.33Si0.33P0.33O4 and Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4 by experiments and simulations. Three Li-ion diffusion mechanisms were discovered from low to high temperatures: local oscillation, isolated hopping and superionic motion. Substitution of Si in Li4SiO4 by P, Al or Ge could induce mixed polyanion effect, which could lower temperature of transition between diffusion mechanisms and increase ionic conductivity. By MD simulation, Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4 was predicted to have ionic conductivity of 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is much higher than Li4SiO4.

Overall, ionic conductivity of LISICON-type solid electrolytes was too low to be used in ASSBs. Kamaya et al. [73] replaced O2- in LISICON-type solid electrolytes with S2-, and obtained thio-LISICON-type Li10GeP2S12 with ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature, which was comparable to organic liquid electrolytes. The sulfide-type solid electrolytes will be introduced in section 2.7.

LiPON is abbreviation of lithium phosphorus oxynitride. Different from other electrolytes discussed above, LiPON is a kind of amorphous Li-ion solid electrolyte. Bates et al. [74] firstly synthesized LiPON using radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering with Li3PO4 as target in a pure N2 atmosphere. Ionic conductivity of this solid electrolyte was about 2 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C, and stable with lithium. Suzuki et al. [75] modified composition of target to a mixture of Li3PO4 and Li2O with molar ratio of 1:2, and ionic conductivity of prepared LiPON was improved to 6.4 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which was three times of that of conventional LiPON prepared from pure Li3PO4. The enhancement of ionic conductivity was due to increase of Li-ions inside the electrolyte. However, further increase in Li-ion amount in the target mixture led to decrease of ionic conductivity, which was probably caused by decrease of relative amount of phosphate chains which could promote Li-ion conduction. Li et al. [76] prepared LiPON films by ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD), which could control nitrogen content by adjusting flow ratio of N2 and Ar. When the flow ratio was 1:8, the nitrogen doping reached the maximum, and the film showed the best mechanical properties and the highest ionic conductivity of 4.5 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature. Su et al. [77] prepared LiPON films with high nitrogen content by RF magnetron sputtering, which showed mean ionic conductivity of 4.9 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 22 °C and transparency of higher than 80% in visible light range. Fujibayashi et al. [78] reported LiPON films prepared by metalorganic-chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), which showed high ionic conductivities of 5.9 × 10−6 S cm−1 and 5.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 for thickness of 190 nm and 95 nm, respectively. Van-Jodin et al. [79] deposited LiPON films by RF sputtering in two ways: without magnetron (non-standard) and with magnetron (standard). The non-standard LiPON showed ionic conductivity of 6.7 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 24 °C, which was much higher than that of the standard LiPON (1.4 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 24 °C). In the standard LiPON, only one type of phosphate group PO43- was observed, while in the non-standard LiPON, there also existed some other phosphate groups including PO32- and PO2−. These phosphate groups could cause disorder in the structure, which led to higher Li-ion mobility in the non-standard LiPON. Several deposition parameters were studied for their effects on LiPON electrolytes, including RF power, N2 pressure, target-substrate distance and target density [80]. The deposition rate would be higher with higher RF power, lower N2 pressure, smaller target-substrate distance and higher target density. The prepared LiPON films showed ionic conductivities between 2.5 × 10−7 S cm−1 and 1.8 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C, and lower RF power, higher N2 pressure, smaller target-substrate distance and higher target density could lead to higher ionic conductivity. It was demonstrated that ionic conductivity increased with N/P ratio, which could be increased by lower RF power, higher N2 pressure and smaller target-substrate distance. N incorporation into LiPON was affected by reaction between N2 gas and thin film surface, poisoning effect of target etc. Because LiPON film was very thin and exhibited low resistance, it was used for thin-film ASSBs and excellent charge-discharge properties were achieved [81,82]. Structure of a LiPON based thin-film battery is shown in Fig. 4 [82]. In this thin-film battery, cathode, anode, electrolyte and current collectors were deposited from vapor phases, and protective coating on the top could prevent Li anode from reaction with air. At the same time, LiPON-type solid electrolytes were stable at voltage of 0–∼5.5 V vs. Li/Li+, enabling use of many types of electrode materials in thin-film ASSBs [83].

Though LiPON-type solid electrolytes are promising for thin-film ASSBs, they are not appropriate for bulk ASSBs because of low room temperature ionic conductivities of 10−6-10−5 S cm−1 [74,75,80].

Li3N solid electrolyte was prepared by reaction of pure lithium ribbon with nitrogen followed by cold-pressing and sintering in nitrogen at 650 °C [10]. The obtained Li3N showed density of about 80% of theoretical density and exhibited ionic conductivity of 3.7 × 10−8 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which was lower than 3.0 × 10−7 S cm−1 of 96% pure Li3N purchased from ROC/RIC company, but higher than that of a loose powder of Li3N. The higher ionic conductivity of the 96% pure Li3N was probably due to some dopants in the electrolyte. Li3N annealed at about 750 °C in 1 atm of nitrogen attained high ionic conductivity of 2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C [84]. It was assumed that the high temperature annealing increased Li/N ratio in the electrolyte, thus led to the high ionic conductivity. Rea et al. [85] prepared Li3N electrolyte by reaction between lithium rod and nitrogen in a nitrogen atmosphere, and sintered at 800 °C. Ionic conductivities measured by AC and DC methods were 4 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. Despite the high ionic conductivity, Li3N could react with cathode materials with potential higher than 1.74 V vs. Li/Li+ including TiS2, PbI2, PbS and AlI3, indicating a narrow electrochemical stability window. Crystal structure of Li3N is shown in Fig. 5 [10]. It is consisted of hexagonal Li2N layers, which are connected by Li-ions to form N-Li-N bridges, and Li-ions can diffuse inside the 2-dimensional tunnels. Color of the Li3N ranges between ruby red and violet black, suggesting covalent bonding between atoms.

Lithium nitride halides were demonstrated to be solid electrolytes with high Li-ion conductivities [86,87]. Kitahama et al. [88] studied solid electrolytes in Li3N-LiCl system. The electrolytes in the composition range of 2Li3N·3LiCl to 9Li3N·11LiCl showed cubic antifluorite structures, and a new phase of Li9N2Cl3 was found with non-cubic structure. The new Li9N2Cl3 phase showed the highest ionic conductivity among the Li3N-LiCl system, which was higher than 10−7 S cm−1 at room temperature. Hatake et al. [89] prepared 3Li3N-MI (M = Li, Na, K, Rb) solid electrolytes by solid-state reaction at 600 °C, and the electrolytes showed ionic conductivities of 7.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and decomposition voltages of 2.5–2.8 V. The total ionic conductivities were almost equal to bulk ionic conductivities, while grain boundary resistances were negligible because of good sinterability. At the same time, pressed compacts of the electrolyte powder exhibited ionic conductivities of higher than 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature. Grain boundary resistances of the pressed compacts were higher than those of the sintered electrolytes, but the total ionic conductivities were not much lower than the bulk ionic conductivities, due probably to incorporation of iodide ions in the electrolytes. Due to the relatively high ionic conductivities of the pressed compacts, ASSBs could be constructed by simply pressing. Li/3Li3N-MI/TiS2 batteries could support a constant load of 1 MΩ with current of 2.5 μA cm−2 at voltage above 2.2 V for more than 10 h. C/3Li3N-KI/LiTiS2 batteries could charge-discharge for 10 cycles with coulombic efficiency of higher than 87%.

Partial substitution of Li-ions in Li3N by other cations were investigated. Li3AlN2 crystallized in cubic antifluorite structure showed ionic conductivity of 5 × 10−8 S cm−1 at room temperature and decomposition voltage of 0.85 V at 104 °C [90]. LiSi2N3 solid electrolytes were prepared by hot-pressing [91]. Addition of Y2O3, CaF2 or B2O3 could densify the LiSi2N3 electrolyte. At sintering temperature of 1600 °C, B2O3-doped LiSi2N3 showed higher ionic conductivity (7.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 327 °C) than undoped LiSi2N3. The undoped LiSi2N3 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 327 °C. Ca doping in LiSi2N3 could enhance ionic conductivity [92]. Densified Li0.85Ca0.075Si2N3 showed ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Li3N-type solid electrolytes showed barely satisfactory ionic conductivities. However, the decomposition voltages were too low for high energy density ASSBs.

Sulfide-type solid electrolytes are closely related to a LISICON-type solid electrolyte γ-Li3PO4, with S2- replacing O2- [93,94]. Interaction between S2- and Li+ is weaker than that between O2- and Li+. Thus, the sulfide-type solid electrolytes showed higher Li-ion mobility and ionic conductivities than the oxide-type counterparts [93]. Sulfide-type solid electrolytes can be classified into three types: glasses, glass-ceramics and ceramics, which all show ionic conductivities comparable to organic liquid electrolytes. Glass/glass-ceramic Li2S-P2S5 and ceramic thio-LISICON Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 (0 < x < 1) are the most promising ones.

Ceramic thio-LISICON Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 (0 < x < 1) solid electrolytes have attracted great attention in recent years because of their superior properties [73,94]. Based on LISICON-type solid electrolytes, Kanno et al. [95] replaced O2- with S2-, and prepared six new thio-LISICON electrolytes: Li2GeS3, Li4GeS4, Li2ZnGeS4, Li4-2xZnxGeS4, Li5GaS4 and Li4+x+δ(Ge1-δ′-xGax)S4. Li2ZnGeS4, Li4-2xZnxGeS4 (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20) and Li4+x+δ(Ge1-δ′-xGax)S4 were prepared based on Li4GeS4 with substitution of Li+ by Zn2+ and substitution of Ge4+ by Ga3+. Li4+x+δ(Ge1-δ′-xGax)S4 showed the highest ionic conductivity of 6.5 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C with x = 0.25. Furthermore, Li4+x+δ(Ge1-δ′-xGax)S4 was electrochemically stable up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+. Based on Li4GeS4, new thio-LISICON solid electrolytes Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 were prepared by partially doping P5+ at Ge4+ sites [94]. Ionic conductivity increased with P content and reached the maximum of 2.17 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C for x = 0.75. Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 was electrochemically stable with lithium and up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+. The Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 (0 < x < 1) system can be divided into three composition regions with different superlattice structures: region Ⅰ (0 < x < 0.6), region Ⅱ (0.6 < x < 0.8) and region Ⅲ (0.8 < x < 1). Based on Li4GeS4 parent lattice a × b × c, diffraction data of electrolytes in these three regions could be indexed to lattices of a × 3b × 2c, a × 3b × 3c and a × 3b × 2c, respectively. The different structures were probably caused by variation of cation ordering. For thio-LISICON based on Li4SiS4 and Li4GeS4, there exist two doping strategies to improve ionic conductivity: vacancy-doping (Li4-xSi1-xPxS4, Li4-2xZnxGeS4, Li4-xGe1-xPxS4) and interstitial-doping (Li4+xSi1-xAlxS4, Li4+xGe1-xGaxS4), which creates Li-ion vacancies or Li-ion interstitials in the structures. The vacancy-doped germanium system Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 showed the highest ionic conductivity. In 2011, Kamaya et al. [73] synthesized a new thio-LISICON solid electrolyte Li10GeP2S12, showing high ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 27 °C. Though composition of Li10GeP2S12 could be fitted to Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 when x = 2/3 (thio-LISCION region Ⅱ), this new solid electrolyte showed different structure with previously synthesized thio-LISICON Li4-xGe1-xPxS4 (0 < x < 1). Crystal structure of Li10GeP2S12 is shown in Fig. 6 [73]. Its 3-dimensional framework is composed of (Ge0.5P0.5)S4 tetrahedrons, PS4 tetrahedrons, LiS4 tetrahedrons and LiS6 octahedrons. The (Ge0.5P0.5)S4 tetrahedrons and the LiS6 octahedrons connect each other to form 1-dimensional chains along c-axis, and these chains are connected by the PS4 tetrahedrons. Li-ions inside the LiS4 tetrahedrons (16 h and 8f sites) form the 1-dimensional conduction pathways. It was found by neutron diffraction that thermal vibration of Li-ions at the 16 h and 8f sites were highly anisotropic, and the Li-ions were displaced toward interstitial positions between two 16 h sites and between 16 h and 8f sites, which demonstrated existence of the 1-dimensional conduction pathways. The high ionic conductivity of Li10GeP2S12 is superior to those of other solid electrolytes, and comparable to those of organic liquid electrolytes. Even at low temperatures, Li10GeP2S12 still showed satisfactory ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at − 30 °C and 4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at − 45 °C. At the same time, Li10GeP2S12 was stable with lithium and up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+. A LiCoO2/Li10GeP2S12/In battery was successfully demonstrated to charge-discharge for 8 cycles with capacity over 120 mAh g−1.

Mo et al. [96] studied Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) by first principles calculation, and it was predicted that LGPS was a 3-dimensional Li-ion conductor, and Li-ion diffusion in ab plane was not as fast as in c direction. Li-ions in LiS6 octahedrons could participate in conduction in ab plane. Ionic conductivities in c direction and in ab plane were predicted to be 4 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 27 °C, respectively. However, diffusion in ab plane is important for the overall diffusion, because Li-ions can crossover between 1-dimensional channels in c direction. At the same time, it showed that LGPS was not stable against lithium, and decomposition voltage of LGPS was lower than 5 V, which was inconsistent with reported experimental results. It was proposed that decomposition of LGPS could form Li2S or P2S5 in interfaces between electrolyte and electrodes, which became passivation layers to prevent LGPS from further decomposition. Ong et al. [97] studied Li10±1MP2X12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn, Al, P; X = O, S, Se) family by first principles calculation. Cation-substituted Li10SiP2S12, Li10SnP2S12, Li11AlP2S12 and Li9P3S12 showed similar properties with Li10GeP2S12. Oxygen-substituted Li10MP2O12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn, Al, P) showed lower ionic conductivities and were less stable. The lower ionic conductivity of Li10GeP2O12 than that of Li10GeP2S12 was probably due to smaller anion radius and polarizability of O2-, as observed in comparison between LISICON and thio-LISICON. Selenium-substituted Li10MP2Se12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn, Al, P) showed larger cell volumes, but only marginally higher ionic conductivities than the sulfide counterparts. Study on effect of lattice parameter of Li10GeP2S12 showed that decrease of lattice parameter could decrease ionic conductivity significantly, while increase of lattice parameter could only increase ionic conductivity by small amount. Thus, it can be concluded that in the thio-LISICON structure, S2- is near optimal for Li-ion conduction. Considering low availability of selenium, air and moisture sensitivity of Li10GeP2S12 cannot be addressed by substitution of S by other anions.

Sun et al. [98] substituted partial sulfur in Li10GeP2S12 by oxygen to prepare Li10GeP2S12-xOx (0 ≤ x < 0.9) electrolytes. Li10GeP2S11.7O0.3 and Li10GeP2S11.4O0.6 showed ionic conductivities of 1.03 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 8.43 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively, which are not much lower than that of Li10GeP2S12 (1.2 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 27 °C). Incorporation of oxygen could promote electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. Kato et al. [99] reported that Cl-doped Si-analogue of Li10GeP2S12, Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 showed ionic conductivity of 2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is the highest among the reported Li-ion electrolytes. Richards et al. [100] predicted highly conductive electrolyte Li1+2xZn1-xPS4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) by ab initio computation. Calculated ionic conductivity of Li2Zn0.5PS4 was 5.38 × 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature, showing promising potential.

Prior to development of ceramic thio-LISICON solid electrolytes, investigation focus of sulfide-type solid electrolytes was glass and glass-ceramic Li2S-P2S5 [93,101]. Mizuno et al. [102] prepared ceramic, glass and glass-ceramic 70Li2S-30P2S5 solid electrolytes. The glass and glass-ceramic samples showed high ionic conductivities of 5.4 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 3.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. However, ionic conductivity of the ceramic sample prepared by solid-state reaction was only 2.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 at room temperature, and low conductive Li3PS4 and Li4P2S6 phases were identified. Thus, solid-state reaction method is not appropriate for Li2S-P2S5 solid electrolytes to obtain high ionic conductivity. Zhang et al. [103] prepared 0.33[(1-y)B2S3-yP2S5]-0.67Li2S (0 ≤ y ≤ 0.3, 0.9 ≤ y ≤ 1.0) glasses by melt-quench. Because of existence of two network formers, the obtained glass solid electrolytes showed higher ionic conductivities than the single network former glasses (1-x)B2S3-xLi2S (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.75) and (1-x)P2S5-xLi2S (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 0.7). The glass 0.23B2S5-0.10P2S5-0.67Li2S (y = 0.3) showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1.41 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Hayashi et al. [104] prepared xLi2S-(100-x)P2S5 glass solid electrolytes by mechanical milling, which was much easier than melt-quench. The mechanical milling could be performed at room temperature, and the obtained electrolyte powder could be applied to ASSBs by simply pressing. The glass formation region could be extended to x = 80 by mechanical milling, while by melt-quench glass could only form for x ≤ 70. Ionic conductivity of the xLi2S-(100-x)P2S5 glass increased with lithium amount, and reached the maximum of 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for x = 75, larger than that of 70Li2S-30P2S5 prepared by melt-quench (1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C).

It was believed that glasses could have higher ionic conductivities than crystals because of larger free volume of glasses due to random and open structures [105]. However, Hayashi et al. [106] prepared glass-ceramic 80Li2S-20P2S5 by mechanical milling and heating, and the obtained glass-ceramic showed ionic conductivity of 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which was higher than 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 of the pristine glass. Li7PS6 crystal phase was identified in the glass-ceramic. However, the Li7PS6 crystal prepared by solid-state reaction showed ionic conductivity of 8 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature, which was about one magnitude lower than that of the glass-ceramic. It was presumed that the Li7PS6 crystallized from the glass was a high-temperature phase, which is different with thermodynamically stable Li7PS6 phase. This high temperature phase could have a similar structure with the glass solid electrolyte and exhibited high ionic conductivity. Another possible reason for the high ionic conductivity of the glass-ceramic was due to enhanced contact between glassy powders, which was caused by softening of the glassy powders during heating. Based on this finding, Tatsumisago et al. [93] have carried out intensive researches on Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic solid electrolytes. Further study of 80Li2S-20P2S5 glass-ceramic showed that Li3PS4 and unknown crystals also precipitated from the glass, together with Li7PS6 [107]. Because Li7PS6 and Li3PS4 crystals prepared by solid-state reaction exhibited low ionic conductivities at room temperature, the high ionic conductivity of 80Li2S-20P2S5 glass-ceramic should be due to the stabilized high-temperature phases of Li7PS6 and Li3PS4 [[106], [107], [108]]. It was reported that Li3PS4 and Li7PS6 had phase transformation at 150–200 °C, which was an evidence for the existence of the high-temperature phases [108]. Ionic conductivity of glass-ceramic was dependent on precipitated crystalline phases, which were affected by heating temperature, lithium content etc [109]. For mechanically milled 75Li2S-25P2S5 and 80Li2S-20P2S5 glasses, multi-crystallization was found during heating. For 80Li2S-20P2S5 glass, thio-LISICON Ⅱ, thio-LISICON Ⅲ, Li3PS4 and Li7PS6 crystallized successively with increase of heating temperature. For 75Li2S-25P2S5 glass, the crystallization sequence was thio-LISICON Ⅲ, Li3PS4 and Li4P2S6. The thio-LISICON Ⅱ and thio-LISICON Ⅲ phases should be metastable, and the former one should have higher ionic conductivity. Thus, after heating-cooling run during conductivity measurement, 80Li2S-20P2S5 glass-ceramic showed ionic conductivity of 7.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, while that of 75Li2S-25P2S5 glass-ceramic was only 2.8 × 10−4 S cm−1. Glass-ceramic 70Li2S-30P2S5 was obtained by mechanical milling and crystallization, and its ionic conductivity was 3.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature [102]. For 70Li2S-30P2S5 glass-ceramic, highly conductive phase was precipitated from glass, which was identified to contain P2S74-. Ionic conductivity of the glass-ceramic was even higher than those of highly conductive thio-LISICONs, which mainly contained PS43-. It was found that superionic metastable phases, including the thio-LISICON Ⅱ analogue in 80Li2S-20P2S5 and the new crystal phase in 70Li2S-30P2S5, were important to obtain Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramics with high ionic conductivities [110]. Pyro-thiophosphate P2S74- and ortho-thiophosphate PS43- were suitable structural units for fast Li-ion conduction in Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramics. The metastable phases could not be prepared by solid-state reaction, and could only be precipitated from the glasses. Temperature of the heat treatment of the glasses should be controlled to be just above first crystallization temperatures to obtain and maintain the metastable phases, because too high temperature would lead to thermodynamically stable phases (Li4P2S6 for 70Li2S-30P2S5, Li3.55P0.89S4 for 80Li2S-20P2S5) which are less conductive. The new high-conductive crystalline phase was determined to be Li7P3S11 by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, and this phase contained P2S74- and PS43- [111]. Li-ions are located around P2S7 ditetrahedrons and PS4 tetrahedrons, and the fast Li-ion diffusion should be related to interstitial sites and open space between P2S7 ditetrahedrons and PS4 tetrahedrons. Li7P3S11 glass-ceramic was also prepared by melt-quench and heating [112]. The glass melt-quenched at 750 °C showed existence of PS43- and P2S74- groups, which was similar with the glass prepared by mechanical milling. However, P2S64- was also found for the glasses melt-quenched at 820 °C and 900 °C, which could lead to Li4P2S6 with low ionic conductivity of 10−8 S cm−1 at room temperature. The 70Li2S-30P2S5 (Li7P3S11) glass and glass-ceramic melt-quenched at 750 °C showed ionic conductivities of 9.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 2.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively, which were similar with those prepared by mechanical milling. Seino et al. [113] optimized heat treatment condition to obtain Li2S-P2S5 glass-ceramic with Li7P3S11 metastable phase. Unified glass-ceramic showed almost no grain boundaries in microstructure, while cold-pressed glass-ceramic still showed obvious grain boundaries. Due to the improved contact between grains, the unified glass-ceramic showed extremely high ionic conductivity of 1.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is one magnitude higher than that of the cold-pressed glass-ceramic (1.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C). This high ionic conductivity is even higher than those of organic liquid electrolytes (∼10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature), considering that Li-ion transport number of the glass-ceramic was almost unity. It is also noted that the glass-ceramic still showed the high ionic conductivity of about 10−3 S cm−1 at − 35 °C, demonstrating potential to be applied in low temperature circumstances. Chu et al. [114] investigated Li7P3S11 glass-ceramic by computational and experimental methods. Li7P3S11 prepared by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) showed ionic conductivity of 1.16 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 27 °C, which is much higher than that of cold-pressed electrolyte (1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C). Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation revealed even higher bulk ionic conductivity of 5.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 27 °C. It was predicted that densification of the electrolyte could further increase the overall ionic conductivity.

Sulfide-type solid electrolytes showed high ionic conductivities comparable to organic liquid electrolytes. However, they were not stable in the ambient atmosphere because of reaction with moisture. Several Li2S-P2S5 electrolytes have been studied on structural changes and generation of H2S upon exposure to air [115]. 67Li2S-33P2S5 glass and Li2S generated large amounts of H2S, with large structural changes. For 67Li2S-33P2S5 glass, original P2S74- group decomposed to OH and SH groups, and SH further reacted to form OH group and H2S. For Li2S crystal, LiOH and H2S were formed. 75Li2S-25P2S5 glass and glass-ceramic showed almost no structural change and little H2S generation, which was because original PS43- group has good chemical stability against hydrolysis. Thus, in order to apply sulfide-type solid electrolytes in ASSBs, it is necessary to choose appropriate chemical composition and separate the batteries from the ambient atmosphere.

Argyrodite-type Li-ion solid electrolytes Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) were firstly synthesized by Deiseroth et al. [116], showing similar structures as Cu+ and Ag+ argyrodites. The six sulfur and halogen atoms form 136 tetrahedral holes. Four of these holes are formed by sulfur atoms (S1) only, and are occupied by P atoms. The rest 132 holes are formed by sulfur atoms (S2) and halogen atoms (X), and are partially occupied by Li atoms. For Li6PS5I, sulfur and iodide atoms at S2 and X sites are fully ordered, while it is fully disordered for Li6PS5Cl. Li6PS5Br is consisted of both ordered and disordered structures, with 84% S and 16% Br at S2 sites and 60% Br and 40% S at X sites. Li6PS5Br showed the highest Li-ion mobility amongst Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I), as indicated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Further experiments were conducted to measure ionic conductivities of these solid electrolytes [117,118]. Li6PS5I showed room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 [117], while that of Li6PS5Br was in range of 10−3-10−2 S cm−1 [118]. Boulineau et al. [119] used high energy ball-milling and post-annealing to prepare Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I). In the ball-milled samples, Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5I formed with crystallite size of ∼15 nm, and ionic conductivities were 4.6 × 10−4 S cm−1, 6.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. After annealing, the electrolytes were almost pure with the argyrodite phases as major phases, and crystallite size increased to ∼90 nm. The annealed Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br showed similar ionic conductivities as the ball-milled samples, while that of Li6PS5I decreased to ∼10−7 S cm−1 at 25 °C. With optimization of ball-milling time to 10 h, ionic conductivity of Li6PS5Cl could reach 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Furthermore, Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) had an electrochemical stability window of 0–7 V vs. Li/Li+. Adams et al. [[120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126]] carried out intensive research on argyrodite-type solid electrolytes. Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) were prepared by mechanical milling followed by annealing at 550 °C for 5 h [120]. After ball-milling, only Li2S, P2S5 and LiX (X = Cl, Br, I) were observed, and after annealing argyrodite phases finally formed. The three ball-milled samples showed ionic conductivities of 3.3 × 10−5 S cm−1, 3.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 and 2.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. Those of the annealed Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br increased to 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 6.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively, while that of Li6PS5I surprisingly decreased to 4.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 at room temperature. Bond valence analysis showed that Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br exhibited Li-ion diffusion pathways with low activation energies for long range transport, which was the reason for the high ionic conductivities. The lower activation energies found in NMR studies should be due to local Li-ion transport, rather than long range transport. It was found that disorder in S2-/Cl− or S2-/Br− could promote Li-ion mobility, while I− could not exchange with S2- due to larger size and Li6PS5I showed lower ionic conductivity than Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br [121]. Argyrodites Li6PO5X (X = Cl, Br) were also reported. However, O2- positions in Li6PO5X (X = Cl, Br) were different with S2- positions in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br), resulting in low ionic conductivities of ∼10−9 S cm−1 at room temperature. Evolution of S2-/Cl− disorder and ionic conductivity of Li6PS5Cl were investigated based on in-situ neutron diffraction [122]. During heating of ball-milled glass-ceramic Li6PS5Cl, argyrodite phase of Li7PS6 formed between 80 °C and 150 °C. Upon further heating to higher temperature, Cl was incorporated into Li7PS6, forming Li7-xPS6-xClx. Impedance measurements indicated that the argyrodite phase formed at 110–130 °C, and the Cl incorporation happened at 170–200 °C. Li6PS5Cl heat-treated at 150, 200 and 250 °C showed ionic conductivities of 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1, 3.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 measured at 40 °C, respectively, demonstrating that the crystalline phase and the Cl incorporation were important for Li-ion conduction in the glass-ceramic Li6PS5Cl. Yu et al. [127] investigated effect of mechanical milling time on structure and ionic conductivity of Li6PS5Cl. Li6PS5Cl argyrodite phase formed after milled at 550 rpm for 4 h, and the ones milled for 8–16 h showed the highest ionic conductivities of ∼1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Further annealing at 550 °C for 5 h could increase crystallinity and contact between grains, leading to higher ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Zhang et al. [128] demonstrated that solid-state sintering was superior to mechanical alloying to obtain high ionic conductivity for Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) argyrodites. Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br sintered with excess Li2S showed ionic conductivities of 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. Schneider et al. [129] synthesized halogen-free and Si-containing argyrodite electrolytes, which could avoid the issues caused by halogens in conventional argyrodites. Substitution of partial phosphorous by silicon could stabilize the cubic high-temperature (HT) phase, which is more conductive than the orthorhombic low-temperature (LT) phase. The electrolytes with compositions Li2xSiP2S7+x (10 < x < 12) showed high ionic conductivities of about 3 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is competitive with halogen-containing argyrodites.

Li6PS5Br solid electrolyte has been used to construct several ASSBs, including Cu-Li2S/Li6PS5Br/In, CuS/Li6PS5Br/In-Li, S/Li6PS5Br/In-Li and MoS2/Li6PS5Br/In-Li [[123], [124], [125], [126]]. The Cu-Li2S/Li6PS5Br/In battery showed high initial charge and discharge capacities of 500 mAh g−1 and 445 mAh g−1 (0.1C, theoretical capacity 490 mAh g−1), respectively [123]. However, its reversible capacity was limited by cathode volume change and dropped to ∼70 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles. During the initial discharging, two plateaus at 1.4 V and 0.9 V were observed, which were assigned to two-step reduction of CuS as indicated in Eqs. (3), (4):

The first step was an intercalation reaction with small volume change, and the second step was a conversion reaction accompanied with large volume change. During cycling, capacity in the conversion step decayed fast, while that of the intercalation step could maintain at a high level. The CuS/Li6PS5Br/In-Li battery showed an initial discharge capacity of 650 mAh g−1 (0.02C, theoretical capacity 560 mAh g−1), while its reversible capacity after 20 cycles was only 90 mAh g−1 [124]. During discharging, Li6PS5Br in the cathode mixture could accommodate reduced Cu+ to form CuyLi6-yPS5Br with low ionic conductivity, which could cause increase of internal resistance of the battery. Volume change of the cathode caused by conversion reaction detached active materials from ionic conductive Li6PS5Br and electronic conductive carbon black. These effects resulted in formation of cracks and fast capacity fading. The S/Li6PS5Br/In-Li battery showed an initial discharge capacity of 1355 mAh g−1 (0.1C, theoretical capacity 1672 mAh g−1) and a reversible capacity of 1080 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles [125]. By a two-step ball-milling, composite cathode consisted of amorphous sulfur, super P carbon and crystalline Li6PS5Br was obtained with particle size of 100 nm, which showed high homogeneity and intimate contact between the components. Li6PS5Br was stable during the cycling, leading to better cycling stability of S/Li6PS5Br/In-Li than Cu-Li2S/Li6PS5Br/In and CuS/Li6PS5Br/In-Li batteries. Furthermore, it was noted that sulfur content in cathode should be selected carefully, considering balance between capacity and volume change. The MoS2/Li6PS5Br/In-Li battery was transformed into a Li/S battery after fully discharging [126]. Mo particles with 3 nm in size were dispersed in the cathode, enhancing electronic conductivity. The battery showed an initial discharge capacity of 650 mAh g−1 (0.1C, theoretical capacity 670 mAh g−1) in 0.1–3 V, and a reversible capacity of 190 mAh g−1 in 1–3 V after 40 cycles with coulombic efficiency of close to 100%. At 70 °C, the battery showed a reversible capacity of 315 mAh g−1 (0.2C) between 0.6 and 3.1 V after 200 cycles, and capacity retention maintained at 85% after 700 cycles, which is even better than liquid electrolyte based MoS2 battery operated at room temperature for 100 cycles.

Argyrodite-type solid electrolytes are very promising for ASSBs. However, similar with sulfide-type solid electrolytes, argyrodite-type solid electrolytes could not be exposed to air, which restricts its application to a large extent. Effective and convenient battery construction technologies are required to conquer the stability problems.

Anti-perovskite-type solid electrolytes were designed and fabricated based on changing perovskite system from A+B2+X-3 to A−B2−X+3, where A site atom is halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) or a mixture of halogens, B site atom is oxygen and X site atom is lithium [11]. Li3OCl and Li3OBr showed typical perovskite structures, and Li3O(Cl1-zBrz) could be formed by solid solutions between the two end members. Li3OCl and Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 showed ionic conductivities of 8.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 1.94 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. The higher ionic conductivity was obtained for Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 because it could avoid small Li-ion hopping interstitial space in Li3OBr and structural distortion in Li3OCl. It was suggested that by adopting A-mixing, M-doping and LiA-depletion schemes, Li3-x-δMx/2O(A1-zA'z)1-δ could be prepared with even higher ionic conductivities. Beyond this, easy fabrication, low-cost and environmental friendly starting materials etc. made the anti-perovskites promising solid electrolytes.

First principles calculation of Li3OCl and Li3OBr solid electrolytes showed a low-barrier hop mechanism with an interstitial dumbbell for Li-ion diffusion [130]. Diffusion through vacancy mechanism had energy barriers of 340 meV and 375 meV for Li3OCl and Li3OBr, respectively, while those of the interstitial dumbbell hop mechanism were much smaller as 170 meV and 175 meV, respectively. Thus, formation of Li-ion interstitial dumbbells contributed to superionic conductivities of the anti-perovskites. Zhang et al. [131] suggested that perfect anti-perovskite structure could not exhibit superionic conduction because of lack of Li-ion diffusion pathway, and some structural defects should be induced during experimental preparation. One vacancy was introduced into anti-perovskite structures, and simulation results showed much improved diffusion mobility of Li-ions. Furthermore, introduction of one Cl-O exchange disorder in Li3OCl structure resulted in even higher Li-ion diffusion mobility. Ionic conductivities of Li3OCl and Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 with a Li-ion vacancy were extrapolated to be 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 27 °C, respectively, which were several times smaller than experimental values. Thus, more defects should be introduced in the structures to rationalize the diffusion mechanism. Deng et al. [132] studied Li3OCl1-xBrx by first principles calculation and percolation theory, and predicted that the electrolytes with 0.235 ≤ x ≤ 0.395 showed high ionic conductivities. Through ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, Li3OCl0.75Br0.25 was predicted to be more conductive than Li3OCl0.5Br0.5.

Braga et al. [133] prepared glass electrolytes Li3-2xMxHalO (M = Mg, Ca, Ba; Hal = Cl, or a mixture of halogens) from anti-perovskite crystals, and Li3-2xBaxClO (x = 0.005) showed ionic conductivity of 2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which was the highest among solid electrolytes at that time. Based on compositions Li3OA (A = halogen), Fang et al. [134] predicted new anti-perovskites Li3O(BH4) and Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 by replacing halogens by BH4 superhalogens. MD simulations estimated ionic conductivities of Li3O(BH4) and Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 to be 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 2.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. It was predicted that experimental ionic conductivity of Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 could be higher than 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, considering underestimation caused by calculation. Li3SBF4 and Li3S(BF4)0.5Cl0.5 were also predicted and estimated to have ionic conductivities of 10−2 S cm−1 and 10−1 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively [135]. Lü et al. [136] deposited a thin-film anti-perovskite Li3OCl solid electrolyte by pulse laser deposition (PLD) from a composite target consisted of Li2O and LiCl, achieving ionic conductivity of 2.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is higher than that of the Li3OCl film prepared from Li3OCl compound target (9 × 10−6 S cm−1). It was indicated that the Li3OCl film prepared from the composite target had larger grain size and higher crystallinity than the Li3OCl film prepared from the compound target. Based on this solid electrolyte, a thin-film ASSB LiCoO2/Li3OCl/graphite was constructed through layer-by-layer deposition, as shown in Fig. 7 [136]. The battery showed an initial discharge capacity of 120 mAh g−1 (10 mA g−1, theoretical capacity 274 mAh g−1) in 2.2–4.2 V. However, the capacity dropped to about 66 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles, probably due to irreversible side reactions and unsatisfactory battery sealing. Coulombic efficiency after the first cycle was relatively low at ∼95%, indicating ionic conductivity of the electrolyte was still not high enough for battery.

Anti-perovskite-type solid electrolytes had high ionic conductivities, and are promising for bulk and thin-film ASSBs. However, they are very hygroscopic and should be operated in an inert atmosphere, posing difficulties for application in ASSBs [11].

Several types of solid electrolytes are introduced, and each of them has respective advantages and drawbacks. Properties of these solid electrolytes are summarized in Table 1.

According to Table 1, advantages and drawbacks of these solid electrolytes are summarized as below:

a.NASICON-type of LAGP has high ionic conductivity and good chemical and electrochemical stability. However, one of the LAGP precursor, GeO2, is expensive and can significantly increase cost of LAGP based ASSBs. It is necessary to develop cost effective new NASICON.

b.Garnet-type of Al-stabilized LLZO has high ionic conductivity and is stable with lithium. However, it is not stable in contact with moisture or CO2 in the ambient atmosphere. It is important to improve LLZO stability through material modifications.

c.Perovskite-type of LSTZ/LSTH is promising for application in ASSBs. However, its preparation condition is very harsh and ionic conductivity is not high enough yet.

d.LISICON-type of solid electrolytes have good chemical and electrochemical stability, but low ionic conductivities compared with other oxide solid electrolytes.

e.LiPON-type of solid electrolytes have been applied and are suitable in thin-film ASSBs, but they are not proper for bulk ASSBs because of low ionic conductivities of 10−6-10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature.

f.Although Li3N-type of solid electrolytes have reasonable ionic conductivities, their decomposition voltages are too low for high energy density ASSBs.

g.Sulfide-type of solid electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivities in the magnitude of 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature. However, they are not stable in the ambient atmosphere because of reaction with moisture. Hence they have to be used in a controlled atmosphere for bulk batteries but not for thin-film ones because of immature deposition technologies for sulfide electrolytes.

h.Argyrodite-type of solid electrolytes possess high ionic conductivities. Similar to sulfide-type solid electrolytes, they are not stable in the ambient atmosphere. Suitable encapsulation of cells using argyrodite-type solid electrolytes is essential, otherwise it may also cause safety issues.

i.Anti-perovskite-type of solid electrolytes have high ionic conductivities and can be applied in bulk and thin-film ASSBs. However, they are very hygroscopic and operation in an inert atmosphere is required.

Generally speaking, NASICON-, garnet- and perovskite-type solid electrolytes are promising ones because of overall performance in ionic conductivity and chemical and electrochemical stability.

Applications of the three promising types of oxide solid electrolytes (NASICON, garnet, perovskite) in ASSBs are tabulated in Table 2.

For NASICON-type electrolytes, ASSBs have been constructed by different methods such as sol-gel [137,138], screen-printing [139], deposition of electrode film on electrolyte [140] et al. Rho et al. [137] constructed an ASSB in the structure of Li4Ti5O12/LiTi2(PO4)3-AlPO4/PMMA gel-polymer/Li. Li4Ti5O12 was coated on surface of the solid electrolyte by sol-gel, spin coating and heating. Through the sol-gel method, interfacial contact area between Li4Ti5O12 film and LiTi2(PO4)3-AlPO4 was increased, and the interfacial resistance was as low as ∼110 Ω cm−2. The ASSB could charge-discharge reversibly for 30 cycles, however, the initial discharge capacity was only 57% of the theoretical one, which was probably due to reaction between Li4Ti5O12 and LiTi2(PO4)3-AlPO4 during heating. Dokko et al. [138] fabricated a LiMn2O4/LATP/PMMA gel-polymer/Li ASSB. LiMn2O4 was coated onto LATP by sol-gel, spin-coating and heating. The LiMn2O4 film showed high porosity with submicron-sized pores. The initial discharge capacity was only 54% of the theoretical one, which could be caused by isolation of some active materials due to porous nature and impurities inside LiMn2O4 or at the interface. Kobayashi et al. [139] fabricated a symmetric ASSB Li3V2(PO4)3/Li1.5Al0.5Ge1,5(PO4)3/Li3V2(PO4)3. Li3V2(PO4)3 was coated onto both sides of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1,5(PO4)3 by screen-printing and hot-pressing. The initial discharge capacity was only 58% of the theoretical one, which was due to large internal resistance. However, the symmetric cell configuration with all NASICON-type phosphate electrodes and electrolyte could benefit fabrication process of ASSBs. Kim et al. [140] constructed a LiCoO2/LATP/LiPON/Li cell. LiCoO2 was deposited onto LATP by magnetron sputtering and heating. The Coulombic efficiency of the first cycle was only 68%, leading to a low initial discharge capacity (57% of theoretical capacity). The large capacity loss was probably caused by structural defects in LiCoO2 film. During cycling, there was continuous capacity fading, which could be caused by anode degradation. Anyway, the LiCoO2/LATP interface remained stable during cycling, which was superior to interfaces between LiCoO2 and sulfide electrolytes.

For garnet-type electrolytes, ASSBs were constructed by sol-gel [141], screen-printing [142], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [143] et al. The cell consisted of LiCoO2/Li7La3Zr2O12/Li stacking showed large capacity loss during charge-discharge with an initial discharge capacity of only 0.2% of the theoretical one, probably due to high interfacial resistance between LiCoO2 and Li7La3Zr2O12 [141]. The LiCoO2/Nb-doped Li7La3Zr2O12/Li cell was prepared from screen-printing LiCoO2 that was pre-mixed with Li3BO3 powder [142]. Since Li3BO3 has rather low melting temperature, LiCoO2 could be fused well with the electrolyte. The initial discharge capacity was 74% of the theoretical one, and the coulombic efficiency was almost 100% from 2nd to 5th cycles. The electrochemical performance could be comparable to ASSB prepared by physical vapor deposition, which revealed that incorporation of Li3BO3 into cathode was beneficial for ASSB construction. Han et al. [143] constructed a Li2FeMn3O8/Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12/ALD-Al2O3/Li ASSB. Al2O3 was deposited between Li and Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and some high-voltage liquid organic electrolyte was added between Li2FeMn3O8 and Li7La2.75Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 to reduce interfacial resistances between the electrodes and the solid electrolyte. The initial discharge capacity was 70% of the theoretical one, and the capacity maintained at 110 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles. The promising performance of the ASSB was mainly due to the interface improvement. Wu et al. [49] fabricated a LiFePO4/Li6.20Ga0.30La2.95Rb0.05Zr2O12/Li ASSB. Li(CF3SO2)2N electrolytic salt was added into cathode to reduce interfacial resistance. The initial discharge capacity at 60 °C was 88% of the theoretical one, and the capacity decreased to 110 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles, which was caused by unstable contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte. Luo et al. [144] constructed a LiFePO4/gel electrolyte/Li7La3Zr2O12/Ge/Li ASSB. A gel membrane was placed between LiFePO4 and Li7La3Zr2O12 to decrease interfacial resistance. A Ge layer was deposited between Li7La3Zr2O12 and Li by evaporation, which could alloy with Li and improve wetting at interface. The initial discharge capacity was 81% of the theoretical one, and the battery exhibited a high capacity of 140 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, which was comparable to battery with liquid electrolyte.

Kotobuki et al. [[145], [146], [147]] fabricated several ASSBs based on perovskite-type electrolytes, which were honeycomb or 3 dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structured. For an ASSB LiMn2O4/honeycomb Li0.55La0.35TiO3/Li4Mn5O12, electrodes were prepared by impregnation of active materials and respective precursor sol into the honeycomb holes and followed by calcination [145]. The initial discharge capacity was only 2% of the theoretical one. To enhance performance of the ASSB, it requires improvement of electrode preparation and 3D structure of the solid electrolyte. A Li0.35La0.55TiO3 electrolyte with a 3 dimensionally ordered microporous (3DOM) structured layer and a honeycomb layer was prepared by a colloidal crystal templating method and calcination, which was applied to an ASSB with LiMn2O4 and Li as cathode and anode [146]. The 3DOM structure could increase contact area between cathode and solid electrolyte. However, the ASSB only possessed an initial discharge capacity of 48% of the theoretical one, due mainly to low regularity of the porous structure and long Li-ion diffusion path in the honeycomb electrolyte. A 2-layered Li0.35La0.55TiO3 with a 3 dimensionally ordered microporous (3DOM) layer and a dense layer was also fabricated by suspension filtration method [147]. The electrolyte was assembled into an ASSB with LiMn2O4 and Li as electrodes, which showed an initial discharge capacity of 18% of the theoretical one and maintained capacity of ∼22 mAh g−1 after 5 cycles.

Summarized in Table 2, most of the ASSBs had lower capacities than their counterparts based on liquid electrolyte and short charge-discharge cycles of no more than 100. The ASSB LiFePO4/gel electrolyte/Li7La3Zr2O12/Ge/Li showed excellent retention for 100 cycles [144], however, capacity fading may appear for longer cycles as in practical application. Interfacial resistance is the main obstacle limiting performance of ASSB. Many effective methods have been adopted to reduce interfacial resistance, as mentioned above, and further interface improvement is necessary to promote application of ASSB.

LISICON- and LiPON-type of solid electrolytes had low ionic conductivities, Li3N-type of solid electrolytes had narrow electrochemical stability windows, sulfide-, argyrodite- and anti-perovskite-type solid electrolytes were not stable in the ambient atmosphere. NASICON-, garnet- and perovskite-type solid electrolytes are promising for applications in ASSBs. With careful selection of solid electrolytes, highly safe battery cells can be constructed. With improvement of interfaces, interfacial resistances can be reduced and ASSBs can show better performance. However, ASSBs still need to be encapsulated to avoid contamination from the ambient environment, which can result in decrease in ionic conductivity and change of structure. Further effort is needed to improve properties of solid electrolytes and compatibility between solid electrolytes and electrodes.
