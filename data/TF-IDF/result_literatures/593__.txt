Developing rechargeable sodium ion batteries (SIBs) with fast charge/discharge rate, high energy and power density, and long lifespan is still a significant challenge. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as one of the most potential SIBs cathodes due to its high theoretical capacity and stable sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) structure. However, the general NVP exhibits inferior electron conductivity due to the two separated [VO6] octahedral arrangement, which limits its widespread applications. Here, we present a design of hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes via a facile molten hydrocarbon-assisted, solid-state reaction strategy, in which span 80 acts as surfactant and carbon source. The formation mechanism of this hierarchical open structure constructed by uniform nanoflakes was investigated by a heating-rate controlled experiment, which indicated that heating rates play an important role in morphology and structure of the final products. When used as SIBs cathode, the hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes electrodes exhibited high reversible capacity of 114.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, high rate capacity of 87.7 mA h g−1 at 100 C and excellent cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles with only 0.0048% per cycling capacity fading, indicating the good sodium storage performances. This work demonstrates that the unique hierarchically porous flaky structure is favorable for improving the cyclability and rate capability in energy storage applications.

The rapid growth of renewable electricity production requires efficient ways for electric energy storage [1], [2], [3]. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been dominating the energy storage market due to high energy density, high energy conversion efficiency, and long cycling lifespan [4], [5], [6]. However, the limited reserve and rising price restrict their large-scale applications. As an alternative replacement for LIBs, SIBs have attracted increasing research attention because of the natural abundance and low cost of sodium resources [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. In addition, SIBs have the similar battery chemistry to LIBs. These advantages make SIBs hold high promise for application in large energy storage systems (ESSs) [2]. However, the larger ionic radius (0.98 Å) of Na+ makes more impeditive for Na+ intercalation into the electrode [10], thus requires the larger tunnel and space in electrode materials.

Recently, many materials such as NaXCoO2 [12], V2O5 [13], [14], Na0.44MnO2 [15], [16], [17], polyanionic compounds (Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) [18], [19], Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) [10], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], Na2FeP2O7 (NFP) [25], NaFePO4 [26]) and so on [27], [28], [29], [30] have been investigated as cathodes for SIBs. Due to their excellent thermal and structural stability, polyanionic compounds are favorable to realize better safety and longer cycle life [31]. Among these, NVP is one of the most promising cathode materials for SIBs due to its large ion channel and fast Na+ ion diffusion coefficient. Like LVP, NVP also possesses NASICON structure, namely Na+ ion superionic conductor, in which two isolated [VO6] octahedra and three [PO4] tetrahedra units are interlinked via corners to establish the framework anion [V2(PO4)3]3−. Two type of Na+ cations are located and occupied in the channel with six-fold coordination for the first and eightfold for the second Na+ cation, respectively [32]. This open 3D framework of NASICON structure results in fast and stable Na+ ion insertion and extraction [33], [34]. However, the poor electronic conductivity of NVP greatly impedes its practical applications [23], [34].

Many strategies have been developed to improve the conductivity of NVP. Constructing hierarchical nanostructured NVP can reduce the distance of Na+ ion diffusion and improve the diffusion kinetics [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. For example, nanostructured NVP 3D foams synthesized via a template-assisted approach exhibited no capacity losses over 1000 cycles at 100 C [41]. Combining NVP particles with carbonaceous materials is another effective way to improve the conductivity of NVP due to the excellent mechanical stability, chemical stability and high electrical conductivity of carbonaceous materials [10], [34], [42], [43], [44]. In particular, in situ generated conductive carbon-coated NVP have been widely applied to improve the electronic conductivity and electrochemical performances of NVP [20], [21], [22]. Very recently, we have reported a NVP nanoflakes coated by the in situ generated 3D graphene-like layers, which exhibited superior sodium storage performances including good rate capability (75.9 mA h g−1 at 200 C), and excellent cyclic stability (62.5% of capacity retention over 30,000 cycles at 50 C) [22]. The high electronic conductivity of coating carbon layer greatly contributes to the rate property of NVP. In addition, the coated carbon can keep the structural integrity of the electrode materials during the repeated Na+ deintercalation and intercalation process, which is greatly benefit for cyclic stability.

Targeting the afore mentioned issues, herein, we report a hierarchically porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes prepared by using span 80 as surfactant and carbon source. The heating-rate controlled experiments were conducted to reveal the formation mechanism of this hierarchical open structure with uniform nanoflakes array. The hierarchical nanoarray structure provide large surface area and enough space for electrode–electrolyte contact and sodium ion diffusion. The in situ generated conductive carbon-coated nanoflakes with high crystallinity guaranteed fast electron transport and enhanced the structural integrity of the electrode materials. As a cathode material for SIBs, the hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes electrodes manifest high reversible capacity, high rate capability and excellent cyclic stability.

All reagents used in this experiment were of analytically pure grade. The NVP nanoflakes was prepared by a one-pot, solid-state reaction in molten surfactant-paraffin media. Firstly, NH4H2PO4 was milled initially with Span 80 for 20 min using a QM-3B high-energy milling machine. Span 80 acts as surfactant and carbon source. Then, the paraffin was added and milled for another 30 min. Paraffin in the process acts as a nonpolar solvent, which can provide a stable environment for moisture-sensitive precursors. Subsequently, VOC2O4·1.4H2O was added, and the mixture was milled for 30 min. Finally, CH3COONa was added and further milled for 60 min. The overall molar ratio of Na: V: P: Span 80 in the milling mixture is 3: 2: 3: 3, in which the weight of paraffin doubles that of the Span 80. The viscous precursor mixture was dried in an oven at 105 °C for 0.5 h, and subjected to heat treatment in tubular furnace at 800 °C for 8 h under an ultra-high purity Ar-H2 (95:5) atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C/min to obtain the final NVP nanoflakes.

X-ray diffraction measurement (XRD, Rigaku D/Max-2500 with non-monochromated Cu-Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å) was conducted to determine the crystal structure and phase composition of the obtained samples. The morphologies and microstructure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Nova Nano SEM 230) and transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 F20). TG curve was recorded by a thermalgravimetric analyzer (Netzsch STA449 C), and Raman spectrum was analyzed by Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG Escalab-250xi) were used to collect XPS spectra. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area was analyzed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, which was obtained from a NOVA 2200e surface area and pore size analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments) at 77 K.

The electrochemical measurements were performed on CR2016 coin type cells. The working electrodes were prepared by dispersing active materials, Super P and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with a weight ratio of 7.5:1.5:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a slurry and then casted onto an aluminum foil, which served as current collector in the cathode. Sodium foil was used as reference electrode. The electrolyte was a solution of 1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). The glass fiber membrane was used as the separator. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were carried out on a multi-channel battery testing system (LAND CT2001A, China) at different current densities in a potential range of 2.5–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+). Before the charge/discharge measurements, the cells were activated for 2 turns. Both the charge and discharge current densities and specific capacity were calculated based on the mass of NVP material only. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, China) in the range of 2.5–4.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at various scan rates.

FESEM and TEM were conducted to investigate the morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared NVP nanoflakes. The FESEM images with low and high magnifications are showed in Fig. 1a–c. The NVP nanoflakes demonstrated a hierarchical nanoarray network with large open spaces, which would facilitate the electrolyte penetration and fast sodium ion diffusion. The surface of the NVP nanoflakes is smooth. Each nanoflake is uniform with several dozens of nanometers in thickness and several hundred nanometers in diameter of in-plane extension. These architectures are further confirmed by TEM images (Fig. 1d and e), which revealed that the hierarchical nanoarray architectures are composed of numerous ultrathin nanoflakes. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1f) demonstrates that a thin carbon layer with several nanometers in thickness coated on the surface of the NVP crystals. The coating carbon can effectively improve the electronic conductivity and lead to fast electron transfer, which would contribute to the rate property. A d-spacing of 3.5 Å of lattice fringes corresponds to the interplanar distance of the ( 2 2) planes of NVP crystal. In addition, a corresponding Fourier transform pattern (inset of Fig. 1f) further reveals the highly crystalline nature of the NVP nanoflakes.

The phase purity of NVP nanoflakes was detected by XRD measurement. The powder XRD pattern of the prepared NVP nanoflakes (Fig. 2a) shows that all the diffraction peaks can match well with the rhombohedral NASICON structure [Space group , ICSD#98-024-8140], indicating the high purity of the sample. The Rietveld refinement method (GSAS) was used to refine the X-ray diffraction patterns to analyze the crystal structure of the material. Table S1 in Electronic Supporting Information (ESI†) shows the refined cell parameters of the NVP in the prepared sample, which are very close to that reported in the other papers [23]. The observed and calculated patterns match well, and the reasonably small Rwp factor (7.43%) suggests that the refinement results are convincible. The atomic Raman spectrum (Fig. 2b) was conducted to confirm the existence of the coated carbon on surfaces of NVP nanoflakes. Two obvious peaks located at ∼1590 cm−1 and ∼1320 cm−1 are attributed to the graphitic carbon peak (G band) and the disordered carbon peak (D band), respectively [45], [46]. The value of the peak intensity ratio of the D to G band (ID/IG) is around 1.06, indicating the carbon in the NVP nanoflakes is partial graphitization, which is beneficial for improving the electronic conductivity of the sample [47]. The weight content of carbon was calculated to be 10.53 wt% as estimated from the TG data (Fig. 2c). XPS measurement was also conducted to probe the detailed surface chemical components and oxidation states of the as-prepared NVP nanoflakes (Fig. 2d). The five elemental signals (Na, O, V, C and P) are detected in the survey spectrum. The high-resolution V 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (Fig. 2e) shows that the binding energy at ∼516.3 eV is in good agreement with V3+ in NVP according to the previous report [48], [49], [50]. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area and porous structure of NVP nanoflakes were investigated by a nitrogen isothermal adsorption technique. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. 2f) can be described as type II with a H3 hysteresis loop, which can be linked to slit-shaped pores in the sample. The BET surface area of NVP nanoflakes is estimated to be 20.38 m2 g−1. The corresponding pore size distribution (inset in Fig. 2f) shows that the pore sizes in NVP nanoflakes are mainly below 10 nm.

The above discussion demonstrate that a hierarchical porous structure composed of uniform ultrathin NVP nanoflakes coated by partial graphitization carbon layer has been successfully prepared. In order to explore its formation mechanism, heating-rate controlled experiments were conducted. Fig. 3 shows SEM, TEM and HRTEM images of samples obtained at different heating rate. We can obviously see that if the heating rate is too fast (3 °C/min), the sample showed agglomeration morphology with dense tiny nanoflakes (Fig. 3a1–a3). The sample exhibited open hierarchical nanoflakes structure at 2 °C/min, as discussed earlier (Fig. 3b1–b3). However, when the heating rate was set at 1 °C/min, partial nanoflakes grew up to be bulk particles (Fig. 3c1–c3). All the NVP crystals are capped with an in situ generated coated carbon layer (Fig. 3a4, b4, and c4). Both agglomeration structure and bulk particles are not benefit for the electrolyte penetration and sodium ion diffusion. Fig. 4 shows the schematic illustration of the proposed formation mechanism of the NVP nanoflakes. Paraffin acts as a nonpolar solvent, which can provide a stable environment for moisture-sensitive precursors [6], [51]. The Span 80 acts as a surface-capping ligand of precursors with its hydroxy group and prevent agglomeration by steric hindrance during formation of the NVP nanoflakes. The presence of the long alkyl chain and unsaturated bond in Span 80 promotes the crystallization and preferential growth of the NVP nanocrystals [6], [52].

Electrochemical performance of NVP nanoflakes as cathode for SIBs was evaluated using a multichannel battery testing system. Fig. 5a shows the first and second charge–discharge profiles at a current rate of 1C (1C corresponds to 117.6 mA g−1) in the potential range of 2.5–4.0 V versus Na/Na+. One pair of well-defined charge/discharge plateaus are located at 3.41 and 3.34 V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively, corresponding to the V3+/V4+ redox couple with two Na+ ions extraction/insertion in the NVP host with a theoretical capacity of 117.6 mA h g−1 [32]. The initial charge capacity of NVP nanoflakes is 115.3 mA h g−1, which is close to its theoretical capacity. The initial discharge capacity is 112.2 mA h g−1 with a high initial coulombic efficiency of 97.3%. The initial irreversible capacity is mainly attributed to the electrolyte decomposition and other undesirable side reactions [53], [54]. The second charge and discharge curves are almost overlapped with first cycle, indicating excellent reversibility of the NVP nanoflakes. Cycling performance at 1C is shown in Fig. 5b and exhibits a high capacity retention of 87.3% after 1000 cycles, demonstrating good cyclic stability. The coulombic efficiencies are nearly 100%, further indicating the excellent reversibility of the NVP nanoflakes. However, the cycling performances of the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes obtained at heating rates of 3 °C/min and 1 °C/min are much inferior (Fig. S1 and Table S2 in ESI†).

Rate performance is a significant indicator for SIBs electrode materials, specially used in high-power ESSs. Therefore, the rate performance of NVP nanoflakes at various current rates from 1 C to 100 C has been investigated, as shown in Fig. 5c. The NVP nanoflakes exhibit a superior rate performance, which released the corresponding representative discharge capacities of 114.2, 112.3, 105.4, 103.3, 101, 98.1, and 95.3 mA h g−1 at various current densities of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 C, respectively. Even at an ultrahigh rate of 100 C, a reversible capacity of 87.7 mA h g−1 is available. The results demonstrate the NVP nanoflakes can bear high rate current density and are able to get rapidly charged and discharged within 1 min. When the current density was reset to 0.5C, it can deliver a high discharge capacity of 114.1 mA h g−1 with little capacity fading of initial discharge capacity. The corresponding charge–discharge profiles at various rates are shown in Fig. 5d, indicating that the discharge voltage plateaus are decreased and the polarization is increased with the increasing current density. However, the charge discharge plateaus are still clearly distinguishable even at the high current density (≧20 C). The Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes obtained at heating rates of 3 °C/min and 1 °C/min also show high specific capacity at low rates (Figs. S2 and S3 in ESI†). The Na3V2(PO4)3 obtained at heating rate of 3 °C/min delivers the specific discharge capacities of 111.9, 107.1, and 103.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C, respectively. And the Na3V2(PO4)3 obtained at heating rate of 1 °C/min delivers the capacities of 111.3, 103.5, and 100.8 mA h g−1 at the above mentioned rates, respectively. However, the discharge capacities of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathodes obtained at heating rates of 3 °C/min and 1 °C/min dropped sharply at high rates (Figs. S2 and S3 in ESI†). More specifically, the discharge capacities can only maintain 92.8, 87.2, 82.6, 71.5 mA h g−1 for the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode obtained at heating rate of 3 °C/min and 91.9, 85.1, 78.2, 68.8 mA h g−1 for the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode obtained at heating rate of 1 °C/min under 10 C, 20 C, 50 C and 100 C, respectively. Long cycle life also plays a significant role in SIBs applications. Unexpectedly, the as-prepared NVP nanoflakes cathode exhibited excellent cyclic stability at 20C, as shown in Fig. 5e. The initial specific discharge capacity is 100.3 mA h g−1 and the capacity maintains 52.5 mA h g−1 after 10,000 cycles, corresponding to the capacity retention of 52.3% and capacity fading of 0.0048% per cycle. This performance is superior to that of pure NVP so far [33], [34], and can also be comparable to that of other reported representative NVP works [39], [41], [47], indicating the remarkable high-rate capability and excellent cyclic stability of NVP nanoflakes electrode.

In order to reveal the reasons of the outstanding electrochemical performance for the hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes electrode, the Na+ ion diffusion coefficient was evaluated and the CV curves at various scan rates from 0.1 mVs−1 to 1.0 mVs−1 were measured (Fig. 6a). With the increase of the scan rates, the anodic peaks shift to higher potential and the corresponding cathodic peaks turn to lower values, which indicate larger polarization at higher scan rates. The intensities of anodic and cathodic peaks increase with the increase of the scan rates. The corresponding correlation between the peak current density () and the square roots of the scanning rate () is shown in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the  and fits a linear relationship well, indicating a typical diffusion controlling response. The apparent diffusion coefficients of sodium ions are calculated based on the Randles Sevcik equation [55]:

where  is the peak current (A), n is the number of electrons per species reaction (for Na+, n = 1), A is the active surface area of the electrode (1.131 cm2 is used for each electrode), is the is the concentration of sodium ions in the cathode (mol cm−3), D is the apparent Na+ ion diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), and v is the scanning rate (V s−1). Accordingly, the calculated Na+ ion diffusion coefficient of NVP nanoflakes is up to the order of magnitude of 10−10 cm2 s−1 during the Na+ ions extraction/insertion processes, implying improved the ionic transport kinetics and electronic conductivity for NVP nanoflakes [22], [47]. The Na+ ion diffusion coefficient values are at least 1 order of magnitude larger than that of pure NVP [56], and are comparable with that of optimized carbon coated NVP [22], [23], [47].

In order to further investigate the structural stability and charge transfer kinetics of the NVP nanoflakes electrode, EIS and ex situ XRD measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. S4a and Table S3 in ESI†, the charge transfer resistance () value is increased from 327.3 Ω before the first cycle to 438.9 Ω after 10 cycles, which consist well with the capacity decrease in the initial cycles. Even after 200 cycles, only a small amount of  increase is discovered, indicating the rapid electronic mobility of the NVP nanoflakes electrode. According to the linear relationship between versus  at low-frequency region (Fig. S4b in ESI†) and Note S1 in ESI†, we calculate the sodium ion diffusion coefficients of the NVP nanoflakes electrode after different cycles, and the results are listed in Table S3 in ESI†. The degradation of conductivity and/or diffusivity could potentially be the origin of the observed continuous loss of capacity upon extended cycling [43], [57]. The ex situ XRD pattern of the NVP nanoflakes electrode after 200 cycles at 1 C (Fig. S5 in ESI†) shows that, all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the rhombohedral NASICON phase, implying the excellent structural integrity. These patterns were refined by the Rietveld method to calculate cell parameters, atomic coordinates, and occupancies (Tables S1 and S4 in ESI†). The slight cell volume contraction involved a deviation of the stoichiometry in NVP crystal structure (Table S1 in ESI†). This trend was also reported for the Na3+3xV2−x(PO4)3 and Na3−3xV2+x(PO4)3 series [57], [58]. The structural degradation caused by the repeated cycles may be a factor of capacity loss upon cycling (Table S4 in ESI†) [57], [58].

On the basis of the above results, the hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes electrodes exhibited good sodium storage performances including high reversible capacity of 114.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, high rate capacity of 87.7 mA h g−1 at 100 C and excellent cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles with only 0.0048% per cycling capacity fading, which would be due to the following reasons: First, the hierarchical nanoarray structure provide large surface area and enough space for electrode–electrolyte contact and sodium ion diffusion. This structure could not only offer more electrochemically active sites for Na+ ions to insert, obtaining a high capacity, but also relieve the stress during fast Na+ ion extraction/insertion, which is beneficial for cycling stability. Second, the ultrathin NVP nanoflakes shorten the diffusion path of Na+ ions and their high crystallinity guaranteed fast electron transport, which contributes to the rate capability. Third, the in situ generated partial graphitization carbon layer can effectively enhanced the structural integrity and specially, greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of the sample, thus leads to good rate capability and long-term cyclic stability.

In summary, we have successfully synthesized novel hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes via a facile molten hydrocarbon-assisted, solid-state reaction strategy. The formation mechanism of this hierarchical open structure with uniform nanoflakes array was investigated by a heating-rate controlled experiments. The thickness of the thin carbon layer coated on the surface of the NVP crystals is several nanometers and its weight content is about 10.53% according to TG data. When used as SIBs cathode, the hierarchical porous carbon-coated NVP nanoflakes electrodes exhibited good sodium storage performances including high reversible capacity of 114.2 mA h g−1 at 0.5 C, high rate capacity of 87.7 mA h g−1 at 100 C and excellent cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles with only 0.0048% per cycling capacity fading, demonstrating NVP nanoflakes is a promising SIBs cathode.
