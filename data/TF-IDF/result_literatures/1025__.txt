Research activities related to the development of negative electrodes for  construction of high-performance Li-ion batteries (LIBs) with conventional  cathodes such as LiCoO 2 , LiFePO 4 , and LiMn 2 O 4  are described. The anode  materials are classiﬁ ed in to three main categories, insertion, conversion, and  alloying type, based on their reactivity with Li. Although numerous materials  have been proposed (i.e., for half-cell assembly), few of them have reached  commercial applications, apart from graphite, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , Si, and Sn-Co-C.  This clearly demonstrates that full-cell studies are desperately needed rather  than just characterizing materials in half-cell assemblies. Additionally, the  performance of such anodes in practical Li-ion conﬁ gurations (full-cell) is  much more important than merely proposing materials for LIBs. Irreversible  capacity loss, huge volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interface layer  formation, and poor cycleability are the main issues for conversion and alloy  type anodes. This review addresses how best to circumvent the mentioned  issues during the construction of Li-ion cells and the future prospects of such  anodes are described in detail. 

Clean  energy  is  one  of  the  prime  areas  of  research  today  because  the  unavoidable  environmental  pollutions,  especially  from  the  motor  vehicles,  and  its  associated  health  hazards  are  the  main  concern  for  the  society,.  Therefore,  the  need  for  research  and  development  (R&D)  in  the  implementation  of  electric  vehicles  (EVs)  and  hybrid  electric  vehicles  (HEVs)  is strongly encouraged. Lithium ion batteries  (LIBs)  are  considered  as  most  promising  electrochemical  energy  storage  system  in  this  era  and  are  anticipated  to  power  the  mentioned  applications.  LIBs  in  the  “rocking-chair”  conﬁ guration  were  introduced  for  consumer  applications  by  Sony  in  1990  and  have  dominated  the  entire  electronic  appliance  market  for  over  two  decades,  remaining  popular  at  present. [ 1 ]   This  fascinating  feature  of  Li-ion  chemistry  is  bound  with  several  beneﬁ cial  and  favorable  factors;  for  instance  Li  is  the  most  electropositive  element  (–3.04  V  vs.  standard hydrogen electrode) with lightest  metal (equivalent weight  M  = 6.94 g mol −1   and  speciﬁ c  gravity  of  0.534  g  cm −3 ),  it  is  the  25 th   most  abundant  element  on  the  earth  crust,  has  high  theoretical  capacity  (≈3862 mAh g −1 ), has high energy density  in  both  gravimetric  and  volumetric  point  of view, has a high working potential, has  less  self-discharge  compared  to  other  secondary  batteries,  and  no  memory  effect. [ 2–7 ]   (LiFePO 4   based  cells  are  experiencing  memory  effect  issues. [ 8 ] ).  Unfortunately,  the  dendrite  growth  upon  cycling  in  the  presence  of  conventional  aprotic  solvents  hampers the possibility of using metallic Li in practical cells. [ 9–11 ]   Therefore,  alternate  anodes  with  lower  working  potential  is  desperately needed. The discovery of reversible Li-intercalation  into graphite with lower working potential (<0.1 V vs. Li) via the  “host-guest” concept makes the materials become most promising  for  LIB  applications. [ 12,13 ]   The  same  concept  has  been  successfully  translated  into  commercial  cells  along  with  conventional cathodes such as LiCoO 2  and LiFePO 4 . [ 14,15 ]  Although  graphitic anodes (LiC 6 ) have 10 times lower theoretical capacity  (≈372  mAh  g −1 ),  requires  smooth  solid  electrolyte  interface  (SEI)  layer  for  the  safe  operation  of  the  cell,  and  suffers  high  current operation compared to metallic Li, they remain attractive  for  small  and  medium  scale  applications.  As  a  result,  achieving high power capability for graphitic anode based systems is difﬁ cult. High power capability is one of the prerequisites  for  the  power  packs  to  be  employed  in  EV  and  HEV. [ 16 ]   On the other hand, electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and  lithium-ion  hybrid  electrochemical  capacitors  (Li-HECs)  are  capable of delivering the high power density, but energy density  remains  an  issue. [ 17,18 ]   This  clearly  suggests  that  the  development of high performance anodes is required to construct high  energy and high power capability Li-ion power packs. 

Generally, anodes used in LIB are broadly classiﬁ ed in to three  main  categories:  intercalation,  conversion  (displacement),  and alloy types based on the reaction mechanism with Li ( Figure    1  ).  A detailed analysis of the mentioned classiﬁ cation is described  in  the  next  sections.  Insertion  type  materials  exhibit  lower  reversible capacity and higher working potential than graphitic  anodes (over 1.5 V vs. Li). As a result, a loss in energy density  is observed, but improvement in the power density is realized  within the thermodynamic stability window of the conventional  carbonate  based  electrolytes. [ 19 ]   In  line  with  this,  Toshiba  Inc.,  recently introduced the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode based LIB for consumer  applications, preferably for the EV market. [ 5 ]  However, the conversion type anodes show higher reversible capacity and power  capability than insertion type anodes, which includes graphite,  but  higher  working  potential,  unstable  SEI  formation,  volume  variation,  and  large  polarization  prohibit  the  potential  usage  in  practical  Li-ion  cells. [ 20 ]   Alloy  based  anodes  are  much  more  promising than the other two types because of their high power  capability, high reversible capacity, and lower working potential  and  reached  the  commercial  market;  example  Sn-based  composites (Sn-Co-Ti-C) were introduced by Sony in Nexelion conﬁ guration  and  the  commercialization  of  Si  based  anodes  has  been announced by Panasonic, although this has certain drawbacks such as unstable SEI formation, huge volume variation,  and poor cycleability issues. [ 21 ]  It is unfortunate that, although  numerous  materials  with  various  morphological  features  and  surface  modiﬁ cations  are  proposed  for  the  three  categories  of  LIB applications, limited reports are available only in the practical  conﬁ guration.  To  study  the  performance  with  cathodes  is  more  important  than  proposing  the  materials  from  anode  point  of  view.  Furthermroe,  several  notable  reviews  have  been  published  covering  the  materials  aspect  (half-cell  assembly)  but  none  of  them  exclusively  report  the  practical  conﬁ guration. [ 2,22–25 ]   In  the  half-cell  conﬁ guration,  metallic  Li  acts  as  a  reservoir for the source of Li-ions, which can uphold the huge  irreversible capacity loss (ICL) issue observed in the mentioned  anodes by supplying more Li. On the other hand, in a practical  cell assembly the cathode is the only source for the Li-ions and  it cannot to sustain such a huge Li loss during conversion and  alloying reaction (this includes the amorphous matrix element,  i.e.,  Li 2 S,  Li 2 O  etc.,  formation).  Excess  loading  of  the  cathode  is one of the efﬁ cient ways to overcome the ICL, but too much  cathode loading and the presence of partially de-lithiated material  affects  the  energy  density  and  stability  of  the  cell,  respectively.This  article  focuses  entirely  on  the  performance  of  such  anodes  in  practical  cells  such  as  solid-state,  ﬂ exible,  and  conventional  conﬁ gurations  based  on  the  anodes  classiﬁ ed  above.  Furthermore,  discussion  of  the  pre-lithiation  process  and  how  best to overcome the ICL issues observed in conversion as well  as alloy type anodes are summarized in detail. It is noteworthy  that graphitic anodes have been extensively investigated for over  four decades and were commercialized 25 years ago. Therefore,  discussion  and  study  of  the  carbonaceous  materials  anodes  in  full-cell conﬁ gurations are not included in this review.   

Intercalation  is  the  reversible  inclusion  or  insertion  of  guest  ions or molecules into the host matrix. Upon such an intercalation  process,  a  small  deviation  in  the  structural  properties  of host  matrix  is  observed  and  this  process  is  called  “topotactic  reaction”,  which  is  either  chemically  or  thermally  reversible;  a  perfect example is Li-intercalation into a graphite matrix. Such  intercalation chemistry has been successfully used in Li-ion batteries for both anode and cathode materials and has also been  commercialized (i.e., LiCoO 2 /Li  x  C 6  and LiFePO 4 /Li  x  C 6 ). [ 4,5 ]  The  insertion  type  materials,  i.e.,  metal  oxides  have  several  advantages over graphitic anodes when used in practical cells; these  include  a  negligible  amount  of  ICL,  no  Li-platting  issues,  no  solvent  co-intercalation,  no  electrolyte  decomposition,  no  SEI  required for the safe operation of the cell, it is capable of delivering  high  power  density,  and  has  an  easy  synthesis  protocol.  On the other hand, less reversible capacity and higher intercalation potential are the notable setbacks compared to graphite.  Although numerous Li-intercalating materials are proposed as  possible  anodes  for  LIB  applications,  few  of  them  have  only  been  tested  or  commercialized  in  the  “rocking-chair”  conﬁ guration, for instance Li 4 Ti 5 O 5  anode. Apart from the mentioned  anode, few other insertion type materials have been also evaluated  in  the  rocking-chair  conﬁ guration  for  LIBs.  Accordingly,  the  next  section  describes  the  structural  and  electrochemical  performance  of  various  intercalation  anodes  evaluated  in  the  rocking-chair conﬁ guration. 

 The existence of several polymorphs is reported for the case of  TiO 2 , but anatase, rutile, brookite, and bronze phases have only  been reported for Li-storage. [ 26 ]  Reversible insertion of one mole  of  Li  is  theoretically  possible,  independent  of  the  polymorph,  with a capacity of ≈335 mAh g −1 . However, variation in the Liinsertion potential and reaction mechanism has been observed  for such polymorphs. Easy synthesis protocols, scalability, inexpensiveness,  ease  of  tailoring  the  desired  morphology,  and eco-friendliness  are  other  key  features  for  utilizing  TiO 2   polymorphs for the construction of Li-ion power packs. [ 27–29 ]  

The anatase phase is one of the widely investigated polymorphs  of  TiO 2   for  Li-storage. [ 27 ]   Theoretically,  one  mole  of  Li  is  possible, but practically only ≈0.5 mole Li is reversible upon cycling.  Several research attempts have been carried out to improve the  reversible capacity, including utilizing high energy (0 0 1) facets  because  of  their  dominant  higher  surface  energy  (0.90  J  m −2 )  compared  to  (1  0  0)  facets  (0.44  J  m −2 )  and  using  thermodynamically more stable (1 0 1) facets (0.53 J m −2 ). [ 30,31 ]  Although  high  Li-reversibility  could  be  achieved  for  such  (0  0  1)  facets,  capacity  fading  remains  an  issue  upon  cycling. [ 32 ]   Li-diffusion  co-efﬁ cient  ( D  Li )  values  for  anatase  phase  are  in  the  range  of  1 × 10 −17  to 4 × 10 −17  cm 2  s −1  for Li-insertion and extraction processes,  respectively. [ 27 ]   In  the  crystal  chemistry  of  the  anatase  phase, TiO 6  octahedra sharetwo adjacent edges with two other  octahedral so that planar double chains are formed with tetragonal  body-centered  space  groups  ( I 4 1 / amd) . [ 27 ]   Li-migration  occurs  along  a  reaction  path  connecting  the  octahedral  interstitial  sites. [ 33 ]   Additionally,  Li-intercalation  into  the  anatase  phase  induces  the  phase  transformation  from  the  tetragonal  ( I 4 1 / amd )  to  the  orthorhombic  (Li 0.5 TiO 2 ,  space  group   Pnm2  1 )  phase  because  of  the  loss  of  symmetry  in  the   y   direction. [ 34,35 ]   As  a  result,  unit  cell  volume  variation  (+3.7%,  136  to  141  Å 3 )  is  noted;  for  example,  a  decrease  in  the  unit  cell  along  the   c axis  and  an  increase  along  the   b -axis. [ 36 ]   However,  high  insertion potential (≈1.75 V vs. Li) is another important issue for the  commercialization of anatase-based Li-ion cells.The Li-insertion  mechanism  in  anatase  phase  is  found  to  be  complicated  and  it occurs at higher potential via a multi-step process, i.e., ﬁ rst,  Li-insertion  results  in  the  formation  of  a  solid-solution  (open 

circuit potential of ≈1.75 V vs. Li) followed by a two-phase reaction  (ﬂ at  potential  at  ≈1.75  V  vs.  Li),  and  subsequent  interfacial  storage  (monotonous  curves  <1.75  V  vs.  Li). [ 37–39 ]   Gratzel  and co-workers [ 40,41 ]  ﬁ rst demonstrated the fabrication of ≈2 V  class  Li-ion  cells  using  layered  type  LiCoO 2   and  its  derivatives  (LiNi 0.5 Co 0.5 O 2 ). Substantial improvement in the same LiCoO 2 / TiO 2  conﬁ guration was realized by Subramaniam et al.  [ 42 ]  utilizing  nanocrystalline  TiO 2 .  However,  capacity  fading  remains  an  issue  when  paired  with  layered  structured  cathodes,  and  even  LiMn 1/3 Ni 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2   is  not  an  exception. [ 43 ]   In  order  to  overcome such capacity fading in 2 V class Li-ion cells, spinel  LiMn 2 O 4   is  used  as  the  cathode  instead  of  layered  type  cathodes.  The  LiMn 2 O 4 /electrospun  TiO 2   displayed  much  better  cycleability  and  capacity  retention  characteristics  than  layered  type cathodes. [ 34 ]  Recently, Aravindan et al. [ 44 ]  reported the fabrication of Li-ion cells composed of all 1D electro-active materials  such as LiMn 2 O 4  nanoﬁ bers, anatase nanoﬁ bers, and polyvinilydene  ﬂ uorideco -hexaﬂ uoropropylene  (PVdF-HFP)  nanoﬁ ber  membranes  by  electrospinning.  The  cell  delivered  exceptional  performance  and  retained  ≈90%  of  its  initial  capacity  after  700 cycles, which is the best result reported for the ≈2 V class  Li-ion  cell  fabricated  with  an  anatase  anode  ( Figure     2  ).  Xin  et al. [ 45 ]  demonstrated the performance of TiO 2 /graphene composites  in  18  650  conﬁ guration  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  that  retained ≈90% (after 200 cycles) and ≈80% (after 300 cycles) of  initial  capacities  at  1  C  and  5  C  rates,  respectively.  The  same all 1D concept has also been extended for the case of the high  voltage  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   conﬁ guration  by  Arun  et  al. [ 46 ]   As  a  result,  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /TiO 2   assembly  delivered  outstanding  performance (retained ≈86% of initial capacity after 400 cycles),  which  is  unrivaled  by  the  previous  reports  by  Brutti  et  al. [ 47 ]   and  Plylahan  et  al. [ 48 ]   Similar  to  the  2  and  3  V  class  rockingchair  Li-ion  cells,  attempts  have  also  been  made  to  fabricate  ≈1.4  V  class  Li-ion  cells  using  olivine-type  LiFePO 4   cathodes  with  long–term  cycleability  for  small  scale  applications. [ 49–52 ]   However,  anatase  nanotubes  prepared  by  anodization  of  Ti  sheets  delivered  inferior  electrochemical  proﬁ les  when  coupled with LiFePO 4.  53  Among the LiFePO 4 /TiO 2  conﬁ gurations,  composite with graphene nanosheets and core-shell nanoﬁ bers  are found to be appealing in terms of high rate capability and  long cycle life. [ 49,50 ]  Recently, Ming et al. [ 54 ]  attempted to maximize the capacity by cycling the anatase anodes prepared using  a  large  amount  of  porous  carbon  for  deep  cycling  between  0.01  and  3  V   vs .  Li.  As  a  result,  the  composite  composed  of  70  wt%  porous  carbon  showed  a  stable  reversible  capacity  of  ≈546 mAh g −1  in the half-cell assembly, which is much higher  than  the  theoretical  limitation  of  one  mole  of  Li.  The  cell  displayed a reversible capacity of ≈413 mAh g −1  without any characteristic  charge-discharge  proﬁ le  at  1.75  V  vs.  Li,  i.e.,  they  showed only monotonous curves. On the other hand, the fullcell fabricated with a small amount of carbon loading (≈7 wt%)  showed  a  characteristic  plateau  at  ≈2.8  V  with  a  reversible capacity of ≈240 mAh g −1 . In both cases the stable cycleability  was noted for the reported 100 cycles with retention of ≈95 and  79% for large and small amounts of porous carbon composite,  respectively.   

Rutile  phase  is  one  of  the  very  stable  polymorphs  and  not  been  explored  much  compared  to  its  counterparts,  includinganatase  and  bronze  phases,  because  of  its  inferior  electrochemical  activity  towards  Li.  In  the  bulk  crystalline  form,  it  is  able  to  accommodate  up  to  0.1  mole  Li,  whereas  at  elevated  conditions (120 °C) the intake level has been improved to 0.5 mole.  It  is  well  known  that  Li-diffusion  in  the  rutile  phase  is  highly  anisotropic  and  proceeds  through  rapid  diffusion  along   c -axis  channels. The Li +  diffusion coefﬁ cient along the  c -axis is found  to  be  ≈10 −6   cm 2   s −1   whereas  in  the   ab -plane  it  is  only  about  10 −15  cm 2  s −1 . As a result, Li-migration and favorable ﬁ lling in  the octahedral sites are severely limited by the  c -channels. Additionally, the strong repulsive Li-Li interactions in the  c -channels,  together  with  trapped  Li-ion  pairs  in  the   ab -planes,  block  the   c -channels  and  restrict  insertion  to  well  below  its  theoretical  limit. [ 33 ]  Particulate size is reduced to below 10 nm and results in  the accommodation of ≈0.85 mole of Li. The Liinsertion reaction  progresses  through  two  solid-solution  domains  and  then  via the irreversible phase transformation of electroactive LiTiO 2   (rock-salt type) because of the expansion of the  ab -plane. [ 55 ]  As a  consequence, 0.5 mole of Li is reversibly cycled with good stability, which is similar to the reversibility of bulk anatase phase.  On  the  other  hand,  Hu  et  al. [ 56 ]   suggested  that  the  surface  storage is more favorable for rutile phase compared to the bulk  intercalation.  However,  Hassoun  et  al. [ 57 ]   reported  the  fabrication of a full-cell assembly using nanostructured rutile phase as  the anode and olivine phase LiFePO 4  as the cathode. The full-cell  delivered a reversible capacity of ≈150 mAh g −1  with appreciable  cycleability  for  20  cycles  under  ambient  conditions  ( Figure     3  ).  In contrast, a reversible capacity of ≈75 mAh g −1  was obtained  after  40  cycles  under  high  temperature  conditions,  even  using  the solid polymer electrolyte (PEO 20 LiCF 3 SO 3 +10 wt% ZrO 2 ).   

Bronze  phase  is  one  of  the  important  polymorphs  reported  as  an  insertion  anode  for  the  construction  of  high  powered  LIBs  because  of  its  facile  Li-insertion/extraction  and  high  reversibility of both anatase and rutile phases, especially in the nanostructured form. [ 28,38,58–65 ]  Apart from the high reversibility, the  slightly  lower  insertion  potential  (≈1.55  V  vs.  Li)  compared  to  the  anatase  phase  (≈1.75  V  vs.  Li)  is  worth  noting;  this  simultaneously translates to a higher energy density of the LIB. Furthermore, the observed insertion potential is almost the same as  that  of  the  well-established  spinel  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode. [ 38,66 ]   Unlike  that  of  the  complicated  Li-insertion  mechanisms  noted  in  the  anatase phase, the bronze phase undergoes a simple two-phase  insertion mechanism during electrochemical cycling. [ 39,62 ]  However,  Kavan  and  co-workers [ 27,67 ]   proposed  pseudocapacitive  Listorage in such bronze phases. The crystal chemistry is believed to  be  the  main  reason  for  the  better  electrochemical  performance  of  the  bronze  phase.  Likewise,  the  monoclinic  bronze  phase  is  composed  of  corrugated  sheets  of  edge  and  corner  sharing  TiO 6   octahedral  units,  however  the  sheets  are  joined  together to form a 3D frame work parallel to the  b -axis that sits  between  axial  oxygens. [ 68,69 ]   Bruce  and  co-workers   [ 60,65 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  the  bronze  phase  with  LiFePO 4   and  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   cathodes  in  the  presence  of  polyvinilydene  ﬂ uoride  (PVdF)-based  gel  polymer  electrolyte.  Both  LiFePO 4   and LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cathodes with the TiO 2 -B anode delivered a  good  cycleability  (over  80%  after  100  cycles)  at  working  potentials of ≈1.9 and ≈3.1 V, respectively. Interestingly, the LiFePO 4 / TiO 2 -B  conﬁ guration  outperformed  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   system,  especially  at  high  current  rates,  which  conﬁ rms  the  high  power  capability  of  the  bronze  phase.  Guo  et  al. [ 70 ]   also  reported a similar LiFePO 4 /TiO 2 -B system with superior performance  compared  to  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   assembly.  Recently,  Aravindan  et  al. [ 38 ]   reported  the  long-term  cycleability  of  such  a  bronze  phase  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  in  the  presence  of  an  electrospun PVdF-HFP membrane ( Figure    4  ). However, slightly  inferior  performance  is  noted  for  such  an  electrospun  membrane (≈67% retention), compared to the commercial Whatman  separator (≈74% retention) after 1000 cycles at a working potential of ≈2.5 V. Similarly, the long-term cycleability with a Ni-rich  layered  cathode  (LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 )  has  also  been  investigated  with  spherical-shaped  micrometer-sized  particles. [ 71 ]   The  LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 /TiO 2 -B  cell  retained  a  ≈80%  capacity  after  3000 cycles at a 1 C rate (1 C = 2.8 A) and at 25 °C.    

Vanadium  oxides  (V 2 O 5 ,  VO 2 -B,  V 6 O 13   and  LiV 3 O 8 )  have  been  widely  investigated  as  potential  electrode  materials  for  energy  storage applications. [ 72–83 ]  This is mainly because of their wide  range of oxidation states and they can be tuned according to the conﬁgurations,  for  example  LiFePO 4 /VO(F),  LiCoO 2 /VO(F)  and  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /VO(F)  assemblies  exhibit  net  operating  potentials  of  ≈0.7,  ≈1.2  and  ≈2  V,  respectively.  Notable  cycleability  is  observed  for  all  of  the  mentioned  conﬁ gurations  with  good  capacity  retention  characteristics  at  various  current  rates  ( Figure    5  ).   

A  spinel  framework  composed  of  the  general  formula  AB 2 O 4   (Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  can be written as Li(Li 1/3 Ti 2/3 )O 4 ) has been extensively  investigated  as  a  promising  insertion  anode  for  Li-ion  power  packs and was recently commercialized by Toshiba Inc. The success  story  of  the  spinel  phase  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   as  an  anode  in  Li-ion  power  packs  lies  on  its  manifold  advantages,  which  includes  a  maximum of three Li could be reversibly inserted in to the spinel  lattice  (Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 )  with  a  corresponding  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈175 mAh g −1 ; [ 90,91 ]  ii) no SEI formation is evident; iii) a ﬂ at operating potential at ≈1.55 V vs. Li is associated with the two-phase  insertion mechanism (in space notations Li (8a) [Li 1/3 Ti 5/3 ] (16d) O 4(32e)   + 3Li +  + 3e −  ↔ Li 2(16e) [Li 1/3 Ti 5/3 ] (16d) O 4(32e) ); [ 33,92,93 ]  iv) no volume  variation is noted during Li-insertion/extraction (so called “zerostrain”  insertion  host); [ 36,93,94 ]   v)  very  high  reversibility,  i.e . ,  the  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  is  >95%  even  at  high  current  rates; [ 95 ]   vi) easy synthesis procedures with tailored morphology; and vii)  inexpensiveness and eco-friendliness. One of the primary issues  for  this  material  is  its  inherent  electrical  conductivity  (<10 −13   S  cm −1 ), [ 96 ]  which limits the Li-diffusion (<10 −6  cm 2  s −1 ) [ 97 ]  particularly  at  high  current  operation.  In  order  to  overcome  the  mentioned issue, composites with carbonaceous materials have been  proposed and such composites are capable of delivering appreciable  capacity  (≈80  mAh  g −1 )  even  at  a  1200  C  rate  (3  s  charging). [ 95,96,98–100 ]   The  compatibility  of  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anodes  with  various  including  LiCoO 2 ,  Li 1.03 Mn 1.97 O 4 ,  and  Li 1.025 Mn 1.95 O 4  have been studied to ensure the reversibility with  a working potential of ≈2.5 V under ambient temperature conditions. [ 101 ]  Short circuit reactions on the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode are  three  orders  of  magnitude  lower  compared  to  conventional  carbonaceous  anodes,  which  is  evident  from  the  internal  shortcircuit abuse tests. Furthermore, the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode paired with  a layered type LiCoO 2  cathode in a prototype cell exhibits higher  energy  density  than  LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2   (64  Wh  kg −1 )  and  LiMn 2 O 4   (61  Wh  kg −1 )  cathodes. [ 102 ]   Wang  et al. [ 103 ]  conﬁ rmed the better compatibility of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode  with  LiCoO 2   than  with  LiMn 2 O 4 .  Jansen  et  al. [ 104 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  ultralong  cycleability  of  the  LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ guration  for  117  000  cycles.  Similarly,  Majima  et  al. [ 105 ]   revealed  the  extended cycleability of over 4000 cycles with good capacity retention  characteristics  of  the  LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cell,  whereas  poor  cycleability  resulted  for  a  LiCr 0.1 Mn 1.9 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   assembly.  A  dramatic  improvement  in  the  high  power  capability  of  the  LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  cell was noted when layered type Li 2 RuO 3  was  incorporated as the additive on the positive side (LiCoO 2 +Li 2 RuO 3 ,  60%+40%). [ 106 ]   Improvement  in  the  electrochemical  proﬁ les  of  LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  systems in the presence of the ionic liquid, 1.0  M LiTFSI with SEI forming additives such as vinylene carbonate  (VC) and 1,3-propane sultone, was reported by Kim et al. [ 107 ]  and  VC,  lithium requirements, i.e., working potential. [ 75 ]  Although, vanadium is  hazardous and a P-listed toxic material, several research works  have  been  reported  for  energy  storage  applications,  including  supercapacitors,  Li-ion  capacitors,  Li-ion  batteries,  and  vanadium redox ﬂ ow systems. [ 74–81,84–86 ]  The structure of VO  x   (2 ≤ x   ≤ 2.5) is composed of both VO 5  square pyramidal and VO 4  tetrahedral units. VO 5  pyramidal units are hare edges to form the  zig-zag  chain  along  the  (0  1  0)  direction,  which  are  connected  by  corner-shared  square  pyramidal  and  tetrahedral  units. [ 82,87 ]   Ding  et  al. [ 88 ]   successfully  used  the  hydrothermal  route  for  preparation of the monoclinic VO  x  . n H 2 O phase and 0.43 mole  of water molecules is present in the mentioned phase. Li-insertion  in  to  VO 2 .  0.43H 2 O  (VO  (F))  takes  place  at  ≈2.6  V  vs.  Li  and  involves  the  formation  of  solid  solution  (Li 0.2 VO  (F)),  followed by a two-phase reaction (Li 0.5 VO(F)). With the exception  of the ﬁ rst cycle, the VO(F) delivered exceptional cycleability in  the  half-cell  assembly,  irrespective  of  the  applied  current  rate.  The  same  thermal  stability  of  VO 2   (B)  is  anticipated  for  the  present  VO(F)  phasebecause  VO 2 (B)  exhibits  better  thermal  stability  than  both  mesoporous  carbon  microbeads  (MCMBs)  and  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   phase  in  the  de-lithiated  phase. [ 89 ]   An  attempt  has been made to fabricate rocking-chair type Li-ion cells with  LiFePO 4 , LiCoO 2 , and LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cells with VO(F) anodes.  As  expected,  the  higher  redox  potential  of  the  VO(F)  anode  results  in  the  lower  working  potential  for  the  rocking  chair bis(triﬂ uoromethanesulfonyl)  imide  (LiTFSI)  additives  were  reported by Dahn et al. [ 108 ]  All-solid-state LiCoO 2 /Li 0.33 La 0.56 TiO 3 / Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  microbatteries were also reported to have good cycleability. [ 109 ]  The inﬂ uence of the synthesis technique (sol-gel, solidstate and combustion) on the electrochemical proﬁ les of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   was  evaluated  with  layered  type,  Ni and  Mn-doped  LiCoO 2   (LiCo 2/3 Ni 1/6 Mn 1/6 O 2 )  cathodes  with  working  potentials  of  ≈2.3 V. [ 110 ]  Amongst the sol-gel and combustion-derived Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   was found to be superior in terms of cycleability (retained ≈90%  of  initial  capacity  after  50  cycles)  and  reversibility  compared  to  solid-state  prepared  material.  Accelerated  cycling  tests  (constant  voltage mode) were carried out for LiCo 0.5 Ni 0.5 O 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration for 50 000 cycles to ensure the long-term stability (by  testing them at 2.5 V for 25.6 s and 1.7 V for 25.6 s). [ 111 ]  About  90% of the initial capacity was retained even the cells were operated at a low current rate. Amatucci  et al . [ 112–114 ]  ﬁ rst suggested  the  fabrication  of  a  hybrid  device  by  incorporating  activated  carbon  (AC)  in  both  electrodes  (AC+LiCoO 2 /AC+Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 )  to  bridge the gap between LIB and supercapacitors, which led to the  development  of  Li-HECs.  The  same  concept  has  also  been  adopted  for  other  conventional  LiMn 2 O 4   and  LiFePO 4   +AC/ AC+Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ gurations. [ 115–118 ]   The  conﬁ guration  is  currently  referred  to  as  “super-redox  capacitors”. [ 95,119 ]   The  performance of a ﬂ exible paper battery with a ﬁ rst generation layered  cathode LiCoO 2  and a spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode as reported by several researchers to have appreciable cycleability and an operating  potential of ≈2.4 V (here the paper means, free-standing carbonaceous  materials); [ 120–129 ]   for  example  the  full-cell  composed  of  carbon nanotube (CNT)-supported LiCoO 2  and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  showed a  good  cycleability  of  ≈93%  capacity  retention  after  450  cycles  ( Figure     6  ). [ 129 ]   Similarly,  carbon and  binder-free  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -TiO 2   rutile  (3:1)  hybrid  nanowire  arrays  were  also  proposed  to  overcome the inherent conductivity issue and sustain to deliver high  reversible  capacity  at  high  current  operations. [ 130 ]   Aging  studies  were reported that compared the calendar and cycled life of the  composite  cathode  (LiCoO 2 +LiMn 2 O 4 )  in  a  full-cell  assembly  with  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode. [ 131 ]   The  LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -TiO 2   rutile  displayed  exceptional  cycleability  of  3000  cycles  with  a  capacity  retention of ≈96% at a current density of 450 mA g −1 . A similar  capacity proﬁ les were observed while operating at a high current  rate  of  1750  mA  g −1   for  2000  cycles.  Theoretically,  the  spinel  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  paired  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  showed  a  working potential of ≈2.5 V [ 132,133 ]  and this kind of assembly was  extensively  investigated  by  Ohzuku   et  al . [ 134,135 ]   The  LiMn 2 O 4 / Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ guration  (nanostructured  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode)  has  been  widely  investigated  for  HEVs,  considering  the  cost,  safety,  and high power capability. [ 136–138 ]  At a 10 C rate, the cell displayed  excellent cycleability over 1000 cycles under elevated temperature  conditions  (55  °C)  without  noticeable  capacity  fading. [ 136,139 ]   An  excellent long-term cycleability of 30 000 cycles were reported for  100% state-of-charge between 1.8–2.8 V in constant current-constant  voltage  (CC-CV)  mode  for  a  LiMn 2 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cell  at  a  10 C rate (1 C = 3 A) with retention of ≈95%. [ 140 ]  Accordingly, the  cycle  number  and  cycle  time  at  a  capacity  fading  of  10%,  in  accordance  with  the  square  root  of  the  cycle  number  and  time  rule, are predicted to be 200 000 cycles and 15 years, respectively.  On the other hand, the LiNi 0.5 Co 0.2 Mn 0.3 O 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  cell showed  slightly  the  aforesaid conﬁguration and displayed ≈86% retention after 6000 cycles at a  60  A  current  rate  (3  C).  Based  on  the  square  root  of  the  cycle  number and time rule, the cell is capable of working for 15 years  with a loss of 20% capacity. Elevated temperature (55 °C) performance of the LiMn 2 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  system was further improved by  Al and  F-doping  in  the  cathode  side  (LiAl 0.1 Mn 1.8 O 4-z F 0.5 )  with  porous  PVdF  membrane  and  displayed  ≈85%  of  retention  after  400  cycles  at  0.14  C  rate  (7  months). [ 141,142 ]   Ionica-Bousquet  et al. [ 143 ]  attempted to use two new polyﬂ uorinated boron cluster  lithium salts (Li 2 B 12 F 12  and Li 2 B 12 F 8 H 4 ) as the electrolyte for the  LiMn 2 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ guration  to  improve  the  initial  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  and  high  reversibility.  Li 2 B 12 F 12   salt  iswas  found to be superior than the latter and is comparable to conventional LiPF 6  based solutions. The electrochemical performance of  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   microspheres  was  tested  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  for  1000 cycles and reversible insertion of more than 3 mole Li was  observed. [ 144 ]  Utilizing a single crystalline Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode with a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  was  unsuccessful  and  displayed  poor  electrochemical  behavior  even  at  ambient  temperature  conditions   [ 145 ]   compared to the previous work by Belharouak et al. [ 136 ]  At high  current  cycling,  much  less  generation  of  heat  was  observed  for  the  case  of  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   compared  to  MCMB [ 146 ]   and  graphite [ 147 ]   anodes in full-cell assemblies with LiMn 2 O 4  and LiFePO 4 , respectively, which is an added advantage. Later, Jiang and Dahn [ 89,148 ]  conﬁrmed the lower heat evolution (–110 kJ (mol Li) −1 ) in de-lithiated  state  (Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 )  compared  to  Li 0.81 C 6   (–215  kJ  (mol  Li) −1 ).  The compatibility with the polymer electrolyte (polyacrylonitrile;  PAN)  was  also  evaluated  for  the  conﬁ guration  with  a  loss  of  0.05%  initial  capacity  only  after  200  cycles. [ 149,150 ]   Christensen  et al. [ 151 ]  found that Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  exhibits better high current performance  than  LiC 6   anode  when  paired  with  Li-rich  spinel  (Li 1.16 Mn 1.84 O 4 ). Later, Reale et al. [ 152,153 ]  demonstrated the compatibility of the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode in the presence of a PVdF-based  gel  polymer  electrolyte  with  spinel  LiMn 2 O 4   and  its  derivative  (LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 )  as  well  as  the  olivine  phase  LiFePO 4 .  Electrochemical activity in non-ﬂ ammable electrolytes, i.e., ionic liquids  (LiTFSI  in  1n -butyl-1-ethyl-pyrrolidinium  bis(triﬂ uoromethane)  sulfonamide (Py 24 TFSI) was also evaluated by the same group for  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   assembly. [ 154 ]   However,  slightly  inferior  cycling  proﬁ les  were  noted  for  the  PVdF-based  gel  polymer  system  compared  to  the  PAN-based  system  with  the  spinel  anode. Zr-doping (Li 4 Ti 5   -x  Zr  x  O 12 ) was also performed to improve  the electrochemical activity in the full-cell assembly with LiMn 2 O 4   and  no  fading  was  observed  for  200  cycles. [ 155 ]   Electrode  thickness is very crucial to yield high performance batteries, however  at higher rates the performance is independent of the electrode  thickness,  which  is  clearly  evident  from  the  LiMn 2 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells. [ 156 ]   Hydrothermally  prepared  web-like  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anodes over Ti foil exhibited the extended cycleability of 5000 cycles in a  half-cell  assembly,  irrespective  of  the  applied  current  rates  (2  C  and 20 C, 1 C = 175 mA g −1 ) and they also delivered similar performance to the spinel LiMn 2 O 4  cathode. [ 157 ]  Belharouak et al. [ 158 ]   reported  interesting  results  on  such  conﬁ gurations  when  they  were aged at 30, 45, and 60 °C for 5 months; this resulted in a  drastic capacity fade, power capability, and H 2  gas production in  the  cell  at  high  temperature  operation.  AlF 3   modiﬁ cation  was  also carried out over a Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  surface to suppress the gas evolution  when  coupled  with  LiMn 2 O 4.  [ 159 ]   Gas  evolution  of  the  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  at  elevated  temperature  operation  was  further  conﬁ rmed  by  Wu  et  al. [ 160,161 ]   when  paired  with  a  LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2   cathode.  However,  capacity  fading  is  inevitable for such LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2  cathodes when coupled with  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ,  irrespective  of  the  operating  temperature  (55,  75  and  95  °C). [ 162 ]   Although,  capacity  fading  is  unavoidable  for  LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2   based  systems,  they  displayed  excellent  power  capability  when  paired  with  spinel  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   compared  toMCMB  anodes. [ 163,164 ]   The  performance  of  the  LiMn 2 O 4 / Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration under sub-zero conditions with three different electrolytes (1.0 M LiPF 6  in ethylene carbonate (EC): diethyl carbonate (DEC): ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1, vol%),  1.0 M LiBF 4  in propylene carbonate (PC):EMC: methyl butyrate  (MB):EC (19:19:57:5, wt%), 1.0 M LiPF 6  in EC:EMC:ethyl acetate  (EA) (1:5:4, vol%)) was reported by Chen et al. [ 165 ]  The cell composed  of  1.0  M  LiPF 6   in  EC:EMC:EA  solution  exhibited  outstanding performance under low temperature conditions because  of the low melting point (-84 °C) and viscosity (0.45 cP at 25 °C)  of the EA and it eventually passed the cold cranking test as well.  Imazaki et al. [ 166 ]  suggested the reversible insertion of more than  3  moles  of  Li  in  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   without  damaging  the  counter  electrode  (Li[Li 0.1 Al 0.1 Mn 1.8 ]O 4 )  by  overcharging  to  5.2  V  with  good  stability.  Surprisingly,  very  stable  electrochemical  proﬁ les  were  observed  when  such  Li[Li 0.1 Al 0.1 Mn 1.8 ]O 4   cathodes  were  paired  with Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anodes at –10, 25, and 55 °C temperature conditions. [ 167 ]  Very negligible capacity fading was observed under subzero conditions (–10 °C), whereas 5 and 15% fading was observed  after 250 cycles at 25 and 55 °C temperature conditions, respectively. The long-term cycleability of Li[Li 0.1 Al 0.1 Mn 1.8 ]O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells with positive limited (PL) designs was evaluated by means  of  constant  voltage  mode  (at  3  V  for  6  min  charge  and  at  2 V for 6 min discharge) and retained ≈91.7% of initial capacity  after  3600  cycles. [ 168 ]   The  inﬂ uence  of  the  separator  (polypropylene microporous membrane or non-woven cloth) on the performance  of  Li[Li 0.1 Al 0.1 Mn 1.8 ]O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   and  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 / Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  was  analyzed  under  elevated  conditions  (55  °C). Use of non-woven cloths was found appealing in terms of good  capacity retention characteristics and high reversibility, and they  certainly  displayed  much  better  cycleability  than  commercial  polypropylene  separators  under  elevated  conditions  irrespective  of the mentioned ≈2.5 and 3 V conﬁ gurations. [ 169 ]  Carbon coating  is one of the efﬁ cient approaches to overcome the gas evolution  observed in Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  based cells while operating under elevated  conditions.  [ 170 ]  Additionally, the presence of a carbon layer promotes  the  high  power  capability  of  the  system.  The  gassing  behavior  of  the  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  was  not  observed  when  it  was  paired  with  layered,  spinel,  or  LiFePO 4   systems.  This  was  comprehensively  analyzed  using  online  electrochemical  mass  spectrometry  measurements  because  of  the  use  of  poorly  dried electrodes  and  separators  and  it  is  in  contrast  to  previous  reports. [ 171 ]  This report conﬁ rms that the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode  is not involved in the gas evolution process while operating under  elevated conditions.  

Although good cycling proﬁ les were observed for this conﬁ guration, elevated temperature proﬁ les of LiMn 2 O 4  are the main  hurdle  to  using  them  in  practical  cells  because  of  the  dissolution  of  Mn 3+   and  the  associated  Jahn-Teller  distortion. [ 44,137,172 ]   Hence,  the  well-established  low-potential  (≈3.4  V   vs .  Li)  olivine  LiFePO 4   was  replaced  with  spinel  phase  LiMn 2 O 4 ,  which  tends  to  decrease  the  net  operating  potential  of  the  system  from  ≈2.5  to  ≈1.9  V. [ 70,173–176 ]   The  net  operating  potential  is  lower,  but  the  olivine  phase  LiFePO 4   exhibits  similar  characteristics,  such  ashigh  power  capability,  cost,  safety,  and  high  thermal  stability. [ 177–183 ]   The  loss  in  operating  potential  could  be  compromised  by  the  high  reversible  capacity  of  LiFePO 4   (150–160 mAh g −1 ) compared to LiMn 2 O 4  (110–130 mAh g −1 ) in  half-cell  assemblies. [ 137 ]   The  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  displayed  excellent capacity retention characteristics over 1300 cycles for  stationary  storage [ 184 ]   and  delivered  high  power  capability  as  well. [ 185 ]  Yang et al. [ 186 ]  reported the inﬂ uence of V-substitution  on the Ti sites (Li 4 Ti 5  x  V  x  O 12 ) and subsequently the full-cell was  fabricated  and  showed  an  appreciable  performance  of  ≈98.1%  retention  after  400  cycles.  In  addition,  improved  electrochemical  reversibility  was  observed  for  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  when  casting  over  free-standing  and  ﬂ exible  single-walled  carbon  nanotube  (SWCNT)/polycellulose  paper  current  collectors  compared  to  Al-foil  current  collectors. [ 187 ]   Similarly,  a  wearable  conﬁ guration  was  also  reported,  with  the  possibility  of charging using solar power and utilization of 3D current collectors with notable electrochemical proﬁ les. [ 188–191 ]  Lei et al. [ 192 ]   described  the  advantages  of  using  porous  graphitic  carbonLi 4 Ti 5 O 12  composites with LiFePO 4  to improve the high current  cycling.  Composite  electrodes  (LiFePO 4   and  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 )  were  formulated  with  graphene  foam  to  construct  ﬂ exible  LIBs  for  ultrafast  charge-discharge  capability  under  harsh  conditions  (200  C  with  respect  to  anode  mass)  using  different  orientations  of  ﬂ at  and  bend  modes  with  good  cycleability. [ 193 ]   Interesting electrochemical and thermal properties are evidenced at  sub-zero temperature conditions for 18 650 conﬁ gurations. [ 194 ]   Fast  charging  capability  with  enhanced  safety  and  long  cycle  life  was  noted  for  LiFePO 4   and  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   electrodes  in  18  650  conﬁ gurations,  in  which  the  electrodes  were  formulated  with  water  soluble  carboxylmethyl  cellulose  (CMC)  binder. [ 195 ]   The  cell  retains  full-capacity  after  20  000  cycles  at  6  min  charge  (10 C) and 12 min (5 C) discharge, and slightly fades to ≈95%  after 30 000 cycles, when increasing the charging rate of 15 C  (4  min)  with  5  C  discharge,  tested  in  parallel.  In  both  cases  100%  depth-of-discharge  and  state-of-charge  conditions  were  used. In addition, the mentioned conﬁ guration was successfully  demonstrated for powering the car on roads. To improve the cell  safety under elevated conditions, the LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration was evaluated at 60 °C by incorporating the ionic liquid,  1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium  bis(triﬂ uoromethanesulfonyl)  imide  (HMIM-TFSI)  as  the  electrolyte. [ 196 ]   Passerini  and  co-workers [ 197,198 ]  also reported the possibility of using  N -butyl N -methylpyrrolidinium  bis(ﬂ uorosulfonyl)  imide  (PyR 14 FSI)  and   N -methoxyethylN -methylpyrrolidinium  ﬂ uorosulfonyl(triﬂ uoromethanesulfonyl)  imide  (PyR 12O1 FTFSI)  ionic  liquids for  both  ambient  and  elevated-temperature  operation  of  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cell.  Both  electrodes  were  formulated  with  CMC  binder.  Furthermore,  ionic  liquid  based  quaternary  polymer electrolyte (PVdF + LiTFSI +  N -methylN -propylpiperidinium  bis(triﬂ uoromethanesulphonyl)  imide  (PP13-TFSI)+  VC)  were  also  proposed  to  retard  the  ﬂ ammability  of  the  conventional  aprotic  solvents  in  the  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ guration  and  they  displayed  a  reversible  capacity  of ≈161  mAh  g −1   with good rate performance characteristics. [ 199 ]  Zaghib et al. [ 200 ]   suggested  that  0.5  mol  L −1   LiTFSI  +  1  mol  L −1   LiBF 4   in  EC  γbutyrolactone  (GBL)  is  found  to  be  a  better  alternative  compared  to  the  thermally  unstable  LiPF 6 -based  electrolytes  when  the LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  cell operates at 60 °C. Notably, the mentioned electrolyte is stable for over thousands of cycles even at  ultrafast charging rates such as 30, 60 and 100 C. Redox shuttle  additives play a vital role and ensure the cell safety during over  charge conditions. [ 10 ]  Moshuchak et al. [ 201 ]  studied the usage of  2,5-ditert -butyl-1,4-dimethoxybenzene  (DDB)  and  4tert -butyl1,2-dimethoxybenzene (TDB) as the redox shuttle additives for  the LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration and found that the former  supports the overcharge protection of ≈200 cycles and the latter  supports  only  3–15  cycles.  Good  cycleability  of  ≈150  mAh  g −1   under  both  ambient  and  elevated  temperature  conditions  for  over 100 cycles was reported in the presence of borate ester or  aluminium  ester-based  solid-polymer  electrolyte  by  Wakihara  et  al. [ 202 ]   Similarly,  the  use  of  patterned  current  collectors  is  one of the efﬁ cient routes to easily migrate the Li-ions so that  high  power  capability  could  be  realized.  Along  this  line,  Choi  et  al. [ 203 ]   reported  a  demonstration  of  a  LiFePO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cell  fabricated using the well patterned (Al and Cu for the cathode  and anode, respectively) foils with excellent cycleability at 10 C  rate  (6  min  charge)  for  1000  cycles.  The  cell  delivered  the  reversible  capacity  of  ≈70  mAh  g −1   after  1000  cycles  whereas  normal current collector displayed the capacity of ≈8 mAh g −1   only under similar testing conditions. 

After  the  successful  demonstration  of  olivine  type  LiFePO 4   in  a  full-cell  assembly  with  a  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode,  another  olivine  with  a  higher  redox  couple  (≈4.1  V   vs .  Li),  LiMnPO 4 ,  was  also  used  as  the  cathode  active  material  to  fabricate  Li-ion  power  packs  for  load  leveling  applications.  Similar  to  LiFePO 4   and  LiMn 2 O 4 ,  LiMnPO 4   also  had  similar  characteristics,  including  power  capability,  cost,  safety,  high  thermal  stability,  and  ecofriendliness. [ 4 ]   The  construction  of  LiMnPO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  with  a  ﬂ at  working  potential  of  ≈2.5  V  was  ﬁ rst  reported  by  Martha et al. [ 204 ]  The cell displayed an initial reversible capacity  of ≈130 mAh g −1  (based on cathode loading) at 0.05 C and also  exhibited  better  rate  capability  proﬁ les.  Furthermore,  there  was no notable capacity loss observed for the cell over the 300  cycles investigated at a 0.5 C rate at 30 °C. Interestingly, there  was no such prominent plateau observed at ≈2.5 V while using  the  carbon-coated  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   as  the  anode  with  a  carbon-coated  LiMnPO 4  cathode, as reported by Ramar et al., [ 205 ]  and it showed  a more or less monotonous discharge proﬁ le with high power  capability.  Because  of  the  inferior  electrochemical  activity  of  the olivine phase cathode and the different charging protocols  (used  in  conventional  mobile  phone  chargers,  CC-CV)  fewer  reports  are  available  for  the  case  of  LiMnPO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   based  systems. Therefore, currently, the research activities are focused  on the wide range of solid-solutions between LiFePO 4 -LiMnPO 4 (LiFe 1  x  Mn  x  PO 4 ),  which  are  expected  to  operate  between  ≈4.1  and  3.4  V  vs.  Li  with  two  prominent  ﬂ at  potentials. [ 4,206 ]   For  instance,  LiMn 0.8 Fe 0.2 PO 4  [204,207–209]   and  LiMn 0.5 Fe 0.5 PO 4  [208]   solid-solutions  were  reported  with  spinel  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anodes  in  full-cell assemblies. 

The  problems  such  as  anion  dissolution  in  conventional  electrolyte solutions and the associated capacity fading reported  for  the  case  of  high  voltage  (≈4.8  V   vs .  Li)  olivine  phase  LiCoPO 4  210,211   are  reported  but  few  reports  describing  the  performance  with  a  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  can  be  found. [ 212,213 ]   The  LiCoPO 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   conﬁ guration  seems  promising  because  of  the  higher  redox  potential  (≈3.25  V),  but  an  expected  capacity  fading  remains  in  the  full-cell  assembly. [ 212,213 ]   Similar  to  LiCoPO 4 ,  its  derivative,  Li 2 CoPO 4 F,  also  suffers  from  many  including  poor  compatibility  with  electrolytes, [ 214 ]   issues  single-phase  reaction [ 215 ]   (whereas  LiCoPO 4   undergoes  a  twophase  reaction  mechanism), [ 84,216–219 ]   inherent  electrical  conductivity, [ 218 ]   etc.,  but  also,  full-cell  assembly  with  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode was reported. [ 220 ]  Unlike that of ﬂ at working potential in  LiCoPO 4   cathodes,  a  monotonous  curve  is  resulted  at  ≈3.5  V  with  capacity  fading  upon  cycling.  Furthermore,  few  reports  are available on the spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode paired with ≈5 V vs.  Li  type  cathodes  such  as  LiCo 0.2 Fe 0.2 Mn 1.6 O 4   (working  potential: ≈3 V), [ 221 ]  LiCoMnO 4  (working potential: ≈3.2 V) [ 222 ] , ≈4 V  vs.  Li  class  cathodes  LiVPO 4 F  (working  potential:  ≈2.6  V), [ 223 ]   LiNiO 2  (working potential: ≈ 2 V), [ 224 ]  and Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  (working  potential:  ≈2.5  V), [ 225 ]   and  ≈3.4  V  vs.  Li  type  layered  cathode  V 2 O 5   (limited  for  one  mole  Li-insertion/extraction  with  operating  potential  of  ≈1.85  V) [ 75,80 ]   were  studied  and  reported.  In  addition,  an  interesting  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 /Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F 3   assembly  composed  of  mixed  1   M   LiPF 6   and  1   M   NaPF 6   in  EC:dimethyl  carbonate  (DMC)  electrolyte  solution  was  reported  by  Barker  et  al. [ 226 ]   The  cell  displayed  reasonable  cycling  behavior  irrespective of either the above solution or LiPF 6  based electrolytes  with operating potential of ≈2.6 V.   Currently,  research  is  focused  on  the  development  of ≈3  V  class spinel LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  systems to fulﬁ l the necessary  requirements  for  zero-emission  transportation  applications  such  as  EVs  and  HEVs. [ 227 ]   Ni-doping  in  LiMn 2 O 4   somewhat overcome the Mn 3+  dissolution and associated JahnTeller distortion issues with beneﬁ cial higher operating potential (≈4.7 V vs. Li). [ 46,228–234 ]  Originally, Ohzuku et al. [ 135,235–238 ]   reported  the  development  of  this  3  V  class  system  for  high  power  applications.  Demonstrating  the  inﬂ uence  of  particle  size  on  the  electrochemical  activity  of  such  3  V  class  Li-ion  cells, LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  particles prepared at 1000 °C with smooth  (111)  facets  composed  of  octahedral  morphology  showed  better  electrochemical  activity  with  a  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  compared  to  low-temperature-synthesized  small  particulates. [ 239 ]   The  long-term  cycleability  of  such  a  cell  was  also  evaluated  by  applying  a  sinusoidal  potential  of  1  V  at  0.1  Hz  with  an  open-circuit  voltage  of  3.16  V  (5  s  charge  and  5  s  discharge)  and  10%  power  fade  was  only  observed  after  200  000  cycles  (23 days).Further studies were carried out by several researchers  to develop such a zero-strain insertion anode, Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 -based  system  for  high  power  applications. [ 240,241 ]   Apart  from  the  higher  operating  potential  of  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 ,  the  eco-friendliness,  low-cost,  and  high  energy  density,  together  with  with  high  power  capability  and  easy  production  on  the  industrial scale  are  worth  mentioning. [ 242 ]   However,  the  Ni 2+/4+   occurs  at  slightly  higher  potential  than  the  thermodynamic  stability  of conventional carbonate-based electrolyte solutions and it is  one of the issues when paired with Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . [ 3 ]  This certainly  results in the lower coloumbic efﬁ ciency of the cell in the initial cycles while using LiPF 6  based electrolyte solutions. Therefore,  a  protective  coating  (preferably  a  conductive  coating,  otherwise it will deteriorate the power capability) or metal codoping in either transition metal sites (Mn or Ni) or Li-sites is  necessary to sustain LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  as electrochemically active  for  extended  cycling.  Wu   et  al . [ 243 ]   investigated  the  electrochemical  performance  of  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   with  negative  limited  (NL),  PL,  and  equal-mass  ratio  (EM)  and  found  that  all  three  conﬁ gurations  showed  better  electrochemical  properties. However, the NL design provides marginally better  electrochemical  performance  than  rest  after  1000  cycles  with  retention  of ≈98%  of  the  initial  capacity  compared  to ≈96.8%  for  EM  and ≈94%  for  PL  designs.  The  better  electrochemical  activity  of  NL  design  was  further  conﬁ rmed  by  Xian   et  al . [ 244 ]   and rendered ≈85% capacity compared to ≈56% for PL design  after  2900  cycles  at  a  current  density  of  0.2  mA  cm −2 .  It  was  also  found  that  EC:DEC  solvents  exhibit  poor  compatibility  compared  to  EC:DMC  when  used  for  these  3  V  class  Li-ion  cells.  Unfortunately,  there  has  been  no  further  improvement  to  the  the  columbic  efﬁ ciency  noted  when  changing  the  conventional  LiPF 6   salt  to  LiClO 4 ,  lithium  bis(oxalato)  borate  (LiBOB),  or  LiBF 4 . [ 245 ]   Similar  capacity  trends  were  observed  for  all  three  salts,  and  a  rapid  decrease  in  the  proﬁ les  was  observed  for  LiBF 4   salts  in  the  3  V  class  systems.  Li  et  al. [ 246 ]   suggested  the  possibility  of  using  tris(hexaﬂ uoro-iso-propyl)  aluminate  (Al(HFiP) 3 )  as  an  additive  for  the  PL  design  cells  by considering several aspects including coulombic efﬁ ciency,  charge at end point capacity slippage, and capacity loss during  prolonged storage and capacity retention vs. cycle number. Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) was also proposed as an  additive for the 3 V class systems by considering initial higher  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  and  ﬂ ame  retardant  characteristics;  unfortunately,  it  offers  more  fade  than  additive-free  systems  upon  cycling. [ 247 ]   To  enable  the  electrochemical  activity,  preferably  the  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency,  of  such  3  V  class  cells  under  sub-zero (–20 °C) and elevated temperature (55 °C) operations,  Co co-doping has been performed in the cathodic side. [ 248 ]  The  full-cell  LiNi 0.45 Co 0.1 Mn 1.45 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   with  PL  design  rendered  ≈85.4%  of  initial  capacity  after  500  cycles  at  1  C  rate.  Irrespective  of  the  operating  temperature  (–20  to  55  °C),  a  good cycleability was observed with an expected capacity drop,  i.e.,  less  reversibility  in  sub-zero  conditions.  On  the  other  hand, Ti substitution in Mn sites (LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5   −   x Ti x O 4 ) results  in  suppression  of  the  electrolyte  decomposition  and  enables  good  capacity  retention  characteristics. [ 249 ]   Al-co-doping  (LiNi 0.473 Mn 1.473 Al 0.054 O 4 ) in spinel cathodes was also reported  with nanotube morphology and paired with an Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode  that  offered  better  electrochemical  characteristics  compared  to  the  micrometer-sized  system. [ 250 ]   However,  the  obtained  results are inferior compared to the aforementioned 3 V class  systems reported. Choi et al. [ 251 ]  reported the synthesis of hierarchical  cotton  templated  electrode  materials  for  the  fabrication  of  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  with  excellent  high  current performance (3 C) of over 200 cycles with ≈92% capacity retention. No charge capacity end point slippage was observed  for Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  based cells in either the PL design or NL back-toback  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells  as  no  interaction  between  electrodes  was  observed,  whereas  rapid  fading  was  observed  for  normal  NL  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   cells. [ 252 ]   It  is  wellknown  that,  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   is  a  SEI-free  electrode;  however,  the  presence of a passivation layer was evident and it was mainly  composed of solvated Mn, LiF,and some inorganic species. [ 253 ]   This  might  be  the  result  of  oxidation  of  solvent  molecules  while using high voltage spinel cathodes (LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 ). Fabrication  of  “zero-volt”  Li-ion  cells  with  symmetric  electrodes  (Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ) is one of the efﬁ cient ways to understand  capacity  fading  mechanisms. [ 254,255 ]   Interestingly,  Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 / Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  symmetric cells were also used to study the parasitic  side  reaction  with  various  electrolyte  solutions  and  combinations,  preferably  on  a  sulfone-based  system. [ 256 ]   This  study  clearly demonstrated that the surface ﬁ lm formation depends  completely  on  the  state-of-charge  and  the  presence  of  alkyl  carbonates (DMC, EMC) in sulfone ( Figure    7  ). Thus, alkylcarbonare (EMC) reduction occurred at the Li 7 Ti 5 O 12 /electrolyte/ Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   interfaces,  which  lead  to  the  decomposition  products  of  carbonates,  ethers,  and  mineral  compounds  such  as  ROCO 2 Li and Li 2 CO 3  over titanate electrode surfaces. In addition  to  above,  the  large  amounts  of  LiF  deposition  results  in  an  increase  in  resistance  and  subsequently  deteriorates  the  cycling proﬁ le upon cycling.   

LiTi 2 O 4   is  the  only  known  cubic  spinel  superconductor  with  metallic  conductivity  and  has  been  proposed  as  a  promising  insertion  anode  for  LIB  applications;  it  has  a  theoretical  capacity of ≈161 mAh g −1  for the reversible insertion/extraction  of one mole of Li (Li 2 Ti 2 O 4  or Ti 2 O 4 ). During the electrochemical  Li-insertion/extraction  process  spinel  LiTi 2 O 4   undergoes  a  two-phase reaction mechanism at ≈1.5 V  vs . Li. A small reduction of the lattice parameter value (from 8.416 to 8.380 Å) and  unit cell volume variation is also observed during the Li-insertion  process. [ 257,258 ]   The  spinel  phase  exhibits  good  cycleability  in  a  half-cell  assembly,  but  the  very  few  works  only  reported  for the LIB point of view. This is mainly because of difﬁ culties  in  the  synthesis  process,  as  the  preparation  of  mixed  valence  of  Ti 3+   and  Ti 4+   is  not  easy.  Similar  to  Li-insertion,  extraction  is  also  plausible  because  of  the  presence  of  Ti 3+ ,  which  also  undergoes a two-phase equilibrium at ≈2.3 V vs. Li and results  in  the  formation  of  Ramsdellite  type  TiO 2   (Ti 2 O 4 )  at  the  end  of  the  charge. [ 259 ]   Recently,  Yang  et  al. [ 260 ]   reported  a  simple  carbothermal  reduction  for  the  preparation  of  LiTi 2 O 4   with  good  electrochemical  properties  in  the  half-cell  assembly  with  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈140  mAh  g −1   at  ≈1.5  V  vs.  Li  region.  Persi  et  al. [ 261 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  a  LiFePO 4 / LiTi 2 O 4   system  in  the  presence  of  PVdF-based  gel  electrolyte.  The  cell  delivered  a  reversible  capacity  of ≈100  mAh  g −1   (with  respect  to  cathode  loading)  at  a  working  potential  of  ≈1.9  V,  with  meager  fading  upon  cycling  ( Figure     8  ).  Later,  Manickam  and Takada [ 262 ]  reported the performance of a LiMn 2 O 4 /LiTi 2 O 4   conﬁ guration with much less reversibility (≈5 to 15 mAh g −1 ) in  the ≈2.3 V regime.   

 Li[CrTi]O 4   is  a  AB 2 O 4   type  cubic  spinel  and  exhibits  a  similar  characteristics  to  those  of  its  counterpart  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 .  Similar  to  LiTi 2 O 4 , LiCrTiO 4  can also be used as a cathode by utilizing the  Cr 3+/4+   redox  couple  (≈4.5  V   vs .  Li).  Unfortunately  the  electrochemical stability of the Cr 3+/4+  redox couple is found inferior,  hence  there  has  been  no  further  attempt  carried  out  to  make  use  of  it.  On  the  other  hand,  a  Ti 4+/3+   redox  couple  could  be  used as a promising ≈1.5 V  vs . Li insertion anode for LIB applications with theoretical capacity of ≈157 mAh g −1  for the reversible  insertion  of  one  mole  of  Li.  A  unit  cell  volume  variation  from 576 to 580 Å 3  (+3.7%) is observed during the Li-insertion  process  at  low  voltage. [ 36 ]   As  far  as  the  structural  prospects  of  LiCrTiO 4   are  concerned,  the  Li  is  located  in  the  tetrahedral  sites 8(a) sites, whereas the transition metal elements Ti 4+  and  Cr 3+   are  randomly  distributed  in  a  1:1  ratio  and  occupy  100% improvement in  the  octahedral  16(d)  sites  in  a  cubic-closed  packed  oxygen  array in 32(e) sites. [ 90,263,264 ]  The crystal site formula of LiCrTiO 4   can  also  be  written  in  space  notation  as  Li 8(a) [CrTi] 16(d) O 4  32(e) .  Ohzuku et al. [ 36,265 ]  ﬁ rst reported the electrochemical activity of  a  spine  framework  LiCrTiO 4   as  a  promising  electrode  for  LIB  applications.  Later,  the  electrochemical  properties  were  noted,  including  N 2   sintering, [ 266 ]   carbon  coating, [ 267 ]   and  LiCrTiO 4   with  Ramsdellite  structure [ 268,269 ]   in  half-cell  assembly.  Ooms  et  al. [ 270 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  a  LiMg 0.1 Ni 0.4 Mn 1.5 O 4 /LiCrTiO 4   assembly  with  a  high working potential of ≈3.25 V. The cell delivered an exceptional performance of 175 cycles with stable reversible capacity  of  ≈120  mAh  g −1 .  On  the  contrary,  a  severe  fading  was  noted  for  the  native  phase  when  paired  with  a  LiCrTiO 4   anode,  for  example the full-cell LiMn 2 O 4 /LiCrTiO 4  retained only ≈88% of  its initial reversible capacity after 50 cycles with a working potential  of  ≈2.5  V  ( Figure     9  ). [ 263 ]   Apart  from  the  LIB  applications, spinel phase LiCrTiO 4  has also been used as a promising insertion  anode  for  non-aqueous  Li-ion  hybrid  electrochemical  capacitors. [ 264,271 ]    

 Ti-Nb-O oxides is one of the important insertion anode reported  for LIB applications and has two redox species (Ti 4+  and Nb 5+ ).  The  monoclinic  TiNb 2 O 7   exhibits  a  high  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈387  mAh  g −1   for  the  possible  insertion  of  ﬁ ve  mole  of  Li  (Ti 4+/3+ , Nb 5+/4+ , Nb 4+/3+ ). Practically, over 280 mAh g −1  is possible  with  a  working  potential  of  ≈1.55  V   vs .  Li,  irrespective  of  the  synthetic  procedures  employed. [ 272–281 ]   Either  carbon  coating  or  Nb(IV)  doping  into  Ti  sites  is  required  to  improve  the electrochemical proﬁ les at high current rates. [ 276 ]  Although,  the  TiNb 2 O 7   exhibits  the  favorable  characteristics  such  as  no  SEI  formation,  high  reversible  capacity,  and  eco-friendliness,  meager  capacity  fading  upon  cycling  is  one  of  the  prime  issues. [ 277,282 ]   This  fading  mainly  originates  from  the  unit  cell  volume  variation  during  the  Li-insertion  process  likely  +≈7.22%,  which  is  much  higher  compared  to  the  transition  from  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   in  to  Li 7 Ti 5 O 12   (almost  0%). [ 282 ]   TiNb 2 O 7   is  a  monoclinic layered structure with C2/m space group, in which  Ti 4+  and Nb 5+  both occupy octahedral sites sharing corners and edges. Anti-site disorder is also possible because of the similar  ionic radii of Ti 4+  and Nb 5+ . According to Lu et al., [ 273 ]  lithium  can be reversibly inserted into the (–110) plane of the TiNb 2 O 7   primitive  cell  and  occupying  the  interstitial  site.  Han  and  Goodenough [ 272 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  a  TiNb 2 O 7 / LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cell with both cathodeand anode-limiting conﬁ gurations at an operating potential of ≈3 V. The anode limiting  conﬁ guration (NL) tested between 3.5 and 1.5 V rendered good  electrochemical characteristics compared to the PL one. Unfortunately,  both  limiting  designs  exhibited  inferior  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  upon  cycling  ( Figure     10  ).  Gao  et  al. [ 274 ]   reported  the  excellent performance of a nanoporous TiNb 2 O 7 /LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   assembly  over  1000  cycles  with  capacity  retention  and  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  of  ≈84%  and  ≈100%,  respectively.  Ordered  mesoporous  TiNb 2 O 7   exhibits  outstanding  cycleability  of  over  1600  cycles  at  current  density  of  3.87  A  g −1   with  a  LiFePO 4   cathode at a working potential of ≈1.8 V. Although, the working  potential is found to be low, ≈0.009 mAh g −1  loss per cycle was  only  noted  during  such  prolonged  cycling. [ 279 ]   Very  recently,  Jayaraman  et  al. [ 29,277 ]   realized  the  performance  of  electrospun  TiNb 2 O 7  anode in all 1D architecture with electrospun LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  in  the  presence  of  an  electrospun  PVdF-HFP  membrane  ( Figure     11  ).  The  TiNb 2 O 7 /PVdF-HFP/LiMn 2 O 4   cell  displayed good cycleability irrespective of the applied current rates.    

 A high molecular weight, lower potential anode (≈1.4 V vs. Li)  is reported for the alternative to conventional spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . The SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14  has a high theoretical capacity of ≈262 mAh g −1   for  the  complete  reduction  of  all  six  Ti 4+   atoms  in  to  Ti 3+ . [ 283 ]   Furthermore,  it  has  a  3D  structure  and   Cmca   space  group,  in  which  Li-ions  can  migrate  quickly  because  of  the  structure’s  high diffusion coefﬁ cient, allowing for excellent high-drain performance.  SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14   is  made  up  of  edge  and  corner  sharing  TiO 6  octahedral units forming layers parallel to the (1 0 0) plane.  Consecutive  layers  (with  respect  to  a  mirror  plane  at   x   =  1/2)  are  linked  by  common  corners  along  the   a -direction.  These  octahedra constitute a [Ti 6 O 14 ] n   4    n   −  3D network. Li atoms in tetrahedral  coordination  occupy  vacancies  of  the  TiO 6   octahedra  framework, while Sr atoms lie in 11-coordinated sites between  two successive layers. [ 284,285 ]  Belharouak and Amine [ 285,286 ]  ﬁ rst  reported  the  electrochemical  activity  of  the  Sr-based  titanate  and found that ≈4.24 mole of Li inserted in to the matrix, contrary to the theoretical value of six mole. Later, the same group  reported the performance and compatibility with various anode  to cathode mass ratios in the full-cell assembly with a LiMn 2 O 4   cathode. [ 287 ]  The full-cell LiMn 2 O 4 /SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14  delivered appreciable cycleability at ≈2.7 V, irrespective of the mass balancing  with  ≈10%  capacity  loss  after  200  cycles.  Later,  Liu  et  al. [ 288 ]   reported  the  exceptional  cycleability  of  1000  cycles  with  ≈90%  capacity  retention  in  the  half-cell  conﬁ guration.  Recently,  the  full-cell was fabricated with a designed capacity of 6 Ah using LiCoO 2  and it was compared with LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration for HEV applications. [ 289 ]  Li-diffusion coefﬁ cients and electronic  conductivity  of  SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14   were,  respectively,  one  order  and two orders of magnitude higher than commercial Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anodes.  As  a  result,  high  electronic  conductivity  and  high  Li  migration  capability  of  SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14   particles  leads  to  excellent  power performance in the LiCoO 2 /SrLi 2 Ti 6 O 14  cell compared to  the LiCoO 2 /Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  conﬁ guration ( Figure    12  ).   

 Garnet  framework  materials  composed  of  Li 3 A 3 B 2 O 12   structures  have  been  widely  investigated  as  solid/ceramic  electrolytes for LIB applications with ionic conductivities >10 −4  S cm −1   in  ambient  conditions. [ 290,291 ]   Very  recently,  Goodenough  and  co-workers [ 292 ]  reported the possibility of using a garnet framework,  Li 3 Nd 3 W 2 O 12 ,  as  a  low-voltage  (≈0.3  V   vs .  Li)  insertion  anode with high power capability. The garnet framework material  exhibits  a  theoretical  capacity  of ≈106  mAh  g −1   for  reversible insertion of 4 mole of Li by utilizing the reduction of W 4+   to  W 2+ .  The  structural  properties  of  such  a  lithium  garnet  framework can be described as Li 3 A 3 B 2 O 12  in which Li occupies  square anti-prismatic, octahedral, and tetrahedral sites in a 3:2:3 ratio. [ 293 ]   The  tetrahedral  Li-sites  are  bridged  by  empty  octahedra that share opposite faces with two tetrahedral sites; every  face of a Li-site is bridged to neighbouring Li-sites by the means  of octahedral sites to provide a 3D interstitial space. This interstitial space can accommodate 9 mole of Li, but a practical limit  of  7  mole  of  Li  has  been  set.  However,  the  material  is  highly  sensitivity towards atmospheres such as H 2 O and CO 2  and the  garnet  framework  materials  becomes  insulating.  Hence,  the  protective coating necessary to keep the lithium garnet framework  remains  electrochemically  active.  Satish  et  al. [ 294 ]   succeeded at making a uniform carbon coating over Li 3 Nd 3 W 2 O 12   particulates  to  realize  applications  as  an  anode  in  LIBs.  Subsequently,  the  full-cell  was  fabricated  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  that  had  a  working  potential  of  ≈3.4  V.  The  cell,  LiMn 2 O 4 /CLi 3 Nd 3 W 2 O 12 ,  delivered  an  exceptional  cycleability,  irrespective  of the applied current rate, for example ≈83% of initial reversible capacity was retained after 300 cycles ( Figure    13  ).   

 LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is one of the widely investigated electro-active materials  for  LIB  applications,  independent  of  anode,  cathode,  and  electrolyte  applications.  Unfortunately,  the  operating  potential  (≈2.6 V vs. Li) of LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is too high from the anode point of  view and too low from the cathode perspective. [ 295 ]  However, it  remains attractive as a solid-electrolyte/glass ceramic with room temperature ionic conductivity in the order of ≈10 −4  S cm −1 . It  suffers from a lack of electronic conductivity, hence the carbon  coating  is  necessary  while  employing  it  as  an  electrode  in  LIB  applications.  LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3   accommodates  two  mole  of  Li  with  a  theoretical capacity of ≈137 mAh g −1  and undergoes a two-phase  reaction  during  reversible  Li-insertion.  Apart  from  the  LIB  applications, LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is considered to be a prospective anode  material  for  aqueous  rechargeable  batteries  becausethe  redox  potential  falls  well  within  the  H 2   evolution  potential; [ 296,297 ]   it  has  also  been  investigated  as  a  prospective  anode  for  Li-HEC  applications. [ 298–300 ]  The structure of NASICON-type LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is similar to Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . Typically, it is a 3D framework and this  allows numerous ionic substitutions at various lattice sites. The  framework  is  built  of  PO 4   tetrahedra  linked  by  the  corners  of  TiO 6  octrahedral units. Each PO 4  tetrahedron is connected with  four TiO 6  octahedral units and, conversely, TiO 6  units are connected to six PO 4  tetrahedra. The interstitial cavities generated  within the network are of two types known as M1 and M2 sites.  The M1 cavity is situated between two TiO 6  octahedral units and  is coordinated with the trigonal antiprism of oxygen and occupied  by  Li.  The  M2  cavity  is  composed  of  distorted  eight-fold  coordination  and  is  surrounded  by  M1  interstitial  voids.  Initially, it was believed that Li would occupy the M2 sites during  insertion to form Li 3 Ti 2 (PO 4 ) 3  However, Aatiq et al. [ 301 ]  reported  that in Li 3 Ti 2 (PO 4 ) 3  the three Li-ions occupy the two tetrahedral  sites,  M3  and  M’3,  within  the  M2  cavity  in  a  ratio  of  2/3:1/3,  respectively.  Aravindan  et  al. [ 302 ]   reported  the  performance  of a  LiMn 2 O 4 /LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3   cell  with  a  working  potential  of ≈1.5  V.  Unfortunately, the working potential was lower than the redox  potential  of  the  LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3   in  the  half-cell  assembly,  and  it  was  much  higher  than  other  conventional  secondary  batteries  such  as  Pb-acid,  Ni-MH,  Ni-Cd. [ 5,303 ]   The  full-cell  LiMn 2 O 4 / LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3  displayed good capacity retention characteristics and  retained  ≈72%  of  its  initial  reversible  capacity  after  200  cycles  ( Figure     14  ).  Capacity  fading  is  inevitable  for  the  LiMn 2 O 4 / LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3   conﬁ guration,  mainly  because  of  the  intrinsic  nature of the insertion type NASICON anode.  the  V  atoms  into  the  5+  state  with  a  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈197  mAh  g −1.307–310   However,  the  removal  of  the  last  Li  is  kinetically  the  most  difﬁ cult  because  of  the  reduced  ionic  and  electronic conductivity of the fully empty V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  phase. This  certainly  results  in  structural  destruction  and  eventually  leads  to capacity fade upon cycling. Similar to oxidation of V 2+  in to  V 5+ ,  reduction  of  V 3+   in  to  V 2+   is  also  possible  at  ≈1.75  V  vs.  Li  for  reversible  insertion  two  mole  of  Li. [ 311–315 ]   Practically,  a  reversible capacity of ≈100 mAh g −1  for Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is observed  in  theat  low  voltage  region. [ 311 ]   Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   consists  of  a  3D  framework of metal octahedra (VO 6 ) and phosphate tetrahedra  (PO 4 ) sharing oxygen vertices. Each VO 6  octahedral unit is surrounded by six PO 4  tetrahedral units. However, each tetrahedral  unit is surrounded by four VO 6  octahedral units. This conﬁ guration  forms  a  3D  network  and  the  alkali  cation,  Li,  is  located  in  the  cavities  within  the  framework.  Three  four-fold  crystallographic  positions  exist  for  the  Li  atoms  leading  to  twelve  Li  positions  within  the  unit  cell. [ 305,306,309 ]   Kobayashi   e t  al. [ 316 ]   ﬁ rst  demonstrated  an  all-solid-state  symmetric  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 /Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   cell  and  found  that  increasing  the temperature from 25 to 80 °C resulted in an increase in the  operating voltage (from 1.7 to 2 V) and reversible capacity (from  42  to  104  mAh  g −1 ).  This  dramatic  change  in  the  variation  of  the working potential and reversible capacity is mainly because  of the poor interface between the electrode and solid-electrolyte.  Later, Aboulaich et al. [ 312,314 ]  successfully used the spark plasma  sintering  (SPS)  technique  to  overcome  such  interfacial  issues  for the mentioned conﬁ guration ( Figure    15  ). Furthermore, the  electrochemical  proﬁ les  of  such  cells  at  80 °C  are  comparable  to  the  performance  of  a  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   cell  that  contains  conventional  liquid  electrolyte  at  ambient  temperature.  Apart from the fabrication of all-NASICON-based LIB, the construction  of  an  asymmetric  type  LiFePO 4 /Li 1.5 Al 0.5 Ge 1.5 (PO 4 ) 3 / Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   cell  has  been  demonstrated  using  the  same  SPS  technique. However, in both cases, no extended cycleability was  reported.  A  good  cycleability  with  capacity  retention  of  ≈89%  was reported after 100 cycles by Mao et al. [ 315 ]  for a Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   symmetric  cell  with  liquid  electrolyte  at  the  predicted  operating  potential  of  ≈2.25  V.  Plashnitsa  et  al. [ 317 ]   also  investigated  the  performance  of  such  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   symmetric cells in ionic liquid medium to improve the thermal  stability  of  the  cells.  Very  recently,  Jian  et  al. [ 318 ]   reported  the  possibility  of  using  rhombohedral  structured  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   as  possible insertion hosts for both high and low voltage regions.  The half-cell displayed a single prominent ﬂ at working potential  at  ≈3.75  V   vs .  Li  and  variation  in  the  charge  discharge  curves  at lower potential (≈1.75 V vs. Li) was also observed. Although  there  was  no  extended  cycleability  reported  for  the  symmetric  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  a  fade  in  capacity  proﬁ le  was  noted  for  the  given  three cycles.   

 NASICON  type  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   has  been  widely  investigated  as  a  promising  ≈4  V   vs .  Li  cathode  active  material  for  LIB  applications  for  the  extraction  of  two  mole  of  Li  by  utilizing  V 3+/4+   redox  couple  with  theoretical  capacity  ≈132  mAh  g −1 . [ 304–306 ]   Removal  of  a  third  Li  is  also  plausible  by  oxidizing  one  of 

 Similar  to  the  NASICON  framework  Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  LiVPO 4 F  is  one  of  the  promising  ≈4.2  V   vs.   Li  cathodes  for  LIB  applications. Reversible insertion of one mole Li is possible by  utilizing the V 3+/4+  redox couple for the high voltage region with  corresponding  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈156  mAh  g −1 . [ 223,320–324 ]  

Nevertheless,  reversible  insertion  into  tavorite-type  LiVPO 4 F  was  also  possible  at  ≈1.8  V  vs.  Li  by  using  the  V 3+/2+   redox  couple. [ 322–325 ]   Further,  two-phase  reaction  mechanism  was  clearly  evident  in  the  in-situ  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  measurements at low voltage (≈1.8 V vs. Li) operation during the transition  from  LiVPO 4 F  to  Li 2 VPO 4 F. [ 325 ]   Recently  Ma  et  al. [ 323 ]   demonstrated that during Li-insertion into LiVPO 4 F (174.337 Å 3 )  phase  resulted  in  a  huge  unit  cell  variation  of  ≈53.42%  (Li 2 VPO 4 F  374.231  Å 3 ).  As  a  result,  a  dramatic  fade  in  the  cycling  proﬁ les  was  noted  in  the  half-cell  assembly.  A  similar  fading was also demonstrated by Wang et al. [ 326 ]  when the halfcell was operated at lower potential (≈1.8 V vs. Li). Interestingly,  Barker  et  al. [ 324 ]   demonstrated  the  fabrication  of  ≈2.4  V  class  Li-ion  cells  using  LiVPO 4 F  electrodes  in  a  symmetric  conﬁ guration (LiVPO 4 F/LiVPO 4 F). The cell delivered an initial reversible  capacity  of  ≈126  mAh  g −1   and  retained  ≈92%  of  initial  capacity after 65 cycles ( Figure    16  ). Contrary to Barker et al. [ 324 ] ,  Plashnitsa et al. [ 327 ]  observed the dramatic fading of such symmetric cells in conventional organic electrolytes because of the  severe reactivity between LiVPO 4 F and acidic LiPF 6  based solution. The thermal stability of the LiVPO 4 F phase was excellent  in  the  de-lithiated  state  and  was  similar  to  that  of  olivine  type  LiFePO 4.  [ 328 ]   Later,  Plashnitsa  et  al. [ 327 ]   attempted  to  use  LiBF 4   in  1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium  (EMIBF 4 )  ionic  liquid  as  the  electrolyte  and  the  performance  was  found  to be inferior under ambient conditions because of the higher  viscosity  of  the  solution.  Nevertheless,  a  good  cycleability  was noted for LiVPO 4 F/LiVPO 4 F symmetric cells irrespective of the  applied current density at elevated conditions.   

 TiS 2   is  the  ﬁ rst  insertion  type  dichalcogenide  cathode  discovered  for  the  reversible  intercalation  of  Li-ions  in  organic  medium. [ 72,330,331 ]   TiS 2   is  made  up  of  hexagonal  close  packed  structure  with  P m3 1   space  group  and  exhibits  metallic  conductivity.  Therefore,  the  inclusion  of  conductive  additive  is  unnecessary. Ti-ions are in octahedral sites between alternating  sulfur  sheets.  TiS 2   sheets  are  stacked  directly  on  top  of  one  another by a van der Waals layer, resulting in the sulfur anion  stacking  sequence  ABAB. [ 72 ]   Because  of  this  unique  assembly,  it can accommodate a wide range of guest species, in particular  Na +  and Mg 2+  ions, in addition to Li +  ions. [ 332,333 ]  However, an  important issue is the huge volume variation of ≈12% upon lithiation [ 333,334 ]   and  this  is  much  higher  than  conventional  intercalating  materials  such  as  anatase  TiO 2 ,  LiCrTiO 4 ,  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ,  etc. [ 36 ]  High temperature preparation of TiS 2  leads to the presence of few Ti atoms in the van der Waals layer, which prevents  the intercalation of Li. Hence, the dichalcogenide, TiS 2 , must be  prepared below 600 °C. Theoretically reversible insertion of one  mole Li is feasible with a capacity of ≈239 mAh g −1 . Upon lithiation process, dichalcogenide, TiS 2  undergo single phase reaction (Li  x  TiS 2 ). [ 72 ]  TiS 2  primarily focused on the cathode point of view,  but  the  working  potential  is  quite  low  compared  to  the  conventional  cathodes  including  LiFePO 4 ,  LiMn 2 O 4 ,  LiCoO 2 ,  and even LiTi 2 (PO 4 ) 3  and TiP 2 O 7 . [ 38,335 ]  Thus, few reports exist  on  the  utilization  of  TiS 2   as  an  anode  framework  material  for  the construction of rocking-chair type Li-ion cells with LiCoO 2   cathodes.  Plichta  et  al. [ 336 ]   reported  the  fabrication  of  all  solidstate  Li-ion  cells  using  LiAlCl 4   as  the  solid-electrolyte  and  LiCoO 2   as  the  cathode  (LiCoO 2 /LiAlCl 4 /TiS 2 )  with  a  working  potential of ≈1.8 V. The cell exhibited an initial reversibility of  0.4 mole Li and faded upon cycling up to 150 cycles at 100 °C.  On  the  other  hand,  better  electrochemical  proﬁ les  are  noted  compared  to  solid-state  conﬁ guration  while  employing  1.5  M  LiAsF 6  in acetonitrile (AN) solution with long cycle life of 500  cycles. [ 337 ]   Croce  et  al. [ 338,339 ]   demonstrated  the  electrochemical  activity  of  a  LiCoO 2 /TiS 2   cell  towards  composite  polymer  electrolyte  ((PEO) 8 -LiClO 4– 10%  γ-LiAlO 2 )  and  gel  polymer  electrolytes (PAN-EC/PC-LiClO 4 ).   

 Conversion is a reversible electrochemical reaction (often called  a displacement reaction), where the transition metal comprising  compound  (MX  y  ,  X =  P,  S,  O,  F,  Cl  etc.,)  is  destroyed  electrochemically and subsequently reduced as a metal (M o ) during the  process. Upon charging, the electrochemically reduced metallic  nanoparticles is theoretically retained in its original state (MX  y  ),  (Figure   1 ). [ 340 ]   However,  certain  ternary  oxides  are  exceptional  and  the  complete  reversibility  into  the  parent  material  is  not possible;  for  example  in  FeCo 2 O 4 ,  reduction  of  Fe o   and  Co o   is  noted  upon  discharge,  whereas  FeO  and  Co 3 O 4   only  formed  while  in  charge  and  subsequent  cycles  as  well. [ 22,23,341 ]   The  overall  conversion  mechanism  for  the  various  compounds  is  represented according to the following equilibrium,

 Because of the multiple electron reactions, such conversion  type  electrodes  are  able  to  deliver  higher  reversible  capacity  than  insertion  type  materials,  including  graphite.  Similar  to  graphitic anodes, unavoidable electrolyte decomposition occurs  in the ﬁ rst cycle. The decomposition leads to the formation of  a SEI layer over the active particle surfaces, which are predominantly composed of insoluble inorganic by products, polymeric  ﬁ lms,  etc.  As  a  result,  a  huge  irreversible  capacity  loss  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle  is  noted  compared  to  graphite.  In  contrast,  the  SEI  layer  formed  over  conversion  anodes  is  entirely  different  than  graphitic  anodes.  Large  volume  variation,  higher  redox  potential, and poor cycleability are other important issues for this type  of anode. Polarization of the conversion electrodes is also not to  be  ruled  out.  However,  carbon  coating  or  forming  composites  with  carbonaceous  material/passive  elements  is  proposed  to  sustain the volume variation and subsequently improve the stability upon cycling. Pre-treating (pre-lithiation) the electrode is  one of the efﬁ cient approaches to tackle the irreversible capacity  loss (ICL) issue, but it involves either use of three-electrode conﬁ gurations [ 342 ]   or  two-step  cell  fabrication  processes.  Recently,  Tarascon and co-workers [ 343 ]  reported the use of “sacriﬁ cial-salts”  to compensate for the ICL; examples include Li salts of azide,  oxocarbons, di-carboxylates, and hydrazides. Anions present in  these salts will lose electrons in the ﬁ rst charge with emission  of  N 2 ,  CO,  or  CO 2   in  the  acceptable  range  of  3–4.5  V  vs.  Li.  As  expected,  the  redox  potential  of  the  conversion  anodes  can  be varied from 3d-metal to metal and tailored according to the  desired  energy  density.  Indeed,  conversion  anodes  certainly  have  several  advantages  over  insertion  type  anodes,  and  overcoming  the  mentioned  setbacks  during  the  fabrication  of  the  Li-ion cells is a big challenge. [ 344 ]  Therefore, little work has been  reported  for  such  anodes  in  the  full-cell  assembly  and  this  is  described in the following sections. 

A hematite phase, α-Fe 2 O 3  nanostructure has been extensively  investigated  as  the  anode  material  for  LIB  applications  with  various  morphological  features.  The  α-Fe 2 O 3   has  a  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈1008  mAh  g −1   for  six  electron  reaction  according  to  the  following  equilibrium,  Fe 2 O 3   +  6Li +   +  6e −   ↔  Fe 0   +  3Li 2 O. [ 345–347 ]  Although the hematite phase shows the favorable  advantages  such  as  low  cost  and  eco-friendliness,  it  has  poor  electrochemical  proﬁ les  in  the  half-cell  assembly  because  of  its inherent electrical conductivity. Therefore, several attempts,  including  carbon  coating  and  making  composites  with  carbonaceous  materials,  have  been  performed  to  improve  the  electrochemical  activity.  Apart  from  the  intrinsic  properties,  the  testing  potential  also  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  electrochemical  stability. Hassoun et al. [ 342 ]  ﬁ rst reported the fabrication of a Liiron  battery  using  the  bulk  hematite  phase  as  the  anode  and  LiFePO 4  as the cathode ( Figure    17  ). As expected in the half-cell  assembly, very poor cycling proﬁ les were noted for the conventional range (0.3–3 V vs. Li) and, hence, the capacity was limited  to 300 mAh g −1  (0.3–1.8 V vs. Li) to sustain stability. Both electrodes were pre-treated before conducting the full-cell assembly  using  reference  electrode  Li;  likewise  LiFePO 4   was  charged  (Li 0 FePO 4 ) and α-Fe 2 O 3  anode was discharged (Fe 0  + 3Li 2 O) to overcome the ICL issue in the LiFePO 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3  conﬁ guration.  The  cell  had  good  cycleability  and  high  current  performance  for  the  investigated  190  cycles.  However,  much  worse  electrochemical  proﬁ les  were  noted  while  paring  with  a  LiFePO 4   cathode and porous α-Fe 2 O 3  nanosheet anode i.e., without any  pre-treatment. [ 348 ]   Mesoporous  α-Fe 2 O 3 -graphene  composite  was also explored as a possible anode for LIB applications. [ 349 ]   It  is  unfortunate  that  the  cell  exhibited  inferior  cycleability  in  the  full-cell  conﬁ guration  with  both  spinel  LiMn 2 O 4   or  layered  LiCoO 2   cathodes.  Among  the  worst  performances,  spinel  LiMn 2 O 4  was observed to have better compatibility than layered  counterpart  in  terms  of  reversibility  and  cycleability.  In  addition,  >34%  of  ICL  was  noted  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle  because  of  the  presence  of  graphene  nanosheets,  which  undergo  huge  ICL  in  ﬁ rst  cycle.  Hariharan  et  al. [ 350 ]   reported  the  electrochemical  activity  of  the  template  synthesized  α-Fe 2 O 3   with  an  olivine  phase  LiMn 0.8 Fe 0.2 PO 4   cathode.  There  were  no  efforts  taken  to  circumvent  the  ICL,  as  the  authors  mentioned  very  little  irreversible  capacity  only  noted  in  half-cell  assembly,  i.e.,  coloumbic efﬁ ciency was found to be ≈90% in the ﬁ rst cycle. The  full-cell LiMn 0.8 Fe 0.2 PO 4 /α-Fe 2 O 3  had a reasonable reversibility  of ≈83 mAh g −1  (based on cathode loading) over 30 cycles with  a working potential of ≈2.3 V. This study also showed the inﬂ uence of electrode heat treatment on half-cell assembly, but not  on  the  full-cell.  Maghemite  phase  (γ-Fe 2 O 3 )  was  also  explored as  a  possible  anode  material  for  the  fabrication  of  high  power  LIBs with graphene composites. [ 351 ]  The pre-treatment was carried  out  by  placing  the  γ-Fe 2 O 3   electrode  in  contact  with  a  Li  foil soaked in LiBOB solution. The pre-treated electrode in the  full-cell, LiFePO 4 /γ-Fe 2 O 3  with LiBOB-based electrolyte, showed  an initial reversible capacity of ≈130 mAh g −1  (based on cathode  mass) in both pure and graphene composites. The presence of  graphene nanosheets was certainly beneﬁ cial for the retention  of capacity upon cycling and in high current testing compared  to native maghemite phase.   

 The  magnetite  phase  showed  much  better  electrical  conductivity  than  its  counterpart  hematite  phase  because  of  the  electron exchange between the Fe 2+  and Fe 3+  centers. The magnetite phase is a perfect example of the inverse spinel structure  with cubic close packed array of ions, where half of the octahedral sites are ﬁ lled by all the Fe 2+  ions and Fe 3+  ions occupy the  remaining  octahedral  and  tetrahedral  sites.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that,  both  magnetite  and  maghemite  phases  exhibit  very  similar  XRD  patterns  and,  therefore,  careful  analysis  must  be  performed  to  distinguish  between  the  phases.  The  magnetite  phase exhibits the theoretical capacity of ≈926 mAh g −1  for eight  electron reaction according to the following equilibrium, Fe 3 O 4   + 8Li +  + 8e − ↔ Fe 0  + 4Li 2 O. [ 352 ]  Ji et al. [ 353 ]  ﬁ rst demonstrated the  performance of the Fe 3 O 4 -graphene composite as a conversion  anode with layered type LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2  as the cathode. No  pre-treatment was used for the anode, so LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2 / Fe 3 O 4 -graphene  cell  experienced  the  ICL  of  ≈38%  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle.  This  huge  ICL  certainly  affected  the  cell  performance  and it displayed a reversible capacity of ≈85 mAh g −1  (based on  cathode mass) at 0.1 C with a capacity retention of ≈90.3% after  10 cycles. Excellent long-term cycling proﬁ les (over 100% retention  after  600  cycles)  of  carbon  encapsulated  3D  hierarchical  Fe 3 O 4   spheres  were  reported  in  the  half-cell  assembly  by  Fan  et al. [ 354 ]  Unusually, ≈58% irreversibility was observed for such  spheres when coupled with a LiMn 2 O 4  cathode. The LiMn 2 O 4 / Fe 3 O 4  cell exhibits a lack of irreversibility in the ﬁ rst cycle, but  it  retains  the  initial  reversible  capacity  of  ≈800  mAh  g −1   after  50 cycles. CF  x   modiﬁ ed Fe 3 O 4  nanoparticles were reported with  excellent cycleability of over 100 cycles in the half-cell assembly  and they were subsequently fabricated with a full-cell with highvoltage  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   cathodes. [ 355 ]   A  reversible  capacity  of  ≈111 mAh g −1  (based on cathode mass) was observed at a current  density  of  100  mA  g −1   and  it  retained ≈67%  of  capacity  retention after 300 cycles. In addition, elevated temperature (45 °C)  performance  was  also  evaluated  with  inferior  columbic  efﬁ ciency and reported. Recently, Ming et al. [ 356 ]  extensively investigated  the  fabrication  and  electrochemical  proﬁ les  of  porous  carbon-Fe 3 O 4   composite  with  a  layered  LiNi 0.59 Co 0.16 Mn 0.25 O 2   cathode  ( Figure     18  ).  In  the  full-cell  assembly,  both  chemically  and  electrochemically  treated  porous  carbon-Fe 3 O 4   composite  showed  exceptional  electrochemical  proﬁ les  when  paired  with  the  cathode.  The  LiNi 0.59 Co 0.16 Mn 0.25 O 2 /porous  carbon-Fe 3 O 4   cell  had ≈64  and ≈58%  of  the  initial  capacity  after  1000  cycles  for  the  chemically  and  electrochemically  lithiated  anodes,  respectively. A maximum energy density of ≈483 Wh kg −1  was achieved  for  this  conﬁ guration.  This  clearly  indicates  that,  no  matter  what  kind  of  lithiation  procedure  is  used  to  overcome  the ICL while fabricating the cell with cathodes.   

 CuO is a very important p-type semiconductor with a band gap  of  1.2  eV  and  has  been  extensively  studied  for  multifarious  applications  such  as  catalysts,  gas  sensors,  photoconductive/ photochemical cells, and other electronic devices. Furthermore,  CuO  can  also  be  used  as  a  promising  anode  for  LIB  applications  via  conversion  pathways,  with  a  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈674  mAh  g −1   for  two  electron  reaction  (CuO  +  2Li +   +  2e −   ↔  Cu 0   +  Li 2 O). [ 22,340,357–360 ]   CuO  belongs  to  the  monoclinic  crystal structure with space group of C2/c. Verrelli et al. [ 361 ]  ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  a  CuO-MCMB  (1:1  ratio)  composite anode with a high voltage LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cathode. Before  fabricating the LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /CuO-MCMB cell, the anode was  pre-treated/cycled in half-cell conﬁ guration (Li/CuO-MCMB) to  overcome the ICL issue. On the other hand, the ICL observed  when  paired  with  high  voltage  cathodes  cannot  be  ruled  out  in  full-cell  assembly.  The  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /CuO-MCMB  cell  displayed  excellent  electrochemical  proﬁ les  in  terms  of  higher  operating potential (≈4 V) and cycleability (no fade was observed  for 100 cycles). Even under harsh conditions (5 C where 1 C =  148  mA  g −1 ),  the  full-cell  as  capable  of  delivering  a  reversible  capacity  over  100  mAh  g −1   (based  on  cathode  mass  loading).  The same group of authors reported the performance of CuOMCMB  composite  anodes  with  spinel  Li 0.85 Ni 0.46 Cu 0.1 Mn 1.49 O 4   cathodes  in  the  presence  of  1   M   LiPF 6   in  PC  solution  rather  than  conventional  1   M   LiPF 6   in  EC:DMC. [ 362 ]   As  expected,  the  Li 0.85 Ni 0.46 Cu 0.1 Mn 1.49 O 4 /CuO-MCMB  cell  delivered  good cycleability  and  reversibility  at  ≈3.6  V  ( Figure     19  ).  Zhang  et al. [ 363 ]  reported the performance of CuO grown over Cu foil  as an anode with a high voltage LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cathode without  any pre-lithiation process in the NL conﬁ guration. Good cycleability (≈84% capacity retention after 100 cycles at current density of 337 mA g −1 ) was observed with initial reversible capacity  of ≈516 mAh g −1 .   

 It is well known that Mn-based materials are attractive as electrode  materials  for  LIB  applications  by  virtue  of  their  abundance,  low  cost,  and  eco-friendliness. [ 364 ]   The  binary  metal  oxide,  MnO,  undergoes  a  metallic  reduction  (Mn 0 )  according  to  the  conversion  reaction  mechanism  MnO  +  2Li  +  2e −   ↔  Mn 0   +  Li 2 O,  with  a  corresponding  theoretical  capacity  of  ≈756 mAh g −1 . In addition, MnO has much lower redox potential ≈0.5 V vs. Li than rest of the binary and ternary metal oxide  that  have  been  investigated  for  LIB  applications. [ 22 ]   The  lower  redox potential and higher theoretical capacity are certainly beneﬁ cial for the development of high energy density Li-ion power  packs.  However,  inherent  electronic  conductivity  and  large  volume  variation  during  the  conversion  reaction  are  the  main  issues  for  these  materials.  Therefore,  either  carbon  coating  or  making composites with MnO were attempted to overcome the  issues  and  thereby  improve  the  electrochemical  activity.  Chae  et  al. [ 365 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  fabrication  of  a  full-cell  assembly  with  a  MnO  x  -C  composites  as  anode  and  LiMn 2 O 4   as  the  cathode. Prior to the full-cell assembly, the MnO  x  -C composite  was  pre-treated  with  Li  to  overcome  the  ICL  observed  in  ﬁ rst  cycle. The LiMn 2 O 4 /MnO  x  -C cell delivered a reversible capacity  of  ≈105  mAh  g −1   (with  respect  to  cathode  mass  loading)  at cycleability  for  the  investigated  300  cycles  without  noticeable  fade upon cycling.   

 Similar to MnO, Mn 2 O 3  also showed a lower operating potential  vs. Li with a theoretical capacity of ≈1018 mAh g −1  for six electron reaction. Metallic reduction  (Mn 0 ) is also possible for the  Mn (III) oxide according to the multi-step reaction described by  Fang et al. [ 367 ]  as follows:

 Several  works  have  been  reported  for  this  material,  however  a  huge  ICL,  i.e.,  over  50%  loss  in  ﬁ rst  cycle,  is  the  main  issue  for  this  Mn 2 O 3   via  the  conversion  pathway,  irrespective  of  the  synthesis  procedures  and  morphology. [ 364 ]   It  is  noteworthy that various Mn-based binary oxides (MnO, Mn 2 O 3 , and  Mn 3 O 4 ) have been evaluated as conversion type anodes, but the  cycleable  redox  reaction  were  found  in  MnO  and  its  reactivity  is  only  with  Li  (MnO  +  2Li +   +  2e −   ↔  Mn 0   +  Li 2 O). [ 367 ] .  Wang  et  al. [ 368 ]   reported  the  synthesis  of  Mn 2 O 3   nanowires  using  a  two-step  hydrothermal  approach,followed  by  a  solid-state  reaction.  In  the  half-cell  assembly,  Mn 2 O 3   nanowires  displayed  an  initial reversible capacity of 502 mA h g −1  at a current density  of 100 mA g −1 . Prior to the full-cell fabrication, the Mn 2 O 3  was  cycled  for  three  cycles  in  the  half-cell  assembly  to  avoid  the  ICL.  LiMn 2 O 4 /Mn 2 O 3   cell  delivered  the  discharge  capacity  of  ≈99 mAh g −1  with an operating potential of ≈3 V. Furthermore,  a good cycling proﬁ le was evident for 40 cycles in both ﬂ at and  folded pouch cells ( Figure    21  ).   

 Co-based  materials  are  one  of  the  important  materials  of  interest  for  LIBs  and  include  the  layered  cathode,  LiCoO 2 . [ 15 ]   Although favorable electrochemical properties are noted for the  Co-based  compounds,  toxicity  and  high  cost  cannot  be  ruled  out.  Co-based  binary  metal  oxide,  CoO,  is  one  of  the  widely  investigated anode materials for LIB applications that showed a  theoretical capacity of ≈715 mAh g −1  for two electron reactions  and  is  composed  of  a  rock  salt  type  structure.  The  conversion  mechanism can be described as follows

 Tarascon and co-workers  [ 369,370 ]  ﬁ rst reported the fabrication  of CoO anode based cells with either layered LiCoO 2  or spinel  Li  1+x  Mn 2 O 4  cathodes. Interestingly the CoO electrodes exhibited 0.2 C rate with a working potential and energy density of ≈3.5 V  and  350  Wh  kg −1 ,  respectively.  Furthermore,  excellent  cycleability  was  observed  for  LiMn 2 O 4 /MnO  x  -C  cells  for  about  195  cycles  without  any  signiﬁ cant  fade  ( Figure     20  ).  Olive-shaped  MnO  nanostructures  were  prepared  by  the  decomposition  of  MnCO 3   in  Ar  atmosphere  and  they  were  subsequently  paired  with  high  voltage  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  δ    cathodes. [ 366 ]   The  full-cell  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  δ  /MnO delivered a maximum energy density of  ≈390 Wh kg −1  at 0.1 C (1 C = 148 mA g −1 ) and showed excellent much higher reversible capacity than the theoretical limitations  in  half-cell  assembly,  which  was  widely  accepted  because  of  the  contribution  from  interfacial  storage.  A  maximum  reversible capacity of ≈950 mAh g −1  was reported for the Li/CoO cell.  Except  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle,  the  LiCoO 2 /CoO  cell  displayed  excellent cycleability for 80 cycles with a working potential of ≈2 V.  100%  reversibility  was  noted  for  ﬁ rst  50  cycles  and  thereafter  fading  was  observed,  which  was  a  replica  of  the  half-cell  performance of CoO. Here, the main issue was the excess loading  of  LiCoO 2 ,  which  simultaneously  diluted  the  energy  density  of  the  LIB.  Thus,  the  authors  attempted  to  avoid  such  excess  loading  by  using  a  Li-rich  spinel  Li 1.3 Mn 2 O 4   cathode  and  the  presence of excess Li in ≈3 V vs. Li region was expected to compensate  the  ICL.  Accordingly,  the  CoO/Li 1.3 Mn 2 O 4   assembly  displayed  much  better  performance  than  the  normal  spinel  (CoO/LiMn 2 O 4 )  conﬁ guration  in  the  view  of  reversibility,  for  instance, a reversible capacity of ≈110 and ≈90 mAh g −1  (based  on  cathode  mass  loading)  was  observed  for  the  former  and  latter  conﬁ gurations,  respectively.  Except  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle,  the  Li-rich spinel cathode acted as the normal spinel in the subsequent cycles. However, coupling of CoO anode with LiCoO 2  or  Li  1+x  Mn 2 O 4  cathode resulted in a working potential of more or  less 2 V ( Figure    22  ).  

 Cobalt  (II,  III)  oxide  (CoO.Co 2 O 3 )  is  a  perfect  example  for  normal spinel structure, where Co 2+  ions occupy the tetrahedral  sites  and  octahedral  sites  are  ﬁ lled  with  Co 3+   ions.  The  spinel  Co 3 O 4   has  been  extensively  investigated  for  the  LIB  anode  point of view because of its easy synthesis procedure and high  reversible capacity. [ 340,371 ]  Similar to CoO, Co 3 O 4  also undergoes  the redox reaction for the eight electron reaction with a corresponding theoretical capacity of ≈890 mAh g −1  according to the  following mechanism

 The  Tarascon  and  co-workers [ 370 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  performance  of  Co 3 O 4   in  a  full-cell  assembly  with  layered  type  LiCoO 2 .  In  the  half-cell  assembly,  the  anode  was  capable  of  delivering  a  reversible  capacity  of  >900  mAh  g −1   irrespective  of  both  ambient  and  elevated  temperature  (55  °C)  conditions.  An excess loading of LiCoO 2  was used in order to overcome the  ICL issues. Therefore, based on the electrochemical proﬁ les of  individual  electrodes,  the  mass  ratio  between  the  anode  and  cathode  was  adjusted  to  1:8.4.  The  full-cell  LiCoO 2 /Co 3 O 4   was  capable  of  delivering  the  reversible  capacity  of  ≈120  mAh  g −1   (with respect to cathode loading) at a 0.2 C rate under ambient  conditions with a working potential of 2 V. The same capacity  proﬁ les  were  observed  under  elevated  conditions  with  different current densities (0.1 C and 0.2 C). The cycling trend of  LiCoO 2 /Co 3 O 4  cell was a replica of the performance of Co 3 O 4  in  the half-cell assembly (Li/Co 3 O 4 ).  

 Sulﬁ de based electrode materials have an advantage over oxide  based materials for LIB applications in terms of safety. Similar  to binary and ternary metal oxides, research has been reported  on  the  possibilities  of  using  them  in  LIB  applications. [ 330,372 ]   Transition metal monosulﬁ des (MS, where M = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co,  and Ni) are found impressive because of their favorable electrochemical  properties.  The  mentioned  monosulﬁ des  undergo  a  displacement  reaction  (except  TiS)  according  to  the  following  equilibrium, MS + Li +  + e −  ↔ M 0  + Li 2 S. The conversion reaction for TiS occurs at negative Fermi energy of the Li. However,  the metal formation of V 0  and Ti 0  via conversion reaction is still  a debate. It is interesting to note that for metal monosulﬁ des,  an  increase  in  the  atomic  number  results  in  the  increase  in  redox potential. FeS is found to be more interesting because of  its very ﬂ at operating potential (≈1.4 V vs. Li), high theoretical 


 MoS 2  is a layered structured dichalcogenide that shows similar  appearance to that of a conventional graphitic anode. MoS 2  is a  diamagnetic semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV.  Initially, similar to TiS 2 , MoS 2  was also investigated as insertion  electrode  for  LIB  applications  with  an  insertion  potential  and  theoretical capacity of ≈1.1 V vs. Li and ≈167 mAh g −1 , respectively. [ 330,375,376 ]   The  insertion  reaction  is  highly  reversible  and  the mechanism can be schematically represented as follows

 The  reversible  capacity  and  ﬂ at  operating  potential  was  found to be inferior to TiS 2 , and therefore less research activity  was  carried  out  for  this  material.  The  conversion  mechanism  has  been  successfully  used  for  the  metal  oxides  and  the  same  strategy  has  been  extended  for  sulﬁ des  as  well.  Among  the  sulﬁ des  investigated,  MoS 2   is  appealing  because  of  its  high  theoretical  capacity  (≈670  mAh  g −1 )  for  four  electron  reaction  during deep cycling according to the following mechanisms capacity  (≈610  mAh  g −1 )  and  eco-friendliness. [ 373 ]   The  higher  redox  potential  certainly  avoids  the  electrolyte  decomposition,  which  results  in  less  ICL  for  during  the  displacement  reaction (no need for deep cycling). In addition, the observed redox  potential  for  FeS  is  found  to  be  much  lower  (≈0.15  V  vs.  Li)  than  the  well-established  insertion  type  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   with  high  reversibility.  However,  the  electrochemical  stability  of  FeS  is  another issue upon cycling. The deep cycling not only results in  the higher ICL, it also leads to the disappearance of the prominent ≈1.4 V  vs . V plateau. Wang et al. [ 374 ]  reported the synthesis  of  FeS  nanostructures  by  a  hydrothermal  approach  with  and  without  TiO 2   modiﬁ cation.No  prominent  ﬂ at  potentials  are  noted, but the TiO 2  modiﬁ ed FeS showed a reversible capacity  of  ≈430  mAh  g −1   after  500  cycles.  The  Li-ion  cells  were  fabricated  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode.  A  high  ICL  of  ≈125  mAh  g −1   was observed at a current density of 100 mA g −1  under ambient  temperature conditions in LiMn 2 O 4 /TiO 2 -FeS cell. The test cell  delivered a reversible capacity of ≈350 mAh g −1  (at 100 mA g −1 )  and was capable of delivering >150 mAh g −1  at a current density  of 1500 mA g −1 .  

 Interestingly, a very small ICL was only observed for the case  of  MoS 2   compared  to  metal  oxides  in  the  half-cell  assembly.  Similar to oxides, MoS 2  also suffers a lack of cycleability because  of  the  volume  variation  upon  redox  reaction.  Therefore,  most  of  the  work  has  been  reported  with  carbonaceous  materials  in  the  half-cell  assembly  and  this  has  been  clearly  described  in  recent  review  by  Stephenson  et  al. [ 375 ]   In  addition,  a  much  higher reversible capacity than theoretical capacity was reported  by  the  researchers,  with  speculation  that  the  excess  capacity  was obtained from the interfacial storage. Hwang et al. [ 377 ]  synthesized  disordered  graphene-like  MoS 2   nanoplates  using  a  hydrothermal  approach  and  delivered  a  reversible  capacity  of  917  mAh  g −1   in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle  with  a  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  of  87%  in  a  half-cell  assembly.  Furthermore,  ≈98%  capacity  was  retained  after  50  cycles  at  a  current  density  of  1062  mA  g −1 .  Full-cell  LiCoO 2 /MoS 2   was  fabricated  with  a  layered  type  LiCoO 2  cathode and the electrochemical performance at a high  current rate of 1062 mA g −1  was investigated. The cell delivered  an  initial  reversible  capacity  of  114  mAh  g −1   with  retention  of  ≈89%  capacity  after  60  cycles  ( Figure     23  ).  MoS 2   nanoﬂ akes  grown over carbon cloth were also reported by Yu et al. [ 378 ]  and  appreciable areal capacity was noted for such a composite. The  full-cell LiCoO 2 /MoS 2  over carbon cloth was also demonstrated  to power light-emitting diodes (LEDs).    

 Simply,  an  alloy  is  described  as  a  mixture  of  two  or  more  elements. In LIBs, such alloying reactions are feasible in reversible

manner  for  wide  range  of  semi-metal  or  metallic  compounds  (or  elements)  in  the  presence  of  aprotic  organic  solvents. [ 379 ]   The  spontaneously  formed  alloys  during  electrochemical  reaction  with  metallic  Li  are  same  as  those  of  metallurgically  prepared ones and few exceptional cases also exist, for example  Li 15 Si 4 . [ 21,379,380 ]   Numerous  original  and  review  articles  have  described  the  potential  importance  of  such  anodes  and  their  necessity  for  the  development  for  high  energy  LIB  applications. [ 3,22,24,380–396 ] . Moreover, Sony (Sn-Co-Ti-C) and Panasonic  (Si)  companies  have  already  commercialized  such  alloy-based  anodes  in  high  power  Li-ion  packs  for  consumer  applications.  The  reason  behind  the  research  activities  on  such  alloy-based  anodes  are  their  high  theoretical  capacity  and  lower  working  potential  (except  graphite)  compared  to  the  insertion  and  displacement  type  anodes,  especially  for  group  IV  elements  (Si,  Ge,  Pb  and  Sn). [ 397 ]   Several  binary  and  ternary  metal  oxides,  including  ZnO,  SnO  x  ,  Sb 2 O 3 ,  ZnFe 2 O 4   etc.,  also  undergo 

conversion reactions upon charge-discharge processes, in addition to the alloying reaction at a lower working potential. As a  result,  the  theoretical  capacity  has  been  elevated  compared  to  pure metals. On the other hand, the main issue for such anodes  is  associated  with  their  huge  volume  variation  upon  lithiation  and de-lithiation, in addition to the very high ICL observed in  ﬁ rst  cycle.  This  severely  affects  the  electrochemical  proﬁ les  of  such  anodes  and  also  cracks  and  detaches  the  active  particles  (i.e.,  pulverization  of  the  electro-active  particulates)  from  the  current  collector. [ 22 ]   Therefore,  carbon  coating  or  composites  with  carbonaceous  materials  or  prepared  with  either  active  or  inactive  matrix  elements  to  sustain  the  volume  variation  were  proposed.  However,  ICL  remains  an  issue  for  such  anodes.  In  the  recent  past,  a  pre-treating  procedure  was  successfully  adopted  for  the  case  of  conversion  type  anodes  and  the  same  strategy can also be extended for these alloy type anodes during  the  fabrication  of  Li-ion  power  packs.  Unstable  SEI  formation 

over  active  material  is  another  important  issue  that  in  turn  provides a continuous reaction of active particles with the electrolyte  counterpart  and  forms  a  very  thick  layer  upon  cycling  resulting  in  an  increase  in  cell  resistance. [ 20 ]   It  is  well  understood  that  the  SEI  formed  over  alloy  anodes  is  in  contrast  to  that formed in conventional graphitic anodes. In addition, the  SEI  formed  in  alloy  type  anodes  seems  to  be  a  dynamic  process of breaking off and reforming because of the unavoidable  volume variation upon alloying/de-alloying process. [ 382 ]  Because  of  the  mentioned  setbacks,  limited  reports  are  available  for  such  fascinating  anodes  in  full-cell  assemblies  and  these  are  discussed in the next sections. 

 Silicon  is  one  of  the  very  important  Group  IV  elements  and  is  extensively  studied  as  a  potential  candidate  to  replace  the  conventional  graphitic  anode  because  of  its  lower  working  potential,  high  volumetric  (≈9786  mAh  cm −3 )  and  gravimetric  capacities (≈3579 mAh g −1 ), and its abundance on earth’s crust.  Interestingly, the theoretical capacity (Li 15 Si 4 ) is closer to that of  metallic Li (≈3862 mAh g −1 ) and, therefore, extensive research 

activities  have  been  carried  out. [ 383,388,398–402 ]   The  main  issue  for this material is the poor reversibility upon cycling because  of  the  huge  volume  variation  during  lithiation  and  de-lithiation  processes  (434%  for  amorphous  and  399%  for  crystalline  Si), [ 397 ]  which results in the detachment of active particles from  the substrate. [ 403 ]  As a consequence, a dramatic capacity fading  is observed. Other issues such as the ICL observed in the ﬁ rst  cycle and the unstable SEI formation upon cycling are not to be  ruled out. [ 387,404 ]  The main cause of the volume variation is its  reaction with Li. [ 383 ]  

 The  two-phase  reaction  is  observed  in  all  the  stages  of  the  ﬁ rst  discharge  and  completely  vanishes  once  it  reaches  the  binary  Li 15 Si 4   alloy  formation;  single  phase  reaction  only  resulted  with  subsequent  cycles. [ 388,405 ]   Electrochemical  aggregation  of  particles  was  observed  because  of  the  welding  effect  during the charge process (i.e., pressure induced from the enormous  amount  of  volume  expansion/contradiction)  not  ruled  out for the capacity fade. [ 406 ]  Undoubtedly, Si-based active materials  should  be  either  prepared  with  a  carbonaceous  matrix  or  synthesized with active/inactive matrix elements to uphold the  volume variation before formulating the electrodes. Utilization  of hollow structured materials is more preferable, and can sustain certain amounts of variation. [ 407 ]  The use of various binders  (CMC, polyacrylic acid (PAA), teﬂ onized acetylene black (TAB),  etc.) and additives to form a the stable SEI to improve the cycleability  also  been  reported;such  binders  enable  self-heating. [ 408 ]   As  a  consequence,  binders  also  contribute  to  upholding  the  volume variation upon alloying/de-alloying.Much research into  the  synthesis  of  Si  nanostructures  with  various  morphologies  has  been  reported,  but  unfortunately  few  of  them  were  only  explored  in  practical  conﬁ guration.  Si-based  materials  are  the  only extensively studied anodes for practical LIB conﬁ gurations  among  the  alloy-type  materials.  However,  the  electrochemical  proﬁ les are different for thin ﬁ lms and powders and, similarly,  for amorphous and crystalline Si. 

 Lee  et  al. [ 409 ]   ﬁ rst  reported  the  successful  fabrication  of  a  full-cell  assembly  with  a  LiMn 2 O 4   cathode  prepared  by  radio  frequency  (RF)  magnetron  sputtering.  The  sputtered  Si  anode  exhibited much better cycleability and reversibility in PC-based  solution  than  EC:DMC.  Furthermore,  the  authors  attempted  to  overcome  the  ICL  by  cycling  the  Si  anode  in  the  half-cell  assembly  for  ﬁ ve  cycles  and  subsequently  paired  it  with  a  spinel  cathode,  LiMn 2 O 4 .  The  pre-lithiated  Si  anode  displayed  much  better  cycleability  than  the  untreated  Si  anode  in  a  fullcell assembly. Under the optimized conditions, the LiMn 2 O 4 /Si  cell maintained a reversible capacity of 16 µAh cm −2  µm −1  compared to its initial reversible capacity of 24 µAh cm −2  µm −1  after  100 cycles. Amorphous Si is believed to be as efﬁ cient as and a  better candidate than its crystalline state. Baranchukov et al. [ 410 ]   reported  the  preparation  of  amorphous  Si  by  direct  current  (DC)  magnetron  sputtering  and  fabricated  the  full-cell  with  LiCoO 2  (60% excess relative to Si) in the presence of 1 M LiTFSI  in  1-methyl-1-propylpiperidinium  bis(triﬂ uoromethylsufonyl)  imide  (MPPpTFSI)  ionic  liquid.  As  expected,  a  large  ICL  of  ≈1000  mAh  g −1   was  noted  with  a  reversible  capacity  of 

≈2500  mAh  g −1 .  However,  a  drastic  fade  was  noted  for  the  LiCoO 2 /Si cell upon cycling and it showed a reversible capacity  of ≈1200 mAh g −1  within 32 cycles. Yang et al. [ 411 ]  reported the  exceptional  performance  of  a  DC  magnetron  sputtered  amorphous Si anode with a layered LiCoO 2  cathode. The LiCoO 2 /Si  cell  displayed  a  very  stable  cycleability  of  over  300  cycles  with  loss of only 0.01% per cycle and good capacity retention properties at high current rates were also noted. Electron beam deposited  amorphous  Si  also  showed  similar  stability  when  paired  with a LiCoO 2  cathode over 200 cycles. [ 412 ]  Similar stability was  reported  for  spinel  LiMn 2 O 4 /amorphous  Si  by  a  low  pressure  chemical  vapor  deposition  (LPCVD)  process  for  400  cycles  in  the presence of 1 M LiClO 4  in PC. [ 413 ]  On the other hand, there  is no such stability when coupled with LiFePO 4  and amorphous  Si  prepared  by  RF  magnetron  sputtering. [ 414 ]   The  authors  employed Ni as the under layer between Si and the Cu current  collector,  but  the  capacity  fading  was  found  to  be  very  severe  compared  with  the  LiCoO 2   and  LiMn 2 O 4   cathodes.  Recently,  exceptional  performance  of  columnar  Si  thin  ﬁ lm  anodes  was  clearly seen when coupled with a traditional TiS 2  cathode in the  presence of 1 M LiPF 6  in ﬂ uoro ethylene carbonate (FEC):DMC  (1:4). [ 415 ]  The anode was pre-lithiated to ensure the Li 15 Si 5  phase  before conducting the full-cell assembly with TiS 2 . The full-cell  TiS 2 /lithiated Si cell showed a capacity of ≈240 mAh g −1  and displayed a very stable capacity for 300 cycles. The observed reversibility and cycleability were a replica of the performance of the  TiS 2  electrodes in the half-cell assembly, except for the 250 mV  reduction  in  the  operating  potential.  This  outstanding  performance  was  due  to  the  stable  SEI  formation  over  Si  electrodes  upon cycling, which predominantly contains the polyenes, LiF, 

and  dominance  of  Li  x  PO  y  F  z    species  compared  to  Li  x  PF  y    while  using the standard solutions. [ 416 ]  To ensure the favorable properties  of  FEC-based  solutions  in  Si  anodes,  the  same  group  of  authors  used  the  same  strategy  in  high  voltage  and  high  capacity conﬁ gurations, i.e., LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  and  x Li 2 MnO 3 .(1– x ) LiNi  y  Mn  z  Co 1  y     z  O 2 . [ 11,416–418 ]  ( Figure   24 ). A similar electrochemical stability was observed for the Si anodes with the aforementioned cathode, for instance ≈74.2 (after 500 cycles) and ≈89%  (after  200  cycles)  capacity  was  retained  for  a  Si  anode  coupled  with  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   and   x Li 2 MnO 3 .(1– x )LiNi  y  Mn  z  Co 1  y     z  O 2   cathodes, respectively. 

 The  Si-C  composite  prepared  by  pyrolysis  with  polyvinylchloride (PVC) and successive high energy mechanical milling  and  showed  stable  electrochemical  proﬁ les  >950  mAh  g −1 . [ 419 ]   The  full-cell  with  layered  LiCo 0.2 Ni 0.8 O 2   displayed  a  reversible  capacity  of  over  600  mAh  g −1   with  a  working  potential  of  ≈3.5  V.  However,  no  cycleability  was  reported  for  the  mentioned  conﬁ guration.  Park  et  al. [ 420 ]   reported  the  fabrication  of  LIBs  with  carbon-coated  Si  nanotubes  anodes  and  layered  LiCoO 2   cathodes.  The  test  cell  delivered  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈3247  mAh  g −1   with  a  high  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  of  ≈89%.  Furthermore, excellent cycleability over 200 cycles was reported  with  a  retention  of  ≈89%  of  the  initial  reversible  capacity.  In  addition,  the  observed  capacity  of  the  LiCoO 2 /Si  cell  after  200  cycles  was  10  times  higher  than  graphite-based  LIBs  and  displayed high reversibility of >3000 mAh g −1 , even at rates of 5 C  and 2 C (1 C = 3 A g −1 ). Cui et al. [ 421 ]  proposed the concept of  fabricating core-shell structured carbon-Si nanowires to uphold  the  volume  variation.  Usually  Si  is  in  the  core  and  carbon  is  in the shells, whereas in the present case, they were reversed. 

Amorphous  Si  was  prepared  over  the  carbon  nanoﬁ bers  and  evaluated  as  a  possible  anode.  It  displayed  a  stable  reversible  capacity  of  ≈2000  mAh  g −1   for  about  30  cycles.  In  the  fullcell  assembly  with  a  LiCoO 2   core-shell,  carbon-Si  nanowires  showed  good  capacity  retention  characteristics  (≈80%  after  30  cycles) and reversibility (≈1400 mAh g −1 ). Similarly, Si nanowires  over  carbon  textiles  were  also  reported  as  free-standing  electrodes with a reversible capacity of over ≈1600 mAh g −1  and  compatibility at various temperatures (10–45 °C) conditions and  bending states were reported. [ 422 ]  Forney et al. [ 423 ]  attempted to  deposit  the  Si  nanostructures  over  SWCNTs  using  a  plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process with low  (≈26%), medium (≈53%), and high (≈68%) loadings. The higher  loading  leads  to  a  severe  capacity  fading  upon  cycling  in  both  the  half-cell  and  full-cell  assemblies  (with  LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Al 0.1 O 2   as the cathode). However, very stable cycling proﬁ les are noted  for medium and low level Si loadings for the investigated 100  cycles  with  targeted  40%  of  the  depth  of  discharge  (DOD).  It  is strongly believed that the presence of carbonaceous material  upholds the volume variation during lithiation and de-lithiation  processes, nevertheless a stainless steel ﬁ bril mat was also used  for the same propose. In this scenario, Song et al. [ 424 ]  reported  the preparation of a binder-free Si deposited metal ﬁ bril mat as  a promising anode with good cycleability (≈2000 mAh g −1  in the  half-cell). Notable electrochemical proﬁ les were observed when  coupled with a LiFePO 4  cathode and it retained ≈76% of initial  capacity (≈1300 mAh g −1 ) after 50 cycles. Ultralong cycleability  (750  cycles)  was  observed  for  a  Si-carbon  composite  internally  wired with graphene nanosheets paired with Ni-rich layered full  concentration  gradient  cathode  (Li.[Ni 0.75 Co 0.1 Mn 0.15 ]O 2 ). [ 425 ]   The full-cell retained ≈88.4% of initial capacity after 750 cycles,  i.e., the loss of 0.016% capacity per cycle (Figure  24 ). Similarly,  cycling  stability  was  observed  in  a  Si-nanoparticle  backboned  graphene composite for 1000 cycles with almost 100% capacity  retention  and  a  reversibility  of ≈1000  mAh  g −1   in  the  half-cell  assembly. [ 426 ]   A  full-cell  with  a  LiCoO 2   cathode  was  capable  of  delivering the high reversibility at high currents (5, 10, 15 and  20 C rates), for instance ≈90 mAh g −1  (based on cathode mass)  was observed at 20 C with good capacity retention characteristics. Multi-layered Si and graphene structures (ﬁ ve layers) were  prepared using PECVD and an anodic aluminium oxide (AAO)  template  approach,  respectively,  and  these  were  subsequently  evaluated  as  an  anode. [ 427 ]   The  full-cell  composed  of  a  layered  LiNi 1/3 Mn 1/3 Co 1/3 O 2   as  cathode  and  multi-layered  Si-graphene  structure  as  the  anode  showed  a  poor  cycleability  of  ≈70.4%  retention within 15 cycles. Surface modiﬁ cation was one of the  efﬁ cient  approaches  to  suppress  the  unwanted  side  reaction  with electrolyte counterpart and it was effectively adopted for a  Si-graphene composite via atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Al 2 O 3   coating).Enhanced cycleability was observed for such an Al 2 O 3 modiﬁ ed  Si-graphene  composite  compared  to  an  unmodiﬁ ed  one in a half-cell assembly, but severe fading upon cycling was  experienced  when  it  was  paired  with  a  Li-rich  layered-layered  cathode (Li 1.2 Ni 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2 ). [ 408 ]  This fading was mainly because  of  the  excess  Li-removal  during  the  ﬁ rst  charge  process.  The  inﬂ uence  of  the  thickness  of  the  native  oxide  (SiO  x  )  on  the  electrochemical proﬁ les of the Si anode was studied and it was  found  that  increasing  the  SiO  x    thickness  (2–15  nm)  results  in  enhanced capacity retention; however the dilution of reversible 

capacity is inevitable. [ 428 ]  It is well known that, the SiO  x   is also  electrochemically  active  and  it  contributes  a  small  amount  of  capacity.  As  expected,  the  SiO  x    modiﬁ ed  Si  was  paired  with  LiCoO 2  and showed capacity retentions of ≈67 and ≈48% after  130  cycles  with  coating  thicknesses  of  ≈7  and  ≈2  nm,  respectively.  The  mentioned  coating  was  certainly  beneﬁ cial  for  the  nanowire  thickness  of  <100  nm,  but  if  it  exceeds  that  size,  it  is  not  possible  for  such  a  metal  oxide  coating  to  suppress  the  volume  variation.  Similarly,  a  Sb-doped  tin  oxide  coating  over  both the anode (Si) and the cathode (LiCoO 2 ) was suggested by  Lee  et  al. [ 429 ]   to  realize  the  ultrahigh  energy  density  of  a  LIB.  Apart from the prevention of side reactions with the electrolyte,  the  coating  increases  the  electronic  conductivity  of  both  electrodes to an order of magnitude higher than the native phases.  As  a  result,  excellent  cycleability  was  noted  for  the  LiCoO 2 /Si  cells  composed  of  surface-modiﬁ ed  electrodes  compared  to  a  bare LiCoO 2 /Si cell. Choi et al. [ 430 ]  performed a metallo-thermic  reduction  process  to  prepare  a  shape-preserving  macro-/nanoporous Si particulate via alumino-thermic and subsequent magnesio-thermic  reaction  of  porous  silica  particles  with  various  concentrations.Si/Al 2 O 3   with  7:3  was  found  to  be  more  stable  in  the  half-cell  assembly,  but  experienced  severe  fading  when  paired with LiCoO 2 . SnC 2 O 4  modiﬁ cation over the Si anode as  also reported and it is well known that SnC 2 O 4  is also electrochemically  active,  similar  to  SiO  x    and  Sb-doped  tin  oxide. [ 431 ]   Introduction  of  SnC 2 O 4   certainly  improves  the  cycling  proﬁ les,  however  an  increase  in  SnC 2 O 4   concentration  leads  to  a  decrease  in  reversible  capacity.  Si-70%SnC 2 O 4   was  found  to  have  an  optimum  concentration  to  yield  a  high  performance  anode. The full-cell was fabricated with a LiFePO 4  cathode; nevertheless, prior to the cell assembly the anode was cycled in a  half-cell assembly to overcome the ICL. A very stable capacity of  ≈140 mAh g −1  was noted for the reported 200 cycles without any  noticeable fade. In addition, the cell was capable of displaying  a  similar  stability  independent  of  the  working  environment,  including  under  sub-zero  (–20  and  –5 °C)  and  elevated  conditions  (60  °C).  There  was  no  smoke  or  ﬂ ame  observed  during  the  nail  penetration  or  the  over  charge  tests.  Core-shell  Si@ SiO  x    nanowires  over  carbon  textiles  are  reported  as  substrate  free anodes for the fabrication of high energy density LIBs with  LiCoO 2  cathodes. [ 432 ]  The full-cell LiCoO 2 /Si@SiO  x   was capable  of  displaying  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈1949  mAh  g −1   at  a  current density of 2 A g −1  and upheld ≈93.4% of the initial capacity  after 50 cycles. 

 Flexible and bendable electronics are one of the fast growing  frontier  areas  of  research.  In  order  to  power  such  miniature  electronic  appliances,  the  fabrication  of  Li-ion  power  packs  is  warranted  and  Si-based  materials  are  found  to  be  promising  for use as the anodes. Such LIBs with fast charging capabilities  are reported for Si nanoparticle decorated expandable graphite  anodes  and  V 2 O 5   modiﬁ ed  LiNi 0.75 Co 0.11 Mn 0.14 O 2   cathodes. [ 433 ]   Before  conducting  the  fabrication  of  an  assembly,  honeycomb  patterned  Al  and  Cu  current  collectors  are  prepared  using  a  reactive-ion etching process. The full-cell displayed a maximum  reversible  capacity  of  ≈185  mAh  g −1   at  0.1  C,  was  capable  of  delivering  a  good  reversibility  at  12  C  rate  (1  C  =  15.6  mAh),  and  retained  ≈50%  of  its  initial  capacity  after  600  cycles.  Insitu bending studies were also conducted at a speed of 30 mm  min −1  with a simultaneously applied torque of 11 N to ensure 


the  similar  electrochemical  proﬁ les.  Similarly,  nanohair  structured  Cu  current  collectors  were  patterned  with  thermal  evaporation  over  polyimide  and  were  subsequently  deposited  by  Si. [ 434 ]  An outstanding electrochemical proﬁ le of ≈2775 mAh g −1   (at  0.05  C)  was  reported  for  such  a  unique  structure  in  the  half-cell  assembly  and  for  high  currents  as  well.  A  full-cell  was  fabricated  with  LiNiCoAlO 2   oxide  with  working  potential  of  ≈3.74  V.  The  nanohair  structured  electrode  containing  cell  delivered  favorable  electrochemical  properties  compared  to  the  planner  substrate.  Furthermore,  the  mechanical  stability  of  the  mentioned  cells  was  evaluated  against  bending  fatigue  and the working potential of the nanohair electrode composed  cell  remained  constant  for  3000  bending  cycles  compared  to  planner electrodes. Vlad et al. [ 435 ]  also reported a rolled up LIB  composed of Si core @Cu shell  nanostructures as the anode with a  layered LiCoO 2  cathode. 

 Apart from the pure Si nanostructures in thin ﬁ lm or powder  form,  electro-active  Si  with  either  active  or  inactive  materials  are  also  equally  important.  A  multilayer  Si-Ge  thin  ﬁ lms  and  composites were prepared using RF magnetron sputtering for  various compositions. [ 436 ]  Among these, Si 0.84 Ge 0.16  composites  showed  better  reversibility  and  cycleability  in  half-cell  assemblies.  The  composite  anode  Si 0.84 Ge 0.16 ,  paired  with  LiCoO 2 ,  displayed  an  initial  reversible  capacity  of  213  mAh  g −1   with  a  retention rate of 52.4% after 100 cycles. 

 Silicon monoxide (SiO) is considered to be a promising substitute  for  the  fascinating  Si  anode,  andis  expected  to  sustain  the  volume  variation  observed  during  lithiation/de-lithiation  process.  SiO  undergoes  structural  destruction  upon  the  ﬁ rst  discharge process according to the following reaction [ 437,438 ] 

 The cycleability of SiO is found to be superior compared to  its  metallic  form  (Si).  Zeng  et  al. [ 439 ]   attempted  to  fabricate  a  non-ﬂ ammable  LIB  using  a  DMMP-based  electrolyte  solution  (0.8  M  LiPF 6   in  DMMP)  in  the  presence  of  FEC  additive  (10%  by  vol.).  In  this  NL  design,  an  excess  of  LiFePO 4   was  used to overcome the ICL issue observed in carbon-coated-SiO  anodes.  An  excellent  cycleability  was  seen  for  both  the  anode  and  the  cathode  in  the  half-cell  assembly,  but  a  capacity  fade  in  full-cell  conﬁ guration  was  observed;  for  example,  reversible  capacities  of  ≈900  and  ≈570  mAh  g −1   were  observed  for  ﬁ rst  and  50 th   cycles,  respectively.  Carbon-coated  SiO  was  prepared  using  a  thermal  evaporation  procedure  and  it  was  evaluated  as  a  promising  anode  that  has  better  cycleability  than  carboncoated Si anodes. [ 440 ]  The SiO-carbon composite showed much  better electrochemical performance than the SiO-graphite composite in the half-cell assembly and it showed reversibilities of  ≈870 and 740 mAh g −1 , for the former and latter cases, respectively.  Eventually,  the  full-cell  was  fabricated  with  a  manually  mixed cathode LiCoO 2  and LiCo 1/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2  (3:7 ratio) and  it  showed  a  practical  capacity  of  over  700  mAh  g −1   after  100  cycles.  The  capacity  retention  was  observed  to  be  over  ≈85%  after 100 cycles. The electrochemical charging process was carried by a CC-CV mode for such mixed cathodes at 4.2 V for 3 h.  A 14 500 prototype was reported with various current rates and 

temperature conditions with a retention of ≈700 mAh capacity  after  300  cycles  for  the  designed  1  Ah. [ 441 ]   The  cell  passed  the  safety proﬁ les including over charge tolerance (at 1 C charging  to  12  V),  a  nail  penetration  test,  and  heating  the  fully-charged  battery  to  150  °C  for  2  h.  A  diamond-like  carbon  coating  was  also  carried  out  over  SiO  x  -graphite  by  PECVD  to  improve  the  cycleability. [ 442 ]   A  reversible  capacity  of  ≈520  mAh  g −1   was  observed  for  both  bare  and  diamond-like  carbon-coated  composites  when  paired  with  LiCoO 2 ,  but  the  electrochemical  stability  of  the  latter  one  became  superior  compared  to  the  bare  composite.  For  instance,  the  ≈52  and  78.2%  initial  reversible  capacity  was  noted  for  bare  and  diamond-like  carbon-coated  SiO-graphite  composites  after  100  cycles,  respectively.  A  high  reversible capacity of over 1000 mAh g −1  was noted under elevated  temperature  conditions  (60  °C)  with  an  increase  in  the  upper  cut-off  potential,  i.e.,  different  working  potential  3  to  4,  4.1, and 4.2 V when paired with a layered LiNi 0.8 Co 0.15 Al 0.05 O 2   cathode. [ 443 ]   However,  drastic  fading  was  observed  for  the  potential  window  of  3  to  4.2  V,  whereas  notable  fading  was  observed for rest of the potential window. This was because the  working potential played a vital role for the stability of the cell.  However, in the present case, the poor thermal stability of the  electrolyte was responsible for the capacity fade. Liu et al. [ 444,445 ]   reported  the  performance  of  50%  SiO  x   50%  Sn-Co-C  composite  (Sn-Co-C  is  the  alloy-based  anode  developed  and  used  in  Sony's  Nexelion  batteries [ 4,446 ] )  as  a  high  capacity  anode  for  LIB applications with Li-rich cathodes such as Li 1.2 Ni 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2   and  Li 1.2 Ni 0.15 Co 0.10 Mn 0.55 O 2 .  Before  conducting  the  full-cell  assembly,  the  mentioned  composite  electrodes  were  coated  with solid lithium metallic powder (SLMP) to overcome the ICL  issue.  The  Li 1.2 Ni 0.2 Mn 0.6 O 2   or  Li 1.2 Ni 0.15 Co 0.10 Mn 0.55 O 2 /50%  SiO  x  -50%  Sn-Co-C  cell  showed  a  good  reversibility  of  ≈77.7  (after  100  cycles)  and ≈72%  (after  200  cycles)  initial  reversible  capacity for former and latter conﬁ gurations, respectively.  

 Metallic  Sn  has  been  widely  investigated  as  a  possible  anode  for LIB applications and its composite (Sn-Co-Ti-C) has already  been  commercialized  by  Sony  in  high  power  Nexelion  conﬁ gurations. [ 446 ]   This  clearly  shows  the  promising  feature  of  this  element.  Sn  showed  favorable  features  such  as  lower  reaction  potential  (≈0.3  V  vs.  Li)  and  high  theoretical  capacity  (≈993  mAh  g −1   for  the  reversible  formation  of  Li 4.4 Sn  alloy)  compared  to  the  conventional  graphitic  anodes. [ 381 ]   The  high  power  capability  of  Sn  compared  to  graphite  is  worth  mentioning.  During  the  lithiation/de-lithiation  process  Sn  undergoes  a  (alloying)  reaction  with  metallic  Li  according  to  the  following  equilibrium:  Sn  +  4.4Li +   +  4.4e −   ↔  Li 4.4 Sn.  However,  a  large  unit  cell  volume  variation  (≈259%  for  crystalline  and  ≈305%  for  amorphous). [ 397 ]   upon  alloy  formation  results  in the possible use of carbon as the matrix element to sustain  such variation without affecting its electrical conductivity. This  translates to a Sn anode in composite form with carbonaceous  material, which is found to be superior in terms of cycleability  and  high  reversible  capacity.  Apart  from  the  carbonaceous  matrix, several active and inactive matrices have also been proposed  to  sustain  such  volume  variation.  Highly  stable  cycling 

proﬁ les were observed. Accordingly, the derivatives of Sn, such  as SnO and SnO 2 , have also been explored as possible anodes  for LIBs. [ 447 ]  In addition to the mentioned alloying reaction, the  presence of oxide promotes the oxidation of de-alloyed Sn to its  native phase, i.e., SnO and SnO 2  via the conversion reactions:

 Accordingly  the  theoretical  capacity  can  be  extended  from  ≈993  mAh  g −1   for  Sn  metal  (4.4  mole  Li)  to ≈1138  and ≈1494  mAh  g −1   for  SnO  (≈6.4  mole  Li)  and  SnO 2   (≈8.4  mole  Li),  respectively.  Apart  from  the  material  choice,  the  mentioned  reaction  can  be  made  possible  by  adjusting  the  testing  potential  while  using  SnO 2   as  the  anode [ 448,449 ]   ( Figure    25 ).  Apart  from  the  commercialization  of  Sn-Co-Ti-C  composite  anodes  in  the  Nexelion  conﬁ guration  by  Sony,  Derrien  et  al. [ 450 ]   ﬁ rst  reported the possibility of using Sn-C composites with average  particle  size  of  ≈30  nm  an  the  anode  for  LIB  applications.  In  the  half-cell  assembly,  these  showed  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈497 mAh g −1 , which includes a small contribution (≈23 mAh g −1 ) 

from the carbon matrix via an insertion/extraction mechanism.  Prior to the full-cell assembly, the anode was tested for 20 cycles  and  discharged  to  0.01  V  vs.  Li  in  the  half-cell,  whereas  the  cathode  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   was  charged  to  an  open-circuit  voltage  (OCV) (≈5 V vs. Li) for the removal of Li. The LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 / Sn-C  cell  displayed  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈120  mAh  g −1   (based  on  cathode  loading)  with  very  stable  cycleability  (over  100 cycles) and efﬁ ciency (almost 100%). A marginal improvement in the electrochemical reversibility (≈120 mAh g −1 , based  on  cathode  loading)  was  noted  in  the  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Sn  conﬁ guration  when  the  metallic  Sn  anode  was  electroplated  over  Cu foil. [ 451 ]  As expected, the cell delivered a good cycling proﬁ le  for the reported 50 cycles and the same pre-treating procedure  was  adopted  for  the  fabrication  of  the  full-cell.  Furthermore,  the authors attempted to improve the safety of the high power  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Sn-C  conﬁ guration  by  using  polymer  membranes  prepared  by  conventional  (1   M   LiPF 6   in  PVdF-EC-PC)  (Figure   25  ). [ 452 ]  and electrospinning (1  M  LiPF 6 -EC-DMC in polyvinylideneﬂ uorideco -chlorotriﬂ uoroethylene  (PVdF-CTFE)) [ 453 ]   techniques.  In  both  cases,  good  reversibility,  cycleability,  and  high current performances were noted. Instead of using the resorcinol derived Sn-C composite, mechanically milled Sn-C was  also  considered  with  the  high  voltage  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   cathode  and  ensured  the  previous  reversibility  (≈120  mAh  g −1 ,  based  on  cathode  loading)  and  cycling  stability. [ 454 ]   The  performance  of  such  a  cathode  under  sub-zero  conditions  (0  to  –30  °C)  delivered  a  reasonable  capacity  proﬁ le  when  paired  with  a  Sn-C  anode,  particularly  at  –5 °C. [ 455 ]   The  Li-ion  cell  delivered 
excellent  capacity  with  a  reversibility  of  ≈105  mAh  g −1   over  200  cycles  under  sub-zero  temperature  conditions  (–5 °C).  An  attempt has also been made to evaluate the compatibility with  other high voltage conﬁ gurations such as LiNi 0.45 Co 0.1 Mn 1.45 O 4   and  similar  performance  was  observed. [ 456 ]   Fe-doped  LiCoPO 4   (LiFe  x  Co 1  x  PO 4 )  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  promising  solutions for the fabrication of high energy density Li-ion power  packs. [ 217,218,457 ]  To keep the issues of LiCoPO 4  based cathodes  with  conventional  electrolyte,  PyR 14 FSI-LiTFSI  was  used  as  a  cathode. [ 458 ]   This  eventually  destroys  the  reversible  capacity  of  the cathode, for example the reversible capacity of ≈90 mAh g −1   was  only  noted  for  LiFe 0.1 Co 0.9 PO 4   in  the  half-cell  assembly  with  the  expected  high  charge  capacity.  Despite  the  loss  of  the  ﬁ rst  charge,  reasonable  cycling  proﬁ les  were  noted  when  paired with Sn-C for about 7 cycles. Li 2 MnO 3  based derivatives  were  believed  to  be  high  capacity  cathodes  for  the  fabrication  of next generation LIB. Elia et al. [ 459 ]  reported the performance  of  such  a  Li-rich  cathode,  Li[Li 0.2 Ni 0.4/3 Co 0.4/3 Mn 1.6/3 ]O 2   with  a  Sn-C  anode,  and  it  displayed  capacity  retention  of  ≈75%  after  500 cycles at various current densities. Once of the interesting  conﬁ guration of the Sn-C composite is with a LiFePO 4  cathode  because of the low cost, high power, and eco-friendliness of the  system. Unfortunately, the LiFePO 4 /Sn-C system showed more  fading  than  the  layered  and  spinel-type  cathodes  described  above. [ 460 ]   However,  several  approaches,  including  utilization  of LiBOB-based solutions (0.7 M LiBOB in EC:PC:DMC, 1:1:3,  Figure  27 ) [ 461 ] , polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolyte  (PEO 20 -LiCF 3 SO 3 ):ZrO 2 ,  90:10  wt%), [ 462 ]   and  ionic  liquid  LiTFSI-Py 24 TFSI, [ 463 ]   were  also  used  to  improve  the  electrochemical performance. However, there are no long-term cycling  proﬁ les  ( i.e. ,  beyond  100  cycles;  most  of  them  are  up  to  just  10–30  cycles)  or  in-depth  studies  are  available  at  the  moment.  A  free-standing  yolk-shell  structured  Sn-C  composite  was  also  reported with a layered LiCoO 2  with various cut-off potentials,  but such an assembly exhibits very poor cycleability. [ 464 ]  

 Kim et al. [ 465 ]  reported the synthesis of novel core-shell Sn-Cu  anodes, although these offer lower reversible capacity compared  to Sn-C in the half-cell assembly. However, much higher power  capability and cycleability was noted compared to Sn-Cu anodes.  The  full-cell  was  fabricated  with  LiCoO 2   (LiCoO 2 /Sn-Cu)  and  delivered a reversible capacity of ≈670 mAh g −1  (based on anode  loading) with retention of ≈85% after 170 cycles. The observed  cycleability  of  the  Sn-Cu  anode  was  consistent  with  the  natural  graphite  reported  by  the  authors.  Yao  et  al. [ 466 ]   suggested  the  possibility  of  using  3D  current  collectors  to  improve  the  rate  capability  and  the  stability  of  Sn-Cu  anodes  when  paired  with LiFePO 4  cathode. Poor cycleability was noted for the conventional  Cu  current  collector  formulated  with  PVdF  binder,  which was substantially improved by heat treating them in Ar  atmosphere.  However,  the  capacity  fading  remains  an  issue. The combined advantages of using a 3D current collector (NiCr)  and  formulating  with  CMC  binder  certainly  enable  excellent cycleability and allows retention of over ≈90% of the initial  capacity  after  200  cycles.  Trilayer  Sn-WC-few-layer  graphene  was prepared using a ball-milling procedure and was proposed  as a promising anode for LIB applications; it has good reversible capacity (≈400 mAh g −1 ) and capacity retention characteristics. [ 467 ]  In the trilayer system, the inner (WC) and outer layers  (few  layers  graphene)  were  anticipated  to  sustain  the  volume 

variation during the alloying/de-alloying reaction. The electrode  was  prelithiated  before  the  full-cell  assembly,  as  suggested  by  Hassoun  et  al. [ 456 ]   The  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /Sn-WC-few  layer  graphene cell delivered good reversibility (≈400 mAh g −1 ) and rendered ≈87% of initial capacity after 50 cycles. Cable-type ﬂ exible  LIBs fabricated with hollow multi-helix electrodes, i.e., LiCoO 2   coated  Al  wire  and  Sn-Ni  coated  over  Cu  wire,were  reported  for miniature electronic applications. [ 468 ]  The hollow structured  anode exhibited much higher reversibility and cycleability than  solid anodes. 

 Apart  from  the  Sn  composite  with  carbonaceous  materials  and other matrix elements such as Cu, Ni, and WC, the derivative  SnO 2   was  also  explored  as  a  possible  anode  for  practical  cells. To sustain the volume variation the SnO 2  microtubes were  grown over carbon cloth and subsequently used as binder free  anodes. [ 469 ]  The full-cell was fabricated with a NL design using  such a binder-free anode along with LiCoO 2  as the cathode for  self-powered  photo-etector  applications.  Because  there  was  no  pre-treating  for  the  SnO 2   anode,  a  this  results  in  a  huge  ICL  during  the  ﬁ rst  charge  when  paired  with  a  layered  cathode.  The full-cell delivered a reversible capacity of ≈863 mAh g −1  at  a current density of 200 mA g −1  with an ICL of ≈800 mAh g −1 .  The full-cell LiCoO 2 /SnO 2  renders ≈64% of the initial reversible  capacity after 60 cycles. The same group of authors attempted  to  improve  the  cycleability  by  making  heterostructures  with  TiO 2  over carbon cloth for the mentioned photodetector applications. [ 470 ]   As  observed  in  the  previous  case,  a  huge  ICL  was  also  observed  in  the  SnO 2 @TiO 2   heterostructure  when  coupled with LiCoO 2 . However, the improvement in the reversible  capacity (≈960 mAh g −1 ) and cycling stability was noted for the  reported 25 cycles while utilizing SnO 2 @TiO 2  heterostructures  compared to SnO 2  microtubes.  


 Ge is one of the important Group IV elements that have been  widely  exploited  as  promising  anodes  for  LIB  applications.  Despite its salient features, which include high theoretical and  lower working potential (≈0.5 V  vs . Li), the cost of this material  remains  a  main  hurdle  for  the  extensive  research.  As  a  result  fewer research activities have been carried out compared to its  counterparts such as Si and Sn. Formation of the end product  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle  is  still  a  debate  that  leads  to  deviation  in  the  exact  theoretical  capacity  of  Ge  (Li 15 Ge 4   (≈1384  mAh  g −1 ), [ 471 ]   Li 22 Ge 5   (≈1624  mAh  g −1 ), [ 472 ]   or  Li 17 Ge 4   (≈1568  mAh  g −1 ) [ 473 ] ).  Generally, the reaction mechanism can be described as follows  Ge → Li 9 Ge 4  → Li 7 Ge 2  → Li 15 Ge 4  + Li 22 Ge 5 . [ 383 ]  Still, the practical  reversibility  (>1000  mAh  g −1 )  in  the  half-cell  assembly  is  much higher than that for conventional graphitic or Sn-Co-TiC  anodes.  In  addition,  the  three  orders  of  magnitude  higher  electrical  conductivity  (≈2.1  S  m −1 )  and  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher  ionic  diffusivity  (6.25  ×  10 −12   cm 2   s −1 ),  i.e.,  400  times  higher  than  its  counterpart  Si  (electrical  conductivity  ≈1.6  mS  m −1   and  ionic  diffusivity  1.9  ×  10 −14   cm 2   s −1 ),  indicates  the  high  power  capability  of  this  unique  anode. [ 473 ]   This  is  mainly  because  of  the  smaller  band  gap  (0.6  eV)  of  the  Ge.  Furthermore, the ICL observed in the ﬁ rst cycle is also found to  be  minimal  compared  to  Si and  Sn-based  anodes.  Therefore,

research  efforts  on  Ge-based  anodes  are  worth  investigating  from the EV and HEV point of view, for example nanocrystalline  Ge  thin  ﬁ lms  are  capable  of  delivering  higher  reversible  capacity even at 1000 C rates. [ 472 ]  Similar to rest of the alloy and  conversion anodes, Ge also suffers upon cycling because of the  pulverization of the electrode during the lithiation/de-lithiation  process.  Typically,  the  crystalline  and  amorphous  phases  of  Ge  undergo  ≈353  and  ≈382%  of  variation,  respectively. [ 383,397 ]   Therefore,  strategies  adapted  to  the  alloy  type  and  conversion  anodes to sustain the volume variation are desperately needed  to improve the cycleability. 

 Park et al. [ 474 ]  ﬁ rst reported the performance of carbon-coated  Ge nanotubes (obtained from the Kirkendall effect at 700 °C) in  a full-cell assembly with layered LiCoO 2   (Figure 26) . As expected,  carbon-coated  Ge  anodes  delivered  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈716  mAh  g −1   at  a  40  C  rate  (40  A  g −1 ),which  is  much  better  rate  performance  than  its  counterpart  Si  (reported  only  up  to  15  C  or  15  A  g −1 ).  In  addition,  an  exceptional  cycleability  was  noted, for example the cell showed a reversible capacity of 1020  and  1002  mAh  g −1   at  a  1  C  discharge  rate  (charging  at  0.5  C)  for ﬁ rst and 400 th  cycles, respectively. The enhanced cycleability  of dodecanethiol-passivated Ge nanowires was capable of delivering better electrochemical performance than bare nanowires,  irrespective of the applied current rates or working conditions  (both  room  and  elevated  temperatures). [ 475 ]   Without  proper  optimization,  the  full-cell  assembly  with  the  LiFePO 4   cathode  showed  a  reversible  capacity  of  over  1000  mAh  g −1   for  the 

investigated 30 cycles. Later the same group attempted to synthesize high loading of Ge nanoparticles over graphene sheets  with  a  carbon  coating. [ 476 ]   The  Ge-reduced  graphene  oxide  (RGO)-C composite had very stable cycleability over 600 cycles  in a half-cell assembly at a 1 C rate with a reversible capacity of  ≈1000  mAh  g −1 .  As  expected,  the  LiCoO 2 /Ge-RGO-C  cell  retained a capacity of 900 mAh g −1  after 100 cycles with an initial reversible capacity of ≈1234 mAh g −1 . 

 Similar to Ge, the derivative germanium oxide (GeO  x  ) is also  equally promising from an anode point of view according to the  following  equilibrium:  GeO  x    +  2Li +   +  2e −   →  Ge  +  Li 2 O.  Subsequently,  Ge  will  form  a  reversible  alloy  with  Li  according  to  the  above  equation  and  translate  the  high  reversible  capacity.  Another  advantage  of  using  GeO  x    is  translating  additional  two  Li  via  the  conversion  reaction  for  high  reversible  capacity,  which  can  be  utilized  by  widen  the  operating  potential. [ 477 ]   Wang et al. [ 478 ]  ﬁ rst reported the synthesis of amorphous hierarchical porous GeO  x   as promising anode with ultralong cycleability of 600 cycles in half-cell assembly at 0.5 C rate. The fullcell  was  fabricated  with  a  layered  type  Li(NiMnCo) 1/3 O 2   and  the cell delivered the initial coloumbic efﬁ ciency of ≈85%. The  Li(NiMnCo) 1/3 O 2 /GeO  x    cell  displayed  outstanding  cycleability  of 200 cycles with reversible capacity of ≈144 mAh g −1  (based on  cathode mass) at 0.5 C rate by CC-CV mode of charging. The cell  experiences capacity loss of only ≈0.028% per cycle upon cycling  after 200 cycles. In addition to the alloying reaction, the conversion reaction was also utilized for the GeO  x  -RGO composite to 


yield a higher reversible capacity. [ 477 ]  Fabrication of the full-cell  assembly  as  carried  out  with  a  spinel  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   cathode  and  the  GeO  x  -RGO  composite  was  pre-lithiated  prior  to  the  full-cell assembly according to the procedure described by Derrien  et  al. [ 450 ]   The  full-cell,  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 /GeO  x  -RGO  showed  a  reversible  capacity  of  ≈120  mAh  g −1 .  Very  high  reversible  capacity was observed, independent of the applied current density, and it retained ≈83% of the initial capacity at a current density of 560 mA g −1 . 

 Germanate  nanowires  with  active  and  inactive  matrices  are  also  worth  investigating  as  possible  anodes  by  sustaining  the  unit  cell  variation.  Lin  et  al. [ 479,480 ]   reported  a  series  of  germinate  nanowire  arrays  including  SrGe 4 O 9 ,  BaGe 4 O 9 ,  Zn 2 GeO 4 ,  and  Ca 2 Ge 7 O 16   over  carbon  textiles,  which  undergo  both  alloy  and conversion reactions. Irrespective of the germanate nanowires, all four phases experienced a huge ICL observed in the ﬁ rst  cycle, which was much higher than the native and oxide forms.  On the other hand, the presence of a carbonaceous matrix promotes the electrochemical activity of such nanowires, which is  clearly evident from the half-cell studies and delivers the reversible  capacity  of  ≈1000  mAh  g −1   for  all  the  cases.  However,  an  ICL of over 800–1200 mAh g −1  was noted and no information  was available about how it was circumvented during the fabrication of the full-cell assembly with a layered LiCoO 2  cathode.  The  full-cell  LiCoO 2 /BaGe 4 O 9   or  Ca 2 Ge 7 O 16   delivered  a  stable  reversible capacity of ≈900 and ≈1100 mAh g −1  for the former  and latter conﬁ gurations, respectively.  

 Binary    metal    oxides    exhibits    simpler    conversion    reaction   with  metallic  Li  and  eventually  showed  good  electrochemical  activity. Interestingly, the introduction of  alloying  components   in  to  the  aforesaid  matrices leads to a widening of reversible  capacity  and  stability.  As  a  result,    certain    materials    exhibit   combined  conversion  and  alloying reactions  with  Li  during   charge-discharge  process,  for  example, ZnCo 2 O 4 , ZnMn 2 O 4 ,  ZnFe 2 O 4 , SnO, and SnO 2 , etc. In this special kind of material,  the  testing  potential  plays  a  crucial  role  to  determine  in  the  electrochemical performances and it has been clearly described  for  Sn-based  derivatives.  This  kind  of  material  is  also  studied  and paired with conventional cathodes and this is described in  the following sections.  

 Spinel  phase  zinc  ferrite  has  been  extensively  studied  as  a  promising  conversion-type  anode  for  LIB  applications  and  has  a  maximum  theoretical  capacity  of  1000  mAh  g −1   for  the  nine electron reaction. Although metallic reduction of Zn and  Fe  atoms  is  possible  by  conversion  pathways,  Zn  is  effectively  involved  in  the  alloy  formation  with  Li  according  to  the  following equilibrium [ 22,481,482 ] 

 Xie  et  al. [ 483 ]   ﬁ rst  demonstrated  the  fabrication  of  a  ZnFe 2 O 4 -graphene composite with olivine LiFePO 4 . In half-cell  assembly itself, a notable capacity fade was observed irrespective of the applied current rates with an ICL of ≈37%. Interestingly,  the  full-cell  LiFePO 4 /ZnFe 2 O 4   experienced  a  huge  ICL  of  ≈60%  in  the  ﬁ rst  cycle,  which  is  almost  twice  that  of  the  performance in the half-cell assembly. As a result, poor cycling  proﬁ les  were  noted  for  the  LiFePO 4 /ZnFe 2 O 4   conﬁ guration,  for instance an initial reversible capacity of ≈715 mAh g −1  was  dramatically decreased to ≈450 mAh g −1  within 10 cycles. Later,  Varzi  et  al. [ 484 ]   demonstrated  the  ultralong  cycling  proﬁ les  of  over 10 000 cycles for carbon-coated ZnFe 2 O 4  with a LiFePO 4 CNT  composite  in  the  full-cell  assembly  ( Figure    27 ).  Here,  the ZnFe 2 O 4  electrodes were pre-lithiated in different levels to  avoid  the  ICL  observed  in  ﬁ rst  cycle.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  increase  in  pre-lithiation  (an  extended  lithiation  process towards lower potential with respect to metallic Li) results  overcome the ICL issue and elevate the operating potential in  the  full-cell  assembly;  for  example  the  pre-lithiated  ZnFe 2 O 4   anode  exhibits  a  ≈0.43  V  higher  working  potential  than  the  untreated  one  when  coupled  with  a  LiFePO 4 -CNT  composite  cathode. The full-cell composed of pre-treated ZnFe 2 O 4  anode  retained  ≈86%  initial  reversible  capacity  after  10  000  cycles  compared  to ≈46%  retention  for  the  untreated  electrode.  The  test  electrodes  were  formulated  with  CMC  binder  to  yield  such  a  high  performance  conﬁ guration.  Furthermore,  the  authors  claimed  that  the  observed  maximum  speciﬁ c  energy  and power of 202 Wh kg −1  and 3.72 kW kg −1  (referring to the  total electrode mass loading) are much higher than the Li-ion  capacitors. [ 18,98 ]    

 Similar  to  above-mentioned  Co and  Fe-based  spinels,  manganite-based spinels with the general formula AMn 2 O 4 , where,  A = Co, Ni, or Zn, were found to be attractive for LIB applications and were extensively studied by Courtel et al. [ 485 ] . All transition metals undergo the metallic reduction (Zn 0 , Co 0 , Ni 0  and  Mn 0 ) via conversion reaction and, in addition, Zn involves the  reversible alloy formation with Li (<1 V vs. Li), which, in turn,  provides  extra  capacity  for  the  spinel  oxides. [ 364 ]   More  clearly,  CoMn 2 O 4  and NiMn 2 O 4  are the purely conversion type anodes,  whereas  ZnMn 2 O 4   undergo  both  conversion  and  alloy  type  reactions according to the following reactions



 It  was  found  that  ZnMn 2 O 4   that  was  co-precipitated,  followed  by  sintering  at  800  °C,  was  superior  in  terms  of  high  reversible capacity and capacity retention characteristics compared  to  the  rest  of  the  spinels  (CoMn 2 O 4   and  NiMn 2 O 4 )  and  its  individual  oxides  (ZnO  and  Mn 2 O 3 )  in  the  halfcell  assembly.  Li-CMC  and  1  M  LiPF 6   in  EC:DEC  (3:7  by  volume)  were  found  to  be  better  binders  and  electrolytes  for  ZnMn 2 O 4   anode,  respectively.  Eventually,  the  full-cell  was  fabricated  with  a  high  voltage  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   cathode  in  the  presence  of  the  mentioned  electrolytes.  Here,  the  cathode  to  anode  mass  as  adjusted  to  5:1  with  30%  excess  loading  of  LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4   used  to  overcome  the  ICL  issue.  As  expected,  a  dramatic  fade  in  capacity  proﬁ les  was  noted;  for  example  reversible  capacities  of  108  and  68  mAh  g −1   were  observed  in  the  ﬁ rst  and  20 th   cycles,  respectively,  with  poor  coloumbic  efﬁ ciency  throughout  the  cycling  ( Figure    28 ).  There  are  several  reasons  for  this  poor  performance,  for  instance  the  choice  of  electrolyte;  usually  for  such  high  voltage  cathode  conﬁ gurations  DMC-based  solution  are  preferred  over DEC.      

 Even  though  Co-based  compounds  such  as  LiCoO 2   were  claimed to be toxic for the LIB applications, research activities  are  still  in  full  swing,  for  instance,  ZnCo 2 O 4   was  proposed  as  an  attractive  material  for  the  anode  point  of  view.  Similar  to  ZnFe 2 O 4 , ZnCo 2 O 4  shows a cubic spinel structure where Co 3+   ions  occupy  the  octahedral  sites  and  divalent  Zn  ions  ﬁ ll  the  tetrahedral  sites.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  both  Zn  and  Co  are found to be electrochemically active with Li according to the  following equilibrium


 However, it is well established that CoO will be further oxidized into Co 3 O 4  according to Sharma et al. [ 486 ]  (2CoO + 2/3Li 2 O  ↔ 2/3Co 3 O 4  + 4/3Li +  + 4/3e − ). Liu et al. [ 487 ]  successfully synthesized  3D  architectured  ZnCo 2 O 4   nanowire  arrays-carbon  cloth  composites  and  fabricated  a  full-cell  assembly  with  a  layeredtype  LiCoO 2   cathode.  As  expected,  an  irreversible  capacity  of  ≈300  mAh  g −1   was  noted  for  the  ﬁ rst  cycle  in  the  half-cell  assembly.  The  NL  conﬁ guration  LiCoO 2 /ZnCo 2 O 4   nanowire  array-carbon cloth cell displayed a good cycleability of ≈96% initial  capacity  retention  (≈1300  mAh  g −1   with  respect  the  anode  loading) after 40 cycles. The same group reported the synthesis  of  ZnCo 2 O 4   urchins  in  carbon  ﬁ ber  cloth  in  a  similar  process  and  by  varying  the  reaction  time  in  autoclave. [ 488 ]   A  full-cell  LiCoO 2 /ZnCo 2 O 4   urchin-carbon  cloth  cell  with  a  NL  design  showed  a  reversible  capacity  of ≈1176  mAh  g −1   with  an  exceptional  cycleability  of  50  cycles.  Furthermore,  bending  studies  from  30°  to  180° were   also  conducted  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  such a ﬂ exible LIB design. Here, 100% reversibility was noted for  ZnCo 2 O 4  nanostructures when coupled with a LiCoO 2  cathode,  which  is  somewhat  unbelievable.  How  the  authors  achieved  100%  reversibility  in  ﬁ rst  cycle  is  a  mystery  because  there  was  no  pre-lithiation  conducted  for  such  ZnCo 2 O 4   nanostructures.  Additionally,  the  authors  used  an  aqueous  solution  of  1.05  M  LiPF 6  in EC:DMC as the electrolyte in the full-cell assembly in  both works. Although the works reported such spinel ZnCo 2 O 4   based composites are interesting, we are not sure about the reliability and originality of the mentioned works.   

 Several transition metal based insertion materials are proposed  to  be  the  potential  alternative  to  replace  the  graphitic  anodes,  but  few  of  them,  including  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 ,  bronze  phase  TiO 2,   and  TiNb 2 O 7 ,  are  only  found  appealing  in  terms  of  cell-safety,  cost-effectiveness,  compatibility  with  cathodes,  and  improved  electrochemical  activity.  Irrespective  of  the  insertion  anodes 

evaluated, the intercalation potential is found to be much higher  (>1 V vs. Li) for all the cases compared to the graphitic anodes  (<0.1  V  vs.  Li).  Similar  to  higher  insertion  potential,  the  practical  reversible  capacity  is  less  than  that  of  graphite.  Nevertheless, the superior rate capability and redox couple located in the  thermodynamic  stability  window  of  the  conventional  aprotic  solvents, i.e., SEI–free, makes them attractive candidates to fabricate high power Li-ion power packs. After extensive investigation  for  over  two  decades,  the  spinel  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode  reached  into the commercial market with spinel cathodes for EV applications.  However,  the  high  performance  is  realized  for  the  mentioned  anode  in  practical-cell  conﬁ gurations,  but  unfortunately  the reversible capacity is limited to only ≈175 mAh g −1 . Therefore,  research  activities  are  focused  on  using  anatase  TiO 2   as  the anodes for LIB applications because of their high theoretical  capacity (≈335 mAh g −1 ), but they show slightly higher potential  (≈1.75 V vs. Li) compared to the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode (≈1.5 V vs. Li).  Unfortunately,  the  reversibility  is  limited  to  ≈0.5  mole  instead  of one mole, which is inferior compared to the well-established  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   chemistry.  Nevertheless,  the  successful  reversible  Liinsertion  into  the  nanostructured  bronze  phase  with  similar  physico-chemical  properties  made  a  signiﬁ cant  breakthrough  in  the  anode  research. [ 61 ]   Interestingly,  the  insertion  potential  (≈1.55 V vs. Li) is almost same that of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 , which results in  a net increase in the energy density of the cell. This is because  of the structural arrangement of bronze phase and its capable of  delivering high reversibility even at high current rates, i.e., high  power capability. This is clearly evident when the bronze phase  is coupled with either LiFePO 4  or LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4  cathodes compared to Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 . [ 60,70 ]  Similar to the bronze phase, TiNb 2 O 7  is  also promising in the recent past because of its high reversible  capacity  (≈300  mAh  g −1 ),  similar  working  potential  (≈1.5  V  vs.  Li), high power capability, and excellent electrochemical stability  upon cycling. The preliminary results indicate that the compatibility and long-term cycleability with spinel cathodes (about 1000  cycles) are promising and could be used to replace the Li 4 Ti 5 O 12   anode for the fabrication of high power Li-ion power packs. [ 274 ]   However, further in-depth studies are required to make them as  potential anodes in practical cells before reaching the commercialization. On the other hand, other insertion anodes described  displayed  either  less  reversible  capacity  or  higher  working  potential compared to those three anodes and are interesting for  small scale applications and academic research only. 

 Displacement  type  anodes  exhibit  high  reversible  capacity  and high rate capability, but the huge polarization is the main  issue  while  fabricating  the  full-cell  assembly,  apart  from  ICL.  Mitigating  the  ICL  issue  has  been  well  matured,  for  example  in  the  beginning  days  both  the  cathode  and  anode  were  pretreated to eliminate and accommodate the Li, either chemically  or  electrochemically.  Some  reports  have  also  been  reported  with  excess  loading  of  the  cathode  to  overcome  the  ICL.  Presently,  only  the  anode  has  is  pre-treated  with  Li  for  few  cycles  and  it  is  fabricated  with  conventional  cathodes.  Nevertheless,  the  electrochemical  pre-treating  procedure  certainly  beneﬁ cial  in two ways: i) to overcome the ICL and ii) to ensure the electrode performance observed in the respective half-cell assembly.  Favorable  long-term  cycleability  (over  1000  cycles)  and  high  power  capability  were  recently  reported  for  Fe 3 O 4 -porous  carbon  composites  after  both  chemical  and  electrochemical 


lithiation,  but  unavoidable  variation  in  the  structural  changes  has to be sacriﬁ ced upon cycling, which is clearly evident from  the  deviation  of  charge-discharge  curves. [ 355 ]   Similarly,  outstanding  10  000  cycles  with  ≈85%  retention  was  reported  for  ZnFe 2 O 4   with  a  LiFePO 4   assembly,  however  the  Zn-based  ternary oxides (ZnFe 2 O 4 , ZnMn 2 O 4 , ZnCo 2 O 4  etc.,) do not fall into  the category of pure conversion type anodes. [ 484 ]  Generally, Zn  undergoes an alloying reaction with Li (Li  x  Zn), apart from the  conversion  of  its  respective  oxides  (ZnO  and  Fe 2 O 3 ).  On  the  other hand, power capability of the cell is much better than the  insertion  type  anodes  based  cells,  but  the  energy  density  has  been  diluted  because  of  the  polarization  and  wider  working  potential. The research activities on the development of conversion-type-anode based  practical  cells  are  strongly  encouraged  from an academic point of view, but very little scope is available  for the practical aspects. 

 Alloying  type  anodes  are  fascinating  electrodes  among  the  rest  discussed  above  because  of  their  lower  working  potential  (very  close  to  graphite  and  Li),  large  reversible  capacity,  and  high  power  capability.  This  type  of  anode  has  already  been  commercialized,  for  example  Sony's  Nexelion  is  composed  of  a  Sn-based  nanocomposite  with  mixed  layered  type  cathodes  (LiCoO 2  + Li(NiMnCo)O 2 ), but unfortunately this has not been  extended  for  high  power  applications  such  as  EVs  and  HEVs.  Although  hundreds  of  research  articles  are  available  for  such  alloy type anodes, very few of them report practical cell conﬁ gurations.  Initially,  Si-based  anodes  were  expected  to  dominate  the  future  Li-ion  battery  market  due  to  their  salient  features  described,  but  they  failed  to  deliver  satisfactory  results  in  the  half-cell  assembly  itself.  This  limited  full-cell  work  is  not  only  for the Si-based anodes and also inclusive of Sn and Ge based  materials  as  well.  Moreover  the  reported  limited  works  in  the  full-cell conﬁ guration are also composed of inferior cycleability,  i.e.,  100  to  200  cycles  only.  The  performance  of  alloy-based  anodes  in  thin  ﬁ lm  conditions  displayed  much  better  performance  than  those  in  powdered  form. [ 410,415,448 ]   However,  such  thin  ﬁ lm  anodes  have  fewer  practical  applications  and  using  such anodes to realize the goal of EVs and HEVs is impossible.  In  addition,  the  main  reason  for  the  limited  work  on  alloybased materials is ascribed to the unusual volume variation in  both  crystalline  and  amorphous  conditions  upon  alloying/dealloying processes. Either active or inactive matrix element are  necessary to uphold such issue and this makes them attractive  candidates  for  the  construction  of  high  energy  density  Li-ion  power  packs  with  high  power  capability.  On  the  contrary,  the  presence  of  an  amorphous  matrix  such  as  Li 2 O  during  deep  discharge  certainly  sustains  the  unusual  unit  cell  variation  for  some extend. As a result, improved electrochemical proﬁ les are  noted, more clearly SiO  x  , and SnO  x   is a marginally better candidate than its metallic form in the presence of a carbonaceous  matrix. Although a small amount of reversible capacity loss has  to be sacriﬁ ced, long-term cycleability would be assured. Presently, fabricating a full-cell with either conversion or alloy type  anodes is well-matured and long-term cycleability of thousands  of cycles has been reported using displacement type anodes. A  similar  type  of  strategy  is  strongly  encouraged  for  alloy-based  anodes  to  realize  them  in  the  fabrication  of  practical  cells.  Therefore,  many  research  activities  are  strongly  anticipated  to  demonstrate  them  in  practical  conﬁ gurations  with  long-term cycleability and high power capability, rather than just testing in  half-cell assemblies. 

 To conclude, signiﬁ cant progress in the insertion type anodes  development  has  been  realized  and  has  matured,  for  example  spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  anode-based cells have reached the commercial  market after the commercialization of graphitic anodes. Bronze  phase  and  TiNb 2 O 7   exhibit  favorable  characteristics  including  high  power  capability,  high  reversibility,  and  similar  operating  potential to spinel Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  and are lined up for commercialization. On the other hand, several alloy-type anodes are potential  candidates  and  are  expected  to  replace  the  conventional  graphitic anodes, but the unusual volume variation and associated  cyclic  stability  hinders  them  for  potential  use  in  practical  LIBs. Therefore, much research is anticipated to focus on them  to  overcome  the  issues  described  above  and  to  realize  them  for  the  fabrication  of  high  energy  density  Li-ion  power  packs  with lighter weight and high power capability and to eventually  power EVs and HEVs.
