The  urgent  demands  for  developing  a  sustainable  and  “green”  environment  requires  the  establishment  of  efﬁ cient  and  lowcost  energy  storage  systems,  which  will  be  one  of  the  great  challenges  in  the  21st  century  and  and  has  already  attracted  extensive  attention  in  our  daily  life. [ 1–4 ]   Among  the  various  available energy storage technologies, lithium-ion batteries play  a dominant role in portable electronic devices and have become  the prime candidate to power the next generation electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. [ 5–12 ]  Undoubtedly widescale implementation of renewable energy will require growth  in  the  production  of  inexpensive  and  efﬁ cient  energy  storage  systems. However, the increasing demand for lithium (Li) supplies will bring about a steep rise in the Li resources price and  consumption in the foreseeable future because the use of lithium-ion batteries has expanded to large-scale applications. [ 13–16 ]    Sodium  (Na)  is  located  below  Li  in  the  periodic  table  and  shares  similar  physical  and  chemical  properties  with  Li  in  many  aspects,  thus  sodium  can  be  a  promising  candidate  for  substituting  lithium  in  rechargeable  batteries. [ 17–19 ]   Additionally,  sodium  is  optimistically  abundant  in  nature  (ranking  fourth among the most abundant elements in the Earth crust)  and  fairly  low  in  cost. [ 20–22 ]   All  the  advantages  of  sodium  support  the  exploration  of  sodium-based  rechargeable  batteries,  viz. sodium-ion batteries. Furthermore, many materials as well  as  design  processes  currently  applied  for  lithium-ion  batteries  can  also  be  used  in  the  sodium-ion  batteries. [ 23–29 ]   And  obviously,  the  sodium-ion  batteries  explore  a  new  and  important  direction for energy storage systems.  

 Despite  the  numerous  advantages  of  sodium-ion  batteries,  there  still  are  challenges,  for  example,  in  the  search  for  suitable  electrode  materials  for  sodium-ion  batteries.  Because  of  the larger ionic radius of Na +  (0.98 Å) in comparison to that of  Li +   (0.69  Å),  the  diffusion  coefﬁ cient  of  Na +   intercalation  into  the  electrode  is  more  impeditive. [ 17,39–42 ]   Besides,  the  larger  Na +   ions  will  surely  result  in  severe  structure  degradation  of electrode  materials  during  the  intercalation/deintercalation  process.  Therefore,  the  requirements  of  long  cycle  life  and  high  rate  capability  of  sodium-ion  batteries  in  energy  storage  applications should be satisﬁ ed. Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  (NVP) is a promising  candidate  for  sodium-ion  battery  electrodes  because  it  is  a  typical  NASICON  (Na  super-ionic  conductor)  type  compound. [ 43–45 ]  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  was originally investigated for use as  a solid electrolyte that allows fast Na +  ion conduction through  the empty space in its crystal structure. [ 46,47 ]  It is built up from  isolated  [VO 6 ]  octahedra  and  [PO 4 ]  tetrahedrally  interlinked  via corners to establish the framework anion [V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ] 3− . The  two independent Na +  cations are partially occupied and located  in  channels  with  two  different  oxygen  environments,  viz.  sixfold  coordination  for  the  ﬁ rst  and  eightfold  for  the  second  Na +   cation. [ 48 ]   This  unique  structure  provides  an  open,  threedimensional  framework  that  is  known  for  its  facile  Na +   ion  migration. [ 49,50 ]   Besides,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   has  two  different  voltage  plateaus at around 3.3 V and 1.6 V, and therefore this material  can be assembled to a symmetrical full battery with an output  voltage  of  1.7  V.  This  unique  property  renders  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   a  perfect  candidate  for  application  in  symmetric  batteries  with  the  utilization  of  the  same  material  for  the  cathode  and  the  anode  simultaneously. [ 51–53 ]   However,  only  a  few  reports  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ’s  performance  as  battery  electrode  exist  in  the  literature,  and  the  reversibility  and  cyclability  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   need to be enhanced. In addition, the electron and Na +  ion diffusion pathways in the electrode were not clearly compared and  illustrated before. 

 Herein, a facile synthesis method of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  nanograins  by calcination is described, which can be applied in large-scale  production and has great potential in manifold applications. As  carbon matrices have a signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence on the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   performance,  this  synthetic  route  is  employed  rationally  and  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  dispersed  in  different  carbon  matrices  from  zero-dimensional  (0D),  one-dimensional  (1D)  to  two-dimensional  (2D)  nanostructures,  i.e.,  acetylene  carbon  (AC)  nanospheres,  carbon  nanotubes  (CNT)  and  graphite  nanosheets by adjusting the carbon source as well as reductant.  The inﬂ uence and mechanism of carbon matrices on the active  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  nanograins are investigated and an explanation is  proposed.  The  electrochemical  performances  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  in  three  carbon  architectures  in  sodium  half  cells  are  compared,  demonstrating  that  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   dispersed  in  the  AC  nanospheres  has  the  best  sodium-ion  battery  performance (approximately 100% of the theoretical capacity at 0.5 C  and 96.4% capacity retention at 5 C after 200 cycles), while in  the  CNT  matrix  the  performance  is  moderate,  and  in  the  graphite nanosheets the performance is inferior. Furthermore, a high-performance symmetric sodium-ion battery that exploits  the  unique  electrode  characteristics  is  assembled  and  the  battery  offers  excellent  performance,  which  has  never  been  reported  before.  The  symmetric  battery  can  be  cycled  at  a  10 C rate with minor decays in capacity when recovered, and it  has an unusual cycling stability: exceeding 200 cycles at a 1 C  rate with no substantial losses in capacity delivery. The performances  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  in  different  matrices  from  0D to 3D nanostructures are also compared in symmetric full  sodium-ion  batteries,  and  the  performance  shows  the  same  trends as in sodium half batteries. 

  Figure    1  a–c depict the X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the  as-synthesized  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  dispersed  in  different  carbon  matrices.  The  characteristic  peaks  of  different  samples  can be readily indexed to a well-deﬁ ned NASICON structure in  a  P 2 1 /n space group (monoclinic unit cell) with  a  = 8.566 Å and   b   =  12.053  Å.  These  values  correspond  well  with  the  existing  values  in  literatures. [ 45,54 ]   The  morphologies  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / AC, Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite are characterized by ﬁ eld-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM)  images  in  Figure   1 d–f  with  regular  shapes  and  a  narrow  size  distribution,  respectively.  The  morphologies  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  are  similar  to their carbon matrices when compared with the SEM images  of  the  corresponding  carbon  matrices  in  Figure  S1.  This  phenomenon  is  attributed  to  the  fact  that  the  carbon  sources  act  as  templates  in  synthesis  process  to  control  the  morphology.  Figure   1 g–i  are  the  schematic  illustrations  of  our  as-synthesized  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  in  different  carbon  networks.  The  carbon  templates  form  conductive  networks  for  electron transport,  thus  promoting  the  conductivity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analyses  of  different  samples  (Figure  S2a-c)  unambiguously  conﬁ rm  that  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  homogeneously  dispersed  in  AC,  CNT  and  graphite  networks,  resulting  in  improved  electrical conductivity. The carbon amount in each sample is determined by element analysis, and the carbon contents are 8.46%,  8.37%,  and  8.54%  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  respectively.  This  indicates  that  the  carbon contents in the three samples are almost same. Nitrogen  sorption isotherms were generated to investigate the Brunauer– Emmet–Teller  (BET)  surface  area  of  the  samples  (Figure  S3).  The  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  has  the  largest  BET  surface  area,  which  is  about  25  m 2   g −1 .  The  surface  area  of  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  is less, about 12 m 2  g −1 . And the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite has the  smallest surface area, which is only 4 m 2  g −1 . This result shows  that Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC has the largest contact area with the electrolyte during cycling.  

 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to characterize the morphologies and obtain detailed structures of the  products.   Figure     2  a  indicates  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  well  dispersed  in  AC  nanospheres,  which  have  a  physical  morphology of ﬁ nely divided pellets and form a 3D conductive  network.  Figure   2 b  is  a  high-resolution  (HR)  TEM  image  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  in  which  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   are  nanograins  with  a  diameter of ∼5 nm. The lattice fringes of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  are clear,  indicating  its  high  crystallinity.  The  morphology  of  AC  particles  is  sphere-like  and  surround  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins,  and the lattice fringes of AC can also be detected and the interface  between  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  AC  can  be  easily  observed.  For 

Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT,  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  dispersed  on the CNT, as indicated in Figure  2 c. Combined with the EDS  mapping in Figure S2b, it can be deduced that the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   are uniformly dispersed in the CNT matrix. The HRTEM image  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  (Figure   2 d)  shows  clear  lattice  fringes  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  CNT,  the  width  of  4.3  and  3.5  Å  between  neighboring  lattice  fringes  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   correspond  to  the (002)  and  (031)  planes  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  respectively.  The  lattice  fringes  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  conﬁ rm  the  pure  crystalline  phase  of  these  nanoparticles.  The  TEM  and  HRTEM  images  (Figure   2 e  and   2 f)  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  show  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  distributed  in  the  graphite  nanosheets,  and  the  particle  sizes  of  the  nanograins  are  ∼5  nm  with  good  crystallinity.  The  graphite  nanosheets  are N two-dimensional  and  the  boundaries  between  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  and  graphite  are  clearly  observed.  The  size  of  O Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  in  different  carbon  matrices  are  all  I T maintained at 5 nm and it is remarkable that the structures are  A C kept  well-deﬁ ned  nanosized  morphology  through  the  calcinaI tions  at  800  °C.  The  lattice  fringes  of  different  carbonaceous  N materials  can  also  be  observed  in  the  corresponding  HRTEM  U M images, indicating that all the carbon matrices are crystallized.  The spacings of the carbon matrices are nearly 3.3 Å, well conM sistent  with  the  previous  reported  crystalline  carbon  interlayer  O spacing (3.35 Å). It can be seen that in all the TEM images of  C Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  are  intimately  interconnected  by  carbon  bridges.  The  carbon  bridges  act  as  electron  pathways  that  electrically  interconnect  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins,  ultimately  providing  the  electrode  with  a  very  high  conductivity.  Also the Na +  ion diffusion lengths are reduced by the nanoscale  diameter  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  thus  offering  excellent  kinetics  for  Na +  intercalation/deintercalation process.  

 The  electrochemical  performance  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite were characterized by  using  CR2025  coin  cells  with  sodium  metal  as  the  counter  electrode.  The  discharge  voltage  of  carbonaceous  materials  is  below  1.0  V,  therefore  the  reversible  capacity  of  carbon  in  the  composites  is  negligible. [ 55 ]   The  redox  couple  properties  of  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  cathodes  are  demonstrated  by  cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  curves  in   Figure     3  a  for  the  initial  cycle  at  a  scan  rate  of  0.1  mV  s −1   in a voltage range of 2.3 to 3.9 V  vs.  Na/Na + . It is obvious that  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  has  larger  curve  area  and  higher  redox  peak  current than other samples, indicating that Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC has  the  highest  capacity  and  the  fastest  kinetics  for  Na +   ion  insertion/extraction. Each sample has an oxidation peak and a reduction peak as shown in Figure  3 a. The oxidation (Na extraction)  and reduction (Na insertion) peaks are located near 3.3 and 3.5 V.  The  average  voltage  is  3.4  V   vs.   Na/Na + ,  which  is  close  to  the  equilibrium  voltage  of  V 4+ /V 3+   (Na 1+ x  V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  0  ≤   x   ≤  2)  redox  couple  in  our  as-synthesized  materials. [ 53 ]   There  exist  peak shifts in the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  samples: the oxidation peak moves to higher potential and the  reduction peak moves to lower potential, resulting in the larger  potential difference. This may be attributed to the lower kinetics of  the  two  samples,  thus  leading  to  electrode  polarization  during cycling. The peak area of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC is the largest,  indicating  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  with  the  largest  electrochemical  surface  area  has  the  best  performance  of  the  electrodes.  The  discharge proﬁ les of the samples at the rate of 1 C (1 C corresponds to 117.6 mA g −1 ) over a potential window of 2.3 to 3.9 V  are  presented  in  Figure  S4.  It  can  be  clearly  seen  that  all  the  samples have a ﬂ at discharge voltage plateau around 3.3 V, corresponding well with the reduction peaks in the CV curve. This  is identiﬁ ed as the phase transition process of the extraction of  almost  1.7  atoms  of  sodium  per  formula  unit.  The  initial  speciﬁ c  discharge  capacity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  is  108.9  mAh  g −1 ,  higher  than  94.8  and  67.1  mAh  g −1   for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  respectively.  Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopic  (EIS)  measurements  were  carried  out  in  order  to compare the conductivity and diffusion ability of the as-synthesized Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC, Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / graphite electrodes (Figure  3 b). The entire Nyquist plots exhibit  a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a straight line in  the low-frequency region. The semicircle is ascribed to the Na +   ion  migration  through  the  interface  between  the  surface  layer  of  the  particles  and  the  electrolyte.  By  comparing  the  chargetransfer resistance (R ct ), it is found that the R ct  of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / graphite  is  the  highest,  followed  by  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT,  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC has the lowest resistance. This may be ascribed  to the much larger carbon matrix size of graphite and the inhomogeneity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   particle  size  in  graphite  matrix  as  indicated in Figure  1 f and  2 f. The straight line is attributed to  the diffusion of sodium ions in the bulk of the electrode material, and the diffusion coefﬁ cient value (D) of the sodium ions  can  be  calculated  using  the  equation   D  =  0.5(RT/AF 2 σ w C) 2  ,  where   R   is  the  gas  constant,   T   is  the  temperature,   A   is  the  area  of  the  electrode  surface,   F   is  the  Faraday’s  constant,   σ w    is the Warburg factor, and  C  is the molar concentration of Na +   ions. [ 56 ]   The  calculated  sodium  diffusion  coefﬁ cient  values  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  are 1.51 × 10 −12 , 1.38 × 10 −12  and 1.26 × 10 −12  cm 2  s −1 , respectively.  It  can  be  found  that  the  sodium  diffusion  coefﬁ cient  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  possesses  the  highest  value,  indicating  the  fastest Na +  ions transport in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC.  

 It  can  be  concluded  from  the  above  electrochemical  analyses  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  has  the  best  electrochemical  performance,  and  this  is  subsequently  veriﬁ ed.  The  cyclic  performances  of  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  electrodes  in  2.3  to  3.9  V  at  5  C  rate  are  demonstrated  in  Figure   3 c.  The  initial  discharge  capacity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  cathode  is  up  to  100.6  mAh  g −1 ,  closer  to  the theoretical capacity than the other two samples. This value  is  much  higher  than  86.2  mAh  g −1   for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  62.6  mAh  g −1   for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite.  After  200  cycles,  the  capacities  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  cathodes  decrease  to  97.0,  56.3  and  40.8  mAh  g −1 ,  corresponding  to  the  capacity  retention  of  96.4%,  65.3%  and  65.1%  of  their  initial  capacity,  respectively.  It  is  of  great  signiﬁ cance  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  possesses  almost  no  capacity  fading  during  cycling,  compares  well  with  the  commercial  lithium-ion  batteries  and  exceeds  most  of  the  other  rechargeable  batteries.  For  further  evaluation  of  the  advantages  of  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  cathode,  rate  performance at  progressively  increased  current  densities  (ranging  from  0.5  C  to  5  C)  was  measured  (Figure   3 d).  The  initial  discharge  capacity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  at  0.5  C  is  117.5  mAh  g −1   in  the  initial  stage,  approximately  100%  of  the  theoretical  capacity  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  Note  that  the  formation  of  a  polymeric  gellike  ﬁ lm,  the  decomposition  of  the  electrolyte  solution  or  the  possibly  interfacial  lithium  storage  may  contribute  slightly  to  the  initial  capacity. [ 57 ]   This  is  further  testiﬁ ed  by  the  discharge  proﬁ le  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  at  the  rate  of  0.1  C  as  indicated  in  Figure  S5.  The  discharge  capacity  is  119.6  mAh  g −1 ,  slightly  larger  than  the  theoretical  value  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   (117.6  mAh  g −1 ).  The  discharge  potential  shown  in  Figure  S5  is  around  3.35  V,  corresponding  well  with  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   in  previously reported literatures. [ 51,58 ]  The discharge capacities of  105.1,  101.1  and  97.0  mAh  g −1   are  obtained  at  1  C,  2  C  and  5  C  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  respectively.  The  performance  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC at 5 C is much better than that of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  at  the  same  rate,  which  are  only  79.8  and  51.7  mAh  g −1 ,  respectively.  Even  suffering  from  rapid  changes  of  the  current  densities,  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  electrode exhibits stable capacity at each current. Note that the  capacity  decay  at  a  current  rate  of  5  C  is  slower  than  that  at  0.5 C. This phenomenon may be attributed to the severe degradation,  partial  dissolution  of  electrode  materials  in  electrolyte,  larger  metallic  sodium  consumption  and  more  side  reactions  at  initial  cycles  under  lower  current  rates. [ 34,41,52 ]   When  the  current  is  turned  back  to  1  C,  about  99.3%  of  the  capacity  is  recovered and there is no obvious capacity loss (only 3.0%) after  the  subsequent  60  cycles.  This  rate  performance  investigation  indicates the excellent structural stability and rate capability of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  nanograins in AC matrix. 

 It is reported that Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  has electrochemical activity at  a  lower  voltage. [ 51,53 ]   The  CV  curve  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  for  the  initial cycle at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s −1  in a voltage range  of 1.3 to 2.0 V  vs.  Na/Na +  is shown in Figure S6. Two peaks corresponding to V 3+ /V 2+  redox couple could be observed, and the  average voltage is 1.65 V, and this property endows Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   a  candidate  to  perform  as  anode.  Taking  advantage  of  the  big  voltage difference between the plateaus, a symmetric cell using  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /C as both negative and positive electrodes can be  designed. [ 53 ]   As  expected  from  the  respective  voltages  at  3.40  and 1.65 V, the combination of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC as both cathode  and  anode  gives  rise  to  a  battery  operating  around  1.75  V.  Therefore  a  symmetric  sodium-ion  battery  with  structure  as  NVP 储 1 M NaClO 4 /EC + DMC 储 NVP was assembled as shown  in Figure S7. Figure S8a shows the CV curve of the symmetric  cell at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s −1  in the potential range of 1.0 to  3.0 V. Two peaks located at 1.80 and 1.70 V are observed, and  the  average  voltage  is  1.75  V,  matching  well  with  the  expectation. The corresponding voltage proﬁ les of the charge-discharge  curves at 1 C of the symmetric battery are shown in Figure S8b  (the  battery  is  cathode  limited).  The  discharge  capacity  and  charge capacity are 99.2 and 104.2 mAh g −1 , respectively, with  an  initial  coulombic  efﬁ ciency  of  95.2%.

 Rate capability measurement was ﬁ rstly used to evaluate the  symmetric  battery  performance.  As  shown  in   Figure     4  a,  the  symmetric  batteries  with  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC,  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite as both electrodes were cycled from  0.5  C  to  10  C  (58.8  mA  g −1   to  1176  mA  g −1 )  in  the  potential  range of 1.0 to 3.0 V. The symmetric battery using Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / AC  electrodes  delivers  100.9  mAh  g −1   at  0.5  C  based  on  the  cathode  weight,  signiﬁ cantly  larger  than  77.9  mAh  g −1   for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and 37.1 mAh g −1  for Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite.  The  symmetric  battery  also  shows  excellent  cyclic  stability and  the  discharge  capacity  is  94.1,  78.5,  69.4,  60.6  and  54.6  mAh  g −1   at  1  C,  2  C,  3  C,  4  C,  and  5  C,  respectively.  Even  at  much  higher  rate  of  10  C,  the  discharge  capacity  is  42.2  mAh  g −1 ,  and  nearly  42%  of  the  initial  capacity  can  be  retained.  This  value  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  at  10  C  is  2.3  times  higher than that of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and 5.3 times higher than  that of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite in symmetric sodium-ion batteries  under the same rate, respectively, which is signiﬁ cantly advantageous. Remarkably, when the current density is recovered to  1 C, 94.4% of the capacity can be maintained for Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / AC  symmetric  battery,  demonstrating  its  excellent  battery  stability.  The  superior  long  life  of  the  symmetric  batteries  was  further  investigated  by  testing  the  same  symmetric  battery  at  1 C for 200 cycles. As shown in Figure  4 b, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  delivers  the  highest  capacity  and  that  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite  is  the  lowest.  The  capacity  retention  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  symmetric battery is approximately 80% after 200 cycles, which has never  been  reported  before.  The  speciﬁ c  energy  and  speciﬁ c  power of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC, Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 / graphite are shown in the Ragone plot (Figure  4 c), respectively.  The  speciﬁ c  energy  and  speciﬁ c  power  was  calculated  on  the  basis of the cathode. The Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC exhibits the highest  speciﬁ c energy of 185.5 Wh kg −1  at 1 C, and remarkably, it can  deliver a speciﬁ c power of ∼5000 W kg −1 . This shows that our  symmetric battery has a comparable speciﬁ c power and energy  density,  and  can  be  a  promising  candidate  for  energy  storage  systems  with  both  high-power  and  high-energy  densities.  The  energy efﬁ ciency of the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC symmetric sodium-ion  battery is ∼75% at 1 C (Figure  4 d), which is better than those of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  and  higher  than  ∼70% of redox-ﬂ ow batteries. [ 59 ]  At the rate of 10 C, the energy  efﬁ ciency can signiﬁ cantly maintain at ∼50%. It can be expected  that the application of the symmetric batteries will demonstrate  great  potential  in  the  development  of  energy  storage  systems  due  to  the  several  advantages  such  as  improved  safety,  long  preservation, ability of charging in both directions, and low cost  because of the utilization of the same material for the cathode  and the anode.  

 Note  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  material  delivers  the  best  electrochemical  performance  in  all  the  battery  measurements.  It  can  be  concluded  that  this  phenomenon  can  be  attributed  to  the  morphology  of  the  different  carbon  matrices. [ 60 ]   Firstly,  it  is  clear  from  the  BET  surface  area  measurements  that  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC exhibits the largest surface area. The large surface  area  enables  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  more  contact  area  with  the  electrolyte, and this can facilitate electrochemical reactions and  efﬁ cient penetration of the electrolyte into the active materials,  endowing  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  with  reduced  Na +   ion  diffusion  length,  thus  resulting  in  improved  electrochemical  kinetics.  The  sodium  diffusion  coefﬁ cient  values  calculated  from  EIS  measurements  also  exhibit  that  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  sample  has  the  best  Na +   ion  diffusion  ability.  Besides,  according  to  the  diffusion  formula   t =  L 2 /D   (where   t   is  the  diffusion  time,   L   is  the  diffusion  length  and   D   is  the  diffusion  constant),  the  shorter  diffusion  length  will  provide  shorter  diffusion  time,  leading to better electrochemical property. As the size of the AC  nanospheres  is  only  several  tens  of  nanometers  (Figure  S1a),  the Na +  ions can diffuse through the carbon matrix and intercalate  into  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3    via   relatively  shorter  pathways  in  all directions, viz. the Na +  ion intercalation pathways are threedimensional  in  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC.  While  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  the  diffusion  distances  are  much  longer  due  to  the  larger  size  and  more  dimensions  of  carbon  matrices and less contact areas with the electrolyte. This means  that  the  diffusion  length  in  the  AC  is  the  shortest,  thus  providing  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  the  fastest  Na +   ion  diffusion  and  the  best performance. In addition, as it is identiﬁ ed that the active  material  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  dispersed  in  the  carbon  matrix  from  TEM  images,  the  carbon  matrices  perform  as  conductive  network  for  the  electron  transport.  It  can  be  seen  from  the  SEM  images  that  the  carbon  network  formed  from  AC  appears  to  favor better particle connectivity because the morphology of AC  is  ﬁ nely  divided  pellets,  while  for  CNT  network  and  graphite  nanosheet  matrix,  the  intersection  points  or  contact  areas  between  the  particles  are  much  less  than  those  in  AC  matrix.  The  high  surface-to-volume  ratio  and  more  connections  of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  ensures  continuous  pathways  for  electrons  and better contact with electrolyte, hence improve the electronic  conductivities and contribute to rate performance. This can be  certiﬁ ed  from  the  EIS  measurement  that  the  charge-transfer  resistance  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite. The shorter intercalation  distance  for  Na +   ions  and  better  conductive  pathways  for  electrons  in  the  AC  enable  the  higher  sodium  ﬂ ux  across  the interface, and the best electrochemical performance can be  achieved.  Additionally,  the  AC  spheres  provide  the  robustness  and buffers the stress and strain related to the particle volume  expansion/contraction during the sodium intercalation/deintercalation, which are necessary to maintain the structure integrity  as well as the cycling stability of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC. 

 In  conclusion,  NASICON-type  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  dispersed  in  different  carbon  matrices  were  successfully  synthesized  via  a  facile  method.  Their  performance  in  sodium  half  cells  was  compared  and  the  mechanism  of  sodium  diffusion  pathways  in  different  carbon  matrix  dimensions  was  investigated  for  the  ﬁ rst  time.  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   nanograins  dispersed  in  AC  show  the  best  electrochemical  properties,  thus  making  them  a  promising  candidate  for  sodium-ion  batteries.  This  material  exhibits  a  discharge  capacity  of  117.5  mAh  g −1   at  0.5  C  in  the  initial  stage,  approximately  100%  of  the  theoretical  capacity of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  and a very stable cycling performance  of  96.4%  capacity  retention  at  a  5  C  rate  over  200  cycles.  Our  as-synthesized  material  can  be  assembled  into  symmetric  sodium-ion  batteries,  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC  in  the  symmetric  batteries exhibits excellent performance of 80% capacity retention  after  200  cycles  at  1  C,  and  can  tolerate  a  very  high  current rate of 10 C. This superior performance may be attributed  to  the  3D  sodium  intercalation/deintercalation  pathways  and  electron transport, which provides a signiﬁ cantly easier sodium  path and better conductivity compared with Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT  and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite.  Moreover,  the  3D  carbon  framework provides the robustness for the structure during cycling,  thus  endows  this  material  with  excellent  cycling  performance.  Owing  to  the  simple  synthesis  of  the  high-performance  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /carbon material, it is expected to be used in a wide  range of applications in next-generation rechargeable batteries.  The demonstrated symmetric sodium-ion battery performance  with improved safety, longer lifetime, ability of charging in both  directions, and lower cost due to utilizing the same material for  both the cathode and the anode will also provide many opportunities to outclass other competitor systems for operation in the  ﬁ elds of energy storage and transportation.

Firstly,  H 3 PO 4  was slowly introduced into the NH 4 VO 3  solution dropwise under magnetic stirring. When a brownish-red solution was formed, Na 2 CO 3 ,  and  acetylene  carbon  were  added  into  the  solution  and  stirred  for  20  min.  The  mixture  was  continuously  stirred  at  70 °C  for  7  h  to  form  a  homogeneous  suspension.  Then,  the  solution  was  dried  at  70  °C  in  air oven and pre-heated at 300 °C for 4 h in Ar atmosphere. Finally, the  pre-heated  material  was  ground  and  sintered  at  800  °C  for  8  h  under  Ar ﬂ ow to yield Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /AC composite. For Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /CNT and  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /graphite,  the  acetylene  carbon  was  replaced  by  CNTs  and  graphite, respectively.
