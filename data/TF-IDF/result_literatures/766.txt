A composition of NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12)was synthesized by the solid-state reaction method using anew compound Na2HPO42H2O.
The X-ray diffraction patterns of all samples exhibit monoclinic Na3Zr2Si2PO12 asa major phase with a very small amount of monoclinic-ZrO2. The maximum relative density (97 %) and maximumconductivity is obtained in the samples sintered at 1200 ◦C(N3) which is slightly higher than β-Al2O3. The activationenergy is ∼ 0.20 eV for the N3 sample which is lower thanfor β-Al2O3. The dilatometeric study and Arrhenius plotsconfirmed a phase transition of NASICON from monoclinicto rhombohedral.
The micro-structural study of the samples done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicateda significant influence of the processing conditions on themicrostructures.
Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that thesample N3 exhibits minor structural changes compared toother samples.
The X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of monoclinic-Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase along with minor secondary phases.
The crystallite size and volume fraction ofthe m-Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase increased as the sintering temperatureincreased from 1100 ◦C-1200 ◦C.
The ICP-AESresults show the loss of P that leads to the high contentof Na in the present samples.
The sample sintered at 1200◦C (N3) shows a better thermal expansion coefficient andconductivity than other samples.
The TEC of the N3 sampleis in the same range as required for Na/S batteries.
Moreover, the observed conductivity of the N3 sample isslightly higher than that of the β-Al2O3 solid electrolytes.
The presence of a liquid phase in all samples is observedwhich corresponds to well densified grains.
The faceted morphology observed for samples sintered at 1200 ◦C indicate swell grown crystals.
Raman analysis demonstratedthat the sample N3 showed less structural change as comparedto other samples.
The present N3 sample can be usedas a solid electrolyte in Na/S batteries.
