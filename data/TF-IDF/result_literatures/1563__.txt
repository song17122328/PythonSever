Four kinds of NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12, x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75)-based CO2 devices were combined with a L i2CO3–BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase to investigate their CO2 sensing properties. The EMF values of NASICON devices were correlated linearly with the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250–2500 ppm at 450 ◦C. When exposed to 250 ppm CO2 for 200 h under dry condition, the EMF of each NASICON device decreased with aging time. To research the cause of the EMF drift, a mixture that consists of NASICON and Li2CO3 was heated at 750 ◦C in air. From X-ray diffraction measurement, it was confirmed that alkali-rich crystal phases such as Li2ZrO3 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 were formed instead of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase. This suggests that the EMF drift relates with the formation of alkali-rich crystal phase at the interface between NASICON and auxiliary phase.

The measurement of CO2 concentrations was demanded on various fields such as offices, agriculture field and bio-related processes. Several kinds of CO2 sensors with a simple and a compact structure have been proposed so far [1–10]. Among these sensors, the NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 < x < 3))-based potentiometric device combined with an alkaline metal carbonate has become of major interest lately because of an excellent selectivity to CO2 gas, in addition to practical utility in gas sensitivity, response time and commercial price [1 1,12]. However, this type sensor observed the EMF change (EMF drift) under static atmosphere, that is, a lack of long-term stability. Sadaoka et al. pointed out that the EMF drift approaching to a steady state caused the change of ionic activity in auxiliary electrode in consideration of Nernstian equation [13,14]. Since the results of XRD measurement indicated that alkalirich phases such as a Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 a n d a N a4Zr2Si3O12 were formed at the interface between a NASICON and a Li2CO3 auxiliary phase, it was suspected that the diffusion of Li+ into the NASICON phase caused the change of ionic activity. Pasierb et al. investigated on solid-state potentiometric CO2 sensors of the electrochemical cell: CO2, O2, Ag, M2CO3–BaCO3 | NASICON | X, Pt, O2 ( M = L i o r N a , X = N a2Ti6O13/TiO2, N a2Ti6O13/Na2Ti3O7: N a2O activity buffer) [15]. It was suspected that drift phenomena might have brought about the changes of Na+, L i+, N a2O and Li2O activity in the electrode material composition and have attributed to the reaction between carbonate and NASICON. Therefore, it can improve the EMF drift by the control of Na+ or Li+ activities in the electrochemical device. In general, the development of a NASICON-based potentiometric device has been usually carried out by using Na3Zr2Si2PO12 that has the highest ionic conductivity among Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 < x < 3). Therefore, there is not even a single report yet for any NASICONbased CO2 device except for Na3Zr2Si2PO12. In the present study, we tried to obtain the information on the EMF drift of potentiometric NASICON-based CO2 sensor by using NASICON with various Na components. It was fabricated four kinds of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75)-based potentiometric devices and compared those CO2 sensing properties. Furthermore, the effect of an auxiliary phase on the long-term stability of the device was examined using an X-ray diffraction measurement in detail.

Four kinds of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) powders were prepared by a sol–gel technique using Si(OC2H5)4, Zr(OC4H9)4, PO(OC4H9)3 and NaOC2H5 [10]. These alkoxides were stoichiometrically dissolved in an ethanol solvent containing HNO3 with stirring. This operation was carried out in a dry N2 atmosphere and the ethanol solvent was kept at 80 ◦C. Then, the distilled water was added to the ethanol solution for the hydrolysis. The resulting precipitates were dried at 120 ◦C in air for 24 h. After calcined at 750 ◦C in air for 5 h, the precursor powders were compacted into a disk (9 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick). The disk was sintered at 1200 ◦C in air for 5 h and polished with a sand paper. In this paper, NASICON with x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75 is called NASICON (x = 1), NASICON (x = 1.5), NASICON (x = 2) or NASICON (x = 2.75), respectively. An auxiliary phase was synthesized by calcining a mixture of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 powders (1:2 in molar ratio) with Au crucible at 750 ◦C in air for 10 min.

NASICON devices were fabricated by combining the NASICON disks with an auxiliary phase (Li2CO3–BaCO3), as schematically drawn in Fig. 1. The reference electrode was prepared by using Au paste, followed by calcination at 800 ◦C in air for 2 h. On the other hand, the sensing electrode was formed by applying Li2CO3–BaCO3 binary carbonate. Then, the whole assembly was calcined at 750 ◦C in air for 5 min. In order to isolate from water vapor and CO2 gas in atmospheric air, the reference electrode was covered with an inorganic adhesive (TOAGOUSEI, ARON CERAMIC C) as a protective layer. The NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) devices were fixed at the end of a quartz glass tube (9 mm in diameter) with an inorganic adhesive, as shown in Fig. 1.

Gas sensing properties were measured in a conventional gasflow apparatus equipped with a heating facility at 450 ◦C. Sample gases consisting of synthetic air and CO2 were prepared by diluting a parent CO2 gas (5000 ppm CO2 in dry synthetic air) with dry synthetic air. The concentration of CO2 varied in the range of 250–2500 ppm CO2. The sample gases were let to flow over the sensing electrode at a rate of 0.1 dm3/min. On the other hand, the reference electrode was always exposed to static atmospheric air. The electromotive force (EMF) of the sensing device was measured with a digital electrometer.

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to analyze the formation of NASICON phase for four kinds of NASICON synthesized by sol–gel method as compared with JCPDS files. Fig. 2(a)–(d) exhibits XRD patterns of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) after calcination at 1200 ◦C in air for 5 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the formations of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (No. 34-1334), ZrO2 (No. 34-1084), Na2ZrSiO5 (No. 39-0210) and Na5Zr(PO4)3 (No. 37-01 10) phases were identified for NASICON (x = 1, 1.5) powders from XRD patterns. As described later, it is supposed that the appearance of impure phase causes sublimation of P4O10. I n t h e case of NASICON (x = 2), although the formation of ZrO2 (No. 170923) phase was observed at 2? = 3 1◦, N a3Zr2Si2PO12 phase was identified (Fig. 2(c)). On the other hand, NASICON (x = 2.75) was confirmed Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 (No. 36-0351), ZrO2, N a2ZrSiO5 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 phases, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The results of XRD measurements indicate that the decomposition reactions progressed for the synthesis of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5 and 2.75) by calcining, as the following reactions (1)–(3), respectively. 8Na2Zr2SiP2O12 → 3Na3Zr2Si2PO12 + Na2ZrSiO5 + Na5Zr(PO4)3 + 8ZrO2 + 5/2P4O10 + SiO2 (1) 12Na2.5Zr2Si1.5P1.5O12 → 7Na 3Zr2Si2PO12 + 2Na2ZrSiO5 + Na5Zr(PO4)3 + 7ZrO2 + 2P4O10 + 2SiO2 (2) 24Na3.75Zr2Si2.75P0.25O12 → 5Na 3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12+34Na2ZrSiO5 + Na5Zr(PO4)3+3ZrO2 + 20SiO2 (3).

Four kinds of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) were combined with a Li2CO3–BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase to investigate their CO2 sensing properties. The CO2 sensing properties were measured at the range of 250–2500 ppm CO2 at 450 ◦C under dry condition. Firstly, the NASICON-based device was typically fabricated by using NASICON (x = 2) with highest ionic conductivity. Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows EMF response curve to stepwise changing CO2 concentrations and relationship between EMF values and CO2 concentrations for NASICON (x = 2) device. EMF values of the device were increased with increasing CO2 concentration and the device displayed the reproducible response for the change of CO2 concentration from 2500 ppm to 250 ppm. The EMF of the device was correlated linearly with the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250–2500 ppm. In addition, the EMF changes (?EMF) to the variation of CO2 concentrations were given 70 mV. Here, ?EMF represents the EMF change when CO2 concentration is changed from 250 ppm to 2500 ppm. In general, solid-state electrolyte sensors were detected a target gas concentration from the change of electrochemical equilibrium state between the gas and an auxiliary phase of sensing electrode [12]. A cell structure of the NASICON-based CO2 device in the present study is expressed as follows:

where n is the number of electrons associated with the electrode reaction of CO2, P is the partial pressure, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday constant, C is constant of standard electrode potential estimated from Gibbs energy and a is the activity of chemical species such as Li+, N a+, L i2CO3 and Na2O (in NASICON), respectively. The observed EMF is given as a potential difference between the sensing and the reference electrodes. In the present condition, PO2 is kept constant, n is equal to 2.00 in reaction (5). Therefore, the observed EMF (Ecell) can be given by the next equation:

The ?EMF values corresponded to the theoretical value (72 mV) given from Nernstian equation as n = 2.00 (Eq. (10)). According to Nernstian equation, the electron number was evaluated to be n = 2.06 from the experimental EMF slope. These n values are not inconsistent with the n value of electrochemical reaction in Eq. (5). Although the n value was not equal 2.00, this result might include the experimental error. It is well known that the potentiometric NASICON (x = 2) device includes a serious problem that should be improved to practical use [13,14]. The problem is that the EMF of the device continues to drift toward negative potential during the operation under constant CO2 concentration. Therefore, we investigated on EMF behavior of the NASICON (x = 2) device. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between aging time and EMF values of NASICON devices at 450 ◦C in dry condition containing 250 ppm CO2. When exposed to 250 ppm CO2 for 100 h, the EMF of NASICON (x = 2) device decreased with aging time. The EMF of NASICON (x = 2) device was converged within 0.2 mV/h for 70 h. This result coincides with that of the reports in Sadaoka and Pasierb groups [13–15]. Subsequently, the devices used NASICON (x = 1, 1.5 or 2.75) were fabricated and their CO2 sensing properties were investigated in the same order of NASICON (x = 2)-used one. Fig. 5 shows the EMF values as a function of CO2 concentration at 450 ◦C under dry condition for NASICON (x = 1, 1.5 or 2.75) devices. The EMFs of each The results of XRD measurements by Sadaoka et al. indicated that the reaction of Li2CO3 and NASICON proceeded above 400 ◦C [14]. Furthermore, the weight change by TG-DTA measurement was observed at about 700 ◦C by Pasierb et al. [15]. Therefore, to find the cause of the EMF drift, a mixture that consists of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) and Li2CO3 powders (1:1 in mass ratio) were heated at 750 ◦C for 10 min in air and used for an XRD measurement (Fig. 6). As the result, it was confirmed that crystal phases such as Li2ZrO3 (No. 20-0647), ZrO2, N a2Zr(PO4)2 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 were formed instead of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, N a3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 and Na2ZrSiO5 phases confirmed in Fig. 2. It is suspected that the formation of Li2ZrO3, ZrO2, Na2Zr(PO4)2 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 phases caused a reaction of Li2CO3 with Na3Zr2Si2PO12, N a3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 and Na2ZrSiO5, as the following reactions (1 1)–(15), respectively. 

However, Si-containing phases such as Na2SiO3 and SiO2 phases could not be confirmed for the XRD measurements. The phases might be contained as an amorphous phase in the mixture powder. Further investigation is now in progress to obtain more detailed information. The EMFs of the devices went downward during aging treatment, as shown in Fig. 4. In consideration of Nernstian Eq. (9), i t was supposed that the EMF drift of NASICON device was related to the change of activity of Li+, N a2O o r N a+ such as the decrease of aLi+ and aNa2O or the increase of aNa+ . (1) As written in Eqs. (1 1)–(14), the decrease of activity of Li+ in Li2CO3 was brought about the reaction of Li2CO3 with NASICON components (Na3Zr2Si2PO12 or Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12) and Na2ZrSiO5. (2) Moreover, the activity of Na2O decreased because of the decomposition of NASICON components by reaction with Li2CO3. (3) On the other hand, the activity of Na+ in NASICON might be increased because Li+ in Li2CO3 diffused into the Na+ site in NASICON. In the case of (1) and (2), it was suspected that the disappearance of Na2ZrSiO5 was attributed to be suppressed the change of Na+ activity for the NASICON (x = 2.75) device. The reaction of Li2CO3 with Na2ZrSiO5 may take priority over that of NASICON components as shown in Eq. (15). On the other hand, for the case (3), this prediction is appropriate in consideration of ionic radius of Li+ (59 pm) and Na+ (102 pm) [16]. Consequently, for NASICON (x = 2.75) device, the alkali-rich phase such as a Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 would suppress the diffusion of Li+ in Li2CO3 auxiliary phase into the NASICON phase.

Four kinds of NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12)-based CO2 devices, which were NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75), were combined with a Li2CO3–BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase to investigate their CO2 sensing properties. The following conclusions are drawn from the present study. (1) NASICON (x = 1, 1.5 2 or 2.75) powders synthesized from a sol–gel technique and then XRD measurements were carried out for the powders calcined at 1200 ◦C. Although NASICON (x = 2) was composed of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with containing ZrO2 slightly, NASICON (x = 1 or 1.5) powders were consisted of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and impure phases, such as Na2ZrSiO5, Na5Zr(PO4)3 and ZrO2. In addition, the composition of NASICON (x = 2.75) was mixture phases of Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12, Na2ZrSiO5, N a5Zr(PO4)3 and ZrO2. (2) The EMFs of NASICON (x = 1, 1.5, 2 or 2.75) devices were correlated linearly with the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250–2500 ppm at 450 ◦C. Additionally, the EMF changes of each device was corresponded to the theoretical value calculated from Nernstian equation, respectively. (3) When exposed to 250 ppm CO2 for 200 h under dry condition, the EMFs of NASICON devices decreased with aging time. To research the cause of the EMF drift, a mixture that consists of NASICON and Li2CO3 was heated at 750 ◦C i n a i r . F r o m X - r a y diffraction measurement, it was confirmed that crystal phases such as Li2ZrO3, ZrO2, N a2Zr(PO4)2 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 were formed instead of Li2CO3, N a3Zr2Si2PO12, N a3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 and Na2ZrSiO5 phases. This fact suggests that the EMF drift closely relates with the formation of new crystal phase at the interface between a NASICON and an auxiliary phase.
