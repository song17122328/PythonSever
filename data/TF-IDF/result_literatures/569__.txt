Efficient energy storage is a driving factor propelling myriads of mobile electronics, electric vehicles and stationary electric grid storage. Li-ion batteries have realized these goals in a commercially viable manner with ever increasing penetration to different technology sectors across the globe. While these electronic devices are more evident and appealing to consumers, there has been a growing concern for micro-to-mega grid storage systems. Overall, the modern world demands energy in ‘terawatt’ scale. It needs a multipronged approach with alternate technologies complementing the Li-ion batteries. One such viable approach is to design and implement Na-ion batteries. With the uniform geographical distribution, abundance and materials economy of Na resources as well as a striking operational similarity to Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries have commercial potential, particularly for applications unrestricted by volumetric/gravimetric energy density. In pursuit of the development of Na-ion batteries, suites of oxides, sulfides, fluorides, and polyanionic materials have been reported in addition to several organic complexes. This article gives an overview of recent progress in polyanionic framework compounds, with emphasis on high-voltage candidates consisting of earth abundant elements. Guided by ternary phase diagrams, recently discovered and potential cathode candidates will be discussed gauging their performance, current status, and future perspectives.

Currently, Li-ion batteries are ubiquitous in suites of small-scale consumer electronics, power tools, as well as large-scale power sources driving the (plug-in) hybrid electric transportation and power-grid systems. This manifold consumption of Li has led to its price rise, with raising concerns that Li turns into the new gold that may trigger geopolitical tensions in the future.1-3 To avoid this scenario, Na-ion batteries can play a vital role. Contrary to Li, Na has abundant natural resources with even geographic distribution. In addition to being the fifth-most abundant element in earth's crust, the Na charge carrier is also the second lightest alkali element in the periodic table. In this context, mammoth effort has been geared to build efficient Na-ion batteries.4-30

2D layered oxides are the most important category of cathode materials, which has been proven by their dominance in commercial Li-ion batteries. Although the only difference is the intercalation ion, the electrochemical behavior and structure transformation of Na analogs are very different to that in Li-ion batteries. These are mainly caused by the larger size of Na, which can stabilize the layered structure (empirical stability criterion for ABO2: rB/rA <0.86 for α-NaFeO2 type structure) and thus prevent Na from occupying tetrahedral sites and promote Na cation ordering.31 NaMO2 compounds can retain the layered structure for all 3d transition elements M, whereas Co and Ni are the exclusive 3d transition metals that can offer ground state stability of layered structure of LiMO2. Thereby, intensive survey for a variety of NaMO2 compounds was performed.4-6, 32 However, even with the inherently stable structural nature of NaMO2 compounds, they usually suffer from a slopy voltage profile distributed over a wide potential range at lower average voltage (at least 0.3 V and in many cases over 0.5 V) as compared to the Li analog, identifying only a few complicated compounds that can generate >3.5 V versus Na/Na+.

Development of high voltage cathode materials is of paramount importance for Na batteries, bearing in mind the relative difference in anode potential of Li/Li+: −3.03 V and Na/Na+: −2.71 V versus NHE. With an essential lack of high-voltage layered cathode material, polyanion compounds form a major stream toward the stable cathode materials operating over 3.5 V in Na batteries. Light and small polyanion units such as (SO4)2−, (PO4)3−, (BO3)3−, (SiO4)4−, which have also been widely explored as major components in Li-ion battery cathodes,33-62 offer two major functions; i) raising the redox potential largely as compared to the simple oxides with identical redox couple, and ii) providing inherent safety to the battery system. These two very important features led olivine LiFePO4 to a great commercial success in the Li battery market over a decade ago,35, 37, 38, 63 proving that additional atoms X (X = P in this case), other than closed-packed constituent anions (O) and charge transporting/compensating cations (Li and Fe), are not to be excluded in materials design. The high voltage generation by polyanionic cathodes, can be explained by the inductive effect, which is a widely accepted concept based on molecular orbital principles of the local chemical bonding of the cation–anion–cation linkage (Figure 1).64, 65 Figure 1 is a schematic energy level diagram showing the interaction between the transition metal M 3d and O 2sp orbitals. Covalent interaction results in antibonding orbitals of mainly M 3d characters (upper portion) and bonding orbitals mainly of O 2sp characters (lower portion) (Figure 1). When the covalency between M–O is stronger, the energy splitting between antibonding and bonding orbitals will be larger, and the antibonding orbitals will be pushed up. Consequently, the energy difference (Δ, Figure 1) between antibonding orbitals and vacuum will be smaller and hence will result in lower redox potential. The inductive effect comes into play when another atom X is introduced to form MOX bonds. If X has stronger electronegativity than M, the covalency between MO will be lowered, which leads to higher Δ and hence higher voltage. To improve the redox voltage, the polyanionic groups (XO4)n−(Z)m− (X = B, P, S, Si, etc., and Z = F, OH , etc.) were introduced in cathode materials, resulting in an increased voltage as compared to oxide compounds.

Although the inductive effect can roughly explain the overall tendency of the operating voltage, the thermodynamic expression of the cell voltage as a difference of chemical potential of Li in cathode and anode is more definitive and essential, leading to the simple equation ignoring PV and TS terms

where the relative difference of the phase stability of charged and discharged state are diagnostic and can be easily calculated by ab initio in cursive please computational methods.

The purpose of this review is to overview the present status of polyanionic compounds for Na batteries, particularly for high-voltage materials composed of earth-abundant elements. Ternary compositional diagrams will be provided throughout the review to visualize compositional strategies and to spot experimentally explored as well as unexplored regions, which deserve further experimental/computational screening.

The saga of Na-ion battery runs parallel to that of Li-ion batteries dating back to early 1980s, both starting with AxCoO2 (A = Li/ Na) layered cobalt oxides as insertion host. The commercial success of Li-ion battery forced the development of Na-ion battery into a two decade long hibernation. Over the past decade, there has been intensive effort on Na batteries with focus on suites of transition metal oxides [NaxTMO2; TM = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Ti, V, Cr] and their solid-solutions, broadly assuming O3- and P2-type structure.66 However, the large size of Na+ species often leads to a disruptive structural change developing multiple step-wise voltage profiles in layered oxides. Upon charging, oxygen evolution can be triggered leading to safety issues. While these oxides have high theoretical capacity, they deliver relatively low redox potentials. Additionally, these oxides can be hygroscopic leading to their air poisoning. To circumvent these issues, various polyanionic framework compounds can be employed as efficient Na-insertion systems. Similar to the Li-ion case, various phosphate-based compounds are the most widely explored polyanionic insertion hosts offering an ideal combination of ease of synthesis/handling, high redox voltage, chemical/thermal stability and safe operation. As illustrated in the ternary diagram (Figure 2), various thermodynamically stable PO4-based compositions can be employed for reversible Na+ insertion. Putting PO43− groups on anvil, diverse polyanionic frameworks can be realized by i) edge/corner sharing coordination of simple PO43− units, ii) existence of multiple PO43− units forming metaphosphates and pyrophosphates, iii) combination of mixed polyanions (e.g., PO4-P2O7) and iv) combination of PO43− units with other anions (e.g., F−, OH−, N3−). In the following section, we have summarized various PO4-based polyanionic insertion compounds for Na-ion batteries, which are enlisted in Table 1.

Probably the oldest PO4-based polyanionic systems are NASICON-type compounds. Owing to their structural similarity with Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 having very fast Na+ conductivity, they are named as Na+ SuperIonic CONductor (NASICON).67 Na3V2(PO4)3 is a NASICON-type Na insertion host having a 3D rhombohedral framework (symmetry R-3c) consisting of isolated VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra connected strictly by corner-sharing manner. Na occupies two distinct sites with open channels (Figure 3a).68, 69 A recent study has shown the occurrence of four polymorphs of Na3V2(PO4)3 at different temperature regime.70 The Na+ (de)insertion analysis found two distinct plateaus involving V4+/V3+ plateau at 3.4 V and V3+/V2+ plateau at 1.6 V, which enables the construction of a symmetric cell.71-74 The 1.6 V activity has been discussed in the anode section. The 3.4 V plateau involves a two-phase reaction mechanism between Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 involving preferential Na+ extraction from a particular site.75-77 The electrochemical performance can be greatly enhanced by using a thin layer of carbon coating as well as suitable electrolytes (e.g., NaFSI/PC) leading to a capacity approaching 100 mAh g−1 with excellent rate kinetics and cycling stability (Figure 3b). Also in a full cell, Na3V2(PO4)3 displays attractive electrochemical properties as it was shown for instance by Ren et al. for Na3V2(PO4)3// NaTi2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3//hard carbon batteries.78, 79 Recently, the Fe-homologue [Na3Fe2(PO4)3] has been shown to deliver ≈60 mAh g−1 with a 2.5 V Fe4+/Fe3+ activity.80

In the history of Li-ion batteries, triphylite LiFePO4 has a unique mention being the first polyanionic-type cathode material to see successful commercialization. Inspired by the success of LiFePO4, isostructural NaFePO4 was explored as Na insertion host. Unlike LiFePO4, NaFePO4 exists in two distinct olivine polymorphs having an orthorhombic framework (S.G. Pnma) (Figure 4): low-temperature (metastable) triphylite phase (t-NaFePO4) that undergoes irreversible phase transition to form thermodynamically stable maricite phase (m-NaFePO4) over 480 °C.81 t-NaFePO4 is built from corner-sharing FeO6 octahedra, which are connected to PO4 tetrahedra by edge-sharing manner thereby creating slight distortion in FeO6 units. Isostructural to LiFePO4, it has 1D Na+ diffusion pathways along the b-axis suitable for electrode application. In contrast, m-NaFePO4 has edge-sharing FeO6 octahedra that are abridged to PO4 tetrahedra by corner-sharing manner leaving no channels for Na+ migration. The principal difference between t-NaFePO4 and m-NaFePO4 is the connectivity (corner-sharing and edge-sharing) between FeO6 octahedra. While m-NaFePO4 can be directly synthesized via solid-state synthesis, t-NaFePO4 can be obtained by chemical/electrochemical Na+ insertion into heterosite FePO4 derived from LiFePO4 via chemical oxidation.82, 83 Low temperature topochemical as well as aqueous-based electrochemically driven ion exchange routes can also be employed to stabilize t-NaFePO4.30, 84

At a first glance, t-NaFePO4 seems promising for Na-ion batteries. t-NaFePO4 was found to deliver a reversible capacity over 120 mAh g−1 with a two-step voltage profile locating the average Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential at 2.8 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 4a).83 Unlike LiFePO4, charging of t-NaFePO4 develops an intermediate Na0.7FePO4 phase. This intermediate phase appears to compensate the large volume change/strain (≈15%) owing to Na/vacancy ordering during desodiation.85, 86 During charge of t-NaFePO4, a solid–solution (single-phase) redox reaction proceeds from NaFePO4 to the Na0.7FePO4 intermediate phase followed by a two-phase reaction between Na0.7FePO4 and FePO4. Upon discharge, a complex redox process occurs involving three NaxFePO4 (x = 0, 0.7, 1) phases.87, 88 Poor rate kinetics were observed owing to higher charge transfer resistance, lower Na+ diffusion coefficient and larger ionic size of Na+. NaMnPO4 also exists in triphylite and maricite phases. The triphylite NaMnPO4 as well as Na(Fe0.5Mn0.5)PO4 can be prepared by topochemical reaction.30 However, they offer poor electrochemical activity. In a recent report, ion exchange based triphylite NaMnPO4 has been shown to deliver a capacity over 85 mAh g−1 with ≈4 V Mn3+/Mn2+ redox activity.89 This activity is enabled by intimate mixing of carbon additive and reducing any Na/Mn antisite defects.

Owing to the lack of Na+ migration channels, m-NaFePO4 was originally considered to be electrochemically inactive.90 However, a recent study has revealed the possibility to extract Na+ completely by nanosizing m-NaFePO4. Synergy between experimental and computational tools revealed the formation of amorphous FePO4 (a-FePO4) during the first desodiation of m-NaFePO4. a-FePO4 has a very small Na+ migration barrier favoring reversible (de)insertion of Na+ with a 2.6 V Fe-redox activity leading to a capacity over 140 mAh g−1 with excellent cycling stability (Figure 4b).91 Several reports have followed confirming the electrochemical activity in nanoscale m-NaFePO4 as well as a-FePO4 phases.92, 93 Hagiwara's group recently showed that m-NaFePO4 can also be cycled in an ionic liquid electrolyte, where it delivered a reversible capacity of 80 mAh g−1 at C/20 and up to 100 mAh g−1 at C/2 after 120 cycles at 363 K.94 Under these conditions the structural framework of m-NaFePO4 remains stable as shown by ex situ XRD measurements after 100 cycles. Neither amorphisation nor decreasing crystallinity were observed.

While there is no report on triphylite and maricite polymorphs of NaCoPO4, recently a metastable red-phase NaCoPO4 has been reported by microwave-assisted synthesis.95 It stabilizes in a monoclinic system (S.G. P21/c) built from CoO5 trigonal bipyramids connected to PO4 tetrahedra to form large tunnels locating Na+ species. Moderate electrochemical activity with capacities over 30 mAh g−1 with a Co3+/Co2+ redox activity located between 4.1–4.4 V versus Na/Na+ was reported. It warrants further investigation to realize efficient electrode performance.

When phosphate compounds are exposed to high-temperature, they are prone to decomposition/oxygen evolution, thereby forming oxygen deficient compositions (2 PO4 → P2O7). This forms the pyrophosphate class of polyanionic compounds. Various alkali metal pyrophosphates (A2−xMP2O7, A = Li/Na/Ag, M = 3d metals) have been explored since the early 1960s with successful demonstration of Li+ insertion.96 While various Na-based pyrophosphates were characterized by mineralogists showing open frameworks, surprisingly they were never tested in Na batteries. In 2012, Na2FeP2O7 was reported as the first pyrophosphate-type Na insertion material.97-99 Prepared by solid-state, solution combustion and glass-ceramic routes, the target Na2FeP2O7 was found to have a triclinic framework (symmetry P-1) (Figure 5a). It has corner-sharing FeO6 octahedral dimers [forming Fe2O11 dimers], which are bridged with constituent PO4 tetrahedra by both corner-sharing and edge-sharing manner. The Na atoms occupy as many as four probable sites with varying degree of occupancy.100 Even with micrometric particles, the as-synthesized product delivered reversible capacity near 85 mAh g−1 (1 electron theoretical capacity ≈97 mAh g−1). Interestingly, it involves a multiple step-wise (de)sodiation process with a central Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential at 3 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 5b). It was impressive to notice excellent rate kinetics in this cathode without further optimization, which can be rooted to the existence of 3D Na+ diffusion channels with low migration barriers (≈0.5 eV).101 Additionally, the charged state of this compound was found to have adequate thermal stability involving an irreversible phase transition at high temperature without any decomposition and/or gas evolution. It imparts operational safety to Na2FeP2O7 cathode. On another note, isostructural yet off-stoichiometric Na-deficient pyrophosphate [Na1.66Fe1.17P2O7] was reported having higher theoretical capacity (≈110 mAh g−1).102 Involving more than 1 electron activity, it imparts higher discharge capacity with fast rate kinetics.

Following, isostructural Na2MnP2O7 phase was reported as a 3.6 V cathode having a capacity of 80 mAh g−1, albeit with a high degree of polarization and poor rate kinetics owing to the poor activity of Mn.103 Soon followed the report on isostructural rose-colored Na2CoP2O7 prepared by defect-controlled synthesis. It led to a reversible capacity of ≈80 mAh g−1 with an unprecedented 4 V Co3+/Co2+ redox potential.104 Unlike Na2FeP2O7, Na2CoP2O7 exists in three distinct polymorphs. While the metastable (low temperature) phase assume triclinic structure, solid-state synthesis invariably forms the thermodynamically stable orthorhombic polymorph (symmetry Pna21) with a commensurate layered structure having slabs of [Co(P2O7)]2− built from CoO4 and PO4 tetrahedra.105 It delivers a reversible capacity approaching 80 mAh g−1 with a gradually sloping voltage profile and an average Co3+/Co2+ redox potential at 3 V versus Na/Na+. Expanding the pyrophosphate chemistry further, two vanadium based analogs have been reported. NaVP2O7 with a monoclinic structure (symmetry P21/c) was shown to have a V4+/V3+ activity at 3.4 V although with limited reversible capacity (≈40 mAh g−1).106 While the V3+ state is unstable, V4+-based Na2(VO)P2O7 was reported by low-temperature (≈400 °C) solid-state synthesis. It has a tetragonal framework (P4bm symmetry) built from VOO4 (VO5) square pyramids networked to PO4 tetrahedra. It delivered a reversible capacity approaching 80 mAh g−1 with a V5+/V4+ redox potential centered at 3.8 V versus Na/Na+.107

Overall, the pyrophosphate systems form a fundamentally interesting cathode family with rich structural diversity and (de)sodiation behavior. Nevertheless, similar to the Li2−xMP2O7 systems, it is difficult to realize two-electron reaction leading to complete desodiation. Thus, the realizable capacity in Na2−xMP2O7 is low, making them impractical for real-life usages. Research should be geared to find ways to extract two-electron reaction, controlling (off-)stoichiometry and to discover novel Na2MP2O7 (M = Ti, Cu, Cr) pyrophosphate systems for fundamental studies.

As illustrated in the previous section, pyrophosphates offer rich structural diversity and polymorphism owing to the arrangement of corner-sharing P2O7 (PO4-PO4) units in linear or twisted manner. When isolated PO43− units are present along with P2O74− units, mixed phosphates are formed as first reported by Sanz et al.108 With a general formula of Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = 3d metals like Co, Mn, Ni), it forms a 3D orthorhombic framework (space group: Pn21a) consisting of corner/edge-sharing MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra.109 The PO4 units share one edge and two corners with neighboring MO6 octahedra so as to develop a pseudo-layered structure along the bc-plane. These layers are in turn bridged by P2O7 pyrophosphate units along the a-axis creating large tunnels hosting Na+ cations in four distinct sites.

In 2012, Fe-based mixed phosphate homologue [Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7] was first employed as Na insertion host. Involving a three electron reaction, it delivered a reversible capacity of 105 mAh g−1 with a step-wise voltage profile locating the average Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential at 3.2 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 6a).110 Though having high molecular weight, the mixed phosphate delivers a high theoretical capacity (≈129 mAh g−1) exceeding that of pyrophosphates owing to the reversible extraction of three Na+ ions. With moderate rate kinetics, it delivered excellent cycling retention. Detailed structural investigation revealed a solid-solution redox mechanism with minimal 4% volume change involving distortion of the P2O7 units.111 Following, in an effort to improve the energy density, isostructural Na4Co3(PO4)2P2O7 was probed for Na insertion. Reversible (de)sodiation with a capacity exceeding 95 mAh g−1 was observed with a 4.5 V Co3+/Co2+ redox potential, benchmarking the highest ever redox potential for Na battery materials (Figure 6b).109 These mixed phosphates have 3D Na+ diffusion pathways with low migration barriers (0.2–0.24 eV) and high diffusion coefficients (DNa = 10−10–10−11 cm2s−1) that favor efficient and high rate (de)sodiation activity.112 Similar to layered transition metal oxides, it depicts multiple distinct voltage plateaus indicating a progressive phase transition involving Na-ion structural ordering. It is expected that doping of Fe/Co sites with other 3d metals can deliver high energy density mixed-metal phosphates.

Pursuing mixed phosphates further, vanadium-based Na7V4(PO4)P2O7 host was reported having a tetragonal structure with P-421c symmetry.113 It has PO4 units attached to four VO6 octahedra. The adjacent VO6 units are bridged by P2O7 pyrophosphate units in corner-sharing fashion. With 3D Na+ migration pathways, Na7V4(PO4)P2O7 exhibited a capacity around 80 mAh g−1 involving a two-phase V4+/V3+ redox activity centered at 3.88 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 6c). Mixed phosphates are rare examples of cathode systems with multiple electron activity having a good combination of electrochemical performance, operational safety and thereby possible commercial prospects.

Increasing the relative population of PO4 tetrahedra around MO6 octahedra can lead to a structural diversity as evident by going from phosphate to mixed phosphates [PO43− → P2O74− → (PO4)2(P2O7)10−]. Metaphosphates [NaTM(PO3)3] form one such PO4-based polyanionic family. Lin et al. introduced solid-state prepared NaFe(PO3)3 as a potential Na insertion host, albeit without any success in extracting Na+ species.114 Isostructural to NaCd(PO3)3, it has an orthorhombic framework with P212121 symmetry, built from interconnected PO4 tetrahedra and FeO6 octahedra having 12 distinct P atoms. Each PO4 tetrahedron shares its corners with two neighboring PO4 units finally having all PO4 tetrahedra with two shared and two terminal O atoms each. They form a corrugated 1D PO3− channel along a-axis. These chains are connected by FeO6 octahedra locating the constituent Na atoms in four crystallographically distinct sites having open migration channels with large Na+ migration barrier (≈1.17 eV). Gond et al. employed solution combustion synthesis to make carbon-coated metaphosphate NaFe1−xMnx(PO3)3 (x = 0–1) solid-solution phases.115 With restricted grain growth and due cathode optimization, the electrochemical activity of NaFe(PO3)3 was enabled showing a 2.8 V Fe3+/Fe2+ redox activity with a capacity over 20 mAh g−1. While it is limited by low theoretical capacity (≈85 mAh g−1), it marks metaphosphates as Na insertion materials.

In an effort to increase the electrochemical activity, recently NaCo(PO3)3 has been reported having an orthorhombic structure (S.G. Pa-3) very similar to NaFe(PO3)3.116 With relatively lower Na+ migration barrier of 1.1 eV, it delivers a reversible discharge capacity over 50 mAh g−1 involving a Co3+/Co2+ redox potential at 3.2 V versus Na/Na+. Limited by theoretical capacity, metaphosphates have poor practical application.

While the metaphosphate suffer from poor electrochemical activity, their nitrogenated derivative [Na3TM(PO3)3N] have been recently unveiled as promising Na battery electrodes. The presence of N can improve the energy density owing to its high mass per charge ratio thereby giving high theoretical capacity and inductive effect induced high redox potential. In this spirit, Liu et al. reported the first nitridophosphate Na3Ti(PO3)3N.117 The cubic framework compound with P213 symmetry consists of TiO6 octahedra corner-sharing with three neighboring PO3N to form [(PO3)3N]6− building blocks. The constituent Na+ occupies three distinct sites, with at least two sites having easy migration pathways. Indeed, reversible Na+ extraction was realized with a Ti4+/Ti3+ redox activity centered at 2.7 V versus Na/Na+ giving rise to 67 mAh g−1 (1 electron theoretical capacity ≈74 mAh g−1). It undergoes solid-solution (single-phase) redox mechanism involving an extremely small volume change (≈0.5%), beneficial for long-term cycling. Although interesting, this compound is limited by net theoretical capacity, which can be enhanced by extracting multiple Na+ using a multivalent transition metal redox center (V/Cr). Taking this clue, recently isostructural Na3V(PO3)3N has been synthesized by ammonolysis route.118, 119 With a solid-solution route involving negligible 0.25% volume change, it delivered a reversible capacity exceeding 70 mAh g−1 with a 4 V V4+/V3+ redox activity. With its high energy density, cycling stability and rate kinetics, it can be a promising cathode for high power Na battery. Effort should be geared to realize two-electron reaction by employing suitable electrolytes and unveil the electrochemical activity in Cr analog.

The redox potential can be improved by using electronegative anions via inductive effect as shown in nitridophosphate in an earlier section. This potential increment can be more pronounced if electronegative F− with high ionicity can be used in PO4-based systems, thereby forming the fluorophosphate class of polyanionic electrodes. Barker et al. introduced NaVPO4F as the first such Na insertion host.120 Having a tetragonal structure with I4/mmm symmetry, NaVPO4F consists of VO4F2 octahedra (bridged by F vertex) that are connected with PO4 tetrahedra placing the Na+ in open channels. A full cell was fabricated versus hard carbon anode showing a two-step voltage profile with average V4+/V3+ redox potential at 3.7 V delivering a capacity over 80 mAh g−1. Following, a low-temperature monoclinic NaVPO4F polymorph with C2/c symmetry was reported.121, 122 It delivered a capacity approaching 100 mAh g−1 in full cell configuration involving two-step redox plateaus at 3.4 and 3.7 V versus Na/Na+. The electrochemical activity of NaVPO4F polymorphs can be optimized by carbon coating and Cr doping.121, 122 The synthesis of phase pure NaVPO4F is tricky often leading to deviation in its stoichiometry. It is more probable to obtain V4+ based Na1.5VOPO4F0.5 instead of NaVPO4F.123 This Na-rich Na1.5VOPO4F0.5 compound is built from VO5F octahedra (bridged by F vertex) and PO4 tetrahedra units. It delivers a reversible capacity of 87 mAh g−1 (theoretical capacity = 156 mAh g−1) with a distinct two-step redox activity at 3.6 and 4 V. The electrochemical activity can be tuned by changing the relative ratio of O and F, with higher F content delivering higher redox voltage. Deviating from Na1.5VOPO4F0.5, isostructural Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 compound was prepared comprising of both VO5F and VO4F2 octahedra along with PO4 tetrahedra.124 Involving a two-step V5+/V3.8+ redox activity at 3.61 and 4.02 V versus Na/Na+, Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 delivers a reversible capacity exceeding 135 mAh g−1 with good cycling stability and high rate kinetics (Figure 7a). A full cell including Na1.5VPO4.8F0.7 and a graphite anode reaches a capacity of 103 mAh g−1 based on the anode active material.125 It demonstrates a good example of designing superior cathodes solely by stoichiometry control. On another note, tetragonal frameworked (P42/mnm symmetry) isostructural Na1.5MPO4F1.5 (M = V, Ti, Fe) fluorophosphates were reported by two-step solid-state synthesis.126, 127 While poor discharge capacity was obtained for Na1.5FePO4F1.5 (≈40 mAh g−1) and Na1.5TiPO4F1.5 (≈60 mAh g−1), reversible capacity exceeding 160 mAh g−1 was obtained for Na1.5VPO4F1.5 involving two high-voltage V4+/V3+ redox plateaus (at 4.1 and 3.6 V) and a low voltage V3+/V2+ redox plateau at 1.2 V (Figure 7b).126, 128-132 This compound was found to work in full cell configuration against NaTi2(PO4)3 counter electrode with high capacity close to 110 mAh g−1 and excellent rate kinetics.127 Recently, Na-rich Na3+xV2(PO4)2F3 (x ≤ 1) was synthesized by ball-milling Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with Na or Na3P.133 It was found that Na3.5V2(PO4)2F3 cycled in a full cell against carbon provides a significantly increased discharge capacity compared to Na3V2(PO4)2F owing to the additional Na, which compensates for the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation.

While V-based systems inherently offer high voltage, toxicity and cost of vanadium are a serious drawback. An Fe-based candidate would be ideal. Combining PO43− and F− anions, Na2FePO4F was unveiled isostructural to Na2FePO4OH and Na2CoPO4F.134 It assumes a layered orthorhombic framework with Pbcn symmetry. It is built from face-sharing FeO4F2 octahedra forming Fe2O7F2 bioctahedra, which are arranged into parallel chains along a-axis by sharing corners via F atoms. These chains are interconnected by PO4 tetrahedra along c-axis to form (FePO4F)∞ infinite slabs delimiting two distinct crystallographic sites for Na atoms (Figure 8a). Efficient Na+ (de)intercalation from Na2FePO4F has been reported involving a two-step voltage profile (plateaus at 2.91 and 3.06 V) with an average Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential centered at 3 V leading to a capacity over 100 mAh g−1 with good rate kinetics (Figure 8b).135-137 This electrochemical activity can be attributed to 2D Na+ diffusion pathways with low migration barrier of 0.5–0.6 eV. The isostructural Na2CoPO4F end-member was also found to deliver over 100 mAh g−1 capacity involving a Co3+/Co2+ redox activity at 4.3 V, albeit with poor cycling stability.138-140 The Mn-analog Na2MnPO4F deviates from Na2FePO4F structure, where MnO4F2 octahedra share corners to form Mn2F2O8 chains abridged by PO4 tetrahedra forming a 3D monoclinic (S.G. P21/n) structure. With proper cathode optimization, capacity over 100 mAh g−1 was obtained, albeit with large polarization and gradual capacity fading.141, 142 Among them, Na2FePO4F is the most promising material for possible practical application.

Exploring the PO4 chemistry, the alluaudite family of compounds has been reported.143 Delmas' group first reported the structure and electrochemical activity of NaMnFe2(PO4)3 setting them as open framework systems.144 Assuming the naturally occurring alluaudite mineral structure (monoclinic, S.G. C2/c), it has a general formula of X(2)X(1)M(1)M(2)2(PO4)3 where X and M are cation written with decreasing ionic radii. The overall framework is built from infinite chains consisting of M(2)O6 and distorted M(1)O6 octahedra. These chains are in turn bridged by PO4 tetrahedra in corner-sharing manner to develop two distinct sets of voids.145 These voids can be partially or completely filled by Na+ species. The target alluaudite was found to be active delivering over 50 mAh g−1 with an average Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential of 2.7 V versus Na/Na+. Despite having large Na+ migration channels, poor electrochemical activity and slow rate was observed. In another attempt, various Na2Fe3−xMnx(PO4)3 alluaudites were tested showing a reversible capacity close to 140 mAh g−1.146 Several other NaxFe3(PO4)3 (x = 1.702, 1.86) alluaudites have been recently reported, where due cathode optimization with ball milling has enabled high reversible capacity close to 140 mAh g−1 involving a distinct 3 V activity.147, 148 Co- and Ni-based alluaudites have been reported with dual cathode/anode operation giving rise to capacity over 100 mAh g−1 with an average potential of 3 V.149

Overall, while alluaudites form an interesting system, they suffer from low redox potential and poor electrochemical activity, limiting their practical application. One approach may be to switch to SO4-based alluaudites as described in the following section.

While PO4-based insertion materials offer scalable synthesis, robust chemical/thermal stability, minimal moisture attack and electrochemical operational safety, it is limited on account of the overall redox potential. The polyanionic cathodes have limited theoretical capacity owing to the inevitable dead weight from polyanion units, thereby lowering the achievable energy density. It can be compensated by increasing the redox potential by using electronegative anion units. Probing Pauling's electronegativity values,150 theoretically SO4-based compounds should offer the highest possible redox potential in isostructural polyanionic frameworks. With this spirit, benchmarking against tavorite structured LiFePO4F fluorophosphate, Tarascon's group discovered isostructural LiFeSO4F as a high voltage cathode (≈3.6 V vs Li/Li+).151, 152 It led to the unravelling of fluorosulfates, their derivatives and numerous sulfate-based insertion hosts for Li- and Na-ion batteries.54, 153 Following, we are reporting various SO4-based polyanionic insertion compounds designed for Na-ion batteries, which can be spotted on the ternary diagram (Figure 9). The structural and electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2.

Inspired by the observation of the highest Fe3+/Fe2+ redox voltage (3.6–3.9 V vs Li/Li+) in Li-based fluorosulfates,51, 151 attention was drawn to explore Na metal fluorosulfates [NaMSO4F, M = 3d metals]. This erstwhile unknown family was unraveled by topotactic reaction between NaF and MSO4·H2O monohydrate precursors by low temperature (T <300 °C) routes like ionothermal, solid-state and dissolution-precipitation methods.154-156 Due to the large cationic size of Na+ (116 pm: Na+CN = 6), deviating from the LiMSO4F tavorite structure (triclinic, P-1), the NaMSO4F sulfates adopt a maxwellite framework (monoclinic, C2/c) with higher symmetry (Figure 10a). They are built from chains of corner-sharing MO4F2 octahedra along [001] direction abridged by isolated SO4 tetrahedra having the Na+ ions in cavities. The NaMSO4F fluorosulfate series has two anomalies: i) observation of Jahn-Teller instability in NaCuSO4F with highly distorted CuO4F2 octahedra, and ii) deviation from maxwellite to triplite structure in case of NaMnSO4F.

While NaMSO4F have similar ionic conductivity (≈10−7 S cm−1) as LiMSO4F counterparts, they were mostly electrochemically inactive. A very small degree of Na+ (de)insertion was noticed in case of NaFeSO4F with a clear plateau at 3.5 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 10b). This poor activity was further corroborated during chemical oxidation and ion-exchange reactions. Atomistic modeling revealed three root causes behind this poor electrochemical activity: i) the feasibility of 1D zigzag Na+ diffusion along100 direction versus the 3D Li+ diffusion in LiMSO4F, ii) large volume change during (de)sodiation (≈16%), and iii) high activation energy barrier (≈0.9 eV) hindering Na+ diffusion.157

Despite several optimization efforts, the activity of NaFeSO4F remained abysmal. In search of suitable Na+ insertion host, potassium fluorosulfate analogs [KMSO4F] were synthesized by reacting KF with MSO4·H2O monohydrates.158 KFeSO4F was prepared by annealing the precursor mixture sealed inside an evacuated quartz tube at 380 °C for prolonged duration (4 days) to compensate for the slow diffusion of K+. The large cationic size of K+ (152 pm: K+CN=6) led to structural deviation from Li- and Na-analogs. The KMSO4F fluorosulfates were found to have KTiOPO4 (KTP)-type orthorhombic structure with Pna21 symmetry (Figure 10c). They consist of distorted [MO4F2] octahedral chains abridged by SO4 tetrahedra, where the F species have alternate cis and trans positions. The buckling of these chains along [011] and [0-11] directions develops large cavities accommodating K+ ions. Upon chemical oxidation, it forms an orthorhombic FeSO4F polymorph with Pnna symmetry having large open cavities, which allow efficient Na+ (de)insertion leading to a capacity over 120 mAh g−1 involving a flat step-wise voltage profile centered at 3.5 V (Figure 10d). Overall, fluorosulfates forms an interesting family capable of high voltage insertion of Li (3.6–3.9 V), Na (3.6 V) and K (4 V) stemming from the combined electronegativity of SO42− and F− anions.158 While pristine NaFeSO4F was found to be inactive, it was possible to realize Na+ (de)insertion in KFeSO4F derivatives. Further exploration should focus on unravelling unknown fluorosulfates such as i) vanadyl analogs [A(VO)SO4F, A = Li/Na/K] and ii) ammonium analogs [(NH4)MSO4F].

Unlike PO4-compounds, these fluorosulfates are prone to moisture attack with possible formation of hydrated derivatives. In fact, synthetic hydrated fluorosulfates can be prepared by dissolution and precipitation route.159 These NaMSO4F·2H2O compounds assume an uklonskovite structure (monoclinic, S.G. P21/m) built from parallel chains of MO4F2 octahedra where two O atoms are bridged to H atoms to form structural H2O units. These chain structures have open cavities occupied by constituent Na+. Nevertheless, they were found to be electrochemically inactive similar to NaMSO4F. However, these NaMSO4F·2H2O materials can be used to form anhydrous NaMSO4F fluorosulfates. One can attempt to form novel KMSO4F·nH2O and study their Na+ insertion behavior.

While the alkali metal fluorosulfates have high redox potential stemming from the electronegativity of both SO42− and F− species, their presence (particularly F−) make them prone to moisture attack and chemical degradation. This materials stability issue can be partly circumvented by omitting F− species altogether. Using this clue, fluorine-free bisulfate polymorphs [e.g., Li2Fe(SO4)2] have been reported as high voltage (≈3.8 V vs Li/Li+) cathodes for Li-ion batteries.46, 48 Parallel efforts were focused on Na metal bisulfate [Na2M(SO4)2, M = 3d metals] phases. Nonetheless, these phases are highly hygroscopic with a tendency to form hydrated bisulfates [Na2M(SO4)2·nH2O, n = 0, 2, 4].153 It is tricky to form anhydrous bisulfate directly, but can be derived by controlled dehydration of hydrated bisulfates [Na2M(SO4)2·4H2O → Na2M(SO4)2·2H2O → Na2M(SO4)2].

Na2M(SO4)2·4H2O (M = Fe, Co) belong to bloedite mineral family that can be easily prepared by dissolution and precipitation of Na2SO4 and MSO4·7H2O polyhydrate precursors in aqueous media using alcohol.47 Isostructural to Na2Mg(SO4)2·4H2O bloedite, they form a monoclinic structure (S.G. P21/c) consisting of isolated MO2(OH2)4 octahedra where four O atoms are each linked to 2 H atoms to form four units of structural H2O. The remaining two O atoms are abridged with SO4 tetrahedra, thereby forming M(SO4)2(H2O)4 blocks with Na+ occupying large voids. Bloedite Na2Fe(SO4)2·4H2O was found to be redox active at slow rate of C/50 (i.e., 1 Na+ in 50 h) delivering over 50 mAh g−1 with a sloping voltage profile. The average Fe3+/Fe2+ potential was found to be 3.3 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 11a). In addition to the low capacity, ex situ XRD analyses revealed material instability with progressive amorphisation of bloedite phase upon charging.

Following, kröhnkite type Na2Fe(SO4)2·2H2O compound was discovered by following previous synthesis protocol albeit without using any alcohol.160 This kröhnkite compound, having a monoclinic P21/c structure, is built from isolated MO4(OH2)2 octahedra with two O atoms each linked to 2 H atoms so as to form two units of structural water. The other four O atoms are connected to four SO4 tetrahedra, thus delimiting tortuous Na+ diffusion pathways. A reversible capacity close to 70 mAh g−1 involving a 3.25 V Fe3+/Fe2+ redox activity was noticed at a faster rate of C/20 (i.e., 1 Na+ in 20 h). Unlike bloedite, kröhnkite delivers excellent reversibility and material stability.

Both bloedite and kröhnkite can be used as starting materials to get anhydrous Na2Fe(SO4)2 by dehydration. The direct synthesis of Na2Fe(SO4)2 is tricky, often leading to the formation of thermodynamically stable Na6Fe(SO4)4 phase. Na2Fe(SO4)2 assumes monoclinic structure with FeO6 octahedra sharing O atoms with five SO4 tetrahedra. When tested in Na half cell, it delivers a reversible capacity over 60 mAh g−1 involving an Fe redox potential of 3.4 V versus Na/Na+ (Figure 11b).47 Overall, these hydrated and anhydrous bisulfates have open channels for Na+ migration and are electrochemically active. However, with issues related to materials stability and limited capacity, they do not have practical usages.

While all these bisulfates are Fe2+-based compounds, Goodenough group reported the first Fe3+-based bisulfate: an eldfellite class of NaFe(SO4)2 cathode.161 It was synthesized from a solution of NaHCO3 and NH4Fe(SO4)2 involving low temperature annealing at 200–350 °C. It belongs to the eldfellite mineral group assuming a monoclinic structure with C2/m symmetry. The framework is built from layers of edge-sharing FeO6 octahedra interconnected by SO4 tetrahedra forming large voids enabling 2D Na+ migration pathways (Figure 11c). The as-synthesized material exhibited reversible Na (de)insertion leading to a discharge capacity of 80 mAh g−1. The central Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential lies at 3.2 V versus Na/Na+. Ex-situ XRD examination confirmed the occurrence of single-phase redox mechanism with moderate rate kinetics. It is important to note the sodiation (discharging) of eldfellite NaFe(SO4)2 can form a new polymorph of Na2Fe(SO4)2 that is structurally different than the Na2Fe(SO4)2 derived from bloedite and/or kröhnkite.

Similar to hydroxyphosphates (NaMPO4OH), the substitution of F− by OH− species in fluorosulfates can lead to hydroxysulfates (NaMSO4OH) insertion materials. Surprisingly, NaMSO4OH family is yet to be discovered. However, exploring the Na-Fe-SO4-OH system, four phases have been reported. They are Na0.84Fe2.86(SO4)2(OH)6 (jarosite), NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 (natrojarosite), Na2FeOH(SO4)2·H2O (metasideronatrite) and Na2FeOH(SO4)2.3H2O (sideronatrite). Pralong's group reported NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6 as the first hydroxysulfate-based Na insertion compound.162, 163 The target jarosite was prepared by precipitation of precursor solution containing Na2SO4 and Fe2(SO4)3·nH2O. This jarosite compound adopts a trigonal structure with R-3m symmetry having layered framework built from corner-sharing FeO4(OH)2 octahedral chains. These chains are in turn connected by SO4 tetrahedra to form hexagonal voids accommodating Na+ ions. This host framework has ample cavities to insert multiple alkali ions.

When tested in Na half-cell architecture, reversible uptake of 2 Na+ (per f.u.) was observed leading to a capacity of 120 mAh g−1 with an average Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential of 2.72 V versus Na/Na+. It showed good cycling stability involving sloping voltage profiles indicating an underlying solid-solution redox mechanism. Interestingly, Na+ insertion transforms the crystalline jarosite into an amorphous Na3Fe3(SO4)2(OH)6 phase. XRD and TEM study suggested reversible topotactic transformation of crystalline jarosite to its amorphous sodiated derivative. The jarosite building layers [Fe3(SO)4(OH)6] are very thin, which can be distorted, corrugated and separated from neighboring layers during sodiation while keeping all the polydehral features and interatomic bonds intact. In contrast, desodiation relaxes the local strains leading back to jarosite crystalline structure. Although the capacity and redox voltage are low thereby ruling out any practical application, this jarosite system paves way for exploration of amorphous polyanionic phases as possible insertion host for Na batteries.

All these sulfate insertion compounds either suffer from poor electrochemical activity and/ or moderate redox potential (<3.4 V). In addition, several of them are prone to material degradation. In search of a high energy-density sulfate insertion system, Yamada's group unveiled an alluaudite class of material Na2Fe2(SO4)3.164, 165 This compound can be synthesized by conventional solid-state synthesis by low temperature (350 °C) annealing using Na2SO4 and FeSO4 precursors. Its desodiated analog can remind of the earlier reported NASICON class of 3.3 V Fe2(SO4)3.166 However, the alluaudite sulfate was found to be strikingly different than NASICON counterpart.167 Assuming a monoclinic framework (with C2/c symmetry), it is built from isolated edge-sharing FeO6 octahedra forming Fe2O10 dimers. These dimers are abridged by SO4 tetrahedra to build an open framework system having three distinct Na sites. While the Na1 site is fully occupied having no diffusion pathways, the partially occupied Na2 and Na3 sites are situated in large cavities (Figure 12a) having 1D Na+ diffusion pathways along c-axis. This sulfate alluaudite can be expressed as AA′BM2(SO4)3, isostructural to the previous described PO4-based alluaudites NaFeMn2(PO4)3. While alluaudites were originally discovered by mineralogists studying various phosphate-based minerals, Na2Fe2(SO4)3 forms the first SO4-based alluaudite compound. Unlike the PO4-analog, sulfate alluaudite has all Fe in +2 redox state, allowing complete desodiation with a single redox couple. It has paved way for unraveling other 3d-metal based analogs.168-170

The Na2Fe2(SO4)3 alluaudite exhibited efficient Na+ (de)insertion delivering a reversible capacity ≈100 mAh g−1 with an unprecedented 3.8 V Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential (Figure 12b). It involves multistep charge–discharge profiles with partial redox occurring at 3.42, 3.8, and 4.04 V versus Na/Na+. It benchmarks the highest Fe-redox potential ever reported for any Fe-based cathode for Na-ion batteries. This high-voltage operation can originate from i) rich presence of electronegative SO42− units around Fe redox center, and ii) the existence of edge-sharing octahedral dimers with short Fe–Fe distance, which increases the Gibbs free energy in the charged state. Na2Fe2(SO4)3 insertion compound delivered excellent rate kinetics and cycling stability despite having large micrometric particles without any carbon coating. Alluaudite sulfate was found to involve 1D Na+ diffusion with single-phase (solid solution) redox mechanism having a volume change of 3.5% during (de)sodiation process.171, 172 It was noticed during the first desodiation step, an irreversible structural rearrangement occurred leading to a small degree of Na–Fe antisite defect. Owing to the high redox potential, Na2Fe2(SO4)3 offers high energy density comparable to the best known Fe-based Na oxide cathode as well as many state-of-the-art Li-ion battery materials. This high energy density with safe operation potential (≈4 V) leads to a commercially viable Na insertion host. Furthermore, Na2Fe2(SO4)3 was successfully cycled in a full cell against CNF (carbon nanofibers).173

However, alluaudite sulfate has a few issues. While initially it was thought to form Na2Fe2(SO4)3, following works revealed the inherent tendency to form off-stoichiometric (Na-rich and Fe-deficient) Na2+2xFe2−x(SO4)3 (x = 0.18–0.22).174 This off-stoichiometry limits the degree of desodiation thereby limiting the theoretical capacity to 100 mAh g−1. The degree of off-stoichiometry can be tuned, but synthesis of completely stoichiometric Na2Fe2(SO4)3 remains a puzzle. Further, it is difficult to realize complete desodiation to form Fe2(SO4)3 as progressive desodiation leads to high degree of FeO6 distortion making the structure unstable.175 Research effort should be focused on synthetic strategies to obtain fully stoichiometric Na2Fe2(SO4)3 and achieve complete (de)sodiation by various cathode optimization methods. Sulfate (XO4, X = S) alluaudite can be extended to other alluaudite systems (XO4, X = Mo, V, W, As, etc.). There has been recent successes in Mo-based alluaudite Na2.67Mn1.67(MoO4)3 as the first Mn-based alluaudite showing 3.45 V activity.176 In addition to the discovery of these new alluaudites, effort can be geared toward development of nitrogen containing derivatives such as Na3Fe3(SO4)2(SO3N).177

Overall, SO4-based polyanionic insertion compounds deliver high redox potential (hence energy density) stemming from the electronegative SO4 units (inductive effect). They can be prepared by low temperature routes (T < 350 °C), making the synthesis sustainable. However, they are inherently hygroscopic and should be handled in inert atmosphere. Sulfates are economic precursors and often found as byproducts of industrial/agricultural processes. So, tapping SO4-species with abundant Na and Fe sources can in theory realize economic Na–Fe–S–O cathode materials for high energy-density Na battery for large-scale grid storage.

Owing to their low cost and large abundance, Li-based silicates have been intensively studied as cathode materials. Compounds such as Li2FeSiO4 display a large variety of polymorphs and attractive electrochemical performances.44, 178 Therefore, in the quest for new cathode materials for Na-ion batteries, their Na counterparts became of increasing interest and recent research efforts have been dedicated to the exploration of new thermodynamically stable Na-based silicates (Figure 13). The redox potential of silicates is lower than the ones for sulfates or phosphates due to the weaker inductive effect. However, given the low stability window of current electrolytes, this drawback might be an advantage. Furthermore, the lower molecular weight of the SiO44− group is beneficial in terms of capacity. The various silicate-based cathode materials are summarized in Table 3.

In the past few years, the Na2MSiO4 phases with M = Mn, Fe and Co have been identified as possible cathode materials for Na-ion batteries. Na2MnSiO4 is prepared via a sol–gel synthesis approach including an in situ carbon coating with sucrose.42 The structure can be described in the monoclinic space group Pn and consists of isolated MO4 tetrahedra that are connected only via SiO4 tetrahedra (Figure 14). Na is located in the so formed channels running along the c-axis. The first electrochemical activity reported for Na2MnSiO4 was actually in a Li-ion battery, where Na+ was replaced by Li+ upon cycling giving a capacity of 60 mAh g−1.42

Following this work, Na2MnSiO4 was then cycled in a Na half-cell using a Na[FSA]–[C3C1pyrr][FSA] (FSA = bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide anion and C3C1pyrr =N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium cation) ionic liquid electrolyte in the temperature range of 298–363 K.179 Electrochemical cycling revealed a potential of 3.0 V versus Na/Na+ and a capacity of 70 mAh g−1 (298 K) and 125 mAh g−1 (363 K) at C/10. Ex situ XRD experiments showed that the Na2MnSiO4 structure collapses upon Na+ extraction and cannot be recovered upon discharge, which explains the different curve shapes of the first and second cycle. However, the amorphous phase seems still to be capable of reversible Na+ intercalation/deintercalation. For a Na2MnSiO4/graphene composite, the initial discharge capacity of Na2MnSiO4 can be further increased to 182.4 mAh g−1 at C/10 at room temperature.180 An even higher capacity for Na2MnSiO4 was later reached by Law et al., who added 5% of vinylene carbonate to the electrolyte.181 Their initial capacity of 155 mAh g−1 increased to 210 mAh g−1 after 10 cycles (Figure 15b). This corresponds to the reversible cycling of 1.5 Na+. The improved cycling performance (higher capacity and better capacity retention) was attributed to the formation of a passivation film on the electrode, which prevents Mn dissolution into the electrolyte. In this study, no amorphisation was observed and the structure of Na2MnSiO4 remained stable throughout cycling shown by ex situ XRD measurements after various discharge cycles.181

Also Na2FeSiO4 displays electrochemical activity as reported by Kee et al.182 Stabilized via a solvothermal synthesis followed by an annealing step, Na2FeSiO4 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (S.G. P1). Special attention is required for the synthesis of Na2FeSiO4 since too short heating duration results in low yields, while too long heating leads to decomposition. Furthermore, Fe3O4 and Na2SiO3 impurities were systematically detected in the final compound. When cycled at C/40, Na2FeSiO4 shows an average potential of 1.6 V versus Na/Na+ and a capacity of 126 mAh g−1. Like Na2MnSiO4, monoclinic Na2FeSiO4 becomes irreversibly amorphous after the first charge. Published at the same time, another study presented a cubic Na2FeSiO4 phase (S.G. F-43m), which can be synthesized by sol–gel and solid-state reaction.183 Temperature and heating duration determine the structure of the final compound. The monoclinic phase is heated at 230 °C for 7 d in ethylene glycol/ethanol and then further annealed at 300 °C for 2 d. Its cubic counterpart forms upon heating at 120 °C for 10 h in ethylene glycol followed by heating at 500 °C for 10 h. Cubic Na2FeSiO4 exhibits an average potential of 1.9 V versus Na/Na+ corresponding to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple and a capacity of 106 mAh g−1 (C/16). In contrast to the monoclinic Na2FeSiO4 phase, the cubic one presents a high structural stability and good cycling stability.

Na2CoSiO4 can be prepared either via solid-sate synthesis or co-precipitation followed by a thermal treatment.184 Na2CoSiO4 formed via solid-state method crystallizes in the monoclinic Pn unit cell. Na2CoSiO4 prepared by co-precipitation is stabilized either in monoclinic Pn or orthorhombic Pbca space groups depending on the synthesis conditions (heating with or without NaCl flux). The structural difference between the monoclinic and orthorhombic phases is that for the former, Co and Si are on distinct sites, while in the latter they share one crystallographic site. Galvanostatic cycling of the monoclinic sample revealed reversible capacities over 100 mAh g−1, while the orthorhombic phase reaches a slightly higher capacity of 125 mAh g−1.

In early 2017, Panigrahi et al. reported on a new Na2Fe2Si2O7 orthosilicate, which was synthesized via a classic solid-sate reaction.185 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted redox voltages between 2.23 and 2.56 V versus Na/Na+, which lie in the electrolyte stability window and thus make this compound a potential cathode material for Na-ion batteries. Na2Fe2Si2O7 crystallizes in the monoclinic P121/n1 unit cell and consists of 1D chains, which are built out of corner- and edge-sharing distorted FeO5 bipyramids and FeO4 tetrahedra (Figure 16a). The chains are further connected through Si2O7 units. The so formed channels running along [001] direction were identified as possible Na+ diffusion pathways by bond valence sum (BVS) calculations (inset Figure 16b). However, despite the moderate operating potentials and the existing diffusion channels, galvanostatic cycling of Na2Fe2Si2O7 revealed a capacity of merely 20 mAh g−1 (theoretical capacity: 164.5 mAh g−1) (Figure 16b). Low electronic conductivity as well as surface side reactions might be responsible for the poor electrochemical activity.

Owing to the low weight of the SiO44− unit, silicate-based cathode materials show attractive theoretical capacities (Table 3). However, only few compounds have been studied so far and as can be seen on the ternary diagram (Figure 13) there are still some unexplored sections. Especially in combination with high-voltage transition metals, the low inductive effect of silicates could be compensated, which might lead to a high overall energy density.

One of the major drawbacks of the above-described SO42− and PO43− polyanions is their large molecular weight, which is detrimental to the capacity of the cathode. Borates, however, being the lightest polyanion, can drastically reduce the dead weight of the cathode material and thus increase the gravimetric capacity. Another advantage of borate-based compounds is the different oxygen coordination states that boron can occur in (Figure 17), which offer a large variety of structural frameworks that might be susceptible for cation intercalation.186, 187 Indeed, over 200 various borate-based minerals have been reported,188 which offer a wide choice of potentially attractive cathode materials. However, only few compounds have been reported so far (Figure 18; Table 4).

In spite of these advantages, borates have been only little studied for their electrochemical properties. In 2001, LiFeBO3 was firstly presented as a possible cathode material for Li-ion batteries.55-58, 190 However, it was only in 2015 that the first borate-based compounds, namely borophosphates, for Na-ion batteries were published.191, 192 Borophosphates came into focus owing to their combination of the light-weighted BO4 and the strong inductive effect of the PO4 polyanion.191 Three compounds with the formula Li0.8Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O, NaFe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O and (NH4)0.75Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·0.25H2O were simultaneously studied by Tao et al. and Asl et al. They are stabilized via a hydrothermal synthesis approach and crystallize in the hexagonal space groups P6522 (Li0.8Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O; (NH4)0.75Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·0.25H2O) and P6122 (NaFe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O), respectively. Their structures consist of helices twisted around the c-axis, which are formed by [BP2O8] units. PO4 is connected to two BO4 tetrahedra via the oxygen vertices, while BO4 is connected to four PO4. The helices are bridged via FeO6 octahedra, which share their oxygen vertices with four PO4 and two H2O.

Electrochemical measurements in a Na half cell show that Li+ can be extracted from Li0.8Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O during the initial charge and that during the following cycles Na+ can be reversibly (de)intercalated at an average potential of 2.76 V versus Na/Na+ with a capacity of 66.5 mAh g−1.192 (NH4)0.75Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·0.25H2O and NaFe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O both display a redox plateau at 2.9 V versus Na/Na+.191 The former exhibits a reversible capacity of 80 mAh g−1, the latter reaches a capacity of 66 mAh g−1 during first charge, which then decreases drastically during the following cycles.

A year later, Strauss et al. reported on the novel Na pentaborates Na3MB5O10 with M = Fe and Co, which are stabilized via a solid-state synthesis approach.189, 193 Na3MB5O10 crystallizes in the orthorhombic unit cell Pbca for M = Fe (isostructural to Na3MgB5O10194) and in the monoclinic space group P21/n for M = Co. Both compounds present a similar structure, which is built from MO4 tetrahedra linked with all four vertices to [B5O10]5− units (Figure 19a,b). These units are formed from BO4 tetrahedra connected to three BO3 trigonal-planar entities (Figure 17). The MO4-B5O10 network forms layers in the ab-plane, which are stacked along the c-axis. The Na cations are located between the layers. Electrochemical tests in a Na half cell revealed a redox potential of 2.5 V versus Na/Na+ for Na3FeB5O10 (Figure 19c), whereas for Na3CoB5O10 no electrochemical response was detected. The lower potential of Na3FeB5O10 as compared to sulfate- and phosphate-based polyanionic materials does not come as a surprise given the weaker inductive effect of borates compared to PO43− and SO42−. Even though the possibility of Na intercalation/deintercalation in Na3FeB5O10 has been proven, it is not a suitable cathode material since it shows a large hysteresis suggesting limited kinetics. AC/DC measurements revealed that, indeed, Na3FeB5O10 as well as Na3CoB5O10 suffers from low electronic conductivity. Moreover, Na3CoB5O10 also displays a low ionic conductivity at room temperature, which is held responsible for the lack of redox activity.

Hybrid organic/inorganic cathode materials for Na-ion batteries are still a rather unexplored field and only in recent years, reports on carbonophosphates and oxalates have discussed their electrochemical properties for battery applications (Table 5). The advantage of organic polyanions is again their low molecular weight and low cost. Furthermore, due to their versatility in terms of ligands (malonate, fumarate, oxalate, etc.) and coordination modes (monodentate, bidentate, etc.) they offer a large variety of crystal structures, which could be potentially interesting for cation insertion.195-197

Chen et al. introduced the family of carbonophosphates (Na3MPO4CO3, M = Mn, Fe) as potentially attractive cathode materials for Li-ion batteries and they showed in a follow-up study their equally interesting properties for Na-ion batteries.198-201 Sidorenkite Na3MnPO4CO3, which is synthesized via hydrothermal synthesis approach, crystallizes in the monoclinic unit cell P21/m.199 The structure consists of layers in the bc-plane built of isolated MnO6 octahedra, which are linked to four PO4 tetrahedra via their oxygen vertices and which share one edge with a CO3 group. Na occupies two different sites in the anionic framework. Na3MnPO4CO3, when cycled against Na, shows two plateaus corresponding to the Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couples with an average potential of 3.7 V versus Na/Na+. The electrochemical process undergoes a solid-solution mechanism. A capacity of nearly 200 mAh g−1 is obtained during first charge (theoretical capacity: 190 mAh g−1), but drops significantly during the first discharge and eventually stabilizes at around 100 mAh g−1 after several cycles at a C/100 rate.

First principles calculations revealed that Na3MnPO4CO3 has 3D diffusion pathways with rather low activation barriers as compared to other polyanionic compounds, which makes them susceptible for fast charging rates.202 However, Na3MnPO4CO3 suffers from a low electronic conductivity, which was tried to improve by i) increasing the carbon content, ii) decreasing the particle size and avoiding structural defects, and iii) stabilizing a hybrid Na3MnPO4CO3/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite.203-205

Fe-based Na3MPO4CO3 has been stabilized in form of nanoplates via hydrothermal synthesis.206 Electrochemical tests showed a stable capacity of 96 mAh g−1 with an average potential of 2.6 V versus Na/Na+. In situ XANES measurements revealed that, in analogy to Na3MnPO4CO3, the Fe3+/Fe2+ and Fe4+/Fe3+ redox couples are electrochemically activated.206

Another organic-based polyanionic compound with reversible Na+ (de)intercalation is the iron-oxalate K4Na2[Fe(C2O4)2]3·2H2O.207 Its open framework structure, where Fe2+ sits in the center of an octahedra and is connected to six oxalate units via their oxygen atoms, allows K+/Na+ diffusion along 1D channels. On charge, two plateaus at 3.6 V and 3.9 V versus Na/Na+ are observed with an overall capacity of 54.5 mAh g−1 (extraction of K+). The following discharge delivers 50.2 mAh g−1 at 2.7 V versus Na/Na+ (insertion of Na+).

A recent study by Yao et al. describes the electrochemistry of Na2Fe(C2O4)F2.208 This novel compound is stabilized via a hydrothermal synthesis approach. Its structure can be described in the monoclinic space group C2/c and consists of [FeO4F2] octahedra, which are connected via their oxygen vertices. They are further bridged via an oxalate group. Each oxalate group in turn is linked to three [FeO4F2] octahedra. The [Fe(C2O4)F2]2− units form zigzag-chains along the b-axis with Na being located between the chains. Galvanostatic cycling in a Na half cell reveals two plateaus on charge (3.3 V and 3.6 V versus Na/Na+) and two on discharge (2.95 and 3.25 V versus Na/Na+) with a capacity of 70 mAh g−1, which corresponds to the reversible insertion of 0.56 Na+.

Further reported carboxylate-based compounds are the oxalate Na2Fe2(C2O4)3·2H2O, malonate Na2Fe(H2C3O4)2·2H2O and Fe2(C2O4)3·4H2O. However, they were cycled in Li-ion batteries only and the electrochemical properties against Na need yet to be explored.195, 209

In parallel to the search for the ideal cathode material, also the quest for a suitable anode is still demanding intensive research. Commonly used anodes for Na-ion batteries are amongst others hard carbon and Sb- and Sn-based compounds.11, 210-212 However, their major drawbacks are dendrite formation and volume expansion. An alternative to these materials are transition metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4, Na2Ti3O7)213-215 or polyanions such as NaTi2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 (Table 6). Owing to the moderate redox potentials of the Ti4+/Ti3+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples, they can function as cathodes as well as anodes.

Since NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) displays a rather high potential for an anode (2.1 V), the risk of SEI formation and Na deposition are significantly decreased, thus improving the coulombic efficiency and safety.216-218 However, NTP still suffers from a low conductivity, which is why a large number of studies focuses on the optimization of its electrochemical performance via different synthesis approaches and coatings. These include solvothermal synthesis forming NTP microflowers, the formation of a graphene network via hydrothermal synthesis, nanoparticles via sol–gel synthesis and solid state reaction for a carbon and rutile TiO2 coating – just to name a few.217, 219-224 Promising results were obtained by Wu et al., who prepared mesoporous NTP nanoparticles embedded in a 3D graphene network via hydrothermal synthesis followed by a calcination step.217 Tested in a Na half cell, the so prepared NTP phase shows a stable cycling over time with a retention of 100 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 1 C and a coulombic efficiency of 98% (Figure 20a). The mesoporous nanoparticles allow a faster electron/ion conduction within the crystal, which is reflected in the low polarization even at higher rates (Figure 20b). The graphene network stabilizes the material and further improves the electron conductivity. These joint effects significantly improve the electrochemical performances of this compound as compared to nanoparticles without the graphene network.217

When cycled at lower potential, NTP shows an additional plateau at 0.4 V versus Na/Na+ attributed to the Ti3+/Ti2+ redox couple to form Na4Ti2(PO4)3 (Figure 22).225 This finding encouraged the building of a symmetric cell using Na3Ti2(PO4)3 as cathode and anode and resulted in an average potential of 1.5 V.225

Park et al. compared for the first time the electrochemical performance of NTP in an organic and aqueous electrolyte (Figure 23a).226 NTP shows reversible Ti4+/Ti3+ redox activity in aqueous Na2SO4 and NaOH electrolytes, where the latter is slightly disadvantageous due to a faster capacity fading. Since the Na+ insertion occurs above the formation potential of H2, no water decomposition is observed.224, 226 The capacity of NTP, carbothermally treated at 800 °C, in a neutral aqueous (Na2SO4) and nonaqueous (NaClO4/EC:DMC) electrolyte is in the same range (123 mAh g−1 versus 120 mAh g−1); however, the polarization is significantly smaller in Na2SO4 (Figure 23a), which is related to the lower viscosity and higher conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte. This is also reflected in the improved rate capability and capacity retention as compared to the cycling properties in an organic electrolyte (Figure 23b).

Following this study, NTP has been explored as an anode in a variety of aqueous battery systems, where NTP was cycled against Na3V2(PO4)3, Na0.44MnO2 and Na3V2O2x(PO4)2F3−2x cathodes.227-231 Promising results were obtained for the NTP/Na0.44MnO2 system, where capacities of up to 130 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C and an energy density of around 30 Wh kg−1 can be reached.228, 229 An alternative electrolyte to Na2SO4 is aqueous Na-acetate, which was examined in a NTP/NaMnO2 full cell.232

Also Ti2(SO4)3 cycles on the Ti3+/Ti2+ redox couple and was identified as a possible anode material for Na-ion batteries.233 Ti2(SO4)3 exhibits two pseudo-plateaus on reduction (1.0 and 1.5 V vs Na/Na+) and two plateaus upon oxidation (1.10 and 1.64 V vs Na/Na+). It can reversibly uptake 1.7 Na+, which corresponds to 120 mAh g−1, with however a low capacity retention.

Besides the plateau at 3.37 V versus Na/Na+, the NASICON-type phase Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits also low-potential plateaus at 1.6 V versus Na/Na+ and 0.3 V versus Na/Na+, which corresponds to the reduction of V3+ to V2+ (Figure 24a,b).234-236 During these two redox processes Na3V2(PO4)3 is reduced to Na4V2(PO4)3 and Na5V2(PO4)3 inserting the additional Na+ on the Na3 site (Figure 24c). Even at such low potentials, carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 displays attractive electrochemical features with a reversible capacity of 149 mAh g−1 (0.1 C) and a capacity retention of 91% at 0.5 C after 50 cycles (inset Figure 24b). The higher effective capacity as compared to the theoretical one (117 mAh g−1) is ascribed to a contribution of carbon.235

Since Na3V2(PO4)3 can be oxidized at high potentials and reduced at low potentials, it was implicated in a symmetric battery system.236 The full cell, which consisted of Na3V2(PO4)3 nanofibers on both sides, showed two plateaus at 0.5 and 1.5 V, a reversible capacity of 106.2 mAh g−1 and an energy density of 92 Wh kg−1. Equally good electrochemical performances were observed for a symmetric cell containing Na3V2(PO4)3 dispersed in acetylene carbon nanospheres.237 The redox reactions on the electrodes in the full cell are the following 236, 237

Na2VTi(PO4)3 was synthesized via a sol–gel synthesis approach with a following annealing step at 800 °C.238 It crystallizes in the NASICON structure, where Ti4+ and V3+ are statistically distributed on the same site. In a half cell, Na2VTi(PO4)3 shows a plateau at 3.4 V versus Na/Na+ upon charge and three plateaus at 3.4, 2.1, and 1.6 V versus Na/Na+ on discharge. The three plateaus correspond to the stepwise reduction of V4+ to V3+ and further to V2+ and Ti4+ to Ti3+. The Na2VTi(PO4)3 symmetric full cell exhibits two redox potentials at 1.2 and 1.7 V and charge and discharge capacities of 78 mAh g−1 and 72 mAh g−1.

Electrode materials for Na-ion batteries are characterized by their “rich-chemistry” essentially due to the sharp contrast in size of Na+ and the transition metal ions, which leads to the stabilization of a larger number of functional structures with continuous Na+ diffusion pathways as compared to Li-based ones. Motivated by a rapidly increasing demand for middle-to-large scale stationary batteries, a broad variety of electrode materials has been identified in a short period of time over the past five years for both layered and polyanionic compounds. In this regard, the database of electrode materials for Na-ion batteries is expanding at a great rate and in the near future should excel the one established for Li-based electrodes.

Even though layered oxides play a crucial role for Li-ion batteries, in the case of Na-ion batteries, they are outperformed by polyanionics in terms of operating voltage and structural stability. However, while ensuring high voltage, stability, and safety, polyanions also suffer from loss of capacity/energy density due to the heavy inactive counter cations (P, S, Si, etc.). Therefore, in most cases a compromise has to be made between high voltage and high capacity as shown in Figure 25.

Among the large number of polyanionic compounds identified so far, the most promising materials are certainly vanadium-based phosphates and fluorophosphates such as Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3, which are widely studied with an eye to their high energy density. Their industrial deployment is yet hampered by the toxicity and cost of vanadium. Another interesting compound is the pyrophosphate Na2FeP2O7, which provides excellent power capability, safety, and cycle stability, but the low operating voltage (3.0 V versus Na/Na+) downgrades its practical value from the energy density viewpoint. Alluaudite Na2Fe2(SO4)3 seems ideal in terms of abundant constituent elements and high-voltage operation. However, the strong hygroscopic nature of sulfate demands careful handling and complicates its practical application.

Besides the weight of the polyanionic unit, also the low electronic conductivity of polyanionic materials might pose problems. However, several strategies have been developed and established in the lithium battery field to circumvent this issue including carbon coatings and the control of particle size and morphology through specific synthesis conditions, which have also showed promising results for Na-based polyanions.

Finding the ideal electrode material, which fulfills the requirements for a wide use in stationary applications, presents still a huge challenge for the battery community and continuous efforts are dedicated to this field as shown in this review. Besides inherent properties of the cathode material such as structural and electrochemical stability, also the electrolyte and anode part play a crucial role to develop a well-functioning Na-ion battery. In this review, we discussed polyanionic anode materials (e.g., V- and Ti-based phosphates), which show attractive electrochemical properties in half cells as well as in full cells (e.g., NaTi2(PO4)3/Na0.44MnO2). In parallel, intensive research is also directed toward the development of new electrolyte systems with increased stability, whose description, however, would go beyond the scope of this review.

In recent years, major technological progress was achieved with the development of first prototype Na-ion batteries, where for instance Faradion (UK) implemented Na-ion cells in electric bikes and first cylindrical commercial prototype Na-ion batteries were produced by joint efforts of the CNRS/RS2E (France).239-242 The rapid pace toward the development of commercial Na-ion batteries demands an intensified exploration of full cells to find the optimum combination of cathode, anode, and electrolyte.

We hope that this summary not only gives an overview of the intensive research work on polyanionic cathode materials done so far, but also reveals the playground of new compositions that have yet to be explored.
