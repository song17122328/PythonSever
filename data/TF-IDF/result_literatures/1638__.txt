Phase transitions and the mobility of proton-containing groups in hydrogen zirconium phosphate HZr2(PO4)3nH2O with the NASICON structure were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, 1H, 31P NMR, IR spectroscopy and TG analysis.
Heating HZr2(PO4)3H2O above 420 K results in dehydration and in a rhombohedral–triclinic phase transition.
Continued heating to about 490 K results in the thermal activation of cation disordering and phase transition of HZr2(PO4)3 from triclinic to rhombohedral phase.
Parameter‘a’of HZr2(PO4)3 lattice decreases during the heating.
It is shown that oxonium ions in HZr2(PO4)3H2O are characterized by high rotation and translation mobility.
Rotation mobility of oxonium ions can be increased by the substitution of zirconium by yttrium or niobium.

Materials with the NASICON structure (AXMY(PO4)3, where A is an alkaline and M is a polyvalent cation) are wellknown as solid state ionic conductors.
Much attention was paid to the examination of lithiumand sodium-based NASICON-type compounds (A = Li or Na).
These materials exhibit a complex polymorphism.
Much less is known about hydrogen analogues.
Clearﬁeld and co-workers have obtained triclinic HZr2(PO4)3 from ammonium form, prepared hydrothermally.
They showed that HZr2(PO4)3 could be converted to rhombohedral HZr2(PO4)3H2O by reﬂuxing in water.
Proton conductivity of HZr2(PO4)3H2O at low temperatures (below 580 K) was described by Subramanian et al..
Conductivity of the hydrated form was shown to be higher in comparison with HZr2(PO4)3. Conductivity data of HZr2(PO4)3H2O, obtained from the lithium analog by ion exchange.
hydrogen zirconium phosphates with the NASICON structure.

Lithium-zirconium phosphates were synthesized using a standard procedure .
Hydrogen forms were prepared by reﬂuxing the lithium forms in nitric acid for 20 days.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to monitor the degree of ion exchange.
TGA data were obtained on STA 449 (Netzsch) in the temperature range 293–1223 K with a heating rate of 10 K/min.
According to TGA data, the asprepared compounds should be formulated as H1XZr2 XMX(PO4)3H2O (X = 0, 0.02 or 0.1, M = Nb, Y).
For all investigated materials degree of exchange was more than 98%.
High temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were obtained by Philips X’pert powder diffractometer, Cu Ka1 radiation.
Heating rate was 5K/min, with delays at constant temperature for XRPD data collection.
Solid state 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained with the use of the Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer with Bruker UltraShield magnet (wide bore 11.7 T magnet installed) at 500.23 and 202.50 MHz.
Samples were spun at 10– 12 kHz at a magic angle.
Chemical shifts were given relative to TMS and 85% aqueous H3PO4. Wide lines 1H NMR spectra were obtained on Tesla BS-567A spectrometer developed for wide lines registration at 90 MHz in 80–320 K temperature range.
IR spectra of the samples in vaseline oil were recorded on a Nexus 870 spectrometer (Nicolet).
On the basis of thermal analysis of the material, the heating of hydrogen zirconium phosphate to 450–550 K resulted in dehydration of the sample accompanied by an endothermic heat transfer as seen in Fig.1. 
Weight loss below 370 K was attributed to absorbed water.
Continued heating results in H1XZr2 XMX(PO4)3H2O decomposition and the formation of condensed phosphates.
This process was accompanied by an endothermic effect at 1080 K.
This data conﬁrm the high thermal stability of the obtained materials.
The strong binding of oxygen atom in the NASICON structure by two polycharge cations (P5+ and Zr4+) results in a decrease in the negative charge and proton–acceptor ability of the oxygen atoms.
Thus, protons of the HPO4 groups are weakly bounded by anions, and hold crystalline water or ammonia comparatively strongly.
On the other hand, decomposition of anhydrous HZr2(PO4)3 requires protons be ‘pulled out’ of the structure, in which they are strongly bounded to the oxygen atom of the phosphateanion.
High values of this bond energy results in higher dehydration temperature.
At room temperature, HZr2(PO4)3H2O and materials doped with niobium and yttrium have rhombohedral symmetry, which agree with the data reported in literature.
Lattice parameters of all obtained materials are close to those for HZr2(PO4)3H2O , changing slightly with heterovalent doping.
Portions of XPRD patterns for HZr2(PO4)3H2O at different temperatures are shown in Fig.2. 
At 420–470 K, a part of reﬂections shifted, and lattice parameters changed sharply from a = 8.7463  0.0006 A˚ and c = 23.790  0.003 A˚.
The observed changes are not typical of usual phase transitions.
XRPD patterns obtained at 420–470 K show a number of reﬂections, which disappeared again at 490 K.
In the 2Q region about 13.88, only one reﬂection (0 1 2) can be observed for rhombohedral phase, which remained unaltered even after phase transition (490 K).
Two satellites of this peak have appeared at 420–470 K.
These reﬂections cannot be attributed either of highor low-temperature rhombohedral phases.
Their presence can be explained assuming that a new low-symmetry intermediate phase can be formed in this temperature range.
Material heating to about 490 K resulted in loss of crystalline water, which decreased proton disordering and proton transport and caused a phase transition to a low-symmetry triclinic phase.
Further heating results in an increase in structural disordering and proton mobility.
As a result, at temperatures higher than 470 K, the triclinic structure becomes unstable, and another transition to a rhombohedral phase takes place.
Water loss causes the observed change in the lattice parameters of a rhombohedral phase.
Thus, the triclinic modiﬁcation of HZr2(PO4)3 can be observed only in a narrow temperature range.
However, on cooling this material, rehydration processes proceed slowly because of difﬁculties for water molecules to move through the narrow bottlenecks.
Thus, at low temperatures HZr2(PO4)3H2O does not form in air.
Therefore proton mobility in anhydrous HZr2(PO4)3 at lower temperatures is substantially lower than that of hydrated form, and cooling of HZr2(PO4)3 yielded a triclinic phase, stable at room temperature (Fig.3).
One of the interesting features of NASICON-type materials appears to be low thermal expansion , which can also be observed for HZr2(PO4)3. 
On heating of this material above phase transition temperature the lattice parameter ‘‘c’’ changes slightly, while the parameter ‘‘a’’ decreases from 8.885  0.002 A˚ at 423 K to 8.848  0.003 A˚ at 773 K (Fig.4).
Structure and surrounding of proton-containing groups plays an important role in proton transfer.
Rudolf et al.have determined the structure of HZr2(PO4)3H2O by neutron diffraction.
They conclude that proton-containing groups in this compound are represented by oxonium-ions and form hydrogen bonds of 2.788 A˚ with the anion.
According to these  1 in IR-spectrum is expected to show the stretching vibrations of OHdata, a wide band with the maximum at 3170 cm  1. 
Intensity of the last band group.
Moreover, there are weak and substantially narrower bands at 3590, 3510 and 3450 cm  1 increases after dehydration, while the maximums at 3590 and 3510 cm  1 represent the stretching represents the stretching vibrations of OH of the HPO4 groups, and at 3590 and 3510 cm vibrations of OH in the water molecules, which are formed as a result of a partial dissociation of oxonium-ions at room  1 with weakly resolved shoulder at temperature.
Vibrations of PO41627 cm tetrahedra and ZrO6-octahedrons remain unchanged during dehydration.
Most probably, low frequency of deformation vibrations of oxonium-ions is caused by the weakness of the hydrogen bonds formed.
31P MAS NMR spectrum of HZr2(PO4)3H2O showed a single line at  25.0 ppm (Fig.5a), that agrees with the structure data on equivalence of phosphorus atoms in this material.
After dehydration, three additional lines at  26.7,  28.0 and  29.5 ppm appear in the spectrum (Fig.5b) due to the decrease in unit cell symmetry and appearance of nonequivalent phosphorus atoms of three types at least.

1H wide line NMR spectrum of HZr2(PO4)3H2O recorded at 80 K is formed by a triplet with the second moment of 27 G2 (Fig.
6a).
The observed spectrum is typical for oxonium-ions.
The calculated distance between protons in the oxonium-ions is about 1.73 A˚ .
This is lower than the value calculated in ref.
Increasing the temperature resulted in a thermal disorder growth.
Thus, at 120 K all oxonium-ions rotate around the third order symmetry axis (Fig.6b).
Oxygen atoms of anion create a trigonal antiprism arrangement about the oxygen of oxonium-ion.
Protons of oxonium-ion can form hydrogen bonds with any of these oxygen atoms (Fig.7a).
According to ref.the activation energy of oxonium-ions rotation is minimal when a sequential reorientation of hydrogen bonds between three electronegative atoms occurs.
In the intermediate state (with maximum activation energy) protons form two tricentric hydrogen bonds with two atoms of oxygen-acceptor (Fig.7b).
An activation energy of rotation calculated for HZr2(PO4)3H2O structure with the hydrogen bond length of 2.788 A˚  is about 24 kJ/mol.
This is comparable with the activation energy of proton jumps along the hydrogen bond .
Further heating results in increasing of oxonium-ions reorientations.
Thus, at room temperature oxonium-ions rotate isotropically, and 9.8% of them take part in the translation mobility (Figs.6c and 7c).
At 328 K this part is about 12.2%.
Similar oxonium-ions mobility was observed in sulfates of trivalent elements with a similar environment of oxonium-ion .
Moreover, at low temperatures oxygen atom of oxonium-ion can displace to the side of one of triangles formed by oxygen atoms and form hydrogen bond with them (Fig.7a).
Probably, it is an explanation of the high O–H bond length (1.136 A˚ ), found by Rudolf et al.

This can be due to partial dissociation of oxonium-ions on protons and water molecules with a slightly different environment.
After dehydration the chemical shift of the most intensive peak remains almost unaltered ( 11.5 ppm), while the peak at  1.3 ppm disappears.
The third one with increased intensity splits into two lines at  5.9 and  6.7 ppm, respectively (Fig.8b).
Doping of HZr2(PO4)3H2O by niobium ions resulted in proton conductivity increase at low temperatures .
Therefore it is interesting to monitor the change of proton-containing groups mobility in doped materials.
1H wide lines NMR spectra of doped materials differ by lower intensity in the range of 10 G (Fig.9).
Thus, oxonium-ions transition into rotation state is much easier in doped materials.
Most probably, the increase in rotation mobility is caused by so-called cooperative effects.
At higher temperatures there is no essential difference in the wide lines NMR spectra of HZr2(PO4)3H2O and doped materials.
Hydrogen zirconium phosphates with the NASICON structure (H1XZr2 XMX(PO4)3H2O, M = Y, Nb) can be considered as promising solid state proton conductors above 920 K.
High symmetry of oxonium environment and low proton–acceptor ability of anions determine high rotation and translation mobility of proton-containing groups.
Moreover, heterovalent doping results in the increase in the rotation mobility of oxonium ions.
