Structures of two K2SnXPO43 X=Fe,Yb phosphates, obtained by conventional solid statereaction techniques at 950 °C, were determined at room temperature by X-ray powder diffractionusing Rietveld analysis.
The two materials exhibit the langbeinite-type structure P213 space group,Z=4.
Cubic unit cell parameter values are: a=9.92174 Å and a=10.15834 Å for K2SnFePO43and K2SnYbPO43, respectively.
Structural refinements show that the two crystallographically independent octahedral sites of symmetry 3 have a mixed Sn/X X=Fe,Yb population althoughordering is stronger in the Yb phase than in the Fe phase.
Materials with general formula AxXXPO43 typicallyconsist of a XXPO43 framework built up by cornersharingXXO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in such a waythat each octahedron is surrounded by six tetrahedra andeach tetrahedron is connected to four octahedral.
These compoundscrystallise mainly with the nasicon NaZr2PO43-typestructure R3¯c space group Hagman and Kierkegaard,1968.
Depending on the size of the A, X, and X cations andthe value of x, the AxXXPO43 compounds can crystallisein other structure types, such as the langbeinite-type orSc2WO43-type.
All these structures are related to each otherby simple distortions and/or rotations of the cationic polyhedra.
The langbeinite structure is a cage structure with large Acations in the cages and small windows connecting thecages.
Consequently the AxXXPO43 langbeinite phasesare generally favored when the A cation is larger than .
One important difference between the two structures is thatin langbeinite the framework creates closed cavities that trapalkali cations, while in nasicon, A+ cations are found in theintersection of tunnels through which they can diffuse.

A+ and A2+cations occupy one of the two fourfold analogous K sites ofthe structurally characterized K2Mg2SO43 mineral langbeinitewhereas X3+ and/or X4+ are located in the two fourfoldMg sites.
More recently, structural characteristics were determinedby powder X-ray diffraction XRD using the Rietveldmethod for ATiFePO43 A=Mn,Ca,Cd,Sr andASnFePO43 A=Na2,Ca,Cd phases Aatiq and Dhoum,2004; Aatiq, 2004; Aatiq and Dhoum, 2006.
All these materialsexhibit the nasicon-type structure.
In a continuation ofour research concerning phosphates with general formulaAxSnXPO43, the principal objective of the present studywas the structural determination, using Rietveld refinementof the XRD patterns, of two phosphates with general formulaK2Sn4+X3+PO43 X=Fe,Yb.
Syntheses of K2SnXPO43 X=Fe,Yb were carried outusing conventional solid-state reaction techniques.
Powdercrystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of K2CO3Riedel-de Haën, 99%, Yb2O3 Prolabo, 99%, Fe2O3 Prolabo,99%, SnO2 Riedel-de Haën, 99.9%, and NH4H2PO4Riedel-de Haën, 9.9% in stoichiometric proportions.
Themixtures were heated progressively with intermittent grindingat 200 °C 12 h, 600 °C 12 h, 800 °C 16 h, and950 °C 48 h in air.

Thedata were collected from 10 to 90° 2, in steps of 0.02°, witha counting time of 14 s per step.
The Rietveld refinement ofthe structure was performed using the FULLPROF programRodriguez-Carvajal, 1997.
The peak positions and intensities of the two XRD patternsfor K2SnFePO43 and K2SnYbPO43 Figures 1 and2 were close to those of langbeinite-type KTi2PO43 P213space group, Z=4 .
Therefore, the twoXRD powder patterns were indexed on a primitive cubic cellwith parameter values of 9.92174 Å and 10.15834 Å forK2SnFePO43 and K2SnYbPO43, respectively.
The unitcell parameter of K2SnYbPO43 is larger than that forK2SnFePO43 because the ionic radius of Yb3+ 0.868 Å islarger than that of Fe3+0.645 Å Shannon, 1976.
In thefollowing discussion, the structural refinements were basedupon the above-mentioned assumption.
Initial starting parameters for the Rietveld refinement ofK2SnXPO43X=Fe,Yb were based on those already reportedfor langbeinite-type KTi2PO43.
 Initially, the two Katoms in K2SnXPO43 were located at the K1 and K2sites 4a positions of langbeinite-type KTi2PO43. 
We alsoinitially located the Sn and B atoms in K2SnXPO43 in thetwo different octahedral Ti1 0.58-0.58-0.58 and Ti20.86-0.86-0.86 sites, respectively.
The P and O atoms wereall located in independent 12b positions.

Based on these results in subsequent refinements forboth materials the occupancies of Sn and X X=Fe,Yb atomsin both crystallographically possible sites were allowedto vary, but the total atomic contents were constrained to beone for Sn and one for X atoms per formula unit.
Finalrefinements led to a mixed Sn/X X=Fe,Yb populationwithin the two crystallographically independent octahedral sites.
The observed, calculated, and difference XRD patternsof K2SnFePO43 and K2SnYbPO43 are given in Figures 1and 2, respectively.
Results of the Rietveld refinement, selectedinteratomic distances, and calculated bond valencesum BVS of K2SnFePO43 are gathered in Tables I and II.
X-ray powder diffraction data, obtained from the “observedintensities” of the Rietveld refinement Cu K1: 1.54056 Å, of K2SnFePO43 are presented in Table III.
The resultsof refinement, selected interatomic distances, and X-raypowder diffraction data of K2SnYbPO43 are reported inTables IV–VI, respectively.
It is noted that ordering of two cations, within a framework,is generally dependent on the size difference and/orcharge imbalance between them.
Indeed, in K2SnXPO43the driving force for Sn/X distribution within the frameworkseems to be the size difference between Sn4+ and the X3+cations.


The two langbeinite K2M2PO43 M=Sn/Fe,Sn/Ybframeworks are built of MO6 octahedra sharing corners withPO4 tetrahedra Figure 3.
A simple description of the framework is based on M2P3O18 units composed of two MO6octahedra linked together by three PO4 tetrahedra.
Each PO4shares two corners with M1O6 octahedra and two cornerswith M2O6 octahedra.
A careful analysis of the interatomicdistance values shows a high dependence between the Sn/Xdistribution and the average M-O distance values.
In fact,in K2SnFePO43 where Sn and Fe are nearly randomly distributed,the M1-O distance value is practically equal tothat of M2-OTable II.
Both M-O distance values arecomparable to the predicted M-O distance 2.07 Å calculatedfrom Shannon’s table rSn4+=0.690 Å, rFe3+=0.645 .
In contrast, because of the high preferencefor the larger Yb3+ ion to occupy the M1 site inK2SnYbPO43, the M1-O distance value is higher thanthat for the M2-O.
Since there is no geometrical constraints,the exact reason behind the high preference of largercation i.e., Yb3+ in K2SnYbPO43 to occupy M1 site isnot clear.
P-O distance values in both phases are comparable tothose generally found in langbeinite-type phosphates TablesII and V.
Within the langbeinite K2M2PO43 M=Sn/Fe,Sn/Yb frameworks, large isolated cages are formed Figures3 and 5.
Recently, an improved visualisation of thecages formed in langbeinite phases, based on M5P6O39 units,has been presented.


The average K1-O andK2-O distance values Tables II and V show that thecage volume, in K2SnYbPO43, is relatively larger than thecorresponding one in K2SnFePO43. 
Analysis of the calculatedbond valence sums BVS based on bond-strength analysis Brown and Altermatt, 1985 for M1 sites, M2 sites,and P and K atoms, within the two K2M2PO43 M=Sn/Fe,Sn/Yb phases agrees with the expected formal oxidationstates of the corresponding cations Tables II and V.
It is interesting to note that the K1 atom can also be describedas being surrounded by four MO6 octahedra in atetrahedral arrangement, while the K2 atom is surroundedby six MO6 octahedra in an octahedral geometry Figure 5.
These two large polyhedra share one triangular face to forma cage of seven MO6 octahedra about two K+ ions.
The twoenclosed K atom types are located at each end of the cage.
As shown in Figure 5b, a careful structural analysis of thelangbeinite framework shows clearly the presence of a tetrahedralEM4 cavity, located opposite the K1M4 tetrahedraand shares one triangular face with K2M6 octahedra.
Theempty E probable site can accommodate a small cation.
Note for example that in K2SnFePO43, Rietveld refinementshows clearly that, in a first approximation, this probablecation can be found at 0.44-0.44-0.44 site 4a positions.
This last assumption leads to a E-O distance values ranging from 2.191 to 2.671 Å.
Therefore, apparently 0.81 Å isa reasonable radius value of the largest cation that could fit in this tetrahedral EM4 cavity.
To our knowledge, there is noexample of a langbeinite structure in which this third possibleposition is occupied.
It should be noted that a similarobservation was recently made for other langbeinites.

Finally it is important to note that in the nasicon framework,there are interconnected interstitial sites through whichunivalent cations can diffuse, leading to fast ionic conductivity.
In contrast, within the langbeinite framework, the channelsbetween the holes have narrow windows, and only isolatedlarge cages, containing a maximum of two atoms, areconsidered.
This fact prevents univalent cation transport; socations of a sufficiently large size remain captive in the cagesand lose their ability to migrate.
This characteristic may be useful in developing materials for the immobilisation oftoxic cations i.e., 137Cs+ from wastes, including radioactivewaste.
It is of interest to note for example that inCs2FeZrPO43 and/or Cs2Mg0.50Zr1.50PO43 langbeinitephases  concentration of 137Cs can reach38 wt %, which is comparable with its concentration in themineral pollucite.
