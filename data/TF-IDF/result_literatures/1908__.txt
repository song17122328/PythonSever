An impedance spectroscopy study of sodium cation-conducting ceramics, including layered compounds Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2, Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2, Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 (structural type O3), Na0.68Ni0.34Ti0.66O2 (P2 type), and NASICON-type Na3Si2Zr1.88Y0.12PO11.94 and Na3.2Si2.2Zr1.88Y0.12P0.8O11.94, showed that their transport properties are essentially independent of partial water vapor pressure at temperatures above 420 K. In the low-temperature range, increasing vapor partial pressure from approximately 0 (dry air) up to 0.46 atm. leads to a reversible increase in the conductivity. The sensitivity of studied materials to air humidity is strongly affected by the ceramic microstructure, being favored by larger boundary area and porosity. Maximum stability in wet atmospheres was found for NASICON ceramics, which also exhibit the highest cationic conduction. 
The average thermal expansion coefﬁcients at 300–1173 K are in the range (13.7–16.0) × 10 −1 for the layered materials and (5.9–6.5) × 10 −6 −1 for NASICON-type ceramics. 
Solid-state alkali-cation conductors are receiving great attention for applications in rechargeable batteries [1], ion selective electrodes [2, 3], membranes for CO2selective and humidity sensors [4–6]. Fast cation transport requires a crystal structure with favorable diffusion pathways, where the metal-oxygen polyhedra occupied by charge carriers should be connected in one (tunnel structures), two (layered structures) or, most preferable, three dimensions forming a pathway through the unit cell. One of the best groups of sodium ion conductors, the so-called NASICONs, is characterized by a lattice with three-dimensional conductivity paths [7]; β-alumina has a layered structure [8]. Another family of layered compounds, having cationic transport properties comparable to those of NASICONs, comprises several structural types based on brucite-like layers MO6/3 (where M is transition metal) sandwiching alkali cations [1, 9–14]. 
The nomenclature developed for these phases [9] separates known structures into P3, O3, P2, O2, O6 and T2, where the letter indicates the coordination of the interlayer alkali cation (Octahedral, trigonal Prismatic and Tetrahedral) and the number shows how many layers compose one unit cell. Such crystal lattices comprise a lot of free space between layers where water can be intercalated to solvate alkali cations [14]. The NASICON-type ceramics are also well known to easily hydrate [15–17]. Potential applications of Na ionic conductors in batteries and fuel cells require maximum stability, including possible minimum reactivity with water. On the other hand, materials showing a signiﬁcant and reversible response to the humidity variations can be considered for sensor applications.
This work was focused on the comparative study of several layered phases (O3 and P2 types) and NASICONs, in order to evaluate their stability in H2Ocontaining atmospheres and to assess possible interaction mechanisms with water vapor. To our knowledge, there is no literature data on phase formation in the system Na2O–NiO–Sb2O5. By analogy with titanate systems Na2O–MOx –TiO2 (M = Ni2+ , Co2+ , Fe3+ ) [10–13], the authors supposed formation of mixed sodium-nickel antimonates with layered structures; the present work reports characterization of a new Sb-contatining compound in comparison with the isostructural titanates. Another particular goal was to determine thermal expansion of Na -conducting ceramics. The values of thermal expansion coefﬁcients (TECs), determining compatibility with other materials at elevated temperatures is of major relevance for device fabrication or integration.
Phase purity of the ceramic materials was veriﬁed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The spectra were collected using a Rigaku D/Max-B instrument (Cu Kα radiation, graphite monochromator). Crystal structure reﬁnement was performed using the FullProf software [18], Chekcell program was used to calculate unit cell parameters in the case of hydrated phases. Ceramic microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S4100 instrument; the samples for SEM studies were polished and thermally etched for 0.5 h at temperatures 100–200 K lower than the sintering temperature. Thermal expansion was measured by an alumina Linseis dilatometer at 300–1173 K in air (heating rate of 5 K/min). The electrical properties were studied by impedance spectroscopy with a Hewlett Packard 4284A LCR meter in the frequency range from 20 Hz up to 1 MHz. 
The measurements were performed in a ﬂow of dry air, dry argon and humidiﬁed air where the water vapor partial pressure, p(H2O), varied from approximately 0 up to 0.46 atm. Wetting of the air ﬂow was achieved by bubbling through deionized water at various temperatures (controlled with an accuracy of 1 K). For each measurement, the samples were kept in humidiﬁed air ﬂow up to 24 h until the conductivity becomes independent on time. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) was performed using a SETARAM TG-DTA LabSys instrument. The ionic transference numbers measurements by e.m.f. method were performed at room temperature + using Na cells where the sodium activity at the electrodes was determined by (CH3COO)Na concentration in ethanol solutions.
For Na0.68Ni0.34Ti0.66O2 (P2-type), Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 nickel-sodium antimonate (O3) Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 the ﬁrst time, the use of the sintering conditions given in Table 1 made it possible to prepare single-phase ceramics with density higher than 91%. In the case of Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 (O3), trace amounts of β-NaFeO2 were detected by XRD. The formation of this phase cannot be suppressed increasing the sintering temperature; the processing conditions of Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 were thus optimized in order to simultaneously obtain minimum secondary phase concentration (∼3%) and maximum density (∼92%). As a particular result, SEM micrographs of Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 ceramics show small grains of irregular shape, while for other layered phases the grains have platelet shape characteristic of layered hexagonal structure (Fig. 1). The grain size of Ti-containing materials increases with sintering temperature. 
On the contrary, Sb-containing ceramics are characterized by a relatively small grain size and less glassy phase at the boundaries, although the sintering temperature in this case is quite high (Table 1).
As reported previously [19–21], using of TZP instead of monoclinic zirconia as a precursor for NASICON synthesis provides NASICON ceramics with a ﬁne microstructure and minimum free ZrO2 as impurity, usually found along the boundaries of this type of materials. In the present work, the highest densiﬁcation was achieved for Na3Si2Zr1.88Y0.12PO11.94 (NTZP20); Na3.2Si2.2Zr1.88Y0.12P0.8O11.94 (NTZP22) possesses a poor sinterability resulting in signiﬁcant porosity (Fig. 1). Traces of monoclinic ZrO2 were registered for both NASICON materials. Note that the presence of this zirconia impurity is due to Na and P losses by volatilization or by segregation as glassy phases at the grain boundaries, in both cases resulting from the relatively high sintering temperature, rather than to unreacted precursors [20–21].
Thermal expansion of NASICON ceramics is considerably lower than that of phases with layered structure (Table 1). The TECs of NASICONs, (5.9– 6.4)× 10 −1, are compatible with the expansion of commonly-used construction materials such as porcelain, which is advantageous for electrochemical applications. At temperatures above 1200 K, however, a signiﬁcant change in the slope of dilatometric curves of + Na cation-conducting ceramics was observed (Fig. 3). Although additional studies are necessary to reveal the exact reasons for such phenomenon, one may suppose that such behavior is associated with formation of liquid phase. To our knowledge, a complete phase diagram for the quaternary Na2O-ZrO2-SiO2-P2O5 system was not published; however, all numerous literature data on the Na2O-SiO2-P2O5 and Na2O-SiO2-ZrO2 ternary systems point to the formation of liquid in the temperature range from 1123 to 1323 K, the lower limit corresponding to P2O5-rich compositional domain and the higher to the ZrO2 one. 
Note that no phase transition is known to occur in NASICON at ca. 1200 K [26].
The sodium cationic conductivity increases in the series O3-type < P2 < NASICON (Fig. 5). This trend can be mainly explained by structural effects with relevance on the cation diffusion pathway. The NASICON structure has a three-dimensional network formed by channels available for ionic transport, whilst in the layered compounds the conduction is two-dimensional. Among layered phases, the structures with prismatic coordination of sodium show typically a higher conductivity with respect to octahedral [10, 12]. For + P2-type structure, Na ions are distributed within a layer of equivalent prisms forming wide square bottlenecks. This leads to a considerably higher mobility than that in O3-type lattice comprising octahedral sodium hosts, small tetrahedrally-coordinated interstitial positions and triangle bottlenecks between them. 
For O3-type phases, the conductivity of Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 and Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 is higher than that of Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 presumably due to shorter jump distances between sodium sites, which may be expressed by the a parameter (Table 2).
Another necessary comment relates to an important role of ceramic microstructure. In particular, the conductivity of the layered titanates (Fig. 5) is substantially higher than the values reported for similar ceramic materials, Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 [11] and Nax Nix/2Ti1−x/2O2 [10, 12,13]. Most likely, this is a result of higher density achieved in this work. On the contrary, NTZP22 ceramics has a lower conductivity than NTZP20 due to a poor microstructure, as mentioned above.
At high temperatures the conductivity of all studied materials was found essentially independent of air humidity. At temperatures around 323 K, however, the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere results in apparent higher σ values, as illustrated by Fig. 6. The observed changes are completely reversible—the initial values of the impedance can be reproduced after experiments with an accuracy of 3–5%, comparable to the conductivity measurement error (Fig. 7). In order to assess possible mechanisms of interaction with water, a series of ceramic samples were hydrated in wet air at 373 K and p(H2O)= 0.46 atm. for 24 h, ground into powders and then studied by XRD and TG/DTA. The time necessary to achieve equilibrium water content was estimated from the conductivity relaxation data (Fig. 7).
As mentioned above, the layered phases can absorb water between MO6/3 layers sandwiching sodium cations. One may hence expect an increase in the interlayer distance and, thus, lattice parameter c due to water incorporation. Indeed, for Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 and Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 samples kept in wet air, XRD shows an appearance of second hydrated phase having larger c and essentially unchanged a parameters. In Fig. 8(a) and (c) the reﬂections of hydrated phases are marked with subscript “aq”; as expected, the (003) and (006) reﬂections are strongly shifted towards lower 2θ angles. The c parameter calculated from 7–10 reﬂections with high l-contribution (003, 006, 009, 018 etc.), increased by approximately 30% and is equal to 21.50 and 21.38 ˚A for hydrated Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 and Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2, respectively; the a parameter is 3.00 ˚A for both hydrated phases. One should also note that the amount of hydrated phase formed in Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 ceramics is substantially larger than that in Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2.
The fact, that the unit cell parameters are essentially unaffected by interaction with water, suggests that this reaction primarily occurs in Na0.8Fe0.8Ti0.2O2 surface layers and/or at the grain boundaries. Moderate amounts of Na2CO3·H2O were also observed in the XRD patterns of Na0.8Ni0.4Ti0.6O2 (Fig. 8(a)), while Na0.8Ni0.6Sb0.4O2 and Na0.68Ni0.34Ti0.66O2 contain only trace amounts of this phase; in the latter case the peaks are almost coincident with the pattern background and thus unmarked in Fig. 8(e). reported previously [30], interaction of NASICON-type phases with liquid water leads to the formation of the H3O -substituted compound, the so-
