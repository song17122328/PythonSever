Composite materials based on LiFePO4 with olivine structure and Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3 with NASICON structure have been synthesized  and characterized by the XRD analysis, scanning electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy. The investigation of electrochemical  behavior of obtained composites additionally coated with a thin carbon layer demonstrated that the LiFePO4-based materials doped  by phosphate with the NASICON structure exhibit higher electrochemical capacity in comparison with the initial LiFePO4. 

Lithium iron phosphate with the olivine structure is a promising  cathode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This material  is characterized by a low cost, high stability, safety and a theoretical capacity of 169 mAh g–1.1,2 The drawbacks of LiFePO4  include its low electron and ionic conductivity, which limits its  application  in  devices  requiring  a  high  peak  power.3,4  Its  properties  can  be  improved  by  decreasing  the  size  of  material  particles5,6 and applying carbon coatings.7 The charge and discharge  of  carbon-coated  LiFePO4  (LiFePO4/C)  are  limited  by  the  transfer  of  lithium  cations.8–10  Partial  replacement  of  iron  ions  with  other  cations11–13  and  heterogeneous  doping  by  the  incorporation of a second phase14–16 were performed to increase  the  ion  component  of  conductivity.  In  the  latter  case,  the  modification was mainly performed by the addition of oxides,  and the conductivity increased due to the formation of a double  electric  layer  on  the  interface  of  a  phosphate  with  the  olivine  structure  and  a  nonconductive  additive.  Tan  et  al.17  modified  LiFePO4 with a Li3PO4 film possessing a small ionic conductivity.18  However, there are no studies on the use of materials with high  ionic conductivity, for example, with the NASICON structure for  LiFePO4 modification. 

In  this  work,  composite  materials  based  on  LiFePO4  with  an  olivine  structure  and  an  ion-conducting  phosphate  additive  with  the  NASICON  structure  were  synthesized.  We  selected  Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3  as  the  ion-conducting  additive,  which  is  characterized by high ionic conductivity (6.3×10–5 W–1 cm–1 at  298 K) owing to a 3D network of conductive channels.

The composites were formed upon mechanical treatment in a  planetary mill of a mixture of a precursor obtained after the first  stage of LiFePO4 sol–gel synthesis21 and a phosphate with the  NASICON structure (2–10 wt%) pre-synthesized by a reported  procedure20 followed by keeping at 600 °C in an inert atmosphere. The  XRD  patterns  of  the  composite  materials  LiFePO4/ Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3/C showed that all of the materials are pre sented  predominantly by LiFePO4 with the olivine structure indexed in  the orthorhombic syngony. A peak near 2q = 24.9°, which corresponds  to  the  most  intense  signal  of  the  Li1.3Ti1.7 Fe0.3(PO4)3  phase, is observed. Its intensity increases with the concentration  of this compound in the composite material. According to SEM  data, the average particle size of the initial LiFePO4/C is 50 nm.  The addition of pre-synthesized Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3 to the reaction mixture before the final stage of LiFePO4 synthesis results  in the average particle size increase to 100 nm (Figure 1). This  fact is apparently caused by an increase in the rate of diffusion  during the final annealing due to an increase in the concentration  of defects in the samples or preferential nucleation on the surface  of  Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3  particles.  The  acceleration  of  diffusion  processes  during  the  crystallites  formation  indicates  that  the  ionic conductivity of the cathode materials can be raised. 

The  ionic  conductivity  of  the  composites  LiFePO4/x  wt%  Li1.3 Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3/C was studied by impedance spectroscopy.  The ionic conductivity of LiFePO4 grows almost linearly with  the  con centration  of  a  highly  conductive  phosphate  with  the  NASICON structure in the composite from 6×10–12 W–1 cm–1 for  LiFePO4 to 2×10–10, 5×10–10 and 9.8×10–10 W–1 cm–1 for samples  containing 2, 5 and 10 wt% Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3, respectively. This is  explained both by a higher ionic conductivity of Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3  and formation of zones with a higher ionic conductivity in the  com posite.  In  this  case,  the  increase  in  the  overall  material  conduc tivity occurs due to an increase in the surface component  of conductivity. 

Electrochemical cycling was carried out in a voltage range of  2.6–4.0 V. The carbon content of the composites was ~4 wt%.  The  capacity  of  the  initial  LiFePO4/C  at  a  discharge  current  of  15 mA g–1 (0.1 C) is about 140 mAh g–1 (Figure 2, curve 1). The  charge–discharge  curves  for  both  the  initial  and  doped  samples  have almost the same shapes typical of LiFePO4-based cathode  materials  (Figure  2).  The  curves  contain  a  plateau  at  ~3.45 V  corresponding to the Fe2+ ¬® Fe3+ transition. Notably, lithiumtitanium  phosphate  with  the  NASICON  structure  contained  in  the composite shows no electrochemical activity in the working  range of potentials, where lithium–iron phosphate with an olivine  structure was tested (2.6–4.0 V). This is an expected result since  the  transition  Ti4+  ¬®  Ti3+  at  a  voltage  of  ~2.47  V  with  the  Li3Ti2(PO4)3  phase  formation22,23  or  the  transition  in  a  lowpotential region of 0.2–1.5 V typical of anodic materials with  incorporation of more than two lithium cations22,24 are characteristic of LiTi2(PO4)3.

Composites  with  a  minimum  dopant  amount  are  preferred  for the preparation of cathode materials with high capacity since  the heterogeneous additive is not electrochemically active in our  case.  On  the  other  hand,  the  more  ion-conducting  additive  a  material contains, the higher its ionic conductivity becomes. In  order to determine the optimum content of phosphate with the  NASICON structure, we performed the electrochemical testing  of composites with various additive concentrations (2–10 wt%).  The  best  characteristics  correspond  to  the  material  containing  5 wt% Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3 with the NASICON structure. On the  one  hand,  it  is  characterized  by  a  significant  increase  in  ionic  conductivity; on the other hand, it retains a high capacity.

The capacity of LiFePO4 + 5 wt% Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3/C is  154 mAh g–1 at a discharge current of 15 mA g–1 (Figure 2, curve 2).  The  increase  in  the  rate  of  transfer  of  charge  carriers  in  LiFePO4/Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3 composite materials allows us to  expect an improvement in the electrochemical characteristics of  the cathode material at high current densities; this is extremely  important  for  enhancing  the  power  of  LIBs.

LiFePO4/C and a material doped with 5% Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  composite  is  characterized  by  a  higher  discharge capacity compared to that of unmodified material with  current  density  increase.  Thus,  the  discharge  capacity  of  the  initial LiFePO4/C at 1000 mA g–1 is 58 mAh g–1, whereas that  of  LiFePO4/5  wt%  Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3/C  is  75  mAh  g–1.  The  discharge capacity of LiFePO4/5 wt% Li1.3Ti1.7Fe0.3(PO4)3/C is as  high as 60 mAh g–1 even at a discharge current of 1900 mA g–1.  In conclusion, LiFePO4 modification with NASICON phosphates is an effective approach to improve LiFePO4 ionic con ductivity and high-rate capability. The composite materials obtained  can be promising cathodes for devices operating at high current  densities.
