Solid electrolytes (SEs) offer great potential as basis for safer rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Aside from excellent ion conductivity, the stability of SEs against the highly reactive metal anode is also a prerequisite to achieve good performance in solid-state batteries (SSBs). Yet, most SEs are found to have limited thermodynamic stability and are unstable against Li/Na metal. With the combination of AC impedance spectroscopy, first principles calculations and in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we unequivocally reveal that NaSICON-structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolyte forms a kinetically stable interface against sodium metal. Prolonged galvanostatic cycling of symmetric Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na cells shows stable plating/stripping behavior of sodium metal at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 and an areal capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2 at room temperature. Evaluation of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 as an electrolyte in a solid-state battery further demonstrates its good cycling stability for over 120 cycles with very limited capacity degradation. This work provides strong evidence that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is one of the few electrolytes that simultaneously achieve superionic conductivity and excellent chemical/electrochemical stability, making it a very promising alternative to liquid electrolytes. Our findings open up a fertile avenue of exploration for SSBs based on Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and related SEs.
Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are gaining tremendous interest as they promise high safety, high energy density, and long cycle life compared to conventional liquid-electrolyte (LEs) based batteries.1 The use of solid electrolytes (SEs) as alternative to the traditional combustible organic electrolytes offer the potential to improve the safety of batteries. Another attractive prospect of solid electrolytes is their possible compatibility with high voltage cathodes and metal anodes, which increase the energy density of batteries considerably.1 Moreover, the solidification of electrolytes would enable bipolar geometries to improve packing density of cells.2 An ideal solid electrolyte is expected to possess high ionic conductivity (ideally achieving 10-2 S cm-1 at room temperature in case of the catholyte, > 10-3 S cm-1 in case of the separator), negligible electronic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window (> 5 V), chemical and electrochemical compatibility with electrode materials, and good thermal stability.3
Recently, remarkably high conductivities (up to 10-2 S cm-1) approaching and even surpassing those of LEs have been achieved in a wide range of materials, typically in thiophosphates. Examples include Li10GeP2S12 (“LGPS”; σi = 12 mS·cm-1)4 and its derivatives, 4-5 Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 (σi = 25 mS·cm-1),6 Li7P3S11 (σi = 17 mS·cm-1),7 Li-argyrodites Li7+x-yPn1-xMxS6-yXy (Pn = P, Sb; M = Si, Ge, Sn; X = Cl, Br, I) (σi = 3~17 mS·cm-1),8-11 Na11Sn2PnX12 (Pn = P, Sb; X = S, Se; σi = 0.5~3.7 mS·cm-1),12-15 Na3PnX4 (Pn = P, Sb, W; X = S, Se; σi = 0.2 ~ 32 mS·cm-1).16-23 Pivotal progress on the fundamental understanding on fast ion conduction has also been accomplished.24-27 However, simultaneously achieving excellent ionic conductivity and sufficient electrochemical stability remains a great challenge. While most thiophosphates display very high ion conductivities, they typically show significantly narrower thermodynamic stability windows than oxide-based SEs. The direct contact of thiophosphates with a Li/Na metal anode or cathode materials leads to severe reduction or oxidation, and protecting interlayers are required for stable operation.28 In contrast, oxide electrolytes often exhibit better electrochemical stability, but are generally less conductive than their thiophosphate counterparts. Nonetheless, the ion conductivity can be further increased to above 1.0 mS·cm-1 through chemical engineering. Successful examples are LLZO (σi = 0.4~1.3 mS·cm-1), 29-30 and NaSICON (Na3+xMyM’2-ySi3-zPzO12; M/M’ = Zr, Ca, Mg, Zn, La, Sc, Ti, Nb, etc; σi = 0.67~4.0 mS·cm-1).26, 31-34 
 Another challenge that SSBs face is the significant degradation and poor rate performance.35-36 The poor cell kinetics is typically ascribed to the sluggish charge-transfer process across the SE|electrode interface due to high interfacial resistance.1 Possible origins for the high interfacial resistance are suggested to be the poorly ion-conducting interphases formed by chemical or electrochemical decomposition,37 inferior physical contact at the interfaces,38 and mechanical failure of the contacts with volume variation during charge/discharge process.39 Interphase formation can occur due to several reasons: (1) the reduction (at the negative electrode) or oxidation of SEs (at the positive electrode) due to the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the SEs; (2) reactions between the SE and the cathode materials caused by the chemical instability between these two layers; (3) by electrochemical reactions of the SE|electrode interface during charge/discharge processes.40 These interphase layers have significant effects on the interfacial resistance and the overall performance of the solid-state batteries.      In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and first principles calculations have been demonstrated to be very powerful approaches to investigate the stability of solid electrolytes toward Li metal.40-46 As the most promising group of Na+-ion conductors, NaSICON-structured SEs show excellent ion conductivities (up to 4 mS cm-1 through chemical engineering 26, 31-32 and great potential for utilization in bulk-type solid-state batteries.31 Herein, we assess the compatibility of the parent phase, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with Na metal using a combination of AC time-resolved impedance, first principles calculations, and in situ XPS technique. Our studies provide comprehensive and reliable information about the interphase and interfacial chemical reactions. A kinetically stable interphase is revealed to form between Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na metal. The superior compatibility, together with the excellent ion conductivity (5 mS cm-1 at 80°C), enables excellent cell performance of NVP|SE|Na solid-state battery that exhibits stable cycling for over 120 cycles.
Materials Synthesis: Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte and carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP, with 5 wt% carbon) cathode material were prepared by sol-gel method and solid-state reaction, respectively. Details on the synthesis and the structure analysis were provided in our previous works.26, 31, 47 Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data suggested the high crystallinity and high purity of the targeted materials. 26, 31, 47 
The chemical stability of the NaSICON solid electrolyte was studied with symmetric cells of the type Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na. To avoid possible reaction with moisture or carbon oxide in the air, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellets were cleaned with ethanol and transferred to the glove box immediately after the calcination process was finished. The sodium metal cubes were mechanically surface-cleaned and cut into thin slices, subsequently roll pressed, and eventually punched into thin films. The chemical stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 against Na metal was then investigated by attaching Na metal foils mechanically onto each side of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet. Afterwards, a flat rod wrapped with a plastic bag was used to apply sufficient force to the surface of Na metal, in order to yield a smooth surface of the Na metal and to ensure good contact between the Na metal and the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet. A wave washer was positioned between the spacer and the cap to maintain the pressure during the measurement. Time-resolved impedance spectroscopy was performed with the Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na symmetric cells inside an argon filled glove box, within the frequency range of 8 MHz to 100 mHz with a sinus amplitude of 5 mV. The time span between the first contact with sodium metal and the start of the first measurement was less than 2 minutes. All measurements were carried out in an argon filled glove box (p(H2O)/p° < 1 ppm, p(O2)/p° < 1 ppm) at room temperature. Sodium plating/stripping cycling was conducted with a Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na symmetric cell at different current densities from 0.1 to 2.0 mA cm-2 (with an increase step of 0.1 mA cm-2 below 1.0 mA cm-2 and 0.2 mA cm-2 above 1.0 mA cm-2) at both room temperature and 80°C. A pouch cell design was adopted for these galvanostatic cycling measurements. The areal capacity for the plating step was set to be 0.5 mAh cm-2.In situ X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy: The SE sample (pellet) was thinned in air and then cut into small pieces. The sample surface was mechanically cleaned before transferring to the XPS chamber. All transfer and measurements were performed under inert argon atmosphere.       The in situ XPS measurements were performed in a PHI 5000 Versaprobe Scanning ESCA Microprobe (Physical Electronics) employing a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (beam diameter 200 μm, X-ray power of 50 W) equipped with an argon ion gun for depth profiling. The chamber pressure was ~10−7 Pa throughout the experiment. Before the in situ XPS measurement was started, a survey spectrum was recorded to identify the elements. Thereby, the elements sodium (Na), zirconium (Zr), silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), carbon (C) and oxygen (O) were identified. Details for the measurement procedure are referred to our previous paper.40 The pass energy and the step size were set to 46.95 eV and 0.2 eV, respectively. Sputtering of the sodium was performed using an acceleration voltage of 4 kV and an argon ion current of 4 μA, with the angle between the sputter gun and sample surface to be 33°. Deposition time was chosen as 5 min. Beside monochromatized Al radiation, non-monochromatized Mg radiation was used in order to separate the O 1s signal from the Na-Auger lines.Evaluation of the Solid-State Battery Cells: To prepare the NVP composite cathode, the synthesized carbon coated NVP cathode active material and super P were mixed and ground for 30 min before transferring into a centrifuge tube. Afterwards, the proper amount of ionic liquid (0.2 M sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (NaFSI) in N-Methyl-N-Propylpiperidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PP13FSI)) was added into the tube, which was then mounted to the rubber cup of a vortex mixer. The mass ratio of NVP, ionic liquid, and super P in the composite cathode was 60: 37: 3, representing a volume of approx. 43.3 µL ionic liquid per 100 mg Na3V2(PO4)3 active material. A uniform and thick slurry was obtained after ~4 hours vigorous vortex mixing. The slurry was then casted onto one side of the sintered Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet (thickness: ~1.2 mm). These composite electrodes, loaded on the substrate of SE pellet, with an areal NVP loading of 2.5 mg cm-2 (theoretical areal capacity of 0.293 mAh cm-2) were dried at 80°C before use. The NVP|SE|Na solid-state battery was assembled in Ar filled glovebox by applying a piece of Na foil (10 mm in diameter) onto the unpainted side of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet. Electrochemical tests were conducted by galvanostatic cycling the cells between 2.5 and 3.7 V.First principles calculations: The density functional theory (DFT) calculations in this work were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)48 within the projector augmented-wave approach49. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional parameterized by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) was employed to describe the exchange-correlation potential.50 We used a cutoff energy of 520 eV for the plane-wave basis set and Γ-centered k-meshes with the density of 2500 k-points per reciprocal atom in all calculations.
     The structure of  Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12, Na3Zr2Si2PO12, Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12 used in the DFT calculations is based on the structure model established in our previous work.26 Since the structure shows disorder on the cation lattice sites (Si/P and Na/Vacancy), we used enumlib to enumerate possible orderings 51 and selected 20 configurations with the lowest electrostatic energy as candidate structures. DFT calculations were performed for these 20 structures and the one with the lowest energy was selected as the representative ground state structure.     The phase stability and electrochemical stability were calculated by constructing the phase diagram and the grand potential phase diagram based on data from the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD).52-53 All the calculated reaction energies and voltages neglected the contribution of the PV terms and the entropy terms as in previous studies. 45-46
According to the differences in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, the Me/SE (Me refers to metallic anode, such as Li, Na) interface is usually classified into three types40: (1) Thermodynamically stable interface; it requires that both phases, metal Me and the solid electrolyte in contact, are in thermodynamic equilibrium a priori, as in the case of Li/LiI and Li/Li3N; (2) a reactive and mixed ionic-electronic conducting interphase (MCI) with both reasonably high ionic and electronic conductivity; this interphase allows for continuous flux of M+-ions and electrons, leading to the formation of a thick decomposition layer or even the complete lithiation (sodiation) of solid electrolyte; (3) a metastable, thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable (non-growing) solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI); the growth of this interphase is kinetically hindered after formation due to the complete insulating character or fairly-low electronic conductivity of the products. As required for the SEI formed in liquid electrolytes, this third type of interphase ideally shows sufficiently high ionic conductivity and negligible electronic conductivity.     As expected, most Li-SEs, e. g., LixPOyNz (LiPON), Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3 (LLTO), Ti4+ or Ge4+ containing Li1+xM2-xAlx(PO4)3 (NaSICON, M = Ti4+/Ge4+), Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS), Li7P3S11, are thermodynamically unstable against Li metal.45-46 The highly conducting thiophosphates are generally not stable when in contact with Li metal.45 The reduction products of thiophosphates and Li are revealed to be Li3P and Li2S, and for electrolyte materials containing Ge, Cl, and I as constituents, Li-Ge alloy, LiCl and LiI are the other main reaction products, respectively. Amongst oxides, garnet-type SEs, in particular, Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and its derivatives, exhibit the best resistance to reduction by Li.45 In the case of sodium SEs, very limited work has been reported so far. The stability of Na-β”-Al2O3 against Na metal was proven by Janek’s group in a combined XPS and impedance study, while the instability of Na3PS4 was also evidenced in the same work. 54      In a real battery, it is not very likely that a thermodynamically stable interface will form between Li/Na metal and a solid electrolyte because of the high reactivity of Li/Na metal. While a thermodynamically stable interface is desirable, the most possible interface in a real system will either be a mixed conducting interphase that would continue growing into the bulk of the SE layer, or a stable non-growing SEI that would only conduct ions but is electronically insulating otherwise. Generally, an MCI type interphase would cause a destruction of the SE layer, and result in rapid deterioration and eventual self-discharge of the battery, whereas, a SEI type may not be harmful to the long-term battery performance if the additional resistance originating from the interphase is not too large. Some electrolytes, for example, LiPON, as well as thiophosphates such as Li3PS4, and Li7P2S8I (which appears to be better described as Li4PS4I),55 are practically observed to be compatible with Li metal. This is due to kinetic factors: the interphase passivates the SEs and mitigates continued reactions. As a result, the decomposition of the SEs advances only very slowly into the bulk and the SE materials are stabilized by the interphase layer. In light of these considerations, a stable SEI interface with low resistance is preferred in a solid-state battery.      In this work, we utilize time-resolved impedance, DFT calculations, with a combination of an in situ XPS technique, to uncover the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of NaSICON structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellets we used throughout this work exhibit a total ionic conductivity of ~0.67 mS cm-1 at room temperature (25°C) and ~5 mS cm-1 at 80°C, respectively.31 The characterization of its properties - chemical/electrochemical stability against Na metal and compatibility in full cell - from both experimental and theoretical perspective, are demonstrated below.
Time-resolved impedance spectroscopy has been revealed to be a reliable technique to explore the compatibility of solid electrolyte with Li/Na metal.42, 44 Here the interphase formation between Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and two Na metal foils was monitored by time-resolved impedance spectroscopy. Impedance spectra collected during a time span of 30 days are shown in Figure 1a. The equivalent circuit and the fit model for two representative spectra, after 5 minutes and 1 day of contact, are shown in the inset. For the fresh cell, only one semicircle is seen in the spectrum, which is mainly attributed to the resistance of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte (RSE). A minor contribution from the newly formed interphase is probably also included, but cannot be separated from the RSE at this early stage of the reaction. As the contact time advances, a second semicircle emerges and increases within the first 15 minutes, reflecting the progressive growth of the interphase. This is distinct from the evolution of the areal specific resistance (ASR) of the SEI interphase, RSEI, as a function of contact time, as shown in Figure 1b. The increase in RSEI within the first 10 minutes can be explicitly observed, suggesting that a rapid initial reaction/deterioration happens at the Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na interface. Further increase in RSEI is seen upon the increase in contact time, but the deterioration slows down. After 15 minutes, RSEI and the ASR of the total resistance, RTotal, remain unchanged, indicating that no further SEI formation extends into the bulk of the SE. The ASR of the SEI (for one electrode) of ~64.5 Ω cm2 is fairly small, lower than the total ASR of the bulk electrolyte of 105 Ω cm2 (for a Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet with ~1 mm thickness). This is quite different from what happens at the interface of LGPS or Na3PS4 with the corresponding alkali metal, in which a continuous increase in the ASR of the interphase is evident from the time-resolved impedance spectra. Our results suggest that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 forms a kinetically stable SEI-type interphase at room temperature when in contact with Na metal, namely, the reaction between the two can be effectively hindered by the interphase layer. Whether the growth kinetics is better described by an interface-controlled linear rate or a square root t law caused by diffusion control cannot be decided unequivocally. As the resulting SEI is relatively thin and only a few nm thick, and as its growth is quite fast until further growth stops, we tend to believe that the growth kinetics is linear rather than parabolic. At this point we would like to note that an in-depth study of the SEI growth kinetics, the SEI composition and structure is far beyond the current study, and rather will be part of future work.           The chemical stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 against Na metal is also examined by plating/stripping the Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na symmetric cell at different current densities from 0.1 to 2.0 mA cm-2 (with an increment of 0.1 mA cm-2 below 1 mA cm-2 and 0.2 mA cm-2 above 1 mA cm-2) with a plating capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2, both at room temperature (RT) and 80°C (Figure 1c, 1d). When galvanostatically cycled at room temperature, the symmetric cells show an ohmic current-voltage behavior up to 0.2 mA cm-2, after which the cells experience a dramatic drop of the cell voltage output, indicative of a short-circuit of the cells due to the dendrite formation. This represents a critical current density (CCD) of 0.2 mA cm-2 for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 at room temperature, higher than that of garnet LLZO (0.1 mA cm-2).56 Note that the CCD of ceramic pellets can potentially be enhanced via doping, as already demonstrated by Ga doping in LLZO in a previous work.56 At a moderate temperature of 80°C, significantly lower voltage polarizations (2.2 mV at 0.3 mA cm-2, 5.8 mV at 0.5 mA cm-2, 12.1 mV at 1.0 mA cm-2, 26.2 mV at 2.0 mA cm-2) were observed than at room temperature (Figure 1d). Strikingly, no short-circuit of the cells was observed up to 2 mA cm-2 at a plating capacity of 0.5 mAh cm-2, indicating excellent sodium ion transfer capability across the Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12 interface. The prolonged galvanostatic cycling at current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 for more than 800 h over repeated cycles (cycling still in progress) at room temperature demonstrates no observable increase in the polarization, which further verifies the kinetic stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellets against Na metal.
We evaluated the phase stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 by constructing the pseudo-quaternary phase diagram based on the OQMD database.52-53 The representative ground state of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is on the energy convex hull, indicating that it is a stable phase (Figure 2a).       The electrochemical stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is evaluated by constructing the grand potential phase diagram. Our calculations (Figure 2b) predict that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 has a thermodynamic stability window from 1.11 V to 3.41 V (referenced to Na+/Na). We also identified the phase equilibria and decomposition reaction energies of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 against Na metal at low voltages. It is revealed that the reduction of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 starts at 1.11 V, and thus, it is thermodynamically unstable against Na metal. The reduction of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 at 0 V (in equilibrium with Na metal), forms Na4SiO4, Na2ZrO3, Na3P, and ZrSi (Eq.1) with a small reaction energy (-0.27 eV/atom). In comparison, the calculated decomposition energies of LGPS, Li7P3S11, LiPON in thermodynamic equilibrium with Li are -1.25 eV/atom, -1.67 eV/atom and -0.66 eV/atom, respectively.45 The much smaller decomposition energy of  Na3Zr2Si2PO12 in equilibrium with Na metal (-0.27 eV/atom) implies a much smaller thermodynamic driving force and slower kinetics of the reduction reaction compared to thiophosphates and LiPON, as the reaction energy is included in the parabolic rate constant of diffusion-controlled SEI growth. 57     Moreover, the major reduction products, Na4SiO4, Na2ZrO3, and Na3P, are electronic insulators, whilst the minor component, ZrSi, is probably intrinsically electronic conductive, yet, only constitutes a low volume fraction of 2% in the decomposition products, which is well below the percolation threshold. Na3P might show some electronic conductivity, however, its volume fraction would also be too low to achieve electronic percolation.54 These features of the reaction products can potentially ensure the electronically isolating nature of the SEI layer as a multi-phase composite. With the combination of the time-resolved impedance plot, we suggest that the co-existence of these phases does not lead to a MCI-type interphase, but rather an SEI-type interphase, which can provide sufficient passivation for the bulk solid electrolyte and prevent further decomposition. This is further discussed in the next section. We also note that a similar case has been previously reported, 45 where LiPON  is predicted to show a thermodynamically favorable reduction against Li metal with a moderate reaction energy of -0.66 eV/atom. Fortuitously, the reduction products, Li3N, Li2O and Li3P, are electronically insulating. As a result, LiPON has been verified to be compatible with the Li metal anode,58-59 due to the formation of an electronically insulating SEI interlayer.45 For Na3Zr2Si2PO12, the low reaction energy with sodium, the electronic insulating nature of the reduction products, with a combination of the time-resolved impedance spectrum, suggest that the reduction of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with Na metal has only a small thermodynamic driving force, and limited reduction is likely to lead to the formation of an SEI-type interphase. This type of SEI interphase is desired, as it can effectively protect the bulk solid electrolyte from continuous decomposition and maintain a reasonably low interfacial resistance. We note that the decomposition energy and ASR of the interphase are not necessarily related. The reaction energy only describes the thermodynamic driving force for the decomposition/reduction at the sodium/solid electrolyte interface, whereas the ASR is mainly controlled by the kinetic properties of the formed interphase products. A stronger driving force may lead to a thicker interlayer, but the transport properties of the interlayer are determined by the kinetic properties of the products in the interphase. So, even a thin interlayer may show a high ASR, once the product phases in the interlayer are poorly conducting.     The oxidation reactions of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 start at 3.41 V and the calculated equilibrium potential of O2 gas release starts from this voltage. The final oxidation products are O2, SiO2, Zr2P2O9, ZrSiO4 at the equilibrium oxidation potential of 4.30 V (Figure 2b). Notably, the decomposition energies at 4.51 V and 5.0 V are as minor as -0.15 and -0.23 eV/atom, respectively. Given that the O2 release typically has sluggish kinetics,60 at least 1 V overpotential appears reasonable during the oxidation of Na3Zr2Si2PO12. Furthermore, the formed decomposition products are all electronically insulating phases. This suggests that Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is very likely kinetically stable to potentials above 5 V, due to the electronic insulating nature of the decomposition products and the sluggish kinetics of the nucleation and the release of O2. It is therefore probable that an over-potential beyond the calculated thermodynamic equilibrium potential exists in the oxidation process of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, yielding a high practical oxidation potential of > 5 V as observed in the CV experiments. 61 The electrochemical stability windows of other two NaSICON compositions, Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12 and Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12, were also studied, being 1.39-3.41 V and 1.11-3.11 V, respectively (Figure S1). The phase equilibria under different voltages are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The predicted decomposition products against Na metal are the same with those of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, with a decomposition energy of -0.37 eV/atom for Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12 and -0.18 eV/atom for Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12. 
To obtain more insight into the reduction of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 when it is brought in contact with sodium metal, in situ XPS measurements were conducted to collect interphase information. Figure 3 and 4 exhibits the Zr3d, Na1s, Si2p, P2p and O1s spectra for the pristine Na3Zr2Si2PO12 samples and after sodium deposition. The pristine sodium signal in Figure 3a shows only one signal at binding energy of 1071.4 eV, which is assigned to Na+, in well agreement to the binding energy of Na+ in the case of Na-β”-Al2O3, 54 and is very close to that of 1071.8 eV in Na2O when the chemical shift is considered. 62 After sodium metal deposition, an additional signal for sodium metal and the corresponding metal plasmons 62 are observed in Figure 3a. The fraction of sodium metal further increases during deposition, which indicates that the reaction process is finished shortly after the first two deposition steps (approximately 1.4 nm Na metal) and that the interphase is not growing. It is visible that after sodium deposition, an extra but minor signal at lower binding energy of ~180 eV appears in the Zr 3d line (Figure 3b), which remains unchanged during further deposition. These indicate that zirconium is reduced to sub-oxide species, containing Zr(4-x)+. This is consistent with our DFT calculations showing that minor reduction of Zr may happen and zirconium probably exists in the form of ZrSi when Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is in contact with Na metal. The assignment of the reduced zirconium species is, however, difficult, as the reference data for such binding states are lacking. Nevertheless, the advance of the reduction process into the bulk Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is hindered, as suggested by the unchanged intensities in both sodium and zirconium signals during further sodium deposition.        Before sodium deposition, the Si2p signal at the binding energy of 101.8 eV features only one oxidation state, +4 (Figure 4a), in agreement with the binding energy reported for Si2p in ZrSiO4. 63  Upon sodium deposition, the formation of a new line at lower binding energy (100.6 eV) is indicative of minor reduction to a lower state, Six+(Figure 4b). A very close binding energy of 100.4 eV for Si2p in Si2O and 101.4 eV in SiO was reported in a previous paper.64 These suggest that silicon was very likely reduced to an oxidation state between +2 and +1 after sodium deposition. We also note   that the oxidation state of -2 in the form of ZrSi is absent in the Si 2p signal, although   our DFT calculations suggest it is the thermodynamically stable phase when Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is in contact with sodium. One possible reason is that ZrSi may form during the sodium deposition process, but vanishes very rapidly by reaction with the unavoidable trace amount of oxygen and moisture inside the XP spectrometer and is eventually oxidized again to Six+. We also note that upon sodium deposition the intensity of Si 2p signal is declining since the material is buried underneath sodium metal. Along with this, the P 2p line is almost unaffected by sodium metal deposition, except that the intensity is also dampened (Figure 4c). This probably arises from the minor reduction of phosphorus to Na3P. Similar to the case of Li3P, P in Na3P shows a valence state of -3. However, this minor amount of Na3P probably reacts with the residual oxygen and moisture, due to its high reactivity. A similar observation has been reported to Li3P.44 This explains the absence of the reduced phosphorus species Na3P, but only decreased intensity of the P 2p line. Aside from this, the decline in the signal after sodium deposition may also be due to the fact that the solid electrolyte was buried underneath the formed reaction layer and the sputtered metallic sodium. In order to gain insight whether the oxygen signal is affected by sodium deposition, Mg Kα radiation was used. The results are shown in Figure 4d for the pristine (black) and reacted (red) sample. Notably, no changes for the O 1s signal can be detected, besides that aforementioned signal damping,implicating that the anion lattice is not affected by the reduction of zirconium and silicon.
In order to assess the potential use of NaSICON as electrolyte in solid-state batteries, a bulk-type solid-state cell using Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode and Na metal as the anode was fabricated. The NaSICON solid electrolyte is sandwiched between the Na anode and the Na3V2(PO4)3 composite cathode layer. Vortex mixing is used to make the slurry of the composite cathode, which enables uniform mixing of the active materials, super P, solid electrolyte powder, and ionic liquid. (Details for the preparation of the composite cathode is provided in the Methods part). This can be seen from the impedance spectrum of the cell below. The cells were operated at 80°C. Figure 5a shows the charge/discharge curves for the NVP|SE|Na cell in the voltage range 2.5-3.7 V at different rates (0.1C, 0.2C and 0.5C). Minor polarization of the NVP|SE|Na cell was observed at these current densities (66 mV at 0.1C; 99 mV at 0.2C; 220 mV at 0.5C). The cell delivers a capacity of 106.9 mAh/g upon the first cycle charge at 0.1C, which corresponds to 91.4% to the theoretical specific capacity (117 mAh/g) of Na3V2(PO4)3. The discharge capacity of the first cycle is 103.9 mAh/g, representing a very high initial coulombic efficiency of 97.2%. An increase in both the discharge capacity (~106 mAh/g) and the Coulombic efficiency (~99.7%) was observed from the second cycle (Figure 5b). Upon further increase of the current density to 0.2C and 0.5C, a high discharge capacity of 104.5 mAh/g and 103.2 mAh/g was retained, respectively, although the cell can only deliver a reversible capacity of 50 mAh/g at high rate of 1C. The cycling performance of NaSICON solid electrolyte was also evaluated using the same cell configuration within the same voltage range and the same temperature at the current density of 0.1C. As shown in Figure 5c, the cell shows excellent cycling performance at 0.1C, with negligible capacity fade over 120 cycles, and maintains a capacity of ~97.6 mAh/g after long term cycling with high coulombic efficiencies.     To further evidence the excellent electrochemical performance of the solid-state battery, the compatibility of the NaSICON solid electrolyte with Na metal and NVP cathode was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Only one semicircle is found in the Nyquist plot (Figure 5d). The intercept of the semicircle with the x axis at high frequency marks the resistance of the SE. The semicircle is attributed to the solid electrolyte interphases formed between SE and Na metal and SE and NVP cathode. The ASR of the interphases before cycling is only ~15.7 Ω cm2 at 80°C, suggesting good interfacial compatibility of NaSICON solid electrolyte with Na metal at the anode side and NVP at the cathode side with the assistance of ionic liquid. After 100 cycles, a slight increase in the resistance of the interphases is observed, however, the total internal resistance of the cell remains low. We note that many solid-state cells with an unstable interface between SE and electrodes show significant degradation after a few cycles, even if the electrodes were coated with an oxide barrier layer.3, 27 The excellent cycling performance of the NVP|SE|Na solid-state cell in this work is attributed to the superior electrochemical stability and good compatibility of the NaSICON electrolyte with electrodes, as well as the good electrolyte/electrodes interfacial contact contributed from excellent ionic and electronic conducting network formed with the incorporation of the ionic liquid. Our work points to the significant importance of the exploration of stable solid electrolytes in the utilization of solid-state batteries.          We provide direct evidence for the kinetic stability of NaSICON structured electrolyte with sodium metal using a combination of time-resolved impedance spectroscopy, DFT calculations, and in situ XPS. Minor reduction of zirconium, and silicon were observed and the reaction appears to be self-limiting. From the time-revolved impedance, we conclude that the reaction between Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na metal stops already after 15 minutes at room temperature, indicating that a kinetically stable interphase (SEI) has formed. Galvanostatic cycling measurement of symmetric Na|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na cells demonstrates stable sodium plating/stripping behavior and confirms the kinetical stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 against sodium metal. This excellent chemical and electrochemical stability, as well as compatibility of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 further enables solid-state NVP|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|Na batteries with high capacity retention over 120 cycles. Our findings reported in this work will hopefully inspire more work in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and related SEs, and stimulate further endeavors in the field of SSBs.
