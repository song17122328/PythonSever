Sodium-ion batteries are considered as prime alternatives to lithiumion batteries for large-scale renewable energy storage units due to their low cost and the abundance of sodium bearing precursors in the earth's mineral deposits. In the current work, a 3D NASICON framework Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon cathode electrode with 20–30 nm Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles uniformly encapsulated interconnecting one-dimensional carbon nanoﬁbers was fabricated using a simple and scalable electrospinning method. The Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode showed  1 and a discharge capacity of an initial charge capacity of 103 mA h g  1 (calculated on the total mass of Na3V2(PO4)3 and carbon) 101 mA h g at 0.1C rate, and retained stable discharge capacities of 77, 58, 39 and  1 at high current densities of 2C, 5C, 10C and 20C, 20 mA h g respectively. Moreover, because of the eﬃcient 1D sodium-ion transport pathway and the highly conductive network of Na3V2(PO4)3/ C, the electrode exhibited high overall capacities even when cycled at high currents, extending its usability to high power applications.

Lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion batteries) have become one of the most important technologies for energy storage in portable devices and are now industry standards for use in electric/ hybrid electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.1–4 However, considering the limited and unevenly distributed availability of Li deposits, cost will become a major issue for future Li-ion batteries; room temperature sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion batteries) have attracted increasing attention due to their low cost and the relative abundance of Na over Li.5,6 Since the Na ion is larger than the Li ion by approximately 55%,

nding suitable host materials with suﬃciently large interstitial space to accommodate Na ions and to enable reversible and rapid ion insertion and extraction is very diﬃcult.7 Substantial attention has been paid to Na-ion battery cathode materials in recent years, and good progress has been made for a number of materials including Na0.85Li0.17Ni0.21Mn0.64O2, Na4Mn9O18, Na0.6Fe0.5Mn0.5O2, and Na4Fe(CN)6/C.8–12 For example, Cao et al. reported single-crystalline Na4Mn9O18 cathode nanowires, which showed exceptional cycling stability with 77% capacity retention aer 1000 charge–discharge cycles.9 More recently, Wang et al. reported sodium manganese hexacyanoferrate, which demonstrates high-rate performance and could be produced at low cost.12 The choice for phosphate-based Nainsertion hosts is obviously due to the strong covalent (PO4)3  units that provide structural stability even at high charge states and address thermal safety concerns unlike the typical commercial Li-insertion oxide host LiCoO2.13 Oxide cathode materials may undergo oxygen evolution at high states of charge and elevated temperatures, which may lead to potentially disastrous explosion.14

NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 has recently been investigated as a prospective cathode material for Na-ion batteries.15,16 The electrochemical response of this kind of cathode exhibits two potential plateaus located at 3.4 V and 1.6 V vs. Na/Na+ related to the V3+/V4+ and V2+/V3+ redox couples, respectively, and the  1 theoretical capacity varies between 117 and 236 mA h g depending on the cycling potential and the variation between V3+/V4+ and V2+/V3+ redox states.15 The low potential plateau exhibited by this material makes it a candidate for an anode in rechargeable batteries. However, the poor electronic conductivity of phosphates makes it diﬃcult to achieve capacities close to the theoretical values in this NASCION-type cathode material. Eﬃcient strategies to overcome this shortcoming are mainly focused on providing electrically conductive coatings on particle surfaces and/or reducing particle sizes. To date, very few reports on Na3V2(PO4)3 prepared by solid-state and solution reactions are available, and the reported electrochemical performances of this phosphate-based Na-insertion host

generally demonstrate capacity limitations at charge–discharge rates.17–19 Very reported porous Na3V2(PO4)/C zero-dimensional (0D) nanoparticle aggregations for Na-ion batteries with high cycling stability and superior rate capability.20 Subsequent research work on underscoring their application potential for Na-ion batteries encouraged us to develop new advanced methods to synthesise such high performance cathodes for future room-temperature Na-ion batteries. Herein, we adopt a versatile electrospinning method21–23 to synthesize a Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon electrode with a novel one-dimensional in which 0D Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles were uniformly encapsulated by interconnecting 1D carbon nanobers, denoted as [(Na3V2(PO4)3)0D/(carbon)1D]1D. Such a structure combines a variety of advantages for battery electrodes: very short diﬀusion length of Na ions in Na3V2(PO4)3, easy access of the organic electrolyte and the short transport path of Na+ through carbon toward phosphate nanoparticles, high conductivity transport of electrons along the percolation through bers and avoidance of Ostwald ripening. introduction of separate Na3V2(PO4)3 particles, fully-encapsulated by carbon shells, minimizes the strain problems during (de-)insertion. Note that the volume shrinkage from Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV2(PO4)3 is approximately 8.3%, which is similar to that of LiFePO4 (ca. 6.8%).18 Our electrochemical results demonstrated that a stable rate capability of NaV2(PO4)3/C could be nally realized.

NH4VO3 reacted and produced Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles embedded in carbon bers. The fully encapsulated carbon shell in-situ crystallized also prevented the further growth of Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles during the high-temperature annealing treatment.

Fig. 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for the as-spun (Fig. 1a) and annealed bers (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1a, the as-spun precursor nanobers are long and continuous even on a micrometer-scale and exhibit a uniform diameter. The nally carbonized bers mainly maintained their brous morphology and shape of the precursor get connected with a clear shrinkage in diameter. The long precursor nanobers were transformed into shorter Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanobers during calcination, which can be ascribed to the huge volume change on carbonization of PEO polymers and citric acid, and thermal decomposition and reaction of NaH2PO4 and NH4VO3 reagents. The obtained composite nanobers have a smooth surface and an interconnected network. No Na3V2(PO4)3 particles were found on the surface of the bers, suggesting that all the Na3V2(PO4)3 particles were encapsulated in the carbon bers. Such a unique 1D nanostructure, along with the interconnecting nature of the nanobers, facilitated both fast electronic and Na-ion transport. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) patterns of

The precursor solution of NaH2PO4, NH4VO3, citric acid and polyethylene oxide (PEO) was rst electrospun into a nanober matrix. The as-spun nanobers were stabilized and C. Aerwards, carbonized under Ar at a low temperature of 500 the stabilized and partly carbonized bers were further thermally annealed in an Ar atmosphere at 800 C. During this twostep heat treatment, PEO carbonized, while NaH2PO4 and

the samples annealed at diﬀerent temperatures are shown in Fig. 2. When the annealing temperature was settled at 700 C, the as-prepared sample shows amorphous characteristics the crystal structure of (Fig. 2a), which indicates that Na3V2(PO4)3 began to form at a temperature of >700 C. The pure Na3V2(PO4)3 phase was obtained at 800 C, as shown in Fig. 2b. The pattern is in good agreement with previous reports17–20 and JCPDS no. 53-0018, indicating a phase-pure material. All the diﬀraction peaks in the XRD pattern were indexed to the NASICON structure with R3c space group (rhombohedral unit cell).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was further adopted to investigate the encapsulation of the NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles by the carbon nanobers. As shown in a typical low-magnication TEM image (Fig. 3a), the products arrived at aer thermal annealing are composed of 1D nanobers with a diameter of 200–300 nm. It was clearly observed that the distinct contrast between the carbon nanober matrix and densely embedded Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles supports the formation of hierarchical composites. As shown in TEM images at higher magnication (Fig. 3b and c), the Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm were found to be well dispersed inside the carbon bers with carbon separating individual nanoparticles forming the typical polycrystalline Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanobers shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. The characteristics of polycrystalline and well-crystallized porous nanobers can be conrmed by the multiple diﬀraction rings in the selected-area electron diﬀraction (SAED) pattern of a single nanober as shown in the inset of Fig. 3d. The high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 3d reveals the ne lattice fringes and crystalline nature of Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles, which is consistent with the XRD result (Fig. 2b).

The Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon ratio in the bers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA curve (Fig. 4a) of the annealed Na3V2(PO4)3/C shows that the encapsulated carbon shell weight content in the nally obtained nanober composite products is approximately 18% (the slight weight loss around 100 C is due to water evaporation). The surface area of these Na3V2(PO4)3/C 1D nanobers was measured according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Hierarchical Na3V2(PO4)3/C 1D nanobers exhibit a type III

Na3V2(PO4)3 has a well-dened NASICON structure, with each primitive cell containing six Na3V2(PO4)3 formula units. The crystalline structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 is characterized by VO6 octahedra, each corner sharing with three PO4 tetrahedra, and by Na ions occupying the M1 (octahedral sites) and M2 (tetrahedral sites) sites of the interstitial sites. The M1 sites are situated between two adjacent [V2(PO4)3] units in the same [V2(PO4)3]N ribbon while the M2 sites are located between adjacent [V2(PO4)3]N ribbons as shown in Fig. 5a.18 Note that the Na ions occupy M1 and M2 sites with diﬀerent occupancies. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the [V2(PO4)3]3  units are aligned along the c axis forming [V2(PO4)3]N ribbons. The ribbons are connected via PO4 tetrahedra along the a axis to form an open 3D framework structure. The charge–discharge process turns out to be a typical two-phase reaction causing the change from the Na3V2(PO4)3 to the NaV2(PO4)3 phase with 8.3% volume shrinkage (Fig. 5a). The cathode function of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C bers was rst investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 5b shows the CV curves at diﬀerent scanning rates. The well dened sharp redox peaks in the range of 2.6–4.1 V should be attributed to the V3+/V4+ redox couple reaction, corresponding to Na extraction and insertion in the Na3V2(PO4)3 crystal struc 1, the well-dened ture.

By using CVs, the Na-ion diﬀusion coeﬃcient D  1) can be calculated from the linear relationship between (cm2 s peak currents Ip (Amperes) and the square root of scan rates n1/2 according to the following Randles Sevcik equation:24 1/2CNav1/2 (25 C) 3), D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Na ions (cm2 s

where Ip is the peak current of cathodic or anodic peaks, n is the number of electrons per molecule during the intercalation (n ¼ 1 for V3+/V4+ redox pair), A is the surface area of the cathode (cm2), CNa is the concentration of Na ions in the electrode (mol  1) and n is cm  1). Using these data, the calculated D values the scan rate (V s are found to be in the range from 6.3  10  16 (BET area) to 4.9  10  1 (apparent area), which is dependent on the real electrode area. These data indicate that these 1D nanocomposite cathode materials have a high Na-ion diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Fig. 5c shows the charge–discharge curves of mesoporous Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathodes at 0.1C rate (10 hours charge and 10 hours discharge) in the rst cycle. The composite nanober cathode delivered an initial charge capacity of 103 mA  1 (calculated on h g the total mass of Na3V2(PO4)3 and carbon, a charge capacity of  1 for pure 125 mA h g Na3V2(PO4)3). The specic capacity of these Na3V2(PO4)3 nano 1 bers is litter higher than its theoretical capacity (125 mA h g  1), which could be ascribed to the dense intervs. 117 mA h g faces between the embedded Na3V2(PO4)3 tiny nanoparticles and carbon nanober matrix. For the current Na3V2(PO4)3/C porous nanobers, dense interfaces existed between the embedded Na3V2(PO4)3 tiny nanoparticles and the carbon nanober matrix, which may store some additional Na ions

besides the active Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.3 The initial Coulombic eﬃciency was 98%. The obvious at voltage plateau was observed at 3.4 V, which is distinctly higher than voltage plateaus of NaxCoO2 (approximately 2.8 V),25 Na2FePO4F (ca. 3.0 V),26 and NaCrO2 (ca. 3.0 V).27 Due to the open NASICON structure19,20 and the full carbon encapsulation,28–30 one expects this composite cathode to have good cycling performance. The inset of Fig. 5c shows the cycle stability of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanober cathode at 0.1C rate, which displays a superior cycle stability at low current density. Fig. 5d shows indeed an excellent rate performance with stable discharge capacities of 77, 58,  1 for pure 39 and 20 mA h g Na3V2(PO4)3) at 2C, 5C, 10C and 20C respectively. As shown in Fig. 5c, these values are astonishingly stationary at these high current densities. Aer 40 cycles at 2C, 5C, 10C and 20C, the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode can still deliver a reversible and stable  1 for pure Na3V2(PO4)3) in capacity of 75 mA h g the following 66 cycles. The performance properties of the current Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode are clearly superior to the recently reported Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode materials prepared by solid-state and solution reaction routes.17–19 When compared to the newly reported Na3V2(PO4)3/C porous nanoparticle aggregate,20 the rate capability is inferior, which may be ascribed to the relatively long annealing treatment and high mass percent of carbon content in the nal products. As the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was working in the voltage range of 2.5 V to 4.0 V, the stored Na ions encapsulating the carbon layer are very small. So, the higher the mass of the carbon content in the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode, the lower its specic capacity, as the specic capacity was calculated on the total mass of the embedded Na3V2(PO4)3 and encapsulating carbon layer. Future work must be carried out to optimize the detailed synthesis parameters to increase the surface area and porosity.

The development of high voltage plateau and capacity cathodes for Na-ion batteries is still in its incipient stages, and there is a great deal of future work required. In this study, a novel Na3V2(PO4)3/C electrode with a 1D nanostructure was synthesized for the rst time using a simple electrospinning method. In the Na3V2(PO4)3/C cathode electrode, Na3V2(PO4)3 nanoparticles were well dispersed and conned in the center axis of the 1D carbon bers. Such an electrode exhibited excellent cycling stability at high current rates. Its pronounced strong structural stability enabled it to withstand the severe volume change during 1D morphology connected with eﬃcient electrochemical coupling and conductive network leads to superior rate capability, recommending its use in high power applications.
