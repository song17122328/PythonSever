Potentiometric CO2  sensors based  on NASICON (Na1+xZr2Si2PO12) were fabricated by combining with a Li2CO3–BaCO3  (1:2  in molar ratio) auxiliary phase. The CO2  sensing properties of NASICON (x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) sensors were  investigated under  dry condition at 450C. The electromotive force (EMF) values of NASICON sensors were proportional to the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250 to 2500 ppm. When exposed to dry air containing 250 ppm CO2, the EMF values of each sensor continuously changed toward a negative potential. From a X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurement, it was confirmed  that new crystal phases such as Li2ZrO3, ZrO2, Na2Zr(PO4)2 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 were formed at the interface between sensing electrode and solid-state electrolyte, because of reaction between Li2CO3 and NASICON. The result of XRD measurement suggested that the base-EMF change closely related with the decrease of Li+ activity in auxiliary phase and Na2O activity in NASICON.

The potentiometric solid-state electrolyte sensors have become of great attractive as a compact structure and an inexpensive commercial price. The electrochemical cells are fabricated by combining an alkaline metal carbonate (so-called auxiliary phase) with a solid-state electrolyte such as Na-beta- alumina,1),2)    NASICON    (Na3Zr2Si2PO12),3),4)    MSZ   (MgO-stabilized  zirconia),5)  LiTi2(PO4)3,6)  Sc2(WO4)3   –  YSZ (Y2O3-
stabilized zirconia)7) and Na2O–Al2O3–4SiO2.8) Among these sensors, the NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3xO12 (0 < x < 3))-based sensor has become of major interest, because of an excellent selectivity to CO2 gas, in addition to practical utility in gas sen- sitivity, response time and commercial price. However, this type sensor includes a serious problem that should be improved to practical use. The problem is that the EMF of the sensor contin- ues to decrease toward negative potential during the operation under a static condition (so-called EMF-drift). It is pointed out that the change of activities on an auxiliary phase9)–11) or a ref- erence material causes the EMF-drift.3),12),13) In general, the development of a NASICON-based potentiometric device has been usually carried out by using Na3Zr2Si2PO12 that has the highest ionic conductivity among Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 (0 < x < 3). Recently, it was reported that EMF could become fairly stable by using Na3.75Zr2Si2.75P0.5O12 with Na-rich.14)
In the present study, we researched the correlation between the
amount of Na in NASICON and the long-term stability. Four kinds of NASICON (Na1+xZr2Si2PO12: x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) - based sensors were fabricated and those CO2 sensing properties compared each other. Furthermore, the reactivity of NASICONs with Li2CO3 auxiliary phase was examined by using an XRD measurement.

In general, solid-state electrolyte sensor detects a target gas concentration from the change of electrochemical equilibrium state between the gas and an auxiliary phase on the sensing electrode.4) An electrochemical cell combined NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) with alkaline metallic carbonate (Li2CO3 and Li2CO3–BaCO3 etc.) is expressed as the followings.Air, Au | NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) | Li2CO3–BaCO3,Au, Air + CO2	(1)The CO2 sensing reaction can be explained as reaction Eq. (2). 2Li+ + CO2  + 1/2O2  + 2e–  = Li2CO3	(2)On the other hand, the reference electrode (Au electrode) reaction can be given by 2Na+ + 1/2O2  + 2e– = Na2O  (in NASICON).	(3) By using Nernstian equation, both of the electrode potentials in the reactions (2) and (3) are expressed as the Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively,E’ = C1 (constant) + (RT / nF)·ln [(aLi+)2·PCO ·(PO )1/2 / aLi CO ] (4) E’’ = C2  (constant) + (RT / nF)·ln [(aNa+)2·(PO  )1/2 / aNa O]	(5) where n is the number of electrons associated with the electrode reaction of CO2, P the partial pressure, R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, F Faraday constant, C constant of standard electrode potential estimated from Gibbs energy and a the activ- ity of chemical species such as Li+, Na+, Li2CO3 and Na2O (in NASICON), respectively. The EMF of the sensor is observed as the difference of an electrode potential between the sensing and the reference electrodes. It is assumed that PO2 is kept constant and n is equal to 2 as given in reaction (2). The observed EMF(Ecell) can be given by the next equation,
Ecell = C3 (constant) + (RT / 2F)·ln [(aLi+)2·PCO  ·aNa  O  / ((aNa+)2·aLi CO )].	(6) When CO2 concentration is varied from P’CO2 to P’’CO2, the the- oretical EMF change (EMFCO2) is written in Eq. (7),EMFCO2  = (RT / 2F)·ln (P’’CO2/P’CO2).	(7) For instance, the EMF value is estimated about 72 mV in the range of 250 ppm–2500 ppm at 450C.

Four kinds of NASICON powders were prepared by a sol–gel technique using Si(OC2H5)4, Zr(OC4H9)4, PO(OC4H9)3 and NaOC2H5.14) These alkoxides were stoichiometrically dissolved in an ethanol solution containing HNO3 with stirring. This oper- ation was carried out in a dry N2 atmosphere and the ethanol solution was kept at 80C. Then, the distilled water was added  to the ethanol solution for the hydrolysis. The resulting precipi- tates were dried at 120C in air for 24 h. After calcined at 750C in air for 5 h, the precursor powders were compacted into a disk (9 mm in diameter and 1.2 mm thick). The NASICON disks were inserted into Na3PO4 powder to avoid the sublimation of pospho- rus and then sintered at 1200C in air for 5 h. In this paper, NASICON (Na1+xZr2Si2PO12) with x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75 is called NASICON (x = 0), NASICON (x = 1), NASICON (x = 2) or NASICON (x = 2.75), respectively. An auxiliary phase was syn- thesized by calcining a mixture of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 powders (1:2 in molar ratio) with Au crucible at 750C in air for 10 min.

NASICON (x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) sensors were fabricated by com- bining the NASICON disks with an auxiliary phase (Li2CO3– BaCO3), as schematically drawn in Fig. 1. The reference elec- trode was prepared by using Au paste, followed by calcination  at 800C in air for 2 h. On top of it, the sensing electrode was formed by applying Li2CO3–BaCO3 binary carbonate. Then, the whole assembly was calcined at 750C in air for 5 min. The ref- erence (Au electrode) potential was decided by Na2O activity in NASICON and O2 partial pressure. However, the reference potential might shift with changing humidity and CO2 concen- tration, because of the instability of Na2O.13),14) Therefore, in order to suppress the influence of the changes on humidity and CO2 in atmospheric air, the reference electrode was covered with an inorganic adhesive (TOAGOUSEI, ARON  CERAMIC C) as a protective layer. The NASICON (x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) sensors were fixed on the end of a quartz glass tube (9 mm in diameter) with an inorganic adhesive, as shown in Fig. 1.

Gas sensing properties were measured in a conventional gas- flow apparatus equipped with a heating facility. Sample gases consisting of synthetic air and CO2 were prepared by diluting a parent CO2 gas (5000 ppm CO2 in dry synthetic air) with dry synthetic air. The concentration of CO2 was varied in the range of 250 to 2500 ppm CO2. The sample gases were let to flow over the sensing electrode at a rate of 0.1 dm3/min. On the other hand, the reference electrode was always exposed to static atmospheric air. As a sensing signal, the electromotive force (EMF) of the sensor was measured with a digital electrometer.

Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to analyze the NASICON powders synthesized by sol–gel method. The crystal phases were identified by referring to JCPDS files. Figure 2(a)–(d) show the XRD patterns of NASICON (x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) after calcination at 1200C in air for 5 h, respectively. NASICON (x = 0) was composed of a2.8Zr2Si1.8P2.2O12 (No.36- 0350) and ZrO2 (No.34-1084) phases. In the case of NASICON (x = 1), it was confirmed Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 (No.36-0351), Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (No.35-0412) and ZrO2 phases. In NASICON (x = 2.75), it was confirmed Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and ZrO2 phases. Although the ormation of ZrO2 phase was observed, the NASCON (x = 2) was mainly composed of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 phase. It is supposed that sublimation of P4O10 causes the formation of impurity phase such as ZrO2 and SiO2 phase, as written in reactions (8) and (9). The result of XRD measurement was indicated that NASICON powders synthesized were composed of some sorts of crystal phases, as the followings reactions (8)–(11), respectively. 14NaZr2Si2PO12 (x = 0)  5Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12 + 18ZrO2 + 2P4O10 + 19SiO2 + 7O2 (8) Na2Zr2Si2PO12 (x = 1)  11Na3Zr2Si2PO12 + 5Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12 + 30ZrO2 + (17/4) P4O10  + 22SiO2  + (31/4) O2  + 6Na2SiO3	(9) 4Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (x = 2)  Na2SiO3  + 8ZrO2  + P4O10  + 2SiO2	(10) 24Na3.75Zr2Si2PO12 (x = 2.75) + (9/2)O2  10Na3Zr2Si2PO12 + Na2SiO3 + 10Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12  + 8ZrO2  + 8Na3PO4 + 3SiO2	(11)

Four kinds of NASICON (x = 0, 1, 2, 2.75) were combined with a Li2CO3–BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase to investigate their CO2 sensing properties. The CO2 sensing prop- erties were measured in the rage of 250 to 2500 ppm CO2 under dry condition at 450C. Figure 3 shows the correlation between EMF values and CO2 concentrations under dry condition at 450C for NASICON (x = 0, 2, 2.75) sensors. On the other hand, base-EMF of the NASICON (x = 1) sensor was instable after aging for 250 h, as described later in Fig. 4. Therefore, CO2 sens- ing properties of NASICON (x = 1) sensor was not evaluated. It is supposed that some reactions might continue to take place at the interface between NASICON and auxiliary phase for long- term. However, we cannot explain exactly the instability of base- EMF for the NASICON (x = 1) sensor. As shown in Fig. 3, EMFs were correlated linearly with the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250 to 2500 ppm. When CO2 concentration was increased, the EMF change (EMF) of each sensor was esti- mated 64.7 mV, 69.7 mV and 55.8 mV, respectively. The theo- retical EMFCO2  of the potentiometoric NASICON-based sensor is expressed by using Nernstian Eq. (7). According to Nernstian equation, the electron number (n) of NASICON (x = 0, 2, 2.75) sensors were calculated n = 2.22, 2.06 and 2.63, respectively. This result coincides with electrochemical reaction (2). However, strictly speaking, their electron number did not indicate n = 2.00. It might include the experimental error.
Figure 4 shows the relationship between aging time and EMF values of NASICON sensors at 450C in dry condition contain- ing 250 ppm CO2. When exposed to 250 ppm CO2 for a long time, the EMFs of NASICON sensors decreased with aging time and EMF changes were stabled within 0.2 mV/h about 50 h. From the result of Fig. 4, it was obvious that EMF-drift phenom- ena of NASICON (x = 0, 2, 2.75) sensors were hardly different by using NASICON disks with various Na contents.

The EMFs of each sensor went downward during aging treat- ment, as shown in Fig. 4. According to Nernstian Eq. (6), it was suspected that the decrease of aLi+ in Li2CO3 auxiliary or aNa2O in NASICON, or increase of aNa+ in NASICON caused EMF drift phenomena. As previously reported in Ref.,9)–11) NASICON was easily corroded by reaction with an auxiliary phase such as a Li2CO3 and a Na2CO3. Furthermore, it is well-known that Li+ radius (59 pm) is smaller than that of Na+ (102 pm).15) Therefore, the influence of the activities changes on base-EMF can be drawn.(1)	The reaction of Li2CO3 with NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, Na3.4Zr2Si2.4P0.6O12) brings about the decrease of aLi+ .(2)	The decomposition of NASICON causes the change of aNa2O.(3)	If Li+ in Li2CO3 diffuses into the Na+ site in NASICON,aNa+ might seem to be increased.In order to inspect the factor of EMF-drift, the XRD measure- ment was carried out after exposed to dry air containing 250 ppm CO2 at 450C for mixture powders of NASICON and Li2CO3. Figures 5 and 6 show XRD patterns of the mixture powders that consist of NASICON (x = 2 and 2.75) and Li2CO3, respectively. As shown in these figures, after aging for 20 h, the new crystal phases were confirmed such as a Li2ZrO3 (No.16-0837) at 2 = 22, ZrO2  at 2 = 35, Na5Zr(PO4)3  (No. 37-0384) at 2 = 34,Na2Zr(PO4)2  (No.35-0124) at 2 = 21 and 31. Since the intensities of peak corresponded to Li2CO3 (at 2 = 21) decreased with increasing aging time, it was supposed that these new crys- tal phases were formed because of reaction between auxiliary phase and solid-state electrolyte. Although Si-containing crystal phases such as Na2SiO3 and SiO2 phases could not be confirmed for the XRD measurements, the reactions of the formation of Li2ZrO3, ZrO2, Na2Zr(PO4)2 and Na5Zr(PO4)3 phases are respec- tively expressed as the followings (12) – (15).Si-containing phases might be present as an amorphous phase.

From these results, it was supposed that the base-EMF change closely relates with the decrease of Li+ activity in Li2CO3 auxil- iary phase and Na2O activity in NASICON. Furthermore, since EMF-drift phenomena of NASICON sensors with various Na contents were hardly different, it was supposed that the change of aNa+ in NASICON was not influenced on the drift phenomena. It is effectively suspected that improvement of the EMF-drift needs to select an auxiliary phase, which has resistance to the reaction with NASICON, or to insert the interfacial layer to reduce the reaction between auxiliary phase and NASICON.

In this study, the improvement of EMF-drift was investigated on NASICON (Na1+xZr2Si2PO12: x = 0, 1, 2 or 2.75) - based potentiometric CO2 sensors combined with a Li2CO3–BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase. The following conclusions are drawn from the present study.

The EMFs of NASICON (x = 0, 2, 2.75) sensors were corre- lated linearly with the logarithm of CO2 concentrations in the range of 250 to 2500 ppm at 450C. When exposed to 250 ppm CO2 for a long time, the EMF of NASICON sensors decreased with aging time. Since EMF-drift phenomena of NASICON sen- sors with various Na contents were hardly different, it was sup- posed that the change of aNa+ in NASICON was not influenced on the drift phenomena. Subsequently, in order to inspect the fac- tor of EMF-drift, XRD measurement was carried out after exposed to dry air containing 250 ppm CO2 at 450C for mixture powders of NASICON and Li2CO3. From the result of the XRD measurement, it was supposed that the base-EMF change closely relates with the decrease of Li+ activity in Li2CO3 auxiliary phase and Na2O activity in NASICON.
