Divalent Ni2+ cation-conducting solid electrolytes, (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3, were successfully developed by introducing Ni2+ cations into a HfNb(PO4)3 solid exhibiting a three-dimensional NASICON-type structure. Although the HfNb(PO4)3 solid has been reported to be purely a Hf4+ ion conductor, the conducting species was changed to the divalent Ni2+ cation upon Ni2+ doping, due to the facile migration of lower-valence ions in the rigid crystal lattice. In addition, by selecting the well-ordered NASICON-type structure as the mother crystal, the (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 solid electrolytes exhibited lower activation energies and higher Ni2+ cation conductivities than a previously reported NiZr4(PO4)6 solid with the β-Fe2(SO4)3-type structure. Among the (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids, (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 (x = 0.06) showed the highest Ni2+ ion conductivity, of 2.27 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at 600 °C, which is ca. 23 times higher than that of the NiZr4(PO4)6 solid.

Solid electrolytes, in which ions migrate macroscopically in solids as charge carriers, are promising candidate materials for components of electrochemical devices such as batteries, fuel cells, chemical sensors, and others, due to their favorable thermal and mechanical properties which realize high performance and long-term stability. Specifically, solid electrolytes whose conducting species are Li+, H+, or O2− ions are extensively studied for their potential applications in electrochemical energy storage devices [1], [2], [3], [4].

In the field of solid electrolytes, it is generally accepted that ion migration is strongly influenced by the valence state of the conducting ion species, where conducting ion species with higher valence number exhibit stronger electrostatic interactions with surrounding anions; thus, the migration of high-valence ions is regarded to be poor in solids [5]. Based on this theory, many researchers have focused on monovalent ions such as Li+, H+, and Na+, which interact with the surrounding counter anions in weaker electrostatic interactions.

Recently, however, the demand for next-generation batteries with high energy density is gradually increasing due to the high power requirements of devices like mobile phones and portable computers, and divalent-cation conductors are promising candidate component materials because they can theoretically carry twice the amount of electricity that monovalent cations can. Several divalent cations, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Pb2+, and Ba2+, have been reported to conduct in β”-alumina- and β-Fe2(SO4)3-type structures [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, their ion conductivities were too low for commercialization, mainly because the large ionic size limits migration in rigid crystal lattices, or because the crystal structures were unsuitable for smooth ion migration.

Therefore, we focused on the Ni2+ ion as the migrating cation species because the ionic radius of Ni2+ is relatively small in comparison to those of other divalent cations. While the NiZr4(PO4)6 [9] solid with β-Fe2(SO4)3-type structure has been studied as a Ni2+ cation conductor, the activation energy (123 kJ mol−1) for Ni2+ conduction in the NiZr4(PO4)6 solid was extraordinarily high because of a bottle-neck for ion conduction caused by distortion of the crystal structure, resulting in low Ni2+ conductivity even at an elevated temperature (600 °C). In order to achieve high Ni2+ ion conductivity, it is essential to select a crystal structure that is conducive to ion migration. We selected the NASICON-type structure, which comprises a well-ordered three-dimensional conducting pathway.

In this study, we successfully achieved high Ni2+ ion conduction in NASICON-type (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids by selecting HfNb(PO4)3 [11] as the mother solid. By selecting NASICON-type HfNb(PO4)3, Ni2+ ions were able to migrate smoothly through the solid with the help of high-valence cations such as Nb5+, P5+, and Hf4+ present in the structure, which effectively diminished the electrostatic interaction between Ni2+ and surrounding oxide anions.

(NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) solids were synthesized using a conventional co-precipitation method. The detail experimental procedure is described in Supplementary Data. The obtained samples were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and the lattice volumes of the samples were calculated from the XRD peak angles with α-Al2O3 powder as an internal standard.

The electrical conductivities of the (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids were measured by the ac impedance method. Dc electrolysis of the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 pellet was carried out by applying a dc voltage of 4 V for 25 days at 650 °C. Modified Tubandt electrolysis was conducted in order to quantitatively demonstrate Ni2+ ion conduction in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to confirm the valence state of Ni. To eliminate possible effects of humidity on the ion conducting properties, sample preparation and electrical measurements were conducted under a dry atmosphere by using synthetic dry gases.

According to the XRD patterns of the (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) solids obtained by calcination at 1300 °C (Fig. S1), it was found that the single-phase NASICON-type structure was formed only for the samples with x ≤ 0.06. Fig. 1 depicts the compositional dependence of lattice volume of the NASICON-type phase for the prepared samples. The lattice volumes of the samples with single-phase NASICON-type structure (x ≤ 0.06) linearly decreased with an increase in Ni content (x) up to 0.06, whereas the samples with x > 0.06 did not exhibit any significant lattice volume changes. This strongly indicates that the smaller Ni2+ cations (0.083 nm, coordination number 6) [12] were successfully introduced into the Hf4+ cation (0.085 nm, coordination number 6) [12] sites in the NASICON-type structure to form a solid solution, and that the limited solid solubility composition was x = 0.06.

Fig. 1 also displays the compositional dependencies of the electrical conductivity under an air atmosphere at 600 °C and the activation energy (Ea) for Ni2+ ion conduction, the latter of which was estimated from ac conductivities in the temperature range of 300 to 600 °C, for the (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.10) solids. In the single-phase region (x ≤ 0.06), the conductivity monotonically increased while the activation energy decreased with an increase in Ni content (x) up to 0.06. The highest conductivity of 2.27 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at 600 °C and the lowest activation energy of 50.0 kJ·mol−1 were obtained simultaneously at the solid solubility limit composition of x = 0.06 in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid. In contrast, for multi-phase samples (x > 0.06), conductivity decreased and activation energy increased as Ni content increased, due to the formation of HfP2O7 and NbPO5 as impurity phases.

In order to identify Ni2+ cation conduction in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid, dc electrolysis was carried out by applying a dc voltage of 4 V. A deposition of Ni was clearly observed at the cathodic surface of the electrolyzed sample pellet (Fig. S2), implying macroscopic Ni2+ conduction in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid. For a quantitative investigation of Ni2+ migration in the sample, we carried out a modified Tubandt electrolysis by applying a dc voltage of 4 V for 30 days at 650 °C under an air atmosphere, to three (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 sintered pellets. This method allows the determination of ion migration based on the amount of charge passed through during electrolysis. Fig. 2 illustrates the setup of the modified Tubandt electrolysis experiment. If the conducting species in these solids is the Ni2+ cation, a decrease in mass would be observed at the anodic pellet (A) due to migration of the Ni2+ cation generated by the anodic reaction. The produced Ni2+ cation should migrate to the cathodic pellet (C) through the middle pellet (B), meaning that weight change would not be observed for pellet (B). After migration of the Ni2+ cation to the cathodic pellet (C), the migrated Ni2+ cation is blocked by the cathodic bulk Pt electrode and aggregates at the surface of the cathodic pellet (C) where it contacts the Pt electrode. Thus, an increase in mass would be observed for the cathodic pellet (C). As these mass changes are theoretically related to the amount of charge passed, it is possible to estimate the mass changes based on the amount of charge passed during electrolysis. Table 1 displays the theoretical and measured mass change for each sample pellet. Mass loss was observed at the anodic pellet (A) while mass gain was observed at the cathodic pellet (C). The observed mass changes were slightly less than the theoretical values due to current leakage resulting from the flow of some electrons through the surface of the sample pellets. However, this does not affect Ni migration inside the sample, and mass changes of over 90% (mass loss and mass gain for the sample pellets (A + B) and (C), respectively) were observed. Furthermore, an increase in the Ni content was noted only in the cathodic sample pellet (C) (Table S1), confirming Ni migration in the solid. XRD measurements were performed to investigate the electrolyzed samples (Fig. S3). Although the XRD profiles of the anodic and cathodic pellets revealed the presence of both the NASICON-type structure and P2O5·9Nb2O5, the latter of which was formed during electrolysis, a NiO-related phase was not recognized. This is due to the small amount of Ni migrated during the electrolysis.

It should be noted that the Ni in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid, which showed the highest conductivity among the prepared samples, was demonstrated to exist in the divalent state via XPS analysis (Fig. S4). Dc and ac conductivities were also measured under different atmospheres wherein the oxygen partial pressure was varied between 10−16 and 105 Pa, in order to investigate the presence of electronic conduction in the sample. It was determined that the cationic transference number in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 sample was over 0.99 (Fig. S5). From these results, it can be concluded that the sole migrating species in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid is the Ni2+ cation.

The temperature dependences of Ni2+ cation conductivity in the NASICON-type (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solids are shown in Fig. 3, along with the corresponding data for the β-Fe2(SO4)3-type NiZr4(PO4)6 [9] solid. Ni2+ cation conductivity in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid was extraordinarily high compared to that in the NiZr4(PO4)6 solid at all temperatures, and at 600 °C the conductivity was ca. 23 times higher in (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 than in NiZr4(PO4)6. Moreover, the activation energy for Ni2+ cation conduction in (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 (50.0 kJ mol−1) was significantly lower than that in the NiZr4(PO4)6 solid (123 kJ mol−1). This is because the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid contains a well-ordered three-dimensional ion conducting pathway due to the NASICON-type structure, while the NiZr4(PO4)6 solid exists in a distorted β-Fe2(SO4)3-type structure. In addition, electrostatic interactions between Ni2+ and surrounding O2− ions were effectively reduced by the presence of high-valence Nb5+ cations in the structure.

We synthesized divalent Ni2+ ion-conducting solid electrolytes (NixHf1−x)4/(4−2x)Nb(PO4)3 (0.03 ≤ x ≤ 0.10), which exhibited high conductivity due to the selection of the well-ordered three-dimensional NASICON-type structure and the introduction of high-valence Nb5+ cations into the structure. Among the prepared samples, the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid, which corresponds to the solid solubility limit composition (x = 0.06), showed the lowest activation energy (50.0 kJ·mol−1) and the highest Ni2+ cation conductivity (2.27 × 10−4 S·cm−1 at 600 °C). Ni2+ cation conduction in the (Ni0.06Hf0.94)4/3.88Nb(PO4)3 solid was successfully demonstrated using a dc electrolysis method.
