Materials with NASICON structure, such as NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP), are widely studied in the field of sodium ion battery. They have potential applications, but their conductivity is poor. Nanostructure can shorten the ion and electron transport paths and make electrolytes permeable easily. Generally speaking, the electric conductivity of battery materials can be improved by adding appropriate amount of carbon. In this paper, large-scale NTP/C nanomaterial of kilogram level was prepared by spray drying. The as-prepared NTP/C nanomaterial shows good electrochemical performance. At 5 C, the initial specific capacity is 69 mA h g−1, and the capacity after 2000 cycles is about 73.2% of the initial capacity.
Recently, the application of lithium-ion batteries in many fields such as daily life, portable small electronic products, high-power, large-capacity electric vehicles and hybrids has increased [1–3]. However, due to the increasing market demand, the demand for lithium resources has gradually expanded [4, 5]. The uneven distribution and limited reserves will increase the cost of LIBs, which may be a very serious problem for batteries [6, 7]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been paid more and more attention in scientific research and industry because of its abundant reserves, low price and similar working mechanism with LIBs [8–14]. Furthermore, in terms of use, SIBs are safer than lithium-ion batteries, and the choice of electrolyte is more extensive [15–21].
NaTi2(PO4)3 has been widely studied because it has a NASICON structure and forms a three-dimensional ion transport tunnel that facilitates the rapid migration of sodium ions [22–27]. However, the conductivity is low and the charge transfer kinetics is slow during the Na+ insertion/extraction process, resulting in poor rate performance and cycle stability. In the current report of NTP materials, there are mainly three methods for improving conductivity and electrochemical performance [28–37]. First, NTP is designed to be a nanoscale particle, which can shorten the ion and electron transport paths and enable easy electrolyte permeability [28–30]; second, NTP is coated or doped with materials having good conductivity to enhance the composite conductivity [31–34]; third, heteroatom doping can be used to enhance ion/electron transport capabilities [35–37]. For example, (1) T.F. Huang reported that NTP nanoparticles about 100 nm were synthesized by hydrothermal method delivered a high reversible capacity (∼121 and 103 mA h g−1 at 0.2 and 2 C) [38]. (2) The excellent rate performance of NTP prepared by CH Chen attributed to the nanoporous structure and highly graphitized carbon coating [39]. (3) Y .H. Huang prepared F-doped NTP/C material, which greatly enhanced the ion/electron transport, thus achieving ultrahigh performance [40].
However, there is no large-scale industrial production of NTP/C materials in the current report. In order to achieve a large number of industrial production, sodium citrate containing a carbon chain is used as a sodium source, a simple ball milling, followed by spray drying, and finally a high temperature calcination method to obtain a NTP/C nanomaterial. The composite material has good crystallinity. It consists of a large number of nanoparticle structures. The particles are elliptical and the lattice streaks and the uniform amorphous carbon layer can be clearly seen. At 5 C rate, the initial specific capacity is 69 mAh g−1, a n d the capacity after 2000 cycles is about 73.2% of the initial capacity. NTP/C composites have high magnification and good cycle performance. We hope that NTP/C materials will be better developed in the future of industrial production.
In this experiment, NTP/C microsphere particles were prepared by spray drying and subsequent heat treatment after simple ball milling. Firstly, 720.6 g of sodium citrate and 1725 g of NH4H2PO4 were added to the powder dispersion grinder (SX-30) with 4 L water. Under rapid agitation, 2281 g of Ti(OC2H5)4 was added to the grinder through a peristaltic pump at a speed of 30 rmp. After addition, the precursor with Na+:Ti4+:PO3− 4 molar ratio of 1:2:3 was obtained by rapid grinding for four hours. A spray dryer (QFN-CX-5) was used to produce the microsphere NTP@C precursor. During the spray drying process, the mixture solution is injected though the peristaltic pump at the speed of 25 rmp and atomized by the nozzle to produce micro size spherical droplets. The precursors were obtained by injecting these droplets downward into a heating chamber at a constant temperature of 130 centigrade. NTP/C microsphere composite was obtained at 800 centigrade for 10 hours under nitrogen atmosphere at 5 ℃/min heating rate. NTP microspheres were prepared by using the same method, in which sodium citrate was replaced by 265 g sodium carbonate.
The XRD data were test using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer. The morphology and structural information of the samples were analyzed by S-3400N scanning electron microscope and JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope. Using 514 nm laser as excitation source, Raman spectrum was obtained by PerkinElmer Raman workstation 400 spectrometer. The thermal characteristics of the samples were analyzed by synchronous thermal analyzer (STA25000) in the range of room temperature to 900 ℃. The heating rate was 15 ℃ m i n−1. The element content was studied using vario MACRO CN analyzer. Material particle size is tested by Laser Particle Size Analyser (Winner 2000E).
In order to prepare electrode, a mixture of NTP/C microsphere composite materia (70%), Super P (20%, conductive additive), polyvinylidene fluoride (10%, binder) was grinded to give a slurry. After the dried electrode material was rolled with a roller press, it was cut into a working electrode of area 1.13 cm2, and the load of the active material was about 2 mg/cm2. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled in an argon filled glove box (SUPER(1220/750/900)). The electrolyte we used was a mixture of vinyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate, with a volume ratio of 1:1 and a concentration of addition of 1 M NaClO4. The constant current discharge-charge experiment was carried out on the Land-2001A device, and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation.
The structural properties including sizes, morphologies of NTP and NTP/C products description shown in Figure 1. As shown in the FESEM images in Figures 1(a)–(b), all NTP materials are regular block particles with smooth surfaces and particle diameters of about 2 μm. And in Figures 1(c)–(e), all NTP/C composites had microspherical morphology. Figures 1(f)–(g) show the morphologies and sizes of NTP/C at high-magnification, which display similar morphology with particle size distributions ranging from 200 nm to 800 nm. Figures 1(f)–(g) shows the morphology and size of NTP/C product at high magnification, with particle size distribution between 200–800 nm.
 From the panoramic TEM image (Fig. 2(a)) of the prepared NTP/C, we can see that the surface morphology of NTP/C is composed of a large number of small particles. The medium magnification images show that the particles are elliptic and about 150 nm in size (Figs. 2(b–c)). Clear lattice fringe and uniform amorphous carbon layer can be observed in HRTEM image (Figs. 2(d–f)), indicating that NTP/C composite have good crystallinity. The lattice fringe spacing was measured to be 0.367 nm, which is very close to the d of the (113) faces of the rhombohedral NaTi2(PO4)3. Careful observation Figures 2(e)–(f) show that the amorphous carbon layer is 2.8–3.2 nm thick and uniformly coated on the surface of NTP crystal particles.
 The XRD patterns of the NTP/C and NTP composites are shown in Figure 3(a). The high intensity of the diffraction peak shows that the sample has good crystallinity. The peak value of this substance corresponds to JCPDS No. 331296. No characteristic peaks of carbon were detected in XRD spectra, which indicated that carbon existed in the form of amorphous in NTP/C composites.
The carbon in the NTP and NTP/C composites was qualitatively analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. From the Figure 3(b), typical peaks of NPT can be found in the Raman spectrum appearing at 970, 983, 1010, and 1095 cm−1 [32]. Peaks appearing at 195 and 272 cm−1 are associated with the motions are attributed to the translational vibrations of the of Ti4+ ions. The peaks at 305, 335, 347, and 472 cm−1 are ascribe to the vibrations of [PO4]3− [32]. In the Raman spectrum of NTP/C, typical peaks of NPT are still clearly visible. In contrast, two strong and broad characteristic peak of carbon can be found at 1,346 cm−1 (A1g vibration mode, D-band) and 1,608 cm−1 (E2g vibration mode of the sp2, G-band) [27]. The Raman results show that carbon indeed exists in the NTP/C composite. The ratio of the D to G band is higher than the conventional case, which means that the graphitization degree of carbon in NTP/C composite is lower.
The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis operating under flowing air, as shown in Figure 3(c). The results showed that the weight of the NTP@C-1 microsphere reduced by approximately 0.83% in the range of 30–300℃; this indicated that the moisture content in the sample was 0.83%. From 300℃ to 900 ℃, the weight of the product reduced by about 4.11%, which indicated that the carbon content is about 4.11%.
The particle size distribution of NTP/C composite was tested by Laser Particle Size Analyser. The data were a b Fig. 5. (a) Cyclic voltammograms of the NTP/C and NTP electrodes at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s. (b) Nyquist plots of the NTP/C and NTP after 500 cycles. shown in Figure 3(d). The results show that the D10, D50 and D90 value of the sample is 0.8, 2.2 and 4.0 μm respectively and the average particle diameter is 2.17 μm; which is consistent with that of SEM.
The electrochemical properties of as-prepared products including NTP/C and NTP were evaluated via coin cells. A typical voltage capacity profile performance for the obtained NTP/C composite after 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 cycles at 5 C (Fig. 4(a)). The overpotentials of NTP/C are 0.34, 0.48, 0.52, 0.584, 0.62, 0.635 V in 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 cycles, respectively. The discharge-capacities of NTP/C electrode in the 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 cycles are 69, 54.02, 53.39, 53.70, 52.35 and 52.76 mA h g−1, respectively. The comparative charge capacity are 67.95, 53.81, 53.39, 53.70, 52.35 and 52.87 mA h g−1, respectively. The Coulombic efficiencies in the 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 cycles are found to be 99.93%, 99.61%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 99.88%, respectively. Compared with NTP reported in other literatures [37–39], our as-prepared sample shows longer cycle life, and the capacity after 2000 cycles is about 73.2% of the initial capacity (Fig. 4(b)).
The rate capabilities of NTP/C from 1 C to 20 C were tested, 20 cycles per rate stage. As shown in Figure 4(c), the specific capacities of NTP/C are as high as 80.9 , 74.9, 69, 47.3 and 33.5 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 C. However the over potential of NTP are 0.51, 0.52, 0.56, 0.68, 0.71 V in the 1, 50, 100, 150 and 200 cycles, respectively (Fig. 4(d)). Figure 4(e) indicates that the discharge capacities of NTP in the 1, 100, and 200 cycles are 43.2, 26.8, and 23.9 mA h g−1, respectively. The comparative charge capacity values are 34.9, 26.7, and 23.8 mA h g−1, respectively. In addition, the rate capabilities of the NTP are lower than that of the NTP/C composite as shown in Figure 4(f). The above comparison indicate that NTP/C has higher battery capacity, smaller polarizability and better stability than that of NTP.
The cyclic votammograms testes were shown in Figure 5(a). The redox peaks appears at 2.26/1.92 V for NTP/C composite, which is consistent with the results of other reports [17–23]. The redox peaks corresponds to the oxidation-reduction reactions between Ti3+ and Ti4+: NTP + 2Na+ + 2e− → Na3Ti2(PO4)3. It should be noted that compared with the NPT/C electrode, the oxidation potential of NTP electrode moves to high voltage by about 0.1 V . In addition, compared with NPT electrode, the redox peak of NTP/C electrode is lower and wider, which indicates that NTP electrode has larger overpotential. By calculating the overpotential of NTP/C is 0.34 V , which is less than that of NTP (0.42 V). The lower overpotential signify lower electrochemical polarization and higher reversibility. The improvement in e electrochemical properties is due to the increase in conductivity resulting from carbon recombination.
In order to better understand the electrode dynamics, the NTP/C and NTP electrode were tested by the AC impedance tests (Fig. 5(b)). The charge transfer resistance of NTP/C and NTP are 391 and 468 Ω. This shows that after carbon doping of the material, the overpotential of the NTP material during charging and discharging is reduced, and the effective transmission of ions/electrons between the electrode material and the electrolyte is improved.
In summary, large-scale (about 3 Kg at a time) NTP/C nanoparticles were obtained by ball milling, spray drying and calcination process. The as-prepared NTP/C composite shows excellent performance. At 5 C rate, the discharge capacities of NTP/C electrode in the 1, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 cycles are 69, 53.39, 53.70, 52.35 and 52.76 mA h g−1, respectively. From 1 to 2000 cycles, the Coulombic efficiencies are all nearly 100%. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NTP/C composite nanoparticles can be ascribed to two factors: (I) NTP is designed to be nano-scale particles, which can shorten the ion and electron transport paths and make electrolytes permeable easily. (II) Carbon coating not only can improves the electric conductivity of NTP/C composite, but also can protect the nano-structure in a certain degree.
