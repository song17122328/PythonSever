Materials belonging to NASICON family of compositions Na2HfM(PO4)3 and Ag2¬°xNaxHfM(PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al and 0.07  x  0.13) are prepared by sol-gel and ion exchange methods, respectively. The IR spectra are characterized by bands belonging to PO4 groups. The band gap energy of all compositions is obtained from their UV-vis DRS proÔ¨Åles. All these materials are used as catalysts in the degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange under visible light irradiation. The silver compounds have shown good catalytic activity compared to their sodium analogues. The catalysts are stable even after the third cycle of photodegradation.

In materials of composition Na1CxMIV 2¬°xMIII(PO4)3 with NASICON type structure the framework is built by M2(PO4)3 units. In this unit, two MO6 octahedra are linked to three PO4 tetrahedra.[1‚Äì3] This linkage leads to the formation of inÔ¨Ånite ribbons connected by PO4 units, perpendicular to the c-axis.[4] The Na ions can occupy two different sites in the conduction channels: the M1 site is coordinated by a trigonal antiprism of oxygens (six coordination) and M2 site has a distorted 8-fold coordination. The ratio of M1 to M2 is 1:3 per formula unit. Such three-dimensional polyanionic tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra structures built of PO4 have been identiÔ¨Åed as interesting hosts for reversible inser.[5‚Äì8] The sodium ion can be substituted by tion of Na uni-, di-, tri-, and tetravalent ions, giving rise to a very large number of materials. These materials are highly stable, ionic conducting, and possess considerable surface area due to its unique tunnel structure. All these materials possessing NASICON framework have potential applications in catalytic reactions,[9] electrochemical devices,[10,11] and radioactive waste storage.[12] Silver bearing NASICON type materials have been used as catalysts in the butan-2-ol conversion to C C butane and methyl ethyl ketone.[9] Although Na containing NASICON type framework materials have been extensively studied, there have been few investigations on C analogues having same framework structure[9,13] despite Ag their potential catalytic applications. Further, it was reported that the presence of silver enhances the photocatalytic activity of semiconductor catalysts.[14] In continuation of our investigations on silver containing NASICON type materials for catalytic application, we report the preparation, characterization, and photocatalytic studies of Na2HfFe(PO4)3 and Ag2¬°xNaxHfM(PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al and 0.07  x  0.13). For convenience, the composition Na2HfFe(PO4)3, Na2HfAl (0.07  x  0.13), and (PO4)3, Ag2¬°xNaxHfFe(PO4)3 Ag2¬°xNaxHfAl(PO4)3 (0.07  x  0.13) are abbreviated as NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP, respectively.

Na2HfM(PO4)3 (where M D Fe and Al) were prepared by sol-gel method. The preparation of NHFP (NHAP) is described. Stoichiometric amounts of NaNO3, Fe(NO3)3, Al (NO3)3, and NH4H2PO4 were dissolved in ¬ª20 mL of distilled water separately. All the solutions were mixed under constant stirring and stoichiometric amount of HfO2 was added. Subsequently, citric acid was added to this resultant solution in 2:1 mole ratio of citric acid to metal ions. After 1 h of continuous stirring at room temperature, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 6‚Äì7 by adding dilute ammonia solution. It was slowly evaporated on a hot plate under constant stirring until a thick viscous solution was obtained. At this stage, ethylene glycol was added such that the mole ratio of citric acid to ethylene glycol is 1:1.2. Then the solution was evaporated at 373 K till a gel was obtained. The temperature was increased to 433‚Äì453 K to get a black porous solid. This solid was ground thoroughly using spectral grade acetone to obtain Ô¨Åne powder (designated as precursor). This precursor was divided into a few parts and heated separately at 673, 723, 923, 1023, and 1123 K for 5 h. The color of NHFP and NHAP was light red and white, respectively. The silver analogues, viz., Ag2¬°xNaxHfM(PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al and 0.07  x  0.13) were prepared by ion-exchange method. Attempts to prepare Ag2¬°xNaxHfM(PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al and 0.07  x  0.13) by sol-gel method were unsuccessful. One g (0.00186 mol) of Na2HfM(PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al) and 0.94 g (0.0056 mol) of AgNO3 (the mole ratio of Na2HfM (PO4)3 and AgNO3 is 1:3) are added to 40 mL of distilled water in a round bottom Ô¨Çask and reÔ¨Çuxed for 12 h (at C). This process is repeated once again by taking freshly 60 prepared AgNO3 solution in the same ratio. The resultant ash colored product was washed with distilled water several times to remove the byproduct, NaNO3. The obtained product was dried at 373 K on a hot plate. The possible reaction is shown in Eq1.

The room temperature powder X-ray diffractograms of all these samples were recorded on a Rigaku miniÔ¨Çex 600 X-ray diffractometer using nickel Ô¨Åltered Cu-Ka radiation of wave for phase conformation in the 2u range length 1.5406 A 10‚Äì80 and scan step time of 0.15 s. The unit cell parameters were calculated by least square reÔ¨Ånement technique using POWD program. The energy-dispersive spectra were recorded on the HITACHI SU-1500 variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VP-SEM). Infrared spectra of all the samples were recorded ¬°1 using KBr pellets in the wave number range 1500‚Äì400 cm with a Shimadzu FTIR-5300 spectrometer. The room temperature 31P solid state MAS-NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker MSL-300 MHz solid state high resolution spectrometer operating at 121.49 MHz with a 10 kHz spinning speed. The samples were packed in a 4 mm Zirconia with 5 m/s duration were used with a rotor. Pulses of 90 recycle delay of 5 s between pulses. The chemical shift values are given with respect to an 85% H3PO4 solution. UV-vis DRS spectra were recorded with JASCO V 650 UV-vis spectrometer in the range of 200‚Äì800 nm.

The photocatalytic activity of NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP samples was evaluated for the degradation of Methylene blue (MB) and Methyl orange (MO) under visible light. ¬°1 MB soluIn a typical experiment, 100 mL of 10 tion (MO solution) was taken in a photo reactor Ô¨Çask and mixed with 100 mg of NHFP. The resultant suspension of MB (MO) was kept in the dark for ¬ª3 h (¬ª1 h) to ensure the establishment of an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Subsequently, the contents were kept under visible light irradiation using 300 W tungsten lamp (wavelength range: 380‚Äì 840 nm) for 3 h with constant stirring and circulation of cold water to minimize the evaporation of water from the suspension. At regular intervals of time, about 3 mL of suspension was collected and Ô¨Åltered through a millipore Ô¨Ålter, and its optical density was measured using a JASCO V‚Äì650 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 665 nm (for MB) and 464 nm (for MO). The procedure was repeated using NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP.

The powder XRD patterns of NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP are shown in Figures 1a and 1b. All the diffraction patterns are found to be free from impurities and can be compared with the diffraction patterns of NASICON type compounds reported earlier.[15] The d-lines of all the samples are similar to each other except the intensity. The intensity of dlines of both silver compounds is less compared to their sodium analogues. The powder patterns of both NHFP and NHAP are sharp indicating high crystallinity. On the other hand, both AHFP and AHAP are characterized by broad and ill-deÔ¨Åned reÔ¨Çections due to their poor crystallinity. The relative intensity of some of the reÔ¨Çections of AHFP and AHAP is changed considerably with reference to their sodium analogues. Silver doped phosphates are known to give broad d-lines possibly due to their low crystallinity, change in the sample morphology, and exchange of sodium ions.[16‚Äì18] The unit cell parameters of all these ions by Ag compositions were obtained from XRD patterns using least square Ô¨Åt method (POWD software) and are given in Table 1. All these compositions crystallized in rhombohedral lattice with space groupR¬° 3c. The observed d-lines of NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP and the unit cell parameters obtained are comparable with those reported for AgHf2P3O12, AgZr2P3O12, Na2TiMP3O12 and Li1.6Na0.4TiMP3O12 P3O12, and Na1.4M1.6In0.4P3O12 (M D Hf, Ti, Sn, and Zr).[9,13,15,19,20] A small variation in the lattice parameters is observed, which is attributed to the variation of the ionic radii of trivalent metal ions Al3C ). The unit cell parameters of AHAP and AHFP are close to their parent compounds, viz. NHAP and NHFP, respectively. As the silver ions occupy the channels replacing sodium ions, the skeletal structure remains the same leading to approximately same unit cell dimensions.

The energy dispersive spectra (EDS) of all the compositions in the present investigation were recorded to conÔ¨Årm the . The energy dispersive spectra of replacement of Na AHAP and NHAP (representative) is shown in Figures 2a and 2b. The intensity of sodium peak at 1.2 keV in AHAP is about 5% compared to its intensity in NHAP indicating that ions. Based on about 95% of Na the EDS results, the molecular formula of AHAP can be written as Ag2¬°xNaxHfAlP3O12 (0.08  x  0.12). Similarly, the molecular formula of AHFP obtained from its EDS is found to be Ag2¬°xNaxHfFeP3O12 (0.07  x  0.13).

The IR spectra of NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP were ¬°1 (Figure 3). All the measured in the range of 1500‚Äì400 cm compounds exhibit strong absorption bands in this range. The vibrational modes of these phases can be divided into two types: (a) internal and external modes of tetrahedral PO4 and (b) lattice modes of octahedral MO6 units. The bands corresponding to PO4 units are more intense than lattice modes of metal octahedra. According to factor group analysis, the PO4 group gives the following vibrational modes[21]: (a) the symmetric non degenerate P‚ÄìO stretching (ns or n1, ¬°1); (b) asymmetric, douobserved in the range 950‚Äì1070 cm ble degenerate P‚ÄìO stretching (nd or n2, observed at 440‚Äì ¬°1); (c) symmetric, triple degenerate O‚ÄìP‚ÄìO bending 450 cm ¬°1); and (d) asymmetric, (dd or n3, observed at 1100‚Äì1210 cm triple degenerate and harmonic O‚ÄìP‚ÄìO bending (dd or n4, ¬°1). The observed infrared bands for observed at 560‚Äì680 cm all the samples are given in Table 2 along with their assignments. Barj et al.[22‚Äì24] reported that n3 mode is sensitive to the polarizing nature of the metal ion. Ions with small size and large charge have more polarizing nature, leading to localization of electron density on the P-O (M) bond, which in turn increases the force constant and hence the vibration frequency.[24] In the present series of compounds, the charge of the metal ion is same and therefore the polarizing power depends only on the ionic size. As the ionic size of M3C follows the order Al3C ),[25,26] the order of n3 is expected to be NHAP > NHFP. The n3 values observed for NHAP and NHFP are consistent with this view. The PO4 external modes corresponding to vibrational and translational motions of these groups are generally observed ¬°1. Due to the instrumental constraints the below 300 cm ¬°1 and hence the spectra could not be recorded below 400 cm corresponding assignments could not be made. It is noticed that NASICON type compounds are contaminated with pyrophosphate or long chain poly phosphates. In the present investigation, the absence of strong bands in the region of 730 ¬°740 cm ¬°1 indicates the absence of pyrophosphate and long phosphate chains, respectively.[22‚Äì26] Similar types of spectra are obtained for AHFP and AHAP.

The 31P-MAS NMR is a good probe to Ô¨Ånd the local structure of phosphorous ions in NASICON framework. It gives different signals for chemically/crystallographically inequivalent sites of phosphorous. For instance, the 31P MAS NMR spectra of AgHf2(PO4)3, AgZr2(PO4)3, NaZr2(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 gave only one symmetric peak and all the phosphorous atoms occupy only one site (6b) position of the rhombohedral lattice with R¬° 3c space group.[9,13,27] On the other hand, two peaks were observed in Na5Ti(PO4)3 suggesting the occupation of phosphorous at two crystallographically different sites.[27] Figure 4 shows the 31P-MAS NMR spectra of NHAP and AHAP. These spectra are characterized by a symmetric single peak at ‚Äì10.66 and ‚Äì9.73 ppm for NHAP and AHAP, respectively, suggesting only one type of phosphorous in the rhombohedral lattice. The other peaks observed at 130, 40, ‚Äì30, and ‚Äì120 ppm are C spinning side bands. This result supports the view that Na and Ag ions (NHAP and AHAP) are Ô¨Ålled in M1 site and M2 being vacant in the space groupR¬° 3c. The chemical shift value of this compound is close to our earlier results observed in NaAlSb(PO4)3 (d D 9.001 ppm), HAlSb(PO4)3 (d D 9.18 ppm), but higher than those observed in NaZr2(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3. The observed difference in the chemical shift value of present sample with NaZr2(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 could be due to change in the electron density at phosphorous due to the electronegativity differences of M3C .

The light absorption properties of NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP were investigated. Figure 5 shows the diffused reÔ¨Çectance spectra (DRS) of these materials in the range 200‚Äì 900 nm. The DRS of all these samples are characterized by two bands in the 210‚Äì240 nm region. These bands are assigned to charge transfer O2¬° ! Hf4C transitions.[28] The absorption proÔ¨Åles of AHFP and AHAP also show these bands in the same region with a small red shift and tailing towards longer wavelength. Further, AHFP and AHAP show broad and weak absorption centered at about 450 nm. The interpretation of bands observed in silver exchanged is diverse and complex. Bartolomeu et al.[29] materials showed that the band observed in the region 200‚Äì240 nm corC while Ag0 particles give bands above responds to Ag 350 nm. On the other hand, Aspromonte et al.[30] and Shi et al.[31] reported that bands at 400 and 430 nm correspond to Ag2O nanoparticles and ill-deÔ¨Åned silver oxides, respectively. In the present investigation both AHFP and AHAP C. are prepared by ion exchange using silver nitrate at 60 Therefore, the possibility of Ag or Ag2O formation is minimum. Hence the observed weak band centered at 450 nm C (Figure 5 inset) may be due to electronic transition of Ag ions between 1S (4d10) and 3D (4d9 5S1).[9,13,29] Accurate band gap energy of semiconducting oxides can be obtained from the Kubelka-Munk plot of (Khn)1/2 versus hn where K is reÔ¨Çectance transformed according to Kubelka-Munk, where R is reÔ¨Çectancy (%) and hn is photon energy. Extrapolation of linear portion of the plot to (Khn)1/2 D 0 (i.e., onto the x-axis) gives an estimation of band gap energy. The band gap energy of all the samples was obtained from KubelkaMunk plots (Figure 5) and found to be 3.59, 3.55, 3.19, and 3.11 eV for NHAP, NHFP, AHFP, and AHAP, respectively. ions into the lattice of Na2HfM The introduction of Ag (PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al) reduces the band gap energy considerably as observed from the red shift of the absorption bands. The observed reduction in the band gap energy in the case of AHFP and AHAP is due to the introduction of fully occupied (d10 conÔ¨Åguration) into the VB. The hybridd-states of Ag ization of these states with O 2p states contribute to an upshift of the top of VB position giving rise to a decrease in the band gap energy.

Photodegradation of MB and MO was carried out under visible light irradiation. MB and MO exhibit strong absorptions at 665 and 464 nm, respectively. The degradation of MB and MO for all the catalysts was monitored by measuring the optical density (at 665 and 464 nm, respectively) and the UV-visible spectra at different time intervals of visible light irradiation. All the experiments were carried out at the natural pH of the solution. Blank experiments on aqueous MB and MO solutions in the absence of catalyst were also carried out under the same conditions. In the absence of catalyst, the degradation of MO is negligible but MB decomposed to an extent of 30% in 180 min of irradiation. The absorption spectrum of MB is characterized by a medium band at ¬ª300 nm and a strong band at ¬ª665 nm with a shoulder at ¬ª600 nm. The band at 300 nm arises due to the aromatic ring while the overlapping bands are assigned to conjugated p system. The samples were kept in dark chamber for attaining the adsorption-desorption equilibrium for 3 h before the photocatalytic experiment. From this data, it is clear that the adsorption/desorption equilibrium is established after 1 h. It is observed that the degradation of MB increased with increase in the irradiation time (Figure 6). The MB degradation in presence of catalysts follow the order NHFP < NHAP < AHAP < AHFP.

The photodegradation of MO in the presence of all the catalysts (NHFP, NHAP, AHFP, and AHAP) is shown in Figure 7. The absorption spectrum of MO is characterized by a strong band at 464 nm. The degradation of MO in the absence of catalyst is almost negligible. The MO degradation in presence of catalysts follow the order NHFP < NHAP < AHAP < AHFP. The degradation of MO in the presence of NHFP and NHAP is low (about 41%). Under the same conditions, the MO degradation in the presence of AHFP and AHAP was found to be 80% and 79%, respectively, in 3 h. The percentage of degraded amount of MB and MO by these photocatalysts is given in Table 3.

The photodegradation trend shows that parent NHFP and NHAP have lower photoactivity compared to their silver analogues. It is well known that the photoactivity of a material depends on several factors such as surface structure, extent of crystallinity, surface area, structure of the material, the adsorption ability of the pollutant, and band gap energy of the material. The photocatalytic oxidation of organic compounds on AHFP, AHAP, NHFP, and NHAP may proceed in two steps: (a) the adsorption of organic compound on to the surface of the catalyst to form a weak complex and (b) exchange of electrons with the reactive surface of samples.[33] Although it is difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd the reason for higher photoactivity of AHFP and AHAP, in the present investigation it may be due to (a) their lower band gap energy and (b) the effects of Ag ions, which act as electron traps leading to better electron excitation.

The practical applications of a photocatalyst are dependent on its stability during the photoreaction and the possibility of the photocatalysts were reused three times for MB and MO degradation. Figures 8a and 8b show the three cycles of ¬°5 M) and MO (1 ¬£ 10 photodegradation of MB (1 ¬£ 10 ¬°5 M) using AHFP as photocatalyst. It is observed that photocatalyst for photodegradation of MB and MO in all the cycles. This conÔ¨Årms that the structure /composition of the photocatalyst remain the same even after third cycle of photodegradation. The powder XRD of the catalyst (AHFP) recorded after the third cycle was found to be the same (Figure 9). Thus these silver containing NASICON type materials can be considered as attractive photocatalysts for industrial waste/pollutant puriÔ¨Åcation.

New sodium and silver to NASICON family, Na2HfM(PO4)3 and Ag2¬°xNaxHfM (PO4)3 (M D Fe and Al and 0.07  x  0.13), were prepared and characterized by powder Xray diffraction, infrared spectra, energy dispersive spectra and 31P MAS NMR. All the samples crystallized in rhombohedral lattice of NASICON framework. The infrared spectra of these compositions show characteristic PO4 vibrations. The 31P MAS NMR values of NHAP and AHAP exhibit a symmetric single peak at ‚Äì10.66 and ‚Äì9.73 ppm, suggesting only one type of phosphorous in the rhombohedral lattice. EDS data show that the 95% of sodium ions are exchanged by silver ions. The band gap energy of all compounds was found to be in the range 3.11‚Äì3.59 eV. The higher photoactivity of AHFP and AHAP compared to their sodium analogues is possibly due to their lower band gap energy and the Ag ion electron traps. All the catalysts have shown good chemical stability and same catalytic activity after three cycles of photodegradation.
