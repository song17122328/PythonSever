Materials with the general formula AxBB8(PO4) 3 consisting of a BB8(PO4) 3 framework built up by a cornersharing B(B8)O6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in such a way that each octahedron is surrounded by six tetrahedra and each tetrahedron is connected to four octahedra, crystallise mainly in the Nasicon NaZr2(PO4) 3 (R3¯ c space group! ~Hagman and Kierkegaard, 1968! or the langebeinite Na2TiB8(PO4) 3 (B85Cr,Fe) structures (P2 13 space group! ~Isasi and Daidouh, 2000!. Depending on the temperature of preparation, the Nasicon structure can transform to the langbeinite as it was shown for BaTiV(PO4) 3 ~Kasthuri Rangan and Gopalakrishnan, 1994!. Both structure types are related to each other by simple distortions and/or rotations of the cations polyhedra. The langbeinite structure is a cage structure with large A cations in the cages and small windows connecting the cages.
Within the Nasicon framework, there are interconnected interstitial sites usually labeled M1 and M2 through which A cation can diffuse, giving rise to a fast-ion conductivity ~Hong, 1976; Delmas et al., 1981; Aatiq et al., 2002a!.
Phosphates within the Nasicon-type family have been the subject of intensive research due to their potential applications as a solid electrolyte, electrode material, and low thermal expansion ceramics ~Hong, 1976; Padhi et al., 1997; Delmas et al., 1988; Woodcock et al., 1999; Aatiq et al., 2002b!. Previously, there was particular interest by several authors in the phosphates with Nasicon-type materials especially those containing, within the framework, elements which can have more than one oxidation state ~e.g., Ti, Fe, Sn, Nb, V! ~Morin et al., 1997; Masquelier et al., 2000; Aatiq et al., 2002a; Yin et al., 2003!. More recently, the structural characteristics by powder X-ray diffraction ~XRD! study using the Rietveld method for the two ATiFe(PO4) 3 (A5Ca,Cd) phases were realised ~Aatiq and Dhoum, 2003!. In both materials, A21 cations are distributed in the M1 site and Fe31(Ti41) within the Nasicon Ti~Fe!(PO4) 3 framework. 
In a continuation of our search concerning Nasiconlike structure, the ﬁrst objective of the present study was the structural determination, using Rietveld reﬁnement of the XRD patterns, of CaSnFe(PO4) 3 . Our work has therefore been extended to the structural study of two newly synthe(A sised phases with general 5Na2 ,Cd).
Syntheses of ASnFe(PO4) 3 (A5Na2 ,Ca,Cd) were carried out using conventional solid-state reaction techniques. Powder crystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of carbonates Na2CO3 ~Merck, 99.5%! or CaCO3 ~Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99%! or CdCO3 ~Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99%!, oxides SnO2 ~Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99.9%!, Fe2O3 ~Prolabo, 99%!, and NH4H2PO4 ~Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99%! in stoichiometric proportions. The mixture was heated progressively with intermittent grinding at 200 °C ~12 h!, 600 °C ~12 h!, 800 °C ~16 h!, 950 °C ~48 h! for (A5Na2) and another treatment at 1000 °C ~48 h! for (A5Ca,Cd) in air atmosphere. The products of reaction were characterised by XRD at room temperature with a Bruker D8 advance ~u–2u! diffractometer; (Cu Ka) radiation ~40 kV, 40 mA!; divergence slit of 1° and antiscatter slit of 1°. The data were collected in the 10°–90° ~2u! range by steps of 0.02°~2u!, with a constant counting time of 14 s by step. 
The reﬁnement of the structure by the Rietveld method was performed using the FULLPROF program ~Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1997!.
Initial starting parameters for the Rietveld reﬁnement of Na2SnFe(PO4) 3 were based on those already reported for the R3¯ c structure of @Li0.5h 2.50#M2@Li0.50Mn0.50#M1TiCr(PO4) 3 ~Aatiq et al., 1998!. In the ﬁrst step, we have assumed that Sn and Fe atoms were randomly distributed within the Nasicon framework @i.e., Sn~Fe! in the Ti~Cr! site#. The structural parameters of CaTiFe(PO4) 3 ~Aatiq and Dhoum, 2003! were used as starting parameters for the Rietveld reﬁnement of the two ASnFe(PO4) 3 (A5Ca,Cd) phases. Even if the divalent ions in A21B41B831(PO4) 3 type phases occupied preferentially the M1 sites of the Nasicon framework ~Aatiq et al., 1998; Aatiq and Dhoum, 2003! in a ﬁrst step of the structural reﬁnement, A (A5Ca,Cd), Fe, and Sn atoms were separately supposed to be distributed in the M1 sites. As will be discussed in the following, hypothesis of possible occupation of the M2 sites in ASnFe(PO4) 3 Nasicon framework was also checked.
XRD powder data of the three ASnFe(PO4) 3 (A 5Na2 ,Ca,Cd) phases indicated that they were highly crystalline with their structure belonging to the rhombohedral R3¯ c Nasicon type. Therefore, the following structural reﬁnements were based upon this assumption.
It should be noticed that within the Nasicon framework, there are four interconnected cation sites, per formula unit, usually labeled M1 ~one per formula unit! and M2 ~three per formula unit! which can be represented by the crystallographic the @BB8(PO4) 3# skeleton, each M1 cavity is situated between two B(B8)O6 octahedra along the c axis at the intersection of three conduction channels ~Figure 1!. Six M2 cavities with eightfold the @O3B(B8)O3M1O3B(B8)O3 O3B(B8)O3# ‘ ribbons and surround the M1 cavity.
The fact that the amplitude of X-ray scattering by an element is proportional to its atomic number sets a severe limitation on the amount of information which can be obtained by X-ray investigations of substances containing atoms of neighbouring atomic number. On the basis of XRD data alone therefore it is not possible in our case to distinguish without ambiguity between Cd and Sn atoms. Since only the XRD data are available and Sn41 and Cd21 are isoelectronic ions, three hypotheses of Cd, Sn, and Fe atoms distribution, in CdSnFe(PO4) 3 , were checked. 
Sn, Fe, and P sites in @Cd#M1SnFe(PO4) 3 ~2.0 for Cd in M1 site, 3.8 for Sn/Fe, and 5.0 for P! are relatively consistent with the expected formal oxidation state of Cd21, Fe31, Sn41 and P51 ions. X-ray powder diffraction data of CdSnFe(PO4) 3 , obtained from the ‘‘observed intensities’’ of the Rietveld reﬁnement (Cu Ka1:1.54056 Å), are given in Table IV.
A preliminarily comparison between the powder XRD spectrum, for CaSnFe(PO4) 3 , presented in this work ~Figure 4! with that already signalized in literature ~PDF number 31-275! shows: ~i! a notable difference in diffraction lines intensity and also ~ii! the presence of additional weak diffraction lines in the present XRD spectrum ~see, e.g., at 2u 514.378° and 2u525.307°) ~Figure 4!. Since the hexagonal cell parameters already mentioned (a58.596 Å,c 522.104 Å) are relatively comparable to that calculated in the present work @a58.569(1) Å,c522.037(2) Å#, and the observed additional diffraction lines have only a weak intensity, substantial improvement on the known literature data is probably related to the condition of the spectrum run ~e.g., the counting time,...! and/or the way used for estimating the relative peak intensity. 
Taking into account the abovementioned consideration, and in order to have more structural information about compounds with general formula ASnFe(PO4) 3 (A5Ca,Sr,Ba), the structure determination of the selected CaSnFe(PO4) 3 phosphate was undertaken.
The localisation, of Na1 within M1 and M2 sites of Na2SnFe(PO4) 3 , and Ca21 in M1 sites of CaSnFe(PO4) 3 , has been proved from powder X-ray diffraction data. In the case of CdSnFe(PO4) 3 , XRD data cannot distinguish, without difﬁculty, between the two isoelectronic Cd21 and Sn41 cations but analysis of cation–anion distances found after structure determination permits a conclusion about the cationic distribution. In the case of ASnFe(PO4) 3 (A5Cd,Ca) materials, the present example of structural analysis shows how the overall set of distance values, found after structural reﬁnements, and calculated bond valence sums ~BVS! can give effective support for structural determination when it is difﬁcult to distinguish, from powder XRD data, between elements of neighbouring atomic number in the periodic table.
Close examination of the atomic positions and interatomic distances shows that the main differences between or both CaSnFe(PO4) 3) structures are in the ribbons parallel to the c axis. The linear increases of M1–O~2! distance versus A cat(A5Na2 ,Ca,Cd) ion ionic radii (r A), phases, is accompanied with a regular increase of c hex parameters @Figure 5~a!#. The increase of the M1 site size in Na2SnFe(PO4) 3 is accompanied by oxygen displacements perpendicular to the c axis which give rise to rotation of the PO4 tetrahedra and leads to a distortion of the @Sn(Fe) 3(PO4) 3# framework. On the other hand, as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between A cations (A5Cd,Ca,Na2) in in M1 ASnFe(PO4) 3 in Sn(Fe)O6 octahedra is larger than Sn~Fe!–O~1! one and consequently, the O~1!–Sn~Fe!–O~1! (a1) angle is higher than the O~2!–Sn~Fe!-O~2! (a2) one @Figures 1~a! and 5~b!# ~i.e., a1597.5° and a2578.0° for CdSnFe(PO4) 3 ; a1596.3° and a2579.2° for CaSnFe(PO4) 3 ; and a1593.7° and a2 580.3° for Na2SnFe(PO4) 3). 
As can be deduced from the relatively small variation of Sn~Fe!–O distances versus r A in neighbouring Sn41(Fe31) the Sn~Fe!–O~2! cations distance site.
