Driven by the rising demand for consumer electronics, the field of all solid-state batteries employing solid electrolytes as the ion conducting separator has attracted enormous attention in the last years. Recently, the lithium-conducting rare-earth halides A3MX6 (A = Li, M = Y, Er, X = Cl, Br, I) and Li3InX6 have been rediscovered as potential solid electrolytes, showing a good overall electrochemical performance, while the corresponding sodium-based compounds have been mostly overlooked yet. Here, we report the ionic transport properties of the Na-ion conducting rare-earth halide solid electrolyte Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6. Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 shows a conductivity enhancement from 10-9 S¬∑cm-1 up to of ~0.04 mScm-1 for Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6, alongside interesting local structural rearrangements of the polyhedral motifs along the series of solid solutions. This series of halide-based sodium ion conductors sheds light on promising compositions in search for superionic materials.
All solid-state batteries hold promise to meet the rising demand for high energy density and safe storage system over the conventional lithium-ion technology.1 One major requirement is the use of highly conducting, electrochemically stable lithium ion conductors as a separator material and the conductive electrolyte in the cathode composites.2,3 Although the performance of some solid electrolytes nearly match with the liquid counterparts,4‚Äì7 challenges concerning interfacial decomposition reactions have not been solved yet.8‚Äì10 Another potential issue with this Li-ion battery technology is the scarcity of lithium metal, which further drives the search for an alternative.11 Sodium can be used as an earth abundant, low cost substitute of lithium in the solid state battery technology, provided the sodium-containing solid electrolytes can match the performance of their lithium-counterparts.12 Na3MS4 (M=P/Sb),4,13‚Äì15 Na11Sn2PS12,16‚Äì20 NaM2(PX4)3 (M = Zr, Ti, X = O, S)21‚Äì25 are well known names from this family. Recently, a high conductivity of up to 41 mS¬∑cm-1 has been realized for the tungsten substituted Na3SbS4, resulting from a large concentration of Na-vacancies.4,26 However, besides the needed high ionic conductivity, a chemical compatibility to the used electrodes, a high electrochemical stability and general processing capabilities are needed.27‚Äì29 Although a multitude of sodium containing thiophosphates perform great regarding their conductivity, the limited voltage stability window hinders reaching high energy densities within the resulting batteries.30,31 On the contrary, highly stable oxide super ionic conductors (eg. NASICONs and Œ≤-alumina) that exhibit a sufficient electrochemical window, exhibit high grain boundary resistances and require harsh synthesis conditions.32 
Recently, the rare-earth containing halide compounds Li3MX6 (M = Y, Er; X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted growing interest, as they combine the high ionic conductivity of thiophosphates up to the 1 mS¬∑cm-1 range and the large voltage stability window up to 4 V comparable to known oxides.33‚Äì39 From the recent report of Wang et al.,40 it is clear that the halide anionic framework is responsible for the low ion migration energy barrier and high electrochemical stability in these materials. The monovalent nature of chloride leads to weaker interactions with the Li-ion and hence fast conducting ion diffusion pathways as compared to the sulfide electrolyte. Among these halides, the chlorides promise to be the best choice as the higher electronegativity of the chloride results in better oxidative stability,41 which further drives the current exploration of the chloride-based electrolyte systems for solid state battery application. 
One possible approach to expand the use of these materials would be the search for Na-conducting ternary halide electrolytes.42,43 In this manuscript, we report the successful synthesis of the novel Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 substitution series (x = 0 - 1) via mechanochemical synthesis, where substitution of Er3+ by Zr4+ introduces sodium vacancies and provides necessary free lattice sites for ionic diffusion. Using a combination of powder X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy, we explore the influence of the substitution on the structure, the Na+ concentration and the ionic transport. Introduction of Zr4+ in the Er3+ site leads to changes in the local arrangement of the different polyhedral motifs, it increases the Na-ion vacancy concentration, which in turn improves the ionic conductivity and decreases the activation barriers for ionic motion. As a result of a successful vacancy incorporation and activation energy reduction, an ionic conductivity of ~0.04 mScm-1 is achieved for Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6, which is four orders magnitude higher than that of the pristine Na3ErCl6. This work provides a first framework for these new sodium-halide-based superionic conductors.
Synthesis. All syntheses were carried out under Ar atmosphere. NaCl (Merck, 99.5 %, pre-dried at 200 ¬∞C for 48 h under dynamic vacuum), ErCl3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99 %) and ZrCl4 (Alfa Aesar, 99.5 %) were used as received. The syntheses were carried out using around 5-10 wt% excess of ErCl3 similarly as described elsewhere for the synthesis of Li3ErCl6.35 For the mechanochemical synthesis, the mixtures were put into 45 mL ball mill cups using a 30:1 mass ratio for 5 mm ZrO2 milling media : precursor-powder. The reactions were carried out for a total of 99 cycles, with a cycle consisting of a milling time of 15 min at 500 rpm, followed by a rest step of 5 min. For the subsequent crystallization, the powder was put into pre-dried ampoules and then placed into a preheated furnace for 5 minutes at 550 ¬∞C. To ensure a precise annealing time, the powder-containing ampoules were air-quenched. 
X-ray diffraction and structural analyses. X-ray diffraction was carried out with a STOE STADI P Mythen2 4K diffractometer (Ge(111) monochromator; Ag KŒ±1 radiation, Œª = 0.5594 √Ö) using four Dectris MYTHEN2 R 1K detectors in Debye‚ÄìScherrer geometry.44 Scattering data was acquired over a q-range of 0.3 - 20.5 √Ö-1 with a resolution of  0.0029 √Ö-1 (based on 50 ¬µm strip width of MYTHEN2 R 1K modules and instrument geometry). All samples were sealed in glass capillaries (Hilgenberg, √ò = 0.5 mm) and measured for a total time of 22 h each, except samples with composition x = 0.7 and 0.9, which were measured 8 h each.
Rietveld refinements were carried out using the TOPAS software package. Rietveld-refinements included (1) background and scaling factor, (2) lattice parameters and peak-shape,(3) atomic positions and respective thermal displacement parameters. After refining the sodium occupancies (see Table S1 for constraints) all the parameters were opened up simultaneously to achieve the best possible fit. If this resulted in physically unreasonable values (high Na thermal displacement), the values from the refinement before were taken as final values.  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An impedance spectroscopy analysis was used to assess the ionic conductivities. The electrochemical impedance analysis (EIS) was conducted in the temperature range of -40 ¬∞C to 50 ¬∞C, with an equilibration time of 1 h per step using a VMP300 impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 7 MHz to 100 mHz. Roughly 200 mg of powder were filled into press-cells that use steel stamps as current collectors.9 The cells were pressed with a uniaxial pressure of 382 MPa for 3 minutes followed by a slow pressure-release step. The press-cells were fixed in frames using a torque of 10 Nm for the measurements. Bond valence sum analyses. The bond valance sum (BVS) analysis was performed using the softBV software tool with a grid size of 0.1 √Ö. The obtained energy landscape was merged with the initially used structure file (CIF).45 The BVS method is purely based on coulombic interaction and yields a possible diffusion pathway with minimal valance mismatch of the mobile ion. A detailed description of the BVS method can be found in Ref 45. 
Structure of Na3ErCl6 and Na2ZrCl6. Although the Na-analogue of the rare earth chlorides, Na3MCl6 (M = La-Lu) have long been known, studies on their ionic transport properties are rare.46,47 Na3ErCl6 crystallizes in a distorted cryolite type structure with monoclinic space group (P21/n).48 The crystal structure of Na3ErCl6 is shown in Figure 1 along different crystallographic orientations. The structure comprises an ErCl63- octahedral framework located at the corners of the unit cell, as well as the body-centered position (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) with Er occupying the Wyckoff 2a site. The close resemblance of Na3ErCl6 with a bcc structure hints at a possible favorable ionic conduction process in this class of materials.49 Sodium occupies two different crystallographic positions, which form octahedral (Wyckoff 2b) and prismatic (Wyckoff 4e) sites (Figure 1b) for the two different NaCl65- polyhedra. Each NaCl65- prism is connected by an edge or corner sharing arrangement with another NaCl65- octahedron. The full structure is displayed in Figure 1c, showing its dense polyhedral packing and complexity. The ErCl63- polyhedra share edges with the NaCl65- prism indicating an influence of the Er polyhedra on the Na-diffusion pathway. 
The pristine Na3ErCl6 has only fully occupied sodium polyhedra, which are expected to result in poor ion conduction, as vacant adjacent sites are needed for the mobile species to jump to. Therefore, aliovalent substitution may be needed to improve the ion transport of Na3ErCl6 via substitution of Er with higher valent cations, which hopefully tunes the Na-vacancy density along with diffusion pathway modification. In this work, Zr4+ (r = 72 pm) was selected as a substituent for Er3+ (r = 89 pm) because of its large ionic radius compared to other tetravalent metal ions.50 However, unlike Na3ErCl6, Na2ZrCl6 crystallizes in the trigonal ùëÉ3ùëö1 space group, similar to Li3ErCl6.35,39 In Na2ZrCl6, Zr resides in octahedrally coordinated Wyckoff 1a, 1b and 2d sites. Na occupies octahedrally coordinated 6g and 6i Wyckoff positions, with a partial occupation for both the possible Na-octahedra, which build a honeycomb lattice in the ab-plane and every octahedron shares at least one edge with another octahedron. The honeycomb arrangement leads to favorable ionic transport at least in the lithium counterparts as recently shown for Li3ErCl6 and Li3YCl6.35,39,51General structural changes. To study the influence of Na+ vacancy introduction associated with the Zr4+ substitution, in the crystal structure and ion transport, Zr-substituted Na3ErCl6 samples are prepared with increasing Zr/Er ratio (Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6, x = 0 ‚Äì 1). Initially a step size of 0.2 was used, however the occurring structural changes above x > 0.6 warranted smaller steps in the solid solutions of ‚àÜx = 0.1. Rietveld refinements against X-ray diffraction data were used to assess these structural changes. Figure 2 shows the summary of the collected X-ray diffraction data of all compositions and a representative Rietveld-refinement. The diffraction patterns of Na3ErCl6 and Na2ZrCl6 confirm the monoclinic and trigonal crystal structure of the parent compounds, respectively. Upon incorporation of Zr4+, Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 adopts the monoclinic crystal structure of the Na3ErCl6 endmember. A minor phase fraction of a NaCl impurity is found, which is unlikely to affect the ionic transport properties (see Table S2-S10 SI).52 Low values for the fit residuals indicate a good match of theoretical structure and measured data. The constraints and resulting fit parameters for every Rietveld-refinements can be found in the SI (Table S1). 
Figure 3a shows the refined Zr content in Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 against the nominal content. A linear behavior is observed corroborating the existence of solid solutions. Hereafter, all compositions are shown against the refined content of Zr, xr. Figures 3b-d show the evolution of the lattice parameters upon Zr substitution in Na3ErCl6. All the lattice parameters decrease with increasing x in Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 for x=0-0.6, which is likely caused by the smaller ionic radius of Zr4+ (72 pm) in comparison to Er3+ (89 pm).50 However, the change in the lattice parameters is not linear; for x ‚â• 0.6, a sharper reduction is observed for all the lattice parameters along with an  increase in the unit cell angle. This sharp change in the behavior of the lattice may be related to underlying changes in the polyhedra, which needs to be explored.Polyhedral changes. To obtain further insight into the changing structural features, the M-polyhedra are of interest as they are highly interconnected and are likely directly influencing the resulting diffusion pathways and hence the transport properties.53,54 The connection of the different polyhedra are shown in Figure 4 a-c. Figure 4d shows the polyhedral volume of (Er1-xZrxCl6)(3-x)- as a function of the refined Zr4+ substitution. The absence of a solubility limit as discussed in Figure 3a and the complete incorporation of Zr4+ in the Er3+ site of the Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 series is further supported by the linear dependence of the MCl6 octahedral volume. With increasing amount of the smaller Zr4+ on the Er3+ site, the octahedral volume decreases in a linear fashion. This is in particular interesting as the lattice parameters (vide supra) do not change linearly over the whole series of solid solutions, which warrants an investigation of the Na+ polyhedra.
With increasing Zr+ content, a slight increase of the NaCl65- prismatic and octahedral volume can be seen until a substitution degree of x = 0.6, as shown in Figure 4e and 4f, respectively. Exceeding a Zr4+ content of 60 %, both Na+  polyhedra decrease in volume following the general trend of the decreasing lattice parameters (Figure 3a, b, c). Figure 4g shows the Na occupancies on the two different Na positions. While the Na occupancy on the Wyckoff 4e position does not change significantly (prismatic Na+ polyhedron), the occupancy on the Wyckoff 2b position (Na+ octahedron) steadily decreases. Clearly the octahedral environment can stabilize vacancies, whereas empty sites seem to be unfavorable for the prismatic coordination environment here.
Whereas the linear increase of Zr4+ in the structure alongside with a linear decrease of the (Er1-xZrxCl6)(3-x)- polyhedral volume are expected, the non-linear trends of the lattice parameters and Na+ - polyhedral volumes suggest some interrelated compensation mechanism. 
Here, three possibly mechanisms may be related that influence the NaCl65- polyhedra size: (1) The generally decreasing unit-cell volume should result in a decreasing polyhedra size, nevertheless an increasing polyhedral volume is observed at first. (2) The influence of the Na+ occupancy within the polyhedra cannot be neglected and should surely influence the resulting polyhedral size. However, the occupancy on the prismatic site does not change while the volume decreases ruling this influence out in parts. (3) The low symmetry space-group allows for a slight rearrangement of the halide ions, possibly leading to slight distortions of the polyhedra that may change within the local structure. This distortion can be explored by investigating the local environment of the prisms as shown in Figure 5 (b, c and d), with the corresponding distances and angles shown in the schematic structure in Figure 5a. Figure 5a shows the distortion in the Er-Er-Cl angle along the b-axis as a function of the Zr amount. The Er-Er-Cl angle decreases until a substitution degree of roughly x = 0.7 indicating rotation of the ErCl63- octahedra on the edges of the prism. As the NaCl65- prism shares edges with those ErCl63- octahedra this rotation influences the prism size, seen in Figure 4e. Figure 5d shows the distance of nearest neighboring chloride ions of two adjacent ErCl63- polyhedra that are connected to a common NaCl65- prism as seen in Figure 5a. The decreasing Cl-Cl distances are indicative of the distortion of the prism associated with the observed (Er1-xZrxCl6)(3-x)- volume reduction (see Figure 4d). The impact of the rotation of the ErCl63- octahedra can be further understood based on the trigonal transition areas of the NaCl65- prism. The trigonal transition areas (marked in green and purple in Figure 5a and b), formed by the edge shared chloride ions, increases significantly until a substitution degree of x = 0.6 and thereby likely driving this increasing prism size. 
Regarding all these different prism features, it is clear how strongly the low symmetry space-group allows for a repositioning of the halide ions, resulting in this stark prism distortion that is indicated in Figure 5a. Overall, the changing composition that enforces changing occupancies and polyhedral volumes leads to local distortions of the different polyhedra that persist throughout the series of solid solution until the unit cell becomes too small to allow for the distortion, leading to a transition to the structure of Na2ZrCl6.
Diffusion pathways. In addition to the observed changes in the Na+ polyhedra, a bond-valance-sum analysis was used to shed light on the landscape of the local coordination environment of the sodium ion. Figure 6a shows the obtained isosurface for a selected composition of Na2.8Er0.8Zr0.2Cl6, representing the pathway with a lowest valence mismatch and energy for sodium. Three different tetrahedral interstitial positions are possible which are found to be somewhat energetically stable by the bond-valence sums. Figure 6b represent the associated energy landscape with the corresponding pathways shown in 6c, d and e. As expected by the existence of mostly edge sharing octahedra, the main pathways include these tetrahedral transition sites. 
Three different pathways can be thought of; (1) A direct pathway from the octahedral Na-position to the prismatic (red pathway) (Figure 6b and c) without involving any of these interstitial positions. (2) A less direct transition from an octahedron to a prism or vice versa through two of the interstitial transition sites (i1 and i2, blue pathway, Figure 6b and d) and an octahedra-octahedra transition involving the third interstitial site i3 and the corresponding pathway in yellow (Figure 6b and e).  Although the interstitial sites appear to be energetically stable suggested by the bond valence sum calculations, no occupation of the respective sites could be verified using Rietveld-refinements. Therefore, those interstitial sites are likely too short lived as intermediate states for ionic diffusion and overall activation barriers between 0.4 ‚Äì 0.6 eV can be expected in Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6.
Ionic transport properties. Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy was used to access the influence of the changing structural features on the transport properties. While Meyer et al. evaluated the temperature-dependent behavior of the structure,48 no Na-ion transport properties are known for Na3ErCl6. Figure 7a shows a representative Nyquist plot of one of the collected room temperature impedance datasets (Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 with x = 0.2). The remaining Nyquist plots can be found in the SI (Figure S3). A parallel resistor-constant phase element combination that is in series to a second constant phase element is used as the equivalent circuit (shown as inset of Figure 7a) for fitting the impedance data. The process corresponds to the bulk contribution (46 pF¬∑cm-2) and ion-blocking behavior of the used steel electrodes, respectively. As bulk and grain boundary contributions cannot be reasonably deconvoluted, even at low temperature up to -40 ¬∞C, the here reported conductivities represent total conductivities. The comparison of all obtained Arrhenius plots is shown in Figure 7b and the extracted room- temperature conductivities and activation energies are shown in Figure 7c and 7d respectively. The ionic conductivity of the pristine Na3ErCl6 of 10-6 mS¬∑cm-1 (25 ¬∞C) can be attributed to the absence of vacant Na+ - site in the structure. Upon Zr4+ introduction, the conductivity of Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 increases and reaches a maximum value of 0.035 mS¬∑cm-1 (25 ¬∞C) for Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl6, followed by a strong decrease afterwards that ends up at 3.5¬∑10-7 mS¬∑cm-1 for Na2ZrCl6. 
Together with the increasing conductivity, the activation barriers first decrease significantly. Whereas this seems counter intuitive as the volume of the polyhedral pathways shrinks, it is likely associated with the introduction of vacancies here. Vacancy formation enthalpies play a large role in the activation barriers and introduction of vacancies is often observed to decrease the activation barrier in Na+ conductors such as Na3PS4 and Na3SbS4.4,55 Slight variations to the activation barriers can be found after a substitution degree of x = 0.6. It was not possible to relate these to any structural feature, including Na and Er/Zr polyhedra volumes, transition tetrahedra volumes and transition areas. Possibly a highly complex combination of charge carrier density, diffusion pathway and local distortion is responsible for the observed behavior. 
Nevertheless, these changes are overall minor considering the typical uncertainties for activation barriers.52 
Overall, the introduction of vacancies leads to a tunable ionic conductivity in the series of solid solutions Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6, which in turn provide a promising step towards halide-based sodium-ion conductors.
In this manuscript, we report the discovery of the Na-ion conducting chloride solid electrolyte Na3-xEr1-xZrxCl6 together with a successful optimization of the ionic conductivity by aliovalent substitution. The introduction of the smaller Zr4+-ion leads to reduced lattice parameters along a series of solid solutions, with the only exception of the end member Na2ZrCl6 that crystallizes in a different space group. Interesting non-linear structural changes were observed that can be linked to the polyhedral linkage of prisms and octahedra composing the structure, showing the interplay of structural motifs, polyhedral rotations and polyhedral volumes during a substitution.
By introducing vacancies, the ionic conductivity increases to values of 0.04 mScm-1 for Na2.4Er0.4Zr0.6Cl. While these values seem low when compared to the lithium-counterparts of these halides these novel compositions represent a promising first step in sodium-halide-based sodium-ion conductors. Nevertheless, replacements for the expensive elements and studies on the electrochemical potential window, in conjunction with achieving higher ionic conductivities are clearly needed.
