Na3V2(PO4)2F3  has  been  emerging  as  one  of  the  most  promising  cathodes  for sodium-ion  batteries  due  to  its  stable  NASICON  structure  and  fast  Na+  diffusion. 

However, present methods for preparation of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 suffer from either high energy  consumption  or  generating  poor  rate-performance.  Herein,  a  cost-effective solvothermal-ball-milling  method is  proposed  to  solve the  problem.  In the solvothermal process, the morphology of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 varies from 0D to 3D with pH changing, in which, 3D Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in pH=3 shows the optimal purity due to the fastest growth rate. With Ketjenblack (KB) coating by a short-time ball-milling, the Na3V2(PO4)2F3  can be further nanosized with a highly-graphited  carbon  coating layer. The purest Na3V2(PO4)2F3@KB from pH=3 exhibited an initial capacity of 138 mAh  g-1  @  0.5  C  and  122  mAh  g-1  @  40  C.  Moreover,  ultrahigh  dosage  over  80 mmol V source in one 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave has been achieved for the first 

Sodium-ion  batteries  (SIBs)  have  been  extensively  regarded  as  potential alternatives to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for large-scale energy storage application due to abundant sodium resources, high safety, and low cost.1-6 Considering that the cathode material is the key component that determines the energy density, cost, and electrochemical  performance,  many  research  has  been  focused  on  investigating promising  cathode  materials  with  a  high  specific  capacity,  high  voltage,  rapid  Na+ intercalation/deintercalation,  and  long  cycling  life.  Among  various  cathode materials, phosphate compounds have attracted great attention with a 40% occupation in the field of cathode research in the past few years.8, 9 

In particular, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has been considered as one of the most promising cathodes for SIBs, due to its rapid Na+ intercalation/deintercalation, stable NASICON structure, high theoretical specific capacity of 128 mAh g-1 and high average working voltage of 3.85 V. 9-15

According to the reports,10, 16 the energy consumption of the materials production has even exceeded half of the total energy for producing an electrochemical storage system. For Na3V2(PO4)2F3, the most popular synthetic method is solid-state reaction methods,  including  solid-state  carbothermal  reduction  method  (CTR)  and  sol-gel method. 12, 15, 17-23 In a typical reaction,17 Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, NaF, V2O5 and C were used  as the raw  materials,  and  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  was  obtained through  a high-temperature  (350  oC)  precalcination  and  calcination  (650  oC)  process,  which dramatically increases the energy cost. 

In this work, a method coupling a low temperature solvothermal process with a short time (580 rpm, 1 h) ball-milling procedure with Ketjenblack (KB) was proposed to  solve  above  problems. 

The effects of several important parameters, such as the solvent36, 37 and pH25, 38, 39 were investigated to control the product purity. The purity can reflect the yield as well,  because  the  solubility  of  raw  material  VPO4  is  limited  in  water  and  ethanol. 

Green and economic solvents, including water, ethanol and their mixture (in volume ratio of 1:1) were selected (Figure 1a). The Na3V2(PO4)2F3 phase is observed in all solvents  except  ethanol.  Because  NaF  can  be  dissolved  in  water  while  slightly dissolved in alcohol, a solid-solid reaction occurring in the solvent of alcohol is hard to proceed in such low temperature. But solid-liquid reaction in water and the mixed solvent  can  be  proceeded,  in  which,  NaF  can  be  dissolved  and  react  with  VPO4 sufficiently  to  produce  Na3V2(PO4)2F3.  Meanwhile,  the  pressure  in  Teflon-lined autoclave of the mixed solvent is higher than that of water due to that the boiling point of the mixed solvent is lower than that of water, which can effectively improve the mobility  of  the  raw  materials,  resulting  in  a  faster  nucleation  and  growth  rate  for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 crystal. So Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in the mixed solvent shows higher purity and the mixed solution is selected as an optimized solvent. 

Further, the effect of pH (adjusted by H2C2O4 or NH3·H2O) on the purity of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 samples were also investigated (Figure 1b). In the neutral solvent (pH=7), the final product is composed of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and VPO4. As the pH increases to 10, the purity of the final product becomes poor. Adversely, the purity is improved as the pH value decreases from 7 to 3 and finally VPO4 disappears at pH=3. But when pH decreases to 2, the impurity reappears. The refined XRD pattern (Figure S2) of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 sample in pH=3 further confirmed that the final sample is a pure phase. Meanwhile, the peaks at the binding energies of 515.9 eV and 523.1 eV in XPS spectra (Figure S3) can be ascribed to V3+,37 which also demonstrates that the final product in pH=3 is Na3V2(PO4)2F3 without oxidation. To find out the influence mechanism of pH on the purity, the growth rhythm of the crystals, which plays an important role on the final morphology of the product, is considered. In the neutral solvent, the sample exhibits a 2D nanosheet structure with a thickness of about 100nm. For alkaline environment, the sample is composed of 0D nanoparticles with particle size of 100-200 nm (Figure 2b). For acid environment, a 3D cube structure with a particle size of above 10 μm is observed.
