
Na metal has been used as a counter electrode in a half-cell conﬁguration to test positive and negative electrode materials for Na secondary batteries. However, there are signiﬁcant obstacles including high reactivity, which generates a resistive passivation layer along with electrolyte decomposition, dendrite formation that results in poor cyclability, dead Na metal accumulation, which impedes Na+ transport, C. Herein, an alternative counter electrode is and a low melting point, which limits its use to below 98 devised using NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 to measure the accurate electrochemical behaviour of working electrode materials and to use for measurements above the melting point of Na metal. The novel counter electrode is prepared by mixing Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3, and the latter is prepared by the desodiation of Na3V2(PO4)3 using Cl2 gas. The resulting Na3V2(PO4)3–NaV2(PO4)3 electrode exhibits a ﬂat plateau at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na and lower polarization than the Na metal. The electrochemical behaviours of the Na2FeP2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3, and NaCrO2 electrodes tested with the new counter electrode match the known curves recorded with the Na metal at low current densities and show better cyclability and rate performance. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of these electrode materials are veriﬁed at a temperature above the melting point of Na metal for the ﬁrst time.

With the expansion of the applications of secondary batteries, the research in this eld is rapidly progressing. Owing to the low cost and high abundance of Na resources, Na secondary batteries are a viable alternative to current lithium secondary batteries for large-scale energy storage systems such as in a power grid.1–12 Herein, positive and negative electrode materials and electrolytes for Na secondary batteries have been extensively investigated to obtain better performance in terms of high energy and power densities, long cyclability, and high safety.1–14

Furthermore, a Na metal electrode inevitably forms Na dendrites during the deposition/ dissolution process that accompanies continuous consumption of the electrolyte and a severe volumetric change, which degrades the electrochemical performance during cycles including the instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer.15–23

Recently, several studies reported the unreliability of a Na metal counter electrode in organic carbonate-based electrolytes.15–20,23,24 Cycle tests were conducted to verify the use of the Na metal counter electrode with several carbonate organic 3 Na[PF6]-EC/DEC, Na[PF6]-EC/ electrolytes including 1 mol dm DMC, Na[ClO4]-EC/PC, Na[ClO4]-EC/EMC, and Na[ClO4] PC (DEC ¼ dimethyl carbonate, DMC ¼ dimethyl carbonate, and PC ¼ propylene carbonate) each using electrode materials of hard carbon, Na3V2(PO4)3, and Li4Ti5O12 in a half-cell conguration.16–19 They pointed out that the Na metal counter electrode is a factor in the capacity fading in half-cell tests for organic carbonate-based electrolytes.16–19 With respect to research on lithium secondary batteries, Li4Ti5O12 and LixSn were reported as alternative reference and counter electrode materials to obtain more accurate electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge–discharge test instead of Li metal electrodes.

Furthermore, there are also apparent needs for a novel counter electrode which can be used at elevated temperatures above the melting point of Na metal (98 C). Studies using ionic liquid electrolytes suggest that intermediate-temperature operation dramatically improves the rate and cycling performance.12,28–32 However, the Na metal counter electrode can be used only below its melting point in a half-cell conguration, even if electrode materials and electrolytes can be used at high temperatures.13,28,33–39 NASICON-type (NASICON ¼ Na super ionic conductor) Na3V2(PO4)3 is a well-studied polyanionic positive electrode material for Na secondary batteries.31,32,40–46 This material has an open framework with facile Na ion diﬀusion paths and high thermal and electrochemical stabilities. Previous studies have revealed that the sodiation–desodiation mechanism between Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 follows the V3+/V4+ redox reaction 1 based on the twowith a theoretical capacity of 117 mA h g electron reaction for two V atoms,31,32,42–47 providing a at plateau at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na. A prior study used this redox couple as a counter electrode for Na–O2 batteries,22 where Na3V2(PO4)3 was electrochemically charged with Na metal and disassembled and assembled again with a carbon-based O2 cathode for Na–O2 cell measurements.22

Herein, a new counter electrode of N3N1VP in the state of Na3V2(PO4)3–Na1V2(PO4)3 two-phase plateau region is proposed for Na secondary batteries. Fig. 1 schematically shows the concept of the new counter electrode. The electrochemical desodiation procedure of Na3V2(PO4)3 is possible for this purpose, but it is considerably cumbersome for regular experiments, considering the assembly and disassembly of coin cells, and washing and drying of the electrode if necessary. This bottleneck of the concept has been solved by chemical desodiation of Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV2(PO4)3 using Cl2 gas in this study, involving the sizeable and convenient production of uniform NaV2(PO4)3. We expected that the counter electrode could have a state of charge (SOC) ¼ 50% with an initial potential of 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na by simply mixing Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and the electrode in the at plateau region is able to be used as a counter electrode in the half-cell conguration. The electrochemical behaviour is demonstrated using well-studied electrode materials, Na2FeP2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3, and NaCrO2, with two diﬀerent types of elec3 Na[PF6]-EC/DMC (1 : 1 vol/vol) organic trolytes, 1 mol dm solvent electrolyte (hereaer abbreviated as OE) and 40 mol% Na[FSA]-[C2C1im][FSA] (C2C1im ¼ 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium, FSA ¼ bis(uorosulfonyl)amide) ionic liquid electrolyte (hereaer abbreviated as IL).48

All air-sensitive materials were handled under a dry Ar atmosphere in a dry box (H2O < 1 ppm; O2 < 1 ppm). Oxalic acid Industries, purity: 99.5– dihydrate (Wako Pure Chemical 100.2%), V2O5 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemistry, purity: 99.6%), NaOH (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, purity: 97.0%), NH4H2PO4 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, 99.0% purity), and glucose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) were used to prepare the precursors of Na3V2(PO4)3. The powdery carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 was synthesized via a sol–gel method as previously reported.31 A Na metal piece (Sigma-Aldrich Chemistry, 99.95% purity) was obtained aer cutting a Na metal chunk into pieces. The FSA salts, Na[FSA] (Mitsubishi Materials Electronic Chemicals, purity >99%) and [C2C1im][FSA] (Kanto Chemical, purity >99.9%; water content < 30 ppm) were dried under 3 vacuum for 24 h at 80 Na[PF6]-EC/DMC (1 : 1 vol/vol; Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd.), was used as supplied. Na2FeP2O7 and NaCrO2 samples were prepared in the same manner as previously reported.49,50 Details of analytical methods are summarized in the ESI.

Synthesis of NaV2(PO4)3 The powdery NaV2(PO4)3 was prepared by the chemical desodiation of Na3V2(PO4)3 using Cl2 gas (the reaction line is shown in Fig. 2a). Into an air-tight glass ask (600 dm3) with a metal lid equipped with a metal valve, 6.00 g of Na3V2(PO4)3 (11.71 mmol, carbon content: 10.5%), 5.33 g of AlCl3 (40.00 mmol), and 50 mL of acetonitrile were added under a dry Ar atmosphere. The glass ask was connected to the reaction line, and the Ar gas that was inside was removed at 196 C. Aer warming up to room temperature, 1 atm of Cl2 gas (40 mmol) was slowly introduced from a storage cylinder into the glass ask. The reaction mixture was agitated for 24 h, and excess Cl2 was pumped out. 3.75 g of the nal product (8.05 mmol, carbon content: 11.8%) was obtained by repeated washing with acetonitrile and centrifugation (twice). The product was identied as NaV2(PO4)3 by XRD and EDS analysis (Fig. 3).

Results and discussion Chemical desodiation using Cl2 gas and material characterization A at plateau at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na is observed in the SOC range between 15% and 85%, with the capacity range of approximately 1.5 equivalents of Na that is reversibly (de)sodiated in the Na3V2(PO4)3/NaV2(PO4)3 electrode based on the V4+/V3 redox couple.40 A schematic of the preparation process of NaV2(PO4)3 is depicted in Fig. 2b. Na3V2(PO4)3 prepared by a sol–gel method31 is suspended and desodiated in acetonitrile with Cl2 gas in the presence of AlCl3, based on eqn (1):

In this reaction, Cl2 acts as an oxidizing agent (4.07 V vs. Na+/ Na or 1.36 V vs. SHE, based on the potential in the aqueous systems),54 and AlCl3 acts as a Lewis acid to dissolve NaCl formed on the surface of Na3V2(PO4)3. The reaction does not proceed to completion without AlCl3 because of the low solubility of NaCl in acetonitrile. The obtained NaV2(PO4)3 is insoluble in acetonitrile and simply isolated by centrifugation or ltration. A previous report by Gopalakrishnan and Rangan stated that the bubbling of Cl2 gas into Na3V2(PO4)3 in CHCl3 could fully deintercalate Na from Na3V2(PO4)3 and provide V2(PO4)3.55 The present method is milder than that reported by Gopalakrishnan and Rangan, and selectively produces NaV2(PO4)3 without further oxidation.

Electrochemical behaviour of Na3V2(PO4)3, NaV2(PO4)3, and N3N1VP The electrochemical behaviour of Na3V2(PO4)3, NaV2(PO4)3, and N3N1VP was separately determined with the Na metal counter electrode in a half-cell conguration to conrm their basic electrochemical performance. The N3N1VP counter electrode for coin cell tests was obtained by pasting the slurry of an equimolar mixture of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 by using a mortar and pestle on Al foil, followed by drying and punching into a disc shape (Fig. 1a). The mixing ratio of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 could be adjusted depending on the SOC of the working electrode materials. Herein, the 1 : 1 molar ratio was used for versatile applications because it could respond to both the desodiation-starting working electrodes.

N3N1VP has a resting potential of 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na and exhibits 1 initial charge and discharge capacities of 73 and 112 mA h g (Fig. 4c), respectively. This result demonstrates that the amount of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 can adjust the apparent SOC of this electrode material from the initial state and both acting as active materials are involved during the initial charge and discharge processes, providing the plateau region which can be used as a standard potential of the counter electrode as depicted in Fig. 1b. Furthermore, the Cl2 desodiation method preserves the morphology of the primary materials as stated above (Fig. 3c and i) and the rate performance with OE and IL at C (Fig. S3–S8, ESI†, show the results of rate capability 25 and 90 tests of the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3, Na/NaV2(PO4)3, and Na/N3N1VP cells, and the N3N1VP/N3N1VP symmetric cell with OE at 25 C and IL at 25 and 90

To determine the electrochemical stability of the N3N1VP counter electrode, extended cycle tests accompanied by EIS measurements were performed using the Na/OE/Na and N3N1VP/OE/N3N1VP symmetric cells at 25 C. Cathodic and anodic polarizations for the Na/OE/Na and N3N1VP/OE/N3N1VP 2, where the symmetric cells were performed at 0.1 mA cm polarization direction was altered every 12 min (24 min for 1 cycle) (Fig. 4d). EIS was carried out in the initial state and aer 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 cycles (Fig. 4e and f). During the tests, the desertion–insertion process occurred in the N3N1VP/OE/ N3N1VP cell, whereas the Na metal stripping–plating process occurred in the Na/OE/Na cell. The resulting polarization proles revealed that the two symmetric cells showed signicantly diﬀerent electrochemical behaviour. The N3N1VP/OE/ N3N1VP cell exhibited very stable cycle performance; the overpotential in the 1st cycle was 18 mV and did not substantially increase until the end of the measurement, providing an overpotential of 19 mV in the 200th cycle. Contrarily, the overpotential of the Na/Na cell continuously increased from 23 mV in the 1st cycle to the end of the test (rather signicantly up to 60 h (150 cycles)) and reached 130 mV in the 200th cycle (Fig. 4d). This trend was conrmed by EIS measurements. The Nyquist plots for the N3N1VP/N3N1VP cell were stable and roughly overlapped in all cycles (Fig. 4f). In contrast, the semicircle observed in the Na/Na cell kept increasing and reached a width that was ve times larger than that at the beginning of the measurement (Fig. 4e). The increase in resistance corresponding to the semicircle can result from two factors. One is the dead-Na accumulation, which originates from Na dendrite formation because dead Na metal physically hinders ion transport.56 The second reason is an increase in the passivation layer on Na metal, resulting from the reaction of Na metal with the electrolyte.23,24 This factor was conrmed by the time the Na/Na and N3N1VP/N3N1VP dependence of EIS for symmetric cells using OE at 25 C (Fig. S9, ESI†). The symmetric N3N1VP/N3N1VP cell showed stable EIS results over 72 h regardless of the electrolyte and operating temperature, whereas the semicircle for the Na/Na symmetric cells continuously increased with time in the Na/Na symmetric cell, which agrees with the previous result by Dugas et al.;20 they  3 Na[PF6]-EC/ reported that Na metal reacted with a 1 mol dm

DMC electrolyte and formed a passivation layer, which resulted in an increase in resistance with time.20

The actual electrochemical measurements were carried out in a coin cell using the N3N1VP counter electrode. Three wellstudied positive electrode materials, Na2FeP2O7 (space group, P1),51 Na3V2(PO4)3 (space group, R3c),52 and O3-type NaCrO2 (space group R3m),53 were selected as working electrodes. Fig. 5 shows the setup of the coin cell, charge–discharge curves, and rate capability of the Na/Na2FeP2O7 and N3N1VP/Na2FeP2O7 cells with OE and IL at various operating temperatures (Fig. S11–S15† show the related data for the Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaCrO2 electrodes, respectively, ESI†).

Several thermally stable ionic liquids and electrode materials have been reported for shuttle-type Na secondary battery applications, but the measurement is restricted to temperatures below 90 C because of the melting point of Na metal (98 C).13 As shown in Fig. 5c, a comparison of the charge– discharge curves of the N3N1VP/IL/Na2FeP2O7 cell at 90–110 C conrms their nearly identical electrochemical behaviour,

All curves essentially overlap each other during 100 cycles (Fig. 6d). The diﬀerence in cycle performance, depending on the behaviour of the counter electrodes, is more clearly shown in the plots of discharge capacity against the cycle number (Fig. 6b and e). The capacity retention in the 100th cycle is 87% for the Na/OE/Na2FeP2O7 cell and 102% for the N3N1VP/ OE/Na2FeP2O7 cell aer 100 cycles. The EIS results in Fig. 6c and f conrm that the interfacial resistance continuously increases for the Na/OE/Na2FeP2O7 cell as the cycling proceeds but does not change until the end for the N3N1VP/OE/Na2FeP2O7 cell. These results imply that the Na metal counter electrode degrades earlier than the working electrode materials and electrolytes in the half-cell conguration, suggesting that particular attention is required to interpret the performance of new materials and electrolytes. Further cycle tests and EIS measurements were performed to validate the data using the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode with the Na metal and N3N1VP counter electrodes, which also conrmed the superiority of the N3N1VP counter electrode to the Na metal counter electrode (Fig. S16, ESI†).

Additionally, charge–discharge and rate capability tests of negative electrode materials of hard carbon and Na3V2(PO4)3 (V3+/V2+) are carried out using the N3N1VP counter electrode (Fig. S17, ESI†). As reported with the positive electrode, the N3N1VP and negative electrodes showed stable charge– discharge proles and rate performance, suggesting the stable

Successful preparation of a new type of counter electrode was achieved through the synthesis of NaV2(PO4)3 via the chemical desodiation of NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 using Cl2 gas. The desodiation process using Cl2 gas preserved the morphology and electrochemical performance of the initial Na3V2(PO4)3. The N3N1VP electrode, which was prepared by simply mixing Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3, exhibited stable electrochemical behavior in both IL and OE electrolytes with a at plateau at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na, indicating its high feasibility as a counter electrode in half-cell tests for sodium secondary batteries. This counter electrode provided various advantages such as facile measurements, including those at temperatures above the melting point of Na metal, high electrochemical stability during long cycles, low polarization, and absence of dendrite formation in comparison with Na metal counter electrodes. These advantages were demonstrated through half-cell tests using the Na2FeP2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaCrO2 working electrodes. The half-cells with the N3N1VP counter electrode exhibited stable cycles over a long period with low polarization compared to the cases with the Na metal counter electrode. Moreover, the electrochemical characteristics of the positive electrode materials at temperatures above the melting point of Na metal were conrmed using the N3N1VP counter electrode. The ratio of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 could be optimized depending on the target working electrode, although it was xed as a representative value of 1 : 1 in this study. This new N3N1VP counter electrode is an attractive means of circumventing the limitation of current Na metal counter electrodes and can be used to evaluate the true performance of positive and negative electrode materials and electrolytes for sodium secondary batteries. This concept can be possibly extended to other battery systems that suﬀer from a lack of suitable and facile reference or counter electrodes. Oxidation of electrode materials with Cl2 gas is also applicable to a variety of electrode materials, even for lithium systems. Further academic and industrial development of this methodology is expected in the future.
