Two alkali–metal germanium phosphates, namely, NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13, have been synthesized by the solid-state reactions and their structures determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure of NaGe2P3O12 features a Nasicon-type structure, crystallizing in space group R?3 with a = 8.109(2), c = 21.536(8) (Å), V = 1226.3(6) Å3, Z = 6 , R1 = 0.0383 and xR = 0.0960; Cs2GeP4O13 crystallizes in triclinic space group P?1 with a = 9.420(3), b = 10.209(4), c = 12.407(4) (Å), a = 104.136(6), b = 108.132(5), c = 95.338(6)?, V = 1081.0(7) Å3, Z = 2 , R1 = 0.0445 and xR = 0.1117. Additionally, the calculations of band structure and density of states were performed with the density functional theory method for the title compounds. The results show that the solid-state compounds of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 are insulator with indirect band-gap of 3.529 and 3.888 eV, respectively.

Over the course of the past years, inorganic metal phosphates have been extensively investigated due to their structural diversity and subsequently intriguing magnetism, electricity, optics, thermal expansion properties, as well as a wide variety of applications in industry, military and medical treatment [1]. The common basic structural unit of these materials is the PO4 group, and the varied condensations of PO4 groups result in several structural families and the chemical and thermal stability ensures their utility in industrial applications. Introduction germanium to metal phosphate compounds may result in multitude structure types, for Ge atoms may adopt GeO6 octahedral or GeO4 tetrahedral geometry, which sometimes form mixed occupancy MO4(M = Ge or P) group, such as Cd5(PO4)2(GeO4), Li3.05(Ge0.31P0.69O4), Li3.17(P0.69Ge0.24 Mo0.07)O4 [2]. In addition, germanium phosphate include KGe2P3O12 [3], G e5O (PO4)6 [4], P r3(GeO4)(PO4)O [5], KGeOPO4 [6], LiGe2(PO4)3 [7], Na(GeTi)(PO4)3 [8], Ge(P2O7) [9], G e3 P6Si2O25 [10], etc. Although NaGe2P3O12 have been reported previously [11], however, neither single-crystal data nor further theoretical studies was available. In this work, we will present synthesis, crystal structure determinations for two alkali–metal germanium phosphates: NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13. At the same time, we will make the calculations of crystal energy band structures to understand the chemical bonding properties and electronic origin of optical transition for the solid compounds.

All reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern (Cu Ka) was collected on a XPERTMPD h–2h diffractometer. Optical diffuse reflectance spectrum was measured with a PE Lambda 900 UV–vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 190–800 nm at room temperature. The instrument was equipped with an integrating sphere and controlled by a personal computer. A BaSO4 plate was used as a standard (100% reflectance). The absorption spectra were determined by the diffuse-reflectance technique. F(R) and R are linked by F(R) = ( 1 ? R)2/2R, where R is the reflectance and F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk remission function. The minima in the second-derivative curves of the Kubelka–Munk function are taken as the position of the absorption bands.

Single crystal of NaGe2P3O12 was initially obtained by the high temperature solid-state reaction of Na2CO3, GeO2 and NH4H2PO4, with the molar ratio of 5:1:7 (Na:Gd:Mo). The reaction mixture was thoroughly ground in an agate mortar and pressed into a pellet to ensure the best homogeneity and reactivity, which was put into a platinum crucible. The crucible was transferred into an oven and heated at 900 ?C in the air for 2 days. In this stage, the mixture was completely melted. Afterwards, it was allowed to cool at a rate of 0.05 ?C/min to 400 ?C before switching off the furnace. After boiled in water, prism-shaped colorless crystals were purified in very low yield (<5%). Single crystal of Cs2GeP4O13 was prepared by solid-state reaction of analytical reagent starting materials in the molar ratio of Cs/Ge/P = 5/1/7. The mixture was thoroughly ground in an agate mortar and pressed into a pellet. After heated at 800 ?C in the air for 2 days, the mixture was allowed to cool at a rate of 0.05 ?C/ min to 400 ?C before switching off the furnace. Prism-shaped colorless crystals of Cs2GeP4O13 were obtained after boiled in water. After crystal structure determination, polycrystalline samples of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 were synthesized by solid-state reactions of stoichiometric amount of analytical reagents. The powdered mixtures were ground in an agate mortar, and then calcined for 5 days at 800 and 650 ?C for NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13, respectively, during with several intermediate grindings to eusure solid-state reactions completely. On the basis of powder XRD diffraction studies, they have been successfully obtained as single phases (Supporting information).

Single crystals of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 with dimensions of 0.18 ? 0.09 ? 0.08 and 0.29 ? 0.12 ? 0.04 mm were selected for single-crystal X-ray diffraction determination. Data collections for them were performed on a Rigaku Saturn70CCD diffractometer with graphite-monochromated Mo Ka (k = 0.71073 Å) radiation using the x/2h scan mode at the temperature of 294 K. The data were corrected for lorentz factor, polarization, air absorption and absorption due to variations in the path length through the detector faceplate. All of the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F2 by SHELX97 programme [12]. The structure of NaGe2P3O12 is twinned; the twin matrix used in the refinement is TWIN [?1?1001000?1] in the name.ins file. The positions of the Ge and Cs atoms were refined by the application of the direct method of the two compounds, and the remaining atoms were located in succeeding difference Fourier synthesis. None of atoms is disordered and each atomic site is fully occupied according to site occupancy refinements. All of the atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. The final refined solutions obtained were checked with the ADDSYM algorithm in the program PLATON [13]; no higher symmetry was found for them. Crystallographic data and structural refinements for all of the compounds are summarized in Table 1. The atomic coordinates and thermal parameters are listed in Table 2. Important bond distances and angles are listed in Table 3.

The crystallographic data of the solid-state compounds NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction were used to calculate their energy band structures; no further geometry optimizations were performed in theoretical studies. The calculations use the total-energy code CASTEP [14], which employs pseudopotentials to describe electron-ion interactions and represents electronic wave functions using a plane-wave basis set. The total energy and properties were calculated within the framework of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [15]. In addition, the norm-conserving pseudopotentials [16] were employed for Na, Cs, Ge, P and O, respectively. The total energy and the force convergence thresholds were 2?10?6 eV/atom and 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The k-point set meshs to define the number of integration points that will be used to integrate the wave function in reciprocal space were 4 ? 4 ? 4(NaGe2P3O12) and 4 ? 3 ? 1(Cs2GeP4O13) for calculating bond structure, density of state and optical properties. The rest parameters used in the calculations were set by the default values of the CASTEP code. Pseudoatomic calculations were performed for Na2s22p63s1, Cs-5s25p66s1, Ge-4s24p2, P-3s23p3 and O-2s22p4. In addition, the calculations of linear optical properties were also made in this work, which were comparable to the experimental date.

Solid-state reactions of NH4H2PO4, GeO2 and Na2CO3 or Cs2CO3 afforded two alkali–metal germanium phosphate compounds, viz, NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13. The syntheses can be expressed by the following reactions at 900 or 800 ?C: 6NH4H2PO4þ4GeO2þNa2CO3!2NaGe2P3O12þ6NH3þCO2þ9H2O 4NH4H2PO4þGeO2þCs2CO3!Cs2GeP4O13þ4NH3þCO2þ6H2O ðaÞ The single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses show that compound NaGe2P3O12 is isostructural to KGe2P3O12 [3] and NaSn2P3O12 [17]. It crystallizes in rhombohedral, space group R?3 with a = 8.109(2), c = 21.536(8) (Å), V = 1226.3(6) (Å3), Z = 6,, the final R1 = 0.0383 and xR = 0.0960 for 2792 observed reflections (I > 2r(I)); Cs2GeP4O13 is isostructural to Cs2TiP4O13 [18] and crystallizes in triclinic space group P?1 with a = 9.420(3), b = 10.209(4), c = 12.407(4) (Å), a = 104.136(6), b = 108.132(5), c = 95.338(6)?, V = 1081.0(7) (Å3), Z = 2, the final R1 = 0.0445 and xR = 0.1117 for 3251 observed reflections (I > 2r(I)). NaGe2(PO4)3 is a three-dimensional (3D) sodium germanium phosphate whose crystalline habit shows the typical NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) or NZP (NaZr2(PO4)3) structure type by comparing it to compounds with general formal AxM2(XO4)3. As shown in the structural units of NaGe2P3O12 are corner-sharing of GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, forming a 3D [Ge2(PO4)3]? anionic framework delimiting large cavities in which Na+ ions locate. There is one phosphor, two germanium and two sodium atoms in the asymmetric unit of NaGe2P3O12. The P atoms are tetrahedral coordinated by four oxygen atoms with P?O bond distances ranging from 1.5177(18) to 1.531(2) Å, and O?P?O bond angles dispersing from 104.87(11) to 113.57(11)? (Table 2). Ge atoms are coordinated by six oxygen atoms, forming nearly ideal GeO6 tetrahedra. The Ge?O bonds have two groups of different distances, that is, 1.8500(19) and 1.8796(19) Å for Ge1?O, 1.840(2) and 1.8699(17) Å for Ge2?O. Sodium atoms are 6-coordinated by six oxygens with equal Na–O bond distances, viz., 2.3929(18) and 2.5159(18) Å for Na1?O and Na2?O, respectively. It should be noted that there are some weak Na–O contacts of over 3.20 Å, which can be considered as secondary coordination bonds to complete the extended coordination spheres of Na+ cations (coordination number up to 12 and 11 for Na1 and Na2, respectively). GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are interconnected via corner-sharing O atoms to form the 3D anionic framework of [Ge2(PO4)3]?. Na+ cations locates between two GeO6 octahedra along the c-axis forming ribbons Ge?Ge?Na?Ge?Ge?Na? as shown in Fig. 2, i n this way to compensate the negative charges of the anionic network into the 3D structure of compound NaGe2P3O12. Cs2GeP4O13 is isostructural to Cs2TiP4O13 with a layer built structure along the c-axis. (Fig. 3) All four phosphor(IV) atoms in the asymmetric unit are coordinated by four oxygen atoms in a dis torted PO4 tetrahedral geometry. Four PO4 tetrahedra are interconnected via corner-sharing into a [P4O13]6? anionic group, as shown in Fig. 4. The P?O distances fall in the range of 1.465(3)–1.632(3) Å, and O?P?O bond angles of 101.90(17)–114.61(19)?, as listed in Table 3. Thereinto, it is worth noting that P–O bonds in the P–O–P bridge are significantly longer than the rest. The [P4O13]6? groups are isolated from each other and they are further linked with Ge4+ cations by sharing O atoms, leading to a 2D [GeP4O13]? layer in the ab-plane (Fig. 5). Ge4+ cations are six coordinated in a octahedral geometry with Ge?O distances ranging from 1.860(3) to 1.886(3) Å (Table 3). Alternatively, each GeO6 octahedron connects to six PO4 tetrahedra via corner-sharing O atoms in such a way to form the 2D [GeP4O13]? layer along the c-axis. [GeP4O13]? anion framework delimit large caves in which Cs+ cations reside in to compensate the negative charges, leading to a 2D Cs+ layer along the c-axis. The Cs+ layers reside among these [GeP4O13]? layers along the c-axis and join them through coulombic action of Cs+ cations and O2? anions to form the 3D framework of Cs2GeP4O13, a s shown in Fig. 6.

The calculated band structures of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 along high-symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone are plotted in Fig. 7. It is observed that the top of the valence bands (VBs) is nearly flat and close to the Fermi level (0.0 eV), and the bottom of the conduction bands (CBs) exhibits obvious dispersion for both compounds. The state energies (eV) of the lowest conduction band (L-CB) and the highest valence band (H-VB) at some k-points of both the compounds are listed in Table 4. For NaGe2P3O12, the lowest energy of the CBs at the G point is 3.529 eV, whereas the highest energy (0 eV) of VBs is located at the F point. Therefore, NaGe2P3O12 displays an indirect band-gap of 3.529 eV. For Cs2GeP4O13, the lowest energy at the CBs (3.888 eV) is located at the G point, whereas the highest energy (0 eV) of VBs is located at the F point; hence, Cs2GeP4O13 has an indirect band-gap of 3.888 eV, which is a little larger than that of NaGe2P3O12. The bands can be assigned according to the total and partial densities of states (DOS) as plotted in Fig. 8. For NaGe2P3O12, the regions below the Fermi level contain 104 bands and can be divided into four regions. The bottom-most VB region with energy located at around ?48.2 eV is composed of Na-2s states. The bands ranging from -22.0 to ?16.6 eV mostly originates from mixed states of Na-2p, Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2s. The third region ranging from ?11.0 eV to ?4.5 eV arises mainly from mixed states of Ge4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2p. The highest VB region just below the Fermi level is dominated by the O-2p states. The CBs just above the Fermi level are due to the complicated mixed states of Na-2s2p3s, Cs5s5p6s, Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2s2p. For Cs2GeP4O13, the lowest VB region with energy located ranging from ?21.7 to ?16.5 eV arises mainly from Cs-5s, Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2s states. The Cs-5p, Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p states and O-2p states dominate the VBs from ?11.0 to ?3.0 eV. The bands ranging from ?3.0 eV to Fermi level is dominated by the O-2p states. The CBs above the Fermi level are due to the complicated mixed states of Cs-5s5p6s, Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2s2p ranging from 4.0 to 15.0 eV. In addition, we calculated the atomic site and angular momentum projected DOS of the two compounds to elucidate the nature of the electronic band structures and chemical bonds. As shown in Fig. 8, it can be observed that the densities of Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2s states exist simultaneously from ?21.0 to ?16.0 eV,whereas the densities of Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and O-2p states exist simultaneously from ?11.0 to ?6.0 eV, which indicate the covalent interactions between Ge, P and O atoms. Semiempirical population analyses allow for more quantitative bond analysis. For NaGe2P3O12, the calculated bond orders of Na?O, Ge?O and P?O bonds are 0.01e, 0.38–0.39e and 0.65?0.68e (covalent single-bond order is generally 1.0e), while the calculated bond orders of Cs?O, Ge?O and P?O bonds are ?0.14?0.13e, 0.36?0.41e and 0.40?0.91e for Cs2GeP4O13. Accordingly, we can also say that the covalent character of the P?O bond is larger than that of the Ge–O bond, and the ionic character of the Na?O o r C s?O bond is larger than that of the Ge?O bond.

The Optical diffuse reflectance absorption spectrum of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 were measured (Fig. 9) ranging from 190 to 800 nm. The absorption edge is around 360 nm(3.45 eV) and 305 nm(4.074 eV), which is comparable to the calculated bond gap of 3.529 and 3.888 eV, respectively, for NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13. The calculated absorption spectra of them ranging from 0 to 1500 nm are shown in Fig. 10, which are comparable to experimental spectrum in the range of 190–800 nm; hence, our calculated value is reasonable. On the other hand, it is observed that the strong absorption peak is at about 95 nm (13.0 eV) and there is no absorption above 350 nm for both compounds. According to the above DOS analysis, the strong absorption is mainly attributed to the charge transfers from O-2p to Ge-4s4p, P-3s3p and Na2s2p3s (for NaGe2P3O12) or Cs-5s5p6s(for Cs2GeP4O13) states.

In the present work, the single-crystal structure of the compounds NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 synthesized by high temperature solid-state reactions have been determined. NaGe2P3O12 crystallized in the trigonal crystal system with space group R?3 (NASICON-type structure), while Cs2GeP4O13 crystallizes in triclinic system with space group P?1. The calculations of band structure, density of states and optical absorption spectra were performed with the density functional theory method for title compounds. The studies of electronic structure showed that the solid-state compounds of NaGe2P3O12 and Cs2GeP4O13 are insulator with indirect band-gap of 3.529 and 3.888 eV, respectively.
