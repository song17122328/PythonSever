In this study, LATP (Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3) solid electrolyte is prepared by a sol-gel process using Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4 as Ti sources to examine the influence of the Ti source on the electrochemical properties of produced LATP. LATP is successfully produced in all cases, however, AlPO4 impurity is formed in the Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4 samples due to insufficient formation of Ti-O-Al network. In contrast, the AlPO4 formation is not observed in the Ti(C2H5O)4 sample. Also, the Ti(C2H5O)4 sample shows the highest sinterability and the largest grain size among the three samples. As a result, the Ti(C2H5O)4 sample shows the highest Li ion conductivity due to high grain boundary conductivity and less impurity phase. The selection of Ti source is a key to obtain high conductive LATP solid electrolyte.
The current commercial Li-ion batteries use highly ionic conductive organic electrolytes, which have brought a lot of conveniences in cell fabrication and at the same time, also cause serious safety issues, such as electrolyte leakage and fire hazard due to use of flammable organic solvents [1,2]. All- solid-state battery with nonflammable ceramic electrolytes is expected to solve the safety issues [3–5]. Therefore, many kinds of solid electrolytes such as garnet- [6–8], perovskite- [9–11] and NASICON (Na super ion conductor)-type [12,13] have been intensively researched and developed due to reasonably high Li-ion conductivity. Among them, LATP (Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3) with Na super ion conductor (NASICON) structure is of great interest due to its high Li-ion conductivity. Its Li-ion conductivity has been reported as ~10−3 S cm−1 [14], which is very close to that of the organic electrolyte currently used in the rechargeable Li-ion battery. Therefore, LATP has received much attention for its all-solid-state bat-tery applications [4].
The LATP has been prepared using melt- quenching and solid state methods [15,16]. However, these methods require high-temperature processing at over 1200°C. To conserve energy, a low-temperature preparation process has been strongly required.
The sol-gel method allows us to prepare inor-ganic materials at low temperatures [17]. The sol- gel method has been applied for a preparation of not only solid electrolytes [18,19], but also all-solid- state batteries [20–24]. We have studied a preparation of LATP solid electrolyte by the sol- gel method using water-soluble Al(NO3)3 and water- insoluble Al(C3H7O)4 as Al sources [25]. A small amount of impurity (AlPO4) was formed when water-soluble Al(NO3)3 was used as a Al source. Contrarily, the impurity formation was not observed in water-insoluble Al(C3H7O)4 sample. This is because of insufficient mixing of water-insoluble Ti(C3H7O)4 with the water-soluble Al source. The impurity phase would act as a resistance layer, resulting in decrement of Li-ion conductivity. The Li- ion conductivity was higher in the Al(C3H7O)4 sample. The Al source strongly influenced Li-ion conductivity of produced LATP. However, such study using other starting materials has yet to be reported. In this study, effect of Ti source on the properties of LATP solid electrolytes prepared by the sol-gel method was studied. Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3 H7O)4, and Ti(n-C4H9O)4) were used as the Ti sources for LATP preparation and obtained LATP pellets were characterized.
The LATP solid electrolyte was prepared by the sol- gel method [25]. A precursor sol for LATP was prepared by mixing CH3COOLi, Al(C3H7O)3, Ti(n-C3 H7O)4, H3PO4, isopropanol, CH3COOH, and H2O in a molar ratio of 4.3:1:5.7:10:100:50:700. In other batches, Ti(C2H5O)4 or Ti(n-C4H9O)4 was used instead of Ti(n-C3H7O)4 to investigate the influence of Ti source on the final product. All reagents were purchased from Wako Chemical Co. Ltd, Japan, and used without further purification. The samples pre-pared from Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9 O)4 are denoted as C2, C3 and C4, respectively. The precursor sol was dried at 100°C for gelation, and the obtained gel was heated at 450°C for 4 h in air. The powder was milled by a planetary ball mill (Pulver Risette 7, Fritsch) at 400 rpm for 1 h and then pressed into pellet form with 20 mm diameter. The pellet was sintered at 1000°C for 6 h. Obtained pellets were polished to 1 mm in thickness.The crystalline phases of the heated powder and sintered pellet were identified with X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima-IV) using Cu-Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6300LA) was used to observe the morphology of the powder and the pellet cross-section. The density of the pellets was measured by Micrometrics, AccuPyc II 1340.
The Li-ion conductivity was measured by the AC impedance method. Prior to measurement, Au was sputtered onto both sides of the pellet to ensure elec-trical contact. The thickness and diameter of the Au blocking electrodes were 30 nm and 0.5 cm, respec-tively. The AC impedance data were collected at ±10 mV of voltage signal in a frequency range of 400Hz ~ 1 MHz using a chemical impedance meter (HIOKI Chemical Impedance Meter 3532–80). The mea-surement was performed at 30 ~ 200°C to clarify the temperature dependency of Li-ion conductivity. The C2 sample was heated in an electric oven with a heating rate of 10°C/min to target temperatures and kept for 30 min at the target temperature before the measurement.
Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of powder prepared by the sol-gel method after heating the gels at 450°C for 4 h. Small peaks of LATP, Li3PO4 and Li4P2O7 could be observed. No clear diffraction peak was observed in all patterns, indicating that the powder after heating at 450°C was primarily amorphous, but C2 and C4 sam-ples revealed a little sharper and stronger diffraction peaks than those of C3 sample. SEM images of the precursor powders after heating at 450°C are depicted in Figure 2. The particle size was from 500 nm to 20 μm in all samples. The precursor powders were milled by the planetary ball-mill equipment. Figure 3 displays SEM images of the precursor powder after the ball- milling. All powders were crushed well. This is because soft amorphous powders could be crushed by the ball- mill easily. The particle size was decreased to <100 nm in all samples. Figure 4 depicts XRD patterns of the precursor powders after the ball-milling. At all samples, the diffraction patterns were broader than those before the ball-milling. This is due to amorphilization caused by the ball-milling. This is consistent with SEM observation (Figure 3) in which the particle size was decreased in all samples.The milled powders were supplied to form the pel-let which was then sintered at 1000°C for 6 h. The XRD patterns of the sintered pellets are shown in Figure 5. In the C2 pellet, all diffraction peaks could be assigned to LTP with NASICON structure (PDF 35–0754), indicat-ing that the LATP solid electrolyte was successfully prepared by our sol-gel process. Contrarily, in the case of C3 and C4 samples, diffraction peaks originat-ing from AlPO4 (PDF 72–1161) were observed in the main peaks of the LATP. Figure 6 shows cross-sectional SEM images of the sintered pellets. The pellets were sintered well, regardless of the Ti sources. The grains were in good contact with each other. The grain size was decreased in order of C2 > C3 > C4. Relative densities of C2, C3 and C4 samples are summarized in Table 1. The highest density was obtained in the C2 sample. The density decreased with increase of carbon number in Ti-Alkoxide, i.e. C2 > C3 > C4, which was consistent with order of the grain size.
Complex impedance plots of LATP pellets using Au blocking electrodes are depicted in Figure 7. A semicircle and a tail were observed in all samples in the high- and low-frequency ranges, respectively. This characteristic profile of the impedance plot often appears in ceramics with ion conductive nature [26,27]. The tail can be attributed to Warburg-type impedance, which originates from the diffusion of Li ions in the blocking electrode. The intercepts of the semicircle at the high- and low-frequency sides were ascribed to inner crystal (bulk) and total (inner crystal and grain boundary) impedances, respectively [28–30]. Calculated Li-ion conductivities were tabulated in Table 2. The highest bulk and total conductivities were 6.8 × 10−3 and 5.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 in the C2 sample. These values were comparable to previously reported values [28,31]. Both bulk and total conductivities were decreased in order of C2 > C3 > C4. The AC impedance measurement of C2 pellet which showed the highest conductivity was performed under various temperatures to depict the Arrhenius plot and estimate activation energy for Li- ion conduction. The semicircle became smaller with increasing temperature and finally disappeared at 75° C, implying that the bulk conductivity increased with temperature. Therefore, the bulk conductivity could not be estimated above 75°C and only activation energy for total Li conduction could be calculated. The Arrhenius plot (Figure 8) was fit well by the Arrhenius equation and the fitting accuracy (R2 factor) was greater than 0.99. The activation energy was estimated to 0.38 eV.
This study was performed to clarify the influence of the Ti source on properties of LATP prepared by a sol-gel method. The Ti sources largely influenced the properties of LATP. In the C2 pellet, impurity formation was not observed and large grains could be seen in the cross-section. On the other hand, formation of AlPO4 impurity was observed in the C3 and C4 pellets. Also, grains in the C3 and C4 pellets were smaller than those in the C2 pellet. The highest bulk and total conductivities were obtained in the C2 pellet and the conductivities decreased in order of C2 > C3 > C4.
The sol-gel method is a method for producing solid materials using hydrolysis (reaction 1) and polymeriza-tion (reaction 2).  where, R is alkyl group like C2H5-, C3H7- and C4H9-. The polymerization (equation 2) further proceeds to form Ti-O-Ti networks. In our sol-gel process, acid was used as a catalyst for the hydrolysis. H+ attacked oxygen atom in the alkoxide and produced alcohol and metal hydroxide. By the hydrolysis of Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3H7 O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4, C2H5OH, n-C3H7OH and n-C4H9 OH were produced, respectively, in the precursor solu-tion. The acidities (pKa) of C2H5OH, n-C3H7OH and n-C4 H9OH are 15.9 [32], 16.0 [33] and 16.1 [34], respectively. This indicates C2H5OH releases more H+ than others in the following equation.
Therefore, concentration of C2H5OH was lower than C3H7OH and C4H9OH in the precursor solution, resulting in promoting the hydrolysis reaction. Then, the hydrolyzed Ti(C2H5O)4-n(OH)n was poly-merized with hydrolyzed Al(C3H7O)3-n(OH)n and Ti- O-Al network was created. On the other hand, in the case of Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4, the hydrolysis reaction was not promoted significantly due to high pKa of C3H7OH and C4H9OH. Therefore, the hydrolysis was not sufficient. Thus, the hydro-lyzed Al was polymerized with each other and then local Al-O-Al network was created. As a result, AlPO4 would be formed by heating the Al-O-Al network. This was evidenced by the observation of AlPO4 impurity in the C3 and C4 samples. Additionally, the diffraction peaks of AlPO4 were more prominent in the C4 pellet because of high pKa of C4H9OH. By the AlPO4 impurity formation, the Li-ion conduction was hindered. As a result, the highest Li-ion con-ductivity was obtained in the C2 pellet. Additionally, large grains were observed in the C2 sample (Figure 6). This is consistent with density measurement shown in Table 1. The large grains can increase the density and reduce the grain-boundary resis-tance, leading to high conductivity [25]. This is another reason for obtaining the highest conductiv-ity in the C2 sample. Table 3 shows a comparison of ionic conductivity of LATP sintered at various conditions. In our sol-gel method, high conductive LATP was obtained compar-ing with other studies at similar sintering conditions [35–38]. Some studies used sintering additive such as LiF, LiBO2 and so on. By the addition of sintering additives, the sintering temperature was reduced to 800 ~ 925°C [39–42] and comparable ionic conductiv-ity to this study was obtained [39,40]. Further reduc-tion of sintering temperature and improvement of the ionic conductivity of LATP would be achieved by a combination of the sol-gel method with sintering additives. This attempt is now going on in our group. Results will be reported in due course.
In conclusion, the Ti source strongly affects the Li- ion conductivity of produced LATP. The Ti source influ-enced AlPO4 impurity formation and sinterability of the produced LATP. The insufficient creation of Ti-O-Al network would cause the formation of AlPO4 impurity phase, resulting in low Li-ion conductivity. The selec-tion of Ti source is a key to obtain LATP solid electro-lyte with high Li-ion conductivity.
In this study, the LATP solid electrolyte was prepared by the sol-gel method using Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4 as Ti sources to examine the influ-ence of the Ti source on the properties of the produced LATP. The Ti source influenced impurity formation. The impurity formation was not confirmed in the Ti(C2H5 O)4 sample, while AlPO4 formation was observed in the Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4 samples. The acidity constant (pKa) of C2H5OH, n-C3H7OH and n-C4H9OH which were produced by the hydrolysis of Ti(C2H5O)4, Ti(n-C3H7O)4 and Ti(n-C4H9O)4 would affect a creation of Ti-O-Al network. C2H5OH with low pKa would pro-mote the hydrolysis reaction, resulting in creating more hydrolyzed Ti and Ti-O-Al network. On the other hand, n-C4H9OH with high pKa could not pro-mote the hydrolysis reaction significantly. Therefore, local Al-O-Al network was formed, leading to AlPO4 formation after the heating. By the AlPO4 impurity, the Li-ion conduction was hindered. As a result, the highest Li-ion conductivity was obtained in the Ti(C2H5 O)4 sample. It was found that the Ti source largely influenced properties of LATP solid electrolyte. The selection of Ti source is a key to obtain high conductive LATP solid electrolyte.
