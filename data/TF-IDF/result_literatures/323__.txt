A hybrid inorganic-organic ionic liquid based on sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide and investigated as an electrolyte for sodium secondary battery operation over an extended temperature and Na+ ion fraction ranges. The phase diagram of the system reveals a wide liquid-phase temperature range at Na[FSA] mole fractions ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 near room temperature, where the 0.7 mole fraction equates to a molar concentration of 5.42  mol  L−1.  The  viscosity  and  molar  ionic  conductivity  are  consistent  with  the fractional Walden rule, and the temperature dependence of these quantities obeys the Vogel−Tammann−Fulcher equation. The optimal Na[FSA] content of the ionic liquid occurs  at  mole  fractions  between  0.3  and  0.7  based  on  the  sodium  metal deposition/dissolution behavior and the rate and cycle properties of a NASICON-type cathode,  Na3V2(PO4)3/C  (NVPC).  The  greatest  cycle  efficiency,  εcycle,  of  Na  metal deposition/dissolution  is  observed  at  x(Na[FSA])  =  0.6  (εcycle  =  93.3%).  Although Na/NVPC half-cell tests indicate a maximum rate and cycle performance at x(Na[FSA]) = 0.6 (83.5% retention at 100 C (11700 mA g−1) and 80% retention after 4000 cycles at 2C (234 mA g−1), NVPC/NVPC symmetric cell tests indicate that the greater Na[FSA] fraction  provides  better  rate  performance  and  that  half-cell  tests  with  a  Na  metal electrode do not provide reliable data for the target electrode/electrolyte system. 

Ionic  liquids  (ILs)  contain  only  ionic  species  and  are  characterized  by  unique properties such as non-flammability, non-volatility, high thermal and electrochemical stability,  a  wide  electrochemical  window,  and  a  wide  liquid  temperature  range  that includes room temperature.1 These properties allow ILs to be used as electrolytes in energy-related  devices  such  as  secondary  batteries,  electrochemical  capacitors,  fuel cells, and dye-sensitized solar cells.2-8 Ongoing research is directed towards alternative energy conversion and storage solutions to confront the existing energy crisis.9 Organic-solvent electrolytes are used in almost all current Li/Na secondary batteries despite their volatility and flammability, which carries the significant risk of fire or explosion. The suitability of IL electrolytes in such devices has been discussed frequently over the past decade. ILs  are now considered to be safer  alternatives to conventional organic electrolytes and to be compatible with operation over a wide temperature range. This property  facilitates  the  intermediate  temperature  operation  of  secondary  batteries utilizing waste heat and improves battery performance by enhancing ion transport and electrode reaction rates.

Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide  (TFSA−)  and  bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide  (FSA−)are typical IL anions that possess high chemical and electrochemical stability and form salts  with  low  melting  points.16-17  Many  ILs  based  on TFSA−  and  FSA−  have  been reported to date.18-24 FSA− forms significantly less viscous ILs than TFSA− and other chemically  inert  anions.25-29 A  low  viscosity  provides  the  fluidity  needed  to  operate energy storage devices at room-to-intermediate temperatures.30-31 The cathodic stability of FSA− also enables its use as a negative electrode material in Li batteries.32-35 Some reports claim that FSA−-based ILs form a robust solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li0, which suppresses dendrite formation in Li batteries. 

Lithium  secondary  batteries  has  been  widely  studied  and  dominate  the  global secondary battery market, but sodium battery energy storage systems (ESS) is expected to precede Li-ion battery in a near future with high natural abundance, low cost, and even distribution of lithium resources.37 In particular, sodium secondary batteries are emerging  energy  storage  devices  in  large  scale  applications38  owing  to  the  greater availability of Na relative to Li resources.39 The safety advantages of ILs are evident due to their unique properties. Some physical and electrochemical investigations have described  the  potential  of  Na[FSA]−[C3C1pyrr][FSA] as  IL  electrolytes  in  Na  secondary  batteries.40-44  These  studies have  determined  that  the  Na  mole  fraction  is  an  important  factor  affecting  battery operation  and  that  the  optimal  Na  fraction  depends  on  temperature  and  the electrochemical reaction.42-43, 45 The rate capability of positive electrode materials is more difficult to evaluate, because polarization of the Na counter electrode in a two-electrode cell is significant even at elevated temperatures.46-47 Evaluation of electrode materials covering a wide range of Na compositions is required to establish the optimal Na  salt  concentration  in  practical  cells.  This  need  prompted  us  to  investigate  and characterize new IL electrolytes based on C2C1pyrr+ and FSA−. It is notable that organic ionic plastic crystals are also attractive materials possessing a plastic crystalline phase observed over a wide temperature range, which is advantageous for its applications in electrochemical devices.44 Organic ionic plastic crystal phase often appears along with ILs,  especially  in  the  case  of  onium  salts  with  a  relatively  spherical  cation.48 The thermal and physical properties of the Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA] system  are  reported  in  this  study.  A  Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA]  phase  diagram constructed from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results is used to establish the optimal temperature range of the electrolyte. In addition to the basic physicochemical and electrochemical properties of Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA], we have investigated the Na metal deposition/dissolution behavior and the effects of x(Na[FSA]) on the rate and cycle performance of Na3V2(PO4)3/C (NVPC, “C” denotes carbon coat), which is a widely  studied  positive  electrode  material  in  sodium  secondary  batteries.49-50  A NVPC/NVPC symmetric cell is also evaluated to address concerns regarding the effect of the Na metal counter electrode on cell performance. 

Phase  transition  temperatures  were  determined  by  DSC  (DSC-8230 Thermo  Plus EVO II Series, Rigaku Corp.) at a scan rate of 5 K min−1 under a dry Ar atmosphere. 

The  thermal  stability  was  measured  by  thermogravimetric  (TG)  analysis  (STA2500 Regulus, NETZSCH) at  a scan rate of 5 K min−1 under a dry Ar atmosphere. DSC samples were sealed in an Al pan, and TG samples were loaded in an Al pan in the glove box. Viscosities were measured with an electromagnetically spinning viscometer EMS-100 (Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). Samples were sealed in glass tubes with a spherical Al probe in the glove box. The ionic conductivity was measured by an AC  impedance  technique  using  a  3532-80  impedance  analyzer. 

The  thermal,  physical,  and  electrochemical  properties  of  the  binary  Na[FSA]-[C2C1pyrr][FSA] system have been investigated. A phase diagram constructed from 

DSC results reveals that a wide temperature range over 100 K around room temperature is achieved at a broad compositions of 0.3 ≤ x(Na[FSA]) ≤ 0.7. Valid VTF and Walden plot  behavior  was  established.  Sodium  deposition/dissolution  cycling  efficiency increases with increasing temperature and increasing x(Na[FSA]) at 0.3 ≤ x(Na[FSA]) ≤ 0.6. The Na ion concentration in the IL significantly influences the rate and cycle capability  of  a  Na/NVPC  half-cell. The  optimum  electrochemical  performance  of  a Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA] half-cell operating at 363 K occurs at 60 mol% Na[FSA] and  is  characterized  by  superior  charge/discharge  rates  under  various  operating conditions with good cycling stability over 4000 cycles. NVPC symmetric cell rate tests indicate that the half-cell test is not fully appropriate for evaluating the rate capability of NVPC and that the Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA] system based on V3+/V4+ and V2+/V3+ activities  improves  upon  increasing  Na[FSA]  from  0.3  to  0.7.  The  high  Na  ion concentration in the Na[FSA]−[C2C1pyrr][FSA] system allows the application of this IL electrolyte as high-rate Na secondary batteries especially under an environment with waste heat.
