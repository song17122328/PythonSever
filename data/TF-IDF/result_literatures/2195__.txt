The cathode (positive electrode) of a rechargeable battery is normally an electronically conducting solid host into/from which the working ion of the battery can be inserted/extracted reversibly. The use of a nonaqueous electrolyte with Li as the working ion allows storage of more energy per unit weight and volume than is possible with a conventional aqueous-electrolyte battery, and the highest energy densities have been realized with an oxide host as the cathode. These oxide hosts have a close-packed oxideion array with half the octahedral sites occupied by a firstrow transition-metal ion.' The layered oxides Li,MO2, for example, contain close-packed MO2 layers alternating with planes containing Li ions; extraction and reinsertion of the Li* ion is rapid even at room temperature because the spacing between MO2 layers is variable and allows adjustment of the free volume available to the Li ions. The Li,CoO2 and Li,Co,9Ni9O2 cathodes have allowed commercial realization of a secondary Lit-ion battery.2 However, the costs of cobalt and nickel are high, and unwanted species from the electrolyte can be inserted with the Li ions between the MO2 layers. Moreover, fewer than 0.6 Li per M atom can be extracted before M atoms become displaced to the Li layers or the electrolyte begins to be oxidized. Alternatively, the cubic spinel Li[Mn2]O4 offers an [M2]04 host strongly bonded in three dimensions (3D) with 3D pathways for Li-ion motion.3 However, the strong 3D bonding of the host oxide restricts the free voltime available to the Li ions, which limits the room temperature Li-ion mobility in the oxide and hence the power capabilities. In addition, the energy of the M4/M3 redox couple changes by 1 eV as the Li ions are shifted from tetrahedral-site occupancy for Li,_[M2]O4 to octahedral-site occupancy for Li,+[M2]O4. Attempts to exploit an 4.0 V vs. a lithium anode with open-circuit voltage V0,, Li,[Mn2]O4 have been plagued by capacity fade; and 3.0 V with a capacity L,+r[Lj033Mfl067]O4 has a V,, restricted to one Li per formula unit.

These drawbacks with a close-packed oxide-ion array have prompted the exploration of host structures containing oxide polyanions rather than oxide ions.9 The hexagonal M2(S04)3 structure illustrated in Fig. la is strongly bonded in 3D, but the larger size of the polyanion provides a larger free volume for the 3D motion of a guest species such as Li. However, the larger separation of the transition-metal ions M can be expected to reduce the electron mobility. Initial experiments''0 with Lie2(SO4)3 showed that strong polarization of the oxide ions toward the S atom stabilizes the Fe3/Fe2 couple to 3.6 eV below the Fermi energy of a lithium anode and that the gain in Lition mobility is more important than any loss in electron mobility. This finding prompted a mapping of the redox energies for different first-row transition-metal elements

and also a comparison of these redox energies for (PO4)3 and (SO4)2polyanions in isostructural hosts."2

In the hexagonal M2(XO4)3 hosts, the redox energies of the various M cations are nearly independent of the Liion concentration and distribution over the two types of interstitial sites. Moreover, the relative positions of the redox energies remain the same upon exchanging (PO4)3 for (SO4)2; however, the V0,, of a phosphate is reduced by 0.8 eV relative to its value in a sulfate, which is consistent with the stronger Bronsted acidity of sulfuric vs. phosphoric acid.

A monoclinic form of Fe2(SO4)3 also exists; the M2(S04)3 parallel-oriented "lantern" units of Fig. la are alternately oriented nearly perpendicular to each other in the monoclinic structure of Fig. ib, which reduces the free volume of the interstitial space available to the Li ions. Although the hexagonal and monoclinic forms of an M2(SO4)3 host have the same V0,, vs. lithium for a given composition, the hexagonal host structure supports a higher Lit-ion mobility and is, therefore, to be preferred. In the case of Fe2(SO4)3, insertion of lithium converts both forms to an orthorhombic Li2Fe2(S04)3 and neither end-member phase is a good electronic conductor. In this paper we show that substitution of one (P04)3polyanion for (S04)2_ per formula unit preserves the hexagonal structure for all x in Li,Fe(SO4)2(PO4) with a sacrifice of about 0.3 eV in the V,,, i.e., about one-third of the 0.8 eV found between LiFe2(SO4)3 and Li3+,Fe2(PO4)3.

Rhombohedral LiFe2(SO4)2(P04) was prepared by a solution method from stoichiometric quantities of LiH2PO4H2O, FeC136H2O, and (NH4)2504. Each of the raw materials was dissolved in water. Then the solutions were

mixed together slowly with continuous stirring. The resultant solution was heated in a beaker over a hot plate to dryness. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in a Perkin Elmer Thermal Analyzer 7 system under flowing N2 at a heating rate of 10°C/mm to 600°C of the dried precipitate showed a strong endothermic peak at 380°C and a moderate exothermic peak at about 450°C. The peak at 450°C corresponds to the formation of the single-phase solid solution, which was found by X-ray diffraction on a furnace-heated sample to be completed by 475°C. The solid product was then air-heated slowly to 475°C where it was held for 12 h. The final product is insoluble in both water and the electrolyte. The temperature needed to form rhombohedral (space group R3c) LiFe2(S04)2(P04) has to be less than 500°C; and the key to obtaining a pure phase was to avoid the formation of Fe203 as a result of loss of sulfur in the form of sulfur dioxide at higher temperatures. X-ray powder diffraction was employed to identify the phases. Unitcell parameters were obtained with a least squares refinement of the diffraction data, which are given in Table I.

Electrochemical characterizations were made with cointype cells (type 2320). The cathode material was mixed! blended with acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in the weight ratio 70:25:5. This cathode mixture, after being held at 140°C for 2 h, was rolled into thin sheets of uniform thickness and cut into pellets of size required for coin-cell fabrication. The electrolyte (Mitsubishi) was 1 M LiC1O4 in a 1:1 (by volume) mixture of propylene carbonate (PC) and dimethoxyethane (DME). A lithium foil was used for the anode. The coin cell was fabricated in a glove box under argon atmosphere. Cell performance was evaluated at various current densities at room temperature with an Arbin battery tester system (ABTS).

The solid solution LiFe2(S04)2(P04) forms readily as a single phase with the open NASICON framework structure of Fig. la. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for LiFe2(S04)2(P04) was indexed on the basis of a rhombohedral cell with a = 8.535(8) A, c = 20.905(21) A in space group R3c. The XRD patterns for rhombohedral Fe2(S04)3, LiFe2(S04)2(P04), and Li3Fe2(P04)3 are given in Fig. 2. The broader lines shown for LiFe2(S04)2(P04) are due to small particle size as a result of sintering at 47 5°C. The presence of sulfate groups restricts us from heating above 500°C due to the formation of sulfur dioxide, which results in Fe203 as an impurity. The respective lattice parameters and unit-cell volumes are given in Table I. It can be seen that as the smaller sulfate anion (SO4)2is replaced by a larger phosphate anion (P04)3in LiFe2(SO4)3_(P04), the unit-cell volume increases in accordance with Vegard's law, but the c/a ratio apparently passes through a minimum value. We were not able to prepare Li2Fe2(S04)(P04)2. Rhombohedral Li3Fe2(P04)3 with a NASICON-type framework is prepared by ionic exchange from its sodium analog Na3Fe2(P04)3, which can be synthesized by direct decomposition and solid-state reaction of stoichiometric quantities of NaH2PO4H20 and Fe203 at 920°C for 24 h. Electrochemical characterization of rhombohedral LiFe2(S0j2(P04) was performed by galvanostatic cycling at various current densities ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 mA/cm2. In the current-density range 0.05— 0.1 mA/cm2, the capacity of 110 mAh/g was reversible; it increased

slightly during the first five cycles, stabilized at about 15 cycles, and showed minimal capacity fade after 25 cycles. At 0.25 mA/cm2, the voltage V(x) remained unchanged, but the capacity decreased reversibly to about 100 mAh/g and this capacity was nearly 100% retained at the end of 25 cycles. At 0.5 mA/cm2, the initial capacity of 100 mAh/g was reduced by about 10% after the 5th cycle but underwent no further change over 25 cycles. At 1.0 mA/cm2, the initial capacity was further reduced reversibly to 80 mAh/g over the first 10 cycles, but upon further c'cling the capacity increased by about 10%.

As can be seen from the V(x) curves in Fig. 3, the electrochemical lithiation proceeds as a single-phase reaction. A nearly flat, but clearly sloping, V(x) curve with an initial open-circuit voltage of 3.5 V relative to a Li-metal anode is obtained during discharge; a reversible capacity of —1.5 lithium atoms per formula unit can probably be improved. The capacity fade with increasing current density is reversible. A comparison of the discharge curves for rhombohedral Fe2(S04)3, LiFe2(S04)2(P04), and Li3Fe2(P04)3 is given in Fig. 4. A flat V = 3.6 V vs. a lithium anode is obtained for NASICON Fe2(S0j3, which shows that the electrochemical insertion of Li proceeds by a two-phase process. This deduction has been confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction of intermediate compositions in the range 0 < x< 2 of nominal LiFe2(S0j3; the end phase Li2Fe2(SO4)3 was confirmed to be orthorhombic after Li insertion into the rhombohedral parent phase Fe2(S04)3. The electrochemical insertion of lithium into Li3.,Fe2(PO4)3 leaves the rhom-

bohedral structure intact and gives a V(x) curve described by a Nernst equation located roughly 0.8 V below the curve for LiJe2(S04)3. Comparison of a given redox energy; e.g., that of the Fe37Fe2 redox couple, in isostructural sulfates and phosphates provides a measure of the relative influences of the counter cation within the two polyanions.9 Figure 5 shows that the relative positions of the different redox energies of an isostructural series remains essentially constant, but the absolute position of each redox couple is shifted by the same amount.12 It follows that if the (P0,33 and (SO4) polyanions were uniformly distributed as two (S0j2 and one (P04)3 polyanion at each Fe2(X04)3 "lantern unit" in Fig. la, the V(x) curve for Li1+e2(SO4)2(PO4) would lie below the curve for Li1Fe2(S04)3, about one-third the voltage separation to the Li3e2(PO4)3 curve. Figure 4 indicates a statistical distribution in which many lantern units are bridged by three sulfate groups and some by two or more phosphate groups. The Fe3/Fe24 redox energy of the two Fe atoms that are bridged by three sulfate anions remains identical to their energy in Li,Fe2(S04)3; these iron ions are reduced in the initial stage of lithium insertion, i.e., for 0  17) x n 0.4. The Fe atoms that are bridged by one phosphate and two sulfate polyanions appear to be reduced predominantly in the interval 0.5 <x < 1.0; at higher values of x, the majority of Fe atoms that are reduced are bridged by more than one phosphate anion, and the V(x) curve decreases more sharply with increasing x> 1.0 than would be predicted by the Nernst equation for a fixed equilibrium redox

energy. An apparent capacity of only 1.5 (instead of 2.0) Li/formula unit is a surprise that may not represent a fundamental limit. The substitution of a larger (P04)3 group for one (SO4)2 group per formula unit increases the free volume available to a Li ion in the single-phase solid solution, which makes Li1+e2(SO4)2(PO4) an attractive cathode material at higher current densities, as demonstrated in Fig. 3, provided the full capacity of one Li per Fe atom can be realized.

The hexagonal NASICON structure of Fig. la can accept the substitution of one polyanion for another as demonstrated by the synthesis of LiFe2(S04)2(P04). Electrochemical insertion of additional lithium into Li3 ÷1Fe2(S04)2(PO4) over the range 0  17) x S 1.5 is a reversible solid-solution reaction within the hexagonal structure. The reason for limitation of the solid-solution range to x = 1.5 was not determined and contrasts with an x = 2.0 limit found for other NASICON hosts. The voltage curves V(x) vs. a lithium anode indicate a retention of capacity to 0.5 mA/cm2 and reflect the distribution of the bridging polyanions in the NASICON framework. In the range 0  17) x s 0.4, units of two Fe3 ions bridged by three sulfate anions are reduced at the same voltage as in LiFe3(S04)3. Those bridged by two sulfate anions and one phosphate anion have their Fe3/Fe2 redox energy raised by ca. 0.8/3 = 2.67 eV, which lowers the V(x) curve correspondingly in the range 0.5 cx .c 1.0. At higher values of x, the introduction of two or three bridging phosphate anions lowers the V(x) curve further to that of Li3+,Fe2(P0j3. These results show that the inductive effect of the separate polyanions adds to one another in the determination of the effective ligand field operating on the octahedral-site M cations of an M2(S0J3 framework. If the solid-solution range can be increased to x = 2.0, Li1÷Fe3(S0j2(P04) offers an attractive cathode for a lithium-ion battery. Acknowledgment
