The NASICON (Na Super Ionic CONductors)-type materials are good ionic conductors whenserving as solid electrolytes for lithium–ion batteries.
In this paper, Nb-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 hasbeen synthesized by solid-state reaction method and the structural, vibrational and dielectricstudies are systematically investigated.
The X-ray diffraction conforms that the Nb-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 compound has NASICON structure, i.e.rhombohedral with space group R-3c.
Theaverage crystallite size and lattice constant are increased with dopant concentration.
Thegrain sizes of the synthesized compounds are investigated by scanning electron microscopeand it is found to be in the range of 5 μm.
From Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopyspectra, stretching vibrations of P-O-P bond are identified in the region of 700–750 cm−1. ACelectrical study is carried out by exploiting the impedance and dielectric spectroscopy.
Theactivation energy increases with dopant concentration since ion diffusion becomes easy asthe volume fraction of the grain increases.
Non-Debye behavior of conductivity relaxation isreflected in the modulus analysis.
LiTi2−xNbx(PO4)3 with (x = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1 and 0.15)has been synthesized by solid-state reaction method at1100°C to obtain single phase.
XRD pattern conformthe formation of NASICON structure and there is noimpurity phase.
Both crystallite sizes and lattice parametersincrease with increasing niobium concentration.
The vibrational properties of NASICON-typeNb-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 are studied by FT-IR and itconforms the dopant exactly occupies Ti site of thecorresponding host lattice.
The frequency dependentAC conductivity is calculated at different temperaturesand it shows the behavior of ionic material.
Modulusformalism ensures that the non-Debye-type relaxationpresents in the all prepared compounds.
