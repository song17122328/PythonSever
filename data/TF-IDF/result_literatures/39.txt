Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is regarded as a potential cathode material applied in sodium ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its NASICON structure. However, most of the reported works have focused on the synthesis of materials and the improvement of electrochemical properties, with few research on the design and safety of pouch cells. Herein, we implemented a cost-saving and industrialized route to realize industrial-scale synthesis of NVP cathode materials. The obtained NVP samples possess impressive Na-ion storage capability with a high reversible capacity (116.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C), superior power capability (97.9 mA h g−1 at 30 C), and a long lifespan (71.6% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 20 C). Remarkably, industrial-scale NVP/hard carbon (HC) sodium-ion pouch cells were designed with 823 mA h discharge capacity at the current of 200 mA (about 0.25 C), which display a long life and high rate performance (1000 cycles with a little decay at the current of 4000 mA). Besides, the pouch cells also exhibit excellent thermal stability when demonstrated for application in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and puncturing experiment results can further prove the excellent safety performance of NVP-hard carbon pouch cells.
For decades, the market of portable electronic energy storage devices have been dominated by Li-ion batteries (LIBs), attributed to its advantages of high energy or power density with long cycling life.1, 2 But, the expensive cost and limited resources of Li seriously hinder the development of LIBs to larger field, for example, grid-scale energy storage system (ESS).3, 4 However, there exist a few critical factors for stationary batteries applied in ESS, such as low self-discharge behavior, superior rate performance, the stable operation state in any climate and chemistry.5 Alternatively, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been studied for years as a promising technology beyond the LIBs counterpart, mainly ascribed to the higher abundance of sodium resource compared with lithium and the similar electrochemical intercalation behavior as Li.6-13 Besides, the production line for manufacturing LIBs can be applied directly to assemble SIBs, avoiding the waste of production resources. Inspired by these advantageous conditions, extensive efforts have been devoted to studying electrode materials, electrolytes and full-cell structure design of SIBs, aiming at promoting SIBs for commercialization. However, on account of the larger ionic radius of sodium, there exist some issues about the low Na+ diffusion coefficient into the electrode and structure degradation during Na+ intercalation/deintercalation, which leads to the inferior power capability and cyclic ability of SIBs.14-16 Therefore, to search for applicable electrode materials with stable structure and fast ion diffusion pathways, is becoming the key factor for the development of SIBs.As a cathode material with typical sodium super-ionic conductor (NASICON) structure, Na3V2(PO4)3(NVP) has received extensive attention by reason of its 3D open frameworks, providing fast Na-ion transport pathways and maintaining structural stability. So far, a wide variety of synthetic routes have been conducted to make an investigation on the Na-ion storage performance of NVP, such as high-energy ball milling method, sol-gel method and spay-drying method. Park et al,17 synthesized a 3-D interconnected porous structure of NVP by adopting a modified sol-gel method, the NVP@C could possess a high discharge specific capacity, attaining 116.9 mA h g−1 at 1C. Sun et al,18 implemented a high-energy ball milling route to obtain the off-stoichiometric Na3-3xV2+x(PO4)3, which still delivered 79% of the theoretical capacity (about 117 mA h g -1) at 20 C. Our group19 reported a simple self-sacrificed method to prepare 3D NVP nanofiber network with 95.9% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 10 C. However, most reported methods are only suitable for synthesizing electrode materials in the laboratorial scale with output of only a few grams. If calculated in terms of up-scaling industrial quantities (kilogram-class), many key factors of synthetic methods above, such as producing efficiency, consistency of products, and manufacturing cost, will limit NVP for being conducted to electrode material production. Among multitudinous synthetic routes, spray-drying has been demonstrated to be one of the most appropriate method to prepare electrode materials for LIBs and SIBs in up-scaling industrial quantities,20 owing to the synthesis of homogeneous electrode materials with high tap density and reproducible results. To our knowledge, LiFePO4,21-25 Li4Ti5O12,26-28 Li3V2(PO4)3,29-31 NaTi2(PO4)3,32, 33 Na2MnPO4F,34, 35 and V2O536 have been obtained by the spray-drying route and applied in LIBs or SIBs fields.It is well known that LIBs are bringing convenient life to human being. But, in recent years, there have been many safety accidents about LIBs, which sent out a signal for us to attach great importance to battery safety. Taking many factors of safety accidents about LIBs into account, thermal runaway of cells is the most vital one, which can give rise to fire and/or explosion.37-39 As well as LIBs, more attentions must be paid for the concern of safety and reliability of SIBs. Many methods have been introduced for evaluating the abuse tolerance of lithium or sodium ion batteries, including short-circuit, overcharge, oven test, puncturing test, crushing test and so on.40, 41 Punching test is conducted by forcing a nail through the battery. With the test going on, a large amount of heat accumulated in a short period of time is arousing the thermal runaway, which mainly caused by the internal short-circuit of the battery. Generally, the hazard of a single cell with the thermal runaway is extremely low. Yet if the thermal runaway appears in hundreds of cells packed together, the consequences of fire and/or explosion are unimaginable. It is noteworthy that the whole battery system will suffer from hazardous destruction by cell-to-cell spread of thermal runaway, if thermal runaway happens to a single cell.42 Therefore, researches on SIBs should not only focus on battery material technology, but also battery safety.Herein, we developed an industrialized spray-draying route to realize Na3V2(PO4)3 industrialized amplification (kilogram-class). The obtained Na3V2(PO4)3 samples exhibit outstanding Na-ion storage capability with a high reversible capacity, superior power capability, and long cycling life. Furthermore, we designed Na3V2(PO4)3-hard carbon Na-ion pouch cells. And the pouch cells can deliver the discharge capacity of 823 mA h at the current of 200 mA (about 0.25 C), and display a long life at an extremely high current of 4000 mA (about 5 C), for over 1000 cycles. Besides, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) demonstration and puncturing experiment are also carried out to prove the thermal stability and safety performance of NVP-hard carbon pouch cells.
M-NVP/C microspheres could be obtained by a spray-drying and subsequent calcination route. In a typical procedure illustrated in Figure 1, 1.685 kg NaH2PO4, 0.654 kg V2O5, 0.4 kg C6H12O6·H2O and 15 L methanol were fed into a ball-milling tank with Zr-balls and then continually mixed for 2 h. After uniformly mixed, the obtained slurry was spray-dried at 205 °C to form a solid precursor, then calcinated in N2 atmosphere at 800 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min-1 and maintained for 8 h. Finally, carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 microspheres samples could be available and weighed about 1200 g, as described in Fig. S1. However, more than 400 g products were lost during the whole preparing process, mainly as a result of losing the intermediate product bonded to the wall of spray dryer. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we can summarize briefly the specific procedure route for feeding, mixing, spray-drying, calcinating and obtaining the product. For H-NVP/C, the methanol was replaced by distilled water.
The crystallographic information of the final products was analyzed by employing a D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with non-monochromated Cu K α X-ray source. Raman measurement was performed to investigate the nature of carbon layer and hard carbon with Renishaw INVIA micro-Raman spectroscopy system. The information of morphology could be gained with a JEOL-7100F microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were recorded with a JEM-2100F microscope. A Tristar II 3020 instrument by nitrogen adsorption of at 77 K was used to measure BET surface areas. TG-DSC analysis was performed by using a NETZSCH-STA449c/3/G thermoanalyzer. The value of tap density was got by an instrument (BT-300). Carbon contents were determined by using Vario EL cube CHNSO elemental analyzer. 
The electrochemical performances of Na-ion half cells assembled with 2016 coin cells in a glove box full of pure argon gas are demonstrated basing on the following methods. Na metal served as the anode, the electrolyte was made by compounding 1 M solution of NaClO4 into ethylene carbon (EC)-dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1: 1 w/w) and 5% FEC, and a Whatman glass Micro-fibre Filter (Grade GF/F) acted as the separator. The mixture of 80 wt% active materials, 10 wt% carbon nanotube conductive paste, and 10 wt% PVDF with a proper amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent was coated on an Al foil to form the cathode electrode, dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 105 °C. Then, the electrode was cut into circular dimensions of 14 mm diameter with about 1.5-2.0 mg cm-2 of the mass loading of active materials. A battery test system (LAND CT2001A) was employed for carrying out the galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, where 1 C is equal to 117 mA h g-1. A CHI 760e electrochemical workstation was used for performing the Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests.
Pouch cells were fabricated to verify the Na-ion storage capability of NVP cathode material. Aluminum-plastic film served as the sealing, 1 M solution of NaClO4 in ethylene carbon (EC)- dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1: 1 w/w) and 2% FEC was used as the electrolyte, and the separator for lithium ion batteries can be chosen for replacing glass micro-fibre filter. The mixture of 90.5 wt% active material, 1.5 wt% carbon nanotube conductive paste, 2 wt% carbon black, 6 wt% PVDF and a proper amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was putting into a planetary mixer to form a uniform cathode slurry with an appropriate viscosity, which was coated on an Al foil afterwards. The electronic images of NVP cathode pole pieces with 10-11 mg cm−2 of the surface mass density are shown in Fig. S2a and S2b. The anode slurry was coated on a Cu foil, made of 93.8 wt% hard carbon (HC), 2 wt% carbon black, 1.7 wt% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 2.5 wt% styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) and right amount of distilled water. The surface mass density of HC anode is 3-3.5 mg cm−2. The electronic images of HC anode pole pieces are displayed in Fig. S2c and S2d. All electrode pieces were kept in a vacuum oven at 110 °C until the water content of electrode pieces was less 500 ppm. The capacity test for Na-ion pouch cells was conducted by a battery test system (TITANS THCX-IO/5-96-M-A).
Fig. 2a presents the XRD patterns of the M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C samples. All diffraction peaks are well indexed to the rhombohedral NVP (JCPDS No. 53-0018), according with previous reports.19, 43, 44 As it turns out in Fig. 2b, Raman spectrum of M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C possess two characteristic bands appearing at 1326 cm-1 and 1590 cm-1, which are identified as D-band (disorder carbon) and G-band (crystalline graphitized carbon), respectively. The intensity ratios (ID/IG) for M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C samples are about 1.23 and 1.30, suggesting that M-NVP/C samples possess a higher degree of graphitization. Besides, there is a band appearing at around 1000 cm−1 in the H-NVP/C sample, caused by the stretching vibrations of PO4.44, 45 Moreover, CHNSO elemental analysis was conducted for measuring the content of carbon. It is known that the amorphous carbon content of M-NVP/C is 3 wt%, slightly higher than 2.7 wt% for H-NVP/C, and the similar result can be confirmed by TGA test (Fig. S3). The phenomenon can be explained by that the different ball-milling solvent results in different degrees of graphitization and carbon content. BET measurement was conducted to determine the surface area and pore-size distribution of M-NVP/C (Fig. 2c) and H-NVP/C (Fig. 2d). The BET specific surface areas are 14.9 and 15.2 m2 g-1 for M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C samples with pore diameter of 1-5 nm, demonstrating the voids and interspaces of microspheres to relieve internal stress of structure.
The Electronic images of the precursor and product in the mullite saggar are presented in Fig. S4a and S4b. It is found that the colours of the precursor and final products are dark green and pure black, respectively. The morphology of M-NVP/C is shown in Fig. 3a and 3b. The microspheres with size of around 10-20 µm are successfully gained by the spray-drying route. The SEM images display that the microspheres are consisted of numerous intercalated nanoparticles, which leads to lots of voids. The structure is available for providing the fast Na-ion diffusion pathways, enlarging electrode-electrolyte contact areas, and relieving internal stress. The microspheres structure is also found in the H-NVP/C sample as illustrated in Fig. S5a and S5b. The result of EDS indicates that Na, C, V and P are distributed uniformly. It is unexpected that Fe elemental can be found in the M-NVP/C (Fig. 3c) and H-NVP/C (Fig. S5c) samples, which is mainly attributed to the equipment wear. According to the result from inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer (ICP), the content of Fe element is very low, about 0.3%. Moreover, amorphous carbon coating layer on the surface of particles can be observed clearly on the TEM images (Fig. 3d and S5d). The lattice fringes of M-NVP/C (Fig. 3e) and H-NVP/C (Fig. S5e) with d-spacings of about 0.36 nm and 0.44 nm could be clearly observed, originating from the (113) and (104) planes of NVP, respectively. Tap density was evaluated by vibration density meter. The value of tap density for M-NVP/C is about 0.9-0.95 g mL-1, which is much higher than that for NVP nanostructures previously published. It is well known that high tap density could provide higher gravimetric and volumetric energy densities and is beneficial for commercializing cathode material and SIBs.46.
Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the Na-ion storage capability in half cell between M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C in the potential range of 2.2-3.8 V. The CV test (Fig. 4a) was performed at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1. As is known to all, the redox peaks of NVP in the range of 2.2-3.8 V are corresponding to the reversible V3+/V4+ redox couple reaction. Remarkably, there is a split at around 3.2 V of reduction peaks, which mainly arises from the structural rearrangement happening to Na-ion migration from Na(1) to the Na(2) sites in the NASICON framework.43, 47 The rate performances of the M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C are shown in Fig. 4b. Apparently, compared with H-NVP/C, the M-NVP/C possesses higher discharge capacity under each current rate, showing improved rate capability. According to Fig. 4c, it is known that the M-NVP/C electrode can deliver reversible capacities as high as 116.3, 107.9 106.7, 104.5, 102, 99.9, 98.1, 97.9 mA h g−1 at current rates of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 C, respectively. Then, upon the current density is back to 0.2 C, the capacity of 118.3 mA h g−1 could be achieved without any decay. To evaluate the cycling lifespan of two samples, a high current rate of 20 C is adopted and cycling for over 2500 cycles. As presented in Fig. 4e, M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C could deliver the initial specific capacity of 105.7 and 107.6 mA h g−1, respectively. After 2500 cycles, M-NVP/C can still maintain 71.6% of the initial capacity, attaining 75.7 mA h g−1, indicating an impressive cycling lifespan with an excellent material power density. For comparison, H-NVP/C can only achieve capacity of 48.3 mA h g−1 with the 45% capacity retention. Then, we conducted the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test with the half cells after testing the long-term cyclability of M-NVP/C and H-NVP/C, recorded in Fig. 4d. The value of Rct (charge transfer resistance) for the M-NVP/C electrode is 381 Ω, far smaller than that for H-NVP/C (830 Ω), indicating the changeability of charge transfer kinetics by mixing different solvent. According to the results of Raman measurement and electrochemical characterization, it is demonstrated that methanol as the mixing solvent can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of NVP cathode material, which may be attributed to the tribological effects in methanol. The activation energy of pyrolytic carbon milled in the methanol environment, other than milled in the water environment, could be reduced due to increased friction effect, that is, the higher degree of graphitization and electric conductivity can be obtained for the coated carbon, owing to the reduced activation energy under same calcinating temperature. Among numerous anode materials serving in SIBs,48-51 hard carbon has been researched for many years. Therefore, in our work, commercialized hard carbon is also used for verifying the excellent Na-ion storage performance of M-NVP/C electrode. The Raman spectra (Fig. S6a) of hard carbon exhibit a broad D-band (around 1344 cm-1) and a G-band (around 1593 cm-1). The ID/IG for HC (hard carbon) is about 1.014. The morphology of HC is displayed in Fig. S6b, where the block shape particles with diameters of around 5-10 µm can be observed. Fig. S7a shows the CV curves of HC at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential range of 0.01-2 V. There is a pair of redox peaks appearing at about 0.1 V in HC electrodes, which can be ascribed to the sodium insertion/extraction into/from hard carbon material. However, the initial coulombic efficiency of hard carbon is relatively low, limiting the wide application for sodium ion battery. As illustrated in Fig. S7b, the coulombic efficiency of 61.6% 56.1% 50.9% and 42.4% for HC could be achieved at the current densities of 50, 100, 200 and 300 mA g-1, respectively, which is very against operating the capacity for cells. Fig. S7c shows the cyclic ability of HC at different current density. Apparently, there is not any decay in specific capacity after 100 cycles at each current density, which indicates the outstanding cyclability of hard carbon.
The Na-ion full cells containing M-NVP/C and hard carbon are designed and fabricated. As presented in the Fig. 5a, the CV curves of full cells characterized by assembly of 2016 coin cells at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 in the potential range of 2.2-3.65 V. It is evident that a pair of redox peaks appears in relation to the reversible V3+/V4+ redox couple reaction. Fig. 5b displays the discharge curves of pouch cells kept under different test temperatures and discharged at the current of 200 mA (about 0.25 C). At room temperature (25 °C), pouch cells could achieve the capacity of 832 mA h. As the testing temperature was changed, the cells display separately the capacity of 632.3 624.8 and 247.9 mA h at the temperature of 60 ℃, -20 ℃, -40 ℃, and about 76%, 75.1% and 29.8% of the capacity at room temperature are maintained, respectively. The long-term cyclability of the Na-ion pouch cells containing M-NVP/C and hard carbon is shown in Fig. 5c. At the discharge currents of 500 ,1000 and 4000 mA, Na-ion full cells deliver the discharging capacities of 621.1, 681.4 and 487.6 mA h for the first cycle, respectively. A phenomenon can be found that the discharging capacities present a trend from rising to declining, which is ascribed to the electrochemical activation of electrode. With the cycle number increasing, the highest discharging capacities can reach 798.3, 683.7 and 575.1 mA h subsequently. Herein, CT refers to the termination discharge capacities. So, the numerical value of 100*CT/CH% (CH, the highest discharging capacities) can be used to characterize the long-term cyclability of the Na-ion full cells. The value is 92.5%, 92.4% and 80.3% at the current of 500,1000 and 4000 mA after 250, 300 and 1000 cycles, respectively. It is noteworthy that the power density of pouch cells cycled at the current of 4000 mA can reach as high as 320 W L−1, demonstrating that NVP/HC Na-ion full batteries possess excellent power capability.Here, the Na-ion pouch cells were put into practical application for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). As the UAV was connected with prepared batteries, a pair of airscrews can rotate quickly (Fig. 5d). Using multimeter for operating-current test, the numerical value is about 5.5 A. With airscrews rotating, the voltage of cell slowly dropped down to 2.2 V. The rotating time we counted is nearly 7 min. During the whole operating process, the cell shows high stability without gas expansion or size change. Fig. 5e and 5f show the surface temperature of cell before and after operating UAV, respectively. 26.2 ℃ is the surface temperature of cell before, and 28.3 ℃ after operating, which demonstrates the excellent thermal stability and power performance of Na-ion pouch cells containing M-NVP/C and hard carbon. Moreover, the puncturing method was conducted to determine the safety of prepared Na-ion full cells. The cell maintained a 100% charging state in Fig. 5g. Fig. 5h shows the process of puncturing the nail into the cell. The process of pulling out the nail from cell is displayed in Fig. 5i. It is evident that there is no phenomenon of firing, smoking or exploding, proving that the Na-ion full cells have the excellent safety performance.
In summary, an industrialized spray-draying route was developed to realize industrial-scale synthesis of NVP cathode materials. It is proved that adopting methanol as mixed solvent results in superior tap density, higher degrees of graphitization and carbon content of NVP/C. The M-NVP/C microspheres are consisted of interconnected nanoparticles which can provide sufficient pores or channels for Na+ transport path, enlarging electrode-electrolyte contact area and relieving internal stress of microspheres structure. The obtained NVP samples display outstanding Na-ion storage capability with a high reversible capacity (116.3 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C), excellent power capability (97.9 mA h g−1 at 30 C), and a long life-span (71.6% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 20 C). Remarkably, NVP-hard carbon(HC) sodium-ion pouch cells were designed with 823 mA h discharge capacity at the current of 200 mA (about 0.25 C), and display a long life and high rate (1000 cycles with a little decay at the current of 4000 mA). Besides, the pouch cells also exhibit excellent thermal stability when it was demonstrated for application in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and puncturing experiment results further prove the excellent safety performance of the NVP-hard carbon pouch cells.
