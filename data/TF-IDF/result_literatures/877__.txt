Crystallization of high temperature self-flux of systemNa2O-K2O-TiO2-P2O5 was investigated at different molar ratios (Na+K)/P = 0.9; 1.0 or 1.2 and Na/K = 1.0 or 2.0 over thetemperature range 1000–650°C.

 The conditions of formation of complex phosphates K0.10Na0.90Ti2(PO4)3 (NASICONrelated) and K0.877Na0.48TiІІІ0.357TiІV1.643(PO4)3 (langbeiniterelated) have been established.

The new obtained compounds were investigated using FTIR-spectroscopy, powderand single crystal X-ray diffraction and optical microscopymethods.

The influence of alkaline metal nature on thestructure formation of complex phosphates in the high temperature self-fluxes is discussed.

The complex phosphates with a general formulaMIxTi2(PO4)3 attract a great interest due to their useful properties which are caused the particularities oftheir structures.

These compounds crystallize in cubic(space group P213) or rhombohedral (space groupR-3c) systems depending on nature MI.

The phosphateKTi2(PO4)3 [1] belongs to well known group of langbeinites (cubic crystal system) while NaTi2(PO4)3 [2] andRbTi2(PO4)3 [3] crystallize in the NASICON-type structure (NASICON – Na Super ionic conductivity).

It shouldbe noted that KTi2(PO4)3 was structurally determined ascubic langbeinite by Masse et al [1] and as rhombohedralNASICON by Lunezheva et al.

For potassium andtitanium-containing phosphates with langbeinite typestructure are known other examples such as K2Ti2(PO4)3and nonstoichiometric K2-xTi2(PO4)3, 0  x  0.5 [5,6].

These compounds are characterized by a mixedvalence of titanium atom (TiIII/TiIV) and can haveapplication as catalysts, nonlinear optics materials andionic conductors.

Both langbeinite and NASICON-type structures consist of a three-dimensional framework that is build upfrom TiO6-octahedra connected by PO4-tetrahedra.

TheMI atoms occupy channels and cavities formed by theframework.

The langbeinite framework creates closedcavities that trap the cations while the NASICON-typestructure has channels that result in a high ion mobility.

Thus, the NASICON-related compounds exhibit ahigh ionic conductivity associated with low activationenergy [7].

Except this, the flexibility of the framework aswell as the large open channels, provide structural stability and intrinsic safety even at high charge states [8].

Charge-discharge capabilities of the NASICON-type materials NaTi2(PO4)3 were first demonstrated by Delmaset al [9].

The phosphates with langbeinite-type structureare perspective luminescent materials [10, 11] and stable crystalline matrix for the storage of nuclear wastes[12–14].

In view of the importance of phosphates (NASICON and langbeinite-related) application and absenceof knowledge about role of alkaline metal nature onstructure formation of such compounds containing thetitanium, the interaction of TiO2 with the mixed alkalinemetals phosphate melts was investigated.

The results of investigation of crystallization of themolten systems Na2O-K2O-TiO2-P2O5 at different molar ratios (Na+K)/P = 0.9; 1.0 or 1.2 and Na/K =1.0 or 2.0 over the temperature range 1000–650°C areconsidered here.

The synthesized phosphates have beencharacterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the single crystal and powder X-raydiffraction.

The crystallization of melts Na2O-K2O-TiO2-P2O5 wasinvestigated at different molar ratios (Na+K)/P = 0.9,1.0 or 1.2 and Na/K = 1.0 or 2.0 over the temperature range 1000–650°C.

It was found that single crystalsof NASICON-related phosphate (K0.10Na0.90Ti2(PO4)3) areformed only at ratio Na/K = 2.0, while langbeiniterelated phosphate (K0.877Na0.48TiІІІ0.357TiІV1.643(PO4)3) canbe obtain in the P2O5-rich melt ((Na+K)/P = 0.9) at valueNa/K = 1.0.The determination of structure particularitiesfor new obtained phosphates showed the key roleof sodium atoms in formation of NASICON-relatedphosphate K0.10Na0.90Ti2(PO4)3 or potassium atomsin formation of the langbeinite-related phosphateK0.877Na0.48TiІІІ0.357TiІV1.643(PO4)3.The influence of presence of pair K + Na for both types of structure on thegeometry of main building units was considered.

The main advantage of using of mixed alkalinemetals phosphate melts is temperature reduction forpreparation of complex phosphates containing TiIIIwith langbeinite-type structure.

The similar phosphateK2Ti2(PO4)3 was early prepared at the temperature 1200ºC using metallic titanium.
