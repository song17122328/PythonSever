Nasicon-type Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.2) cathodes were synthesized by a solid-state reaction route. The prepared powders were mixed with acetylene carbon using planetary milling to optimize the electrochemical performance. The galvanostatic charge/discharge test and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) indicated that both Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes showed two reversible redox phenomena at 2.8 and 2.7 V for Fe3+/Fe2+ couple versus Li/Li+ upon discharge. The plateau potential of Ti4+/Ti3+ versus Li/Li+ at 2.5 V is not observed because of the low content of Ti and the disturbance of Fe3+/Fe2+. In contrast, the plateau potential of Mn3+/Mn2+ versus Li/Li+ at 3.5 V is observed. In addition, the Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode possessed higher reversibility and better capacity retention (122.3 mAh g−1 at C/20 in the first cycle, approaching the theoretical capacity of 128 mAh g−1, and close to 90.8 mAh g−1 at C/2 in the 20th cycle) than that of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode.

Nowadays, lithium ion batteries are widely used because of the excellent charge/discharge capability. Among known Li insertion compounds, the layered rock salt LiCoO2 [1] and LiNiO2 oxides [2], and the LiMn2O4 spinel [3,4] are now commercially used as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium batteries. However, these materials have low discharge capacity, high cost or poor cyclability. Therefore, other compounds have been researched extensively, especially Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple-based materials such as Nasicon-type (sodium super ionic conductor) and Olivine-type compounds [5–8]. For the Nasicon-type compounds A3Fe2(XO4)3 (A = Li, Na; X = P , As, S), its 3D framework is made up of XO4 tetrahedra and the FeO6 octahedra. Each FeO6 octahedron shares its corners with six tetrahedral and each XO4 tetrahedron is connected by four FeO6 octahedra. This structure allows lithium intercalation and extraction, making it a promising cathode material for lithium batteries [5]. Among these Nasicon compounds, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was reported by Goodenough’s group [6] to generate about 2.8 V versus Li/Li+ with excellent capacity retention. As result of Fe3+/Fe2+ process, 2 mol lithium can be intercalated into 1 mol Li3Fe2(PO4)3, delivering a capacity of 128 mAh g−1, which is comparable to that of the LiCoO2 cathode, in which only half the lithium can be cycled in practical cells. Moreover, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is much less expensive than LiCoO2. Such polyanionic compounds like Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is known to have a very low electronic conductivity due to the lack of connectivity between FeO6 octahedra. In order to overcome this handicap, many efforts have been made, such as dispersing carbon black with high surface area [9], using height ball-milling to reduce the particle size of active materials and improve the uniformity [10], doping geterovalent cations [11], and synthesis of small size particles [12]. Delmas et al. firstly demonstrated to intercalate/deintercalate lithium into/from Nasicon-type LiTi2(PO4)3 with a reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1 at 2.5 V versus Li/Li+ [13,14]. A s w e k n o w , Nasicon-type LiM2(PO4)3(M = Ti, Ge, Zr, Hf) and perovskitetype Li0.5La0.5TiO3 have good ionic conductivity. Many of these ionic conductors containing titanium as the main component, can easily take part in lithium insertion or extraction, and exhibit considerable electronic conductivity. It is mentioned that the coexistence of Mn2+ with Fe2+ could improve the kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+ redox process in LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4/nanocarbon webs composite cathode [15]. In the meantime, the plateau potential of Mn3+/Mn2+ couple versus Li/Li+ at 4.1 V is higher than that of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple versus Li/Li+ at 3.4 V in LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4/nano-carbon webs composite cathode. Similar phenomenon is hoped to take place in the Mn doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathodes. Therefore, partial substitution of Fe with Ti or Mn in the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode is expected to lead to a good electrical conductivity and produce an excellent rate capacity at room temperature. In this work, the Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.2) cathodes were synthesized by solid-state reaction at 850 ◦C, and then ball milled with 5 wt% acetylene carbon, and the electrochemical properties were investigated.

The monoclinic (P21/n) L i3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.2) were prepared by direct solid-state reaction from Li2CO3 (99.5%, SCRC), FePO4·2H2O (99%, HEROCHEM), MnCO3 (99%, SCRC), NH4H2PO4 (99%, SCRC) and P25-TiO2 (99%, Degussa, average particle size 21 nm). The mixtures with stoichiometric amounts of these raw materials were ground in an agate mortar. The resulting mixtures were heated in open crucibles at 450 ◦C for 4 h in an argon atmosphere. The harvested powders were intermediately reground, then pressed into the pellets, and finally the pellets were sintered at 850 ◦C for 20 h under argon to obtain the well-crystallized Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3. The samples were mixed with acetylene carbon in ball-milling at a rotation speed of 220 rpm for 10 h to reduce the particle size and increase the electrical conductivity of the powders. The samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max2550 V diffractometer with Cu K? radiation at a step-scanning mode in the range of 10–60◦ with a step width of 0.02◦ and a step time of 4 s. The morphologies of powders were studied on a scanning electronic microscope (Model JSM-6700F, JEOL Company). Electrochemical characterization was carried out by assembling a Li/LiPF6 (EC + DMC)/cathode CR2025 coin cell for galvanostatic charge/discharge. To make electrodes, the prepared powders were first mixed well together with acetylene carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (80:10:10) in Nmethylpyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a slurry. The slurry was spread uniformly on a thin aluminum foil with a diameter of 14 mm, and then were vacuum dried for 2 h at 120 ◦C. The electrodes disks contained 4–7 mg active material. Metal lithium foils were used as negative electrodes. A 1 M LiPF6 solution in 1:1 volume ratio of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixed solvent was used as electrolyte. A polypropylene (PP) microporous film was used as a separator. Electrodes were assembled in a stainless coin cell in Ar atmosphere using a glove box with moisture and oxygen content of less than 0.1 ppm. The galvanostatical charge and discharge tests were performed between 2 and 4 V versus Li+/Li at various rates at 30 ◦C. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a CHI660B electrochemical working station at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s between 2 and 4 V.

The five diffraction patterns are similar to each other except for the degree of a slight right shift of diffraction angles of Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.05–0.2) when Ti and Mn coexisting with Fe at 4e site, compared with that of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C. No impurities were detected from the XRD dates. There is no evidence of diffraction peaks of acetylene carbon due to its low content and/or amorphous nature [15], as proved by the SEM images as shown in Fig. 2. The amount of carbon in Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C is 5 wt%. Thus, the XRD patterns indicate that pure and well-crystallized Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 could be synthesized by solid-state reaction at 850 ◦C with FePO4·2H2O as iron source. Fig. 2 shows SEM pictures of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3 powders, ball-milled Li3Fe2(PO4)3/ carbon and ball-milled Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/carbon mixtures. The average particle size of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 sample is in the range 1–5?m, and that of the Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3 sample is almost between 10 and 20 ?m. After ball-milling with carbon, the particle size of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C sample decreases about one order of magnitude, and that of Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C samples decreases about two orders of magnitude. The average particle sizes of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C samples are both approximately 100–500 nm. Ball-milling leads to particle fracturing so that the number of non-fully coordinated metal atoms at the particle surface increases. Such sites could become active, enabling a good carbon coating. The improvement possibly results in the electrical conductivity enhancement. The morphology of acetylene carbon cannot be observed from SEM images (c) and (d) due to its amorphous phase. The carbon acting as a lubricant during the milling process, carbon resides on the interfaces among Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 particles and hinders the particles agglomerate efficiently. After milling, the carbon can provide good electronic contact among the small ball-milled Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 particles, and also the small particle size shortens the path of Li+ diffusion and improves diffusion process of Li+. Of course, it is pronounced that planetary milling may be an effective approach to reduce the particle size of the active materials.

The capacity and cyclability of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes were characterized by galvanostatic charge and discharge tests at different rates at room temperature. Figs. 3 and 4 indicate charge/discharge profiles of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C at various rates. At a scan rate of C/20, Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C exhibited a specific capacity of 90.7 mAh g−1, while Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C possessed a capacity of 120 mAh g−1, which is close to the theoretical capacity 128 mAh g−1 of Li3Fe2(PO4)3. It corresponds to a quantity of 1.4 Li+ insertion per Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and 1.9 Li+ insertion per Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3 at C/20. The quantity of 1.9 almost approaches 2.0, the theoretical quantity of lithium insertion of per Li3Fe2(PO4)3. For Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C, two bi-phasic processes occurs at 2.85 and 2.70 V versus Li+/Li, as implied in Fig. 3. In the charge/discharge process, a specific composition Li4Fe2(PO4)3 exists. This is almost consistent with lithium intercalation Li3Fe2(PO4)3 within the two-phase domains Li3Fe2(PO4)3–Li4Fe2(PO4)3 (2.88 V vs. Li) and Li4Fe2(PO4)3–Li5Fe2(PO4)3 (2.73 V vs. Li) [10]. F o r Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C, two distinct plateaus are consistent with the insertion of two Li+ occurring at 2.82 and 2.69 V regions for Fe3+/Fe2+, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the corresponding peak of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple at 2.5 V [13,14] is not found in Fig. 4. It could be attributed to the much lower content of Ti than Fe and the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple at 2.5 V relatively close to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple at 2.7 V . Thus, the peak of the Ti4+/Ti3+ couple at 2.5 V and the peak of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple at 2.7 V may be combined to the peak at 2.67 V in Fig. 4. N e v ertheless, the plateau potential of Mn3+/Mn2+ versus Li/Li+ at 3.5 V is observed. It is found that the voltage difference between charge and discharge plateaus (C/10) for Fe3+/Fe2+ couple in Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode (0.02 V) is lower than that in Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode (0.10 V). These results may indicate that the coexistence of Mn with Fe at 4e sites improves the redox kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple, which proceeds a three-phase reaction in Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode.

This behavior is also confirmed by the cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C, Li3Fe1.9Ti0.05Mn0.05(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes as shown in Fig. 5. In the case of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C, there are two peak pairs, consisting of two anodic and two cathodic peaks, which correspond to insertion of two Li+ for Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple with peak voltage separation of about 0.17 V . While for Li3Fe1.9Ti0.05Mn0.05(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes, two pairs of redox peaks corresponds to insertion of two Li+ for Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple (peak I and IV centered around 2.83 V , peak II and V centered around 2.74 V). This agrees with usual values reported in the literature [16]. However, as shown in Fig. 5, the peaks of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple at 2.5 V and the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple at 2.7 V may be overlapped and thus the peak at 2.67 V is observed as explained above. This agrees with the results of Fig. 4. Furthermore, the reversible redox phenomena at 3.45 V for Mn3+/Mn2+ couple versus Li/Li+ in Li3Fe1.9Ti0.05Mn0.05(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes are observed. The peak voltage separation between the reduction peak (II) and the oxidation (V) for Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple in Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode is close to that in Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode. However, the Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode possesses the higher intensities of the reduction/oxidation peaks and higher electrochemical reactivity than Li3Fe1.9Ti0.05Mn0.05(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathodes, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. 

The capacity and cyclability of Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0–0.2) cathodes is demonstrated in Fig. 6. The Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.05–0.2) cathodes show higher discharge capacities at C/10 than the Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode, indicating that the Ti and Mn codoping enhances both the cyclic ability and electrochemical stability. Though the initial discharge capacity of the undoped sample is larger than that of Li3Fe1.6Ti0.2Mn0.2(PO4)3/C cathode at C/20, the discharge capacity decreased more sharply than that of the Ti and Mn codoped Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathodes. Namely, for the undoped Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode, the discharge capacities for the 1st and 5th cycles is 92.4 and 90.7 mAh g−1, respectively. So the discharge capacity retention is only 98.2%. However, for the Li3Fe2-xTix(PO4)3/C cathodes, in which x = 0.05, 0.10 or 0.15, the discharge capacities almost keep constant during the following cycles, e.g., the capacities of the 1st and 5th cycles for Li3Fe1.9Ti0.05Mn0.05(PO4)3/C cathode at C/20 is 108.4 and 109.6 mAh g−1, respectively, with the discharge capacity retention of almost 100%. The result shows that doping with a exact amount of Ti and Mn results in better reversibility and capacity retention. It is prominent that Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode shows high reversibility and good capacity retention. The initial capacity of the cathode at C/20 was 122.3 mAh g−1, which approaches its theoretical capacity of 128 mAh g−1. And a capacity of 90.8 mAh g−1 for the 20th cycle at a high rate of C/2 was achieved, which was almost equal to its initial capacity at C/2. Furthermore, Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode have better electrochemical performances than those of LiFePO4, reported by Padhi et al. [7]. The reversibility and the capacity retention of the samples with x = 0.15 or 0.2 are poorer than those of Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode. Too much Ti and Mn doping can induce large lattice distortion and phase instability. Fig. 7 exhibits three-cycle cyclic voltammogram of Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode at 0.1 mV/s. It is obvious that Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode presents high reversibility and good cyclability, indicating the higher electrochemical reactivity. This is consistent with the results of what in Fig. 6. There are two reasons explaining for the higher electrochemical reactivity of Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0.05–0.2) than that of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode. On one hand, during the discharge/charge processes, there exist the mixed valences of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple and Ti4+/Ti3+ couple. Ti3+ and Fe2+ could improve the electrical conductivity. So, the mixed valences result in an enhanced electrical conductivity for Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C cathodes (x = 0.05–0.2). On the other hand, the coexistence of Mn with Fe at 4e site reduces the active energy of the transporting Li+ and heightens the ionic conductivity of Mn doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode and improves the redox kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple. Similar phenomena are observed in the Mn doped LiFePO4/nano-carbon webs composite cathode [15]. Thus, cyclic performances of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 system are apparently improved through doping of a certain amount of Ti and Mn.

The structural and electrochemical properties of the monoclinic Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3/C (x = 0–0.2) composite cathodes synthesized by solid-state reaction route were systematically investigated. The prepared Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 cathodes mixed with acetylene carbon in planetary mill could reduce the sizes and increase the electronic conductivity of Li3Fe2−2xTixMnx(PO4)3 cathodes. The SEM images show that the sizes of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes efficiently decreased to improve the electrochemical performances. The galvanostatic charge/discharge test and the cyclic voltammetry (CV) indicate that both Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C and Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathodes showed two reversible redox phenomena upon of two Li+ (Fe3+/Fe2+ couple), at 2.8 and 2.7 V versus Li/Li+, while the redox phenomenon of Ti4+/Ti3+ couple at 2.5 V is not observed due to the low content of Ti and the disturbance of Fe3+/Fe2+. Furthermore, the plateau potential of Mn3+/Mn2+ versus Li/Li+ at 3.5 V is observed. V ery encouraging results were obtained: the Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode could achieve the specific capacity of 122.3 mAh g−1 approaching the theoretical capacity of 128 mAh g−1 for first cycling at C/20 and close to 90.8 mAh g−1 for the 20th cycle at C/2 and show better electrochemical activity than that of Li3Fe2(PO4)3/C cathode. The reason may be that the Ti doping results in an enhanced electrical conductivity for Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3/C cathode and the coexistence of Mn with Fe at 4e site improves the redox kinetics of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple.
