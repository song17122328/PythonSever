Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 (where x=0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3) lithium ionic conductors were prepared by Pechini process. Single NASICON-type phase was detected by X-ray powder diffraction analysis for all synthesized compounds. Ceramic samples have been sintered and investigated by impedance spectroscopy in broad frequency and temperature ranges. The dispersions of electrical parameters correspond to lithium ion migration in the bulk and possibly two different grain boundaries of the ceramics.

Li+-ion conducting solid electrolytes can be used in functional elements such as batteries or CO2 gas sensors. Ionic conductivity of solid electrolyte ceramics is the most important parameter for their application. Generally, ceramic materials are prepared for conductivity investigations. Their conductivity always consists of at least two components, the one is due to ionic migration in the grains of ceramics and is usually called “bulk conductivity” (σb), the other is due to ionic transport through grain boundaries (σgb). It is possible to separate both conductivities from wide frequency impedance spectra. lithium ion conductors, namely Li3xLa(2/3 − x)TiO3 (LLT or LLTO) [1–3], Li1 + xMxTi2 − x(PO4)3, where M is Al, Sc, Fe, Y (NASICON) [4–7], Li3N, and Li14ZnGe4O16 (LISICON) [7], have the highest σb (about 0.1 S/m at room temperature). Li3N compound has very low decomposition voltage (440 mV), LISICON compounds are generally difﬁcult to sinter and to obtain ceramics with high density, while LLTO and NASICON compounds are good candidates for applications. Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 were reported to have the highest ionic conductivity within the materials with NASICON-type structure [5]. Li1 + xAlxTi2− x(PO4)3 compounds were prepared by conventional solid state reaction [8–10], sol–gel process [11–13], and using Na–Li exchange in Na1 + xAlxTi2− x(PO4)3 [14]. Glass ceramics of these compounds have been sintered [15], ordinary ceramic sintering [8–13,16], or even spark plasma sintering [16] were

performed to obtain dense samples for impedance investigation. Slightly different values of the conductivities were found, according to our knowledge the highest bulk conductivity of Li1.2Al0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 ceramics of 0.48 S/m was found [10]. In order to obtain even higher conductivity of the ceramics some attempts were made creating more complex compositions like Li1 + yGe2 − x − yTixAly(PO4)3 [17], Li1 + x + yScxYyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 [18], or Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 [19]. In the present work we continue our investigation of the system Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 [20], but contrary to our previous study, using Pechini synthesis method now we managed to prepare pure single phase materials. We have found out the structure of the compounds and investigated electrical properties of the ceramics in the frequency range from 10 Hz up to 3 GHz.

Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3) solid electrolyte materials have been prepared by Pechini method. Firstly, about 0.5 g of metallic Ti (Alfa Aesar, 99%) has been dissolved in 40 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide (VWR BDH Prolobo) and 10 ml 35% ammonia solution (Fischer Scientiﬁc). Secondly, stoichiometric amounts of LiCO3 (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc., 99.997%) and Sc2O3 (KochLight-Laboratories LTD) were dissolved in HNO3 (VWR BDH Prolobo), while Al(NO3)3⋅9H2O (Merck, 98.5%) and NH4H2PO4 (Fluka, 99%) were dissolved in water. Prepared solutions together with 38.4 g of citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were added into Ti solution. After 30 min complexation, 25 g ethylene glycol (Fluka, ≥99.5%) was added and the solutions were dried at 100 °C. The obtained gels were heated at 350 °C, then ground and Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3

powders were obtained after heating at 900 °C. Finally, powder was pressed into pellets, ﬁrstly in a 3 mm die with 0.5 t load, thereafter isostatically (Top industrie) under 4000 bar. The sintering of ceramics was done in air at 1000 °C for 2 h.

Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 has also been prepared by solid state reaction from stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (Aldrich Chemical company Inc., 99.997%), NH4H2PO4 (Fluka, 99%), α-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), and TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%). This mixture has been milled in a planetary mill (Planetary Micro Mill Pulverisette 7, FRITSCH) using zirconia crucibles and 6 zirconia balls for 1 h. The mixture was pressed into pellet and heated at 450 °C for 24 h. The obtained material was ground and milled in a planetary mill, pressed into pellet and heated at 900 °C for 2 h. At the ﬁnal step the obtained powder was grounded and milled in a planetary mill, pressed into pellet and heated at 1000 °C for 2 h. The powder was uniaxially pressed (1 t on the 5 mm die) and thereafter pressed isostatically (Top industrie) under 4000 bar. Ceramics have been sintered at 1000 °C for 2 h in air.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in air at room temperature with Cu Kα radiation on a PANalytical X'pert Pro diffractometer equipped with the X'celerator detector in the 2θ range from 5 to 140 deg with step 0.017 deg (counting time 280 s/step). The powder has been sieved out through 63 μm mesh in order to avoid any preferred orientation of grains. Structure reﬁnement was carried out by the Rietveld method using Fullprof proﬁle reﬁnement program [21].

All the samples have been prepared in the shape of cylinder with sputtered Au electrodes for the electrical characterization by two-probe

technique. In order to be sure about the separation of electrode effects from the total resistance of the ceramics, one sample with a composition Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 has been measured by using four-probe technique. In addition Pt paste (GVENT Electronic Materials LTD) electrodes have been applied on Li1.3Al0.1Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 sample in order to see the inﬂuence of electrodes. Impedance spectroscopy studies have been performed in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 3 GHz and temperatures from 300 to 500 K. For the low frequency part (up to 2 MHz) twoand four-probe impedance spectrometer based on TiePie oscilloscope was used and for the high frequencies (from 106 to 1.5×109 Hz) coaxial line connected to Agilent E5062A network analyzer was used [22].

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) EVO 50EP (Carl Zeiss SMT AG) has been used to see the morphology of the obtained ceramics. The samples after the impedance investigations have been broken to observe the cross sections of the electrodes.

All the investigated materials show very similar XRD patterns. As an example, the spectrum of Li1.3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 1a). Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns has shown that the obtained materials belong to typical rhombohedral NASICON-type structure (Fig. 1b)). Phosphorus ions occupy tetrahedral sites in the structure, while titanium, scandium, and aluminium share the same octahedral sites. Octahedrons and tetrahedrons share oxygen atoms, which are situated at the corners, and in the following way form solid framework. It was not possible to identify the positions of lithium from XRD, but it is known that Li ions can occupy two positions M1 and M2 in the framework [23]. Space group of the investigated compositions is R 3c and lattice parameters change according to Vegard's law (Fig. 1c)). No impurities were detected by XRD. Structure reﬁnement results are presented in Table 1.

The grain sizes of the obtained powders were calculated from XRD line broadening using Scherrer equation and are approximately 100 nm. We also compared XRD patterns of the prepared powder (the highest heating temperature was 900 °C) with the patterns of grounded ceramics (sintering temperature was 1000 °C), but no difference was found except that the reﬂection lines were narrower because of the grain growth. The density of Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 was determined from XRD (sometimes it is called “theoretical”) and is presented in Fig. 2. A linear decrease of “theoretical” density with increase of x can be observed, but the density of sintered ceramics has a maximum when x =0.15. The densities of the ceramics varied from 80 to 90% of the theoretical densities, which is a good result considering relatively low temperature used for sintering of the ceramics (1000 °C). The grain sizes of the obtained ceramics are in the

measured sample with Pt electrode. A big overlap of the low frequency spike with grain boundary semicircle in this case is probably due to penetration of Pt when it is heated at high temperature (800 °C). On the other hand sputtered Au electrodes inﬂuence the spectrum up to ~5 kHz only and the spectrum coincides with the spectrum of 4-probe sample until the ions are blocked at the electrodes (see Fig. 3b), which is zoom of Fig. 3a)). The values of total ionic conductivity of Li1.3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics with sputtered Au electrodes found from 2-probe measurements are very close to the values found from 4-probe measurements. The cross section of the measured sample with Au electrode is also shown in the insert of Fig. 3a). So we used sputtered electrodes for all other compounds to determine grain boundary conductivities precisely. An arc of bulk dispersion can be seen in the insert of Fig. 2b) and this part of the spectrum was not dependent of the electrode material.

All the data were ﬁtted to an equivalent circuit shown in the insert of Fig. 4 using ZView software. Four processes can be separated by using this analysis. The already mentioned spike in the low frequency range was attributed to the polarization of sputtered Au electrodes. At high frequencies the dispersion region can be attributed to Li+ ion relaxation in the grains of the ceramics. In the intermediate frequency range two dispersions can be seen. This is a little bit unexpected result, but both processes can be related to the different interfaces of the grains, namely the boundaries between grains and boundaries

A typical impedance spectrum in complex plain of Li1.3Al0.3 − x ScxTi1.7(PO4)3 ceramics at 300 K is shown in Fig. 3a). Blue open squares represent the spectrum of Li1.3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics with sputtered Au electrodes measured by 2-probe technique, green crosses show the spectrum of the same composition, but with annealed Pt paste electrodes, and red open circles show the spectrum, measured by 4-probe technique. The advantage of 4-probe measurement is that it gives us the spectrum where no blocking effect of the electrodes is observed. The effect of different electrodes can clearly be seen from the ﬁgure. The total resistance of the sample with annealed Pt paste electrodes can hardly be separated from the electrode effects. SEM image in the insert of Fig. 3a) shows a cross section of the

ions move. σb decreases when x (and lattice parameters) increases, which can be explained by different strength of bonds between lithium and oxygen in the framework as it was discussed by M.A. Subramanian et al. [25].

Single phase Li1.3Al0.3 − xScxTi1.7(PO4)3 (x=0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3) materials have been obtained by Pechini method. These complex compounds form typical NASICON-type structure with space group R 3c and their lattice parameters increase linearly with increase of stoichiometric factor x. Sputtered Au electrodes can be used to separate by impedance spectroscopy total ionic conductivities of the ceramics from the electrode processes or alternatively 4-electrode method should be used to determine σtot. The existence of two contributions to grain boundary conductivity is not fully understood yet, but both observed processes give the biggest contribution to σtot, which correlates with the obtained density of the ceramics. The dispersion at the highest frequencies was caused by the ionic motion in grains of ceramics. Bulk ionic conductivities cannot be directly related to structure parameters of the investigated phosphates.
