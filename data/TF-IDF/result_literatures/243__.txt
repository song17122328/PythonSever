In this work, NASICON-type (sodium superionic conductor) LiTi2(PO4)3 anode material was synthesized using sol–gel method, and carbon-coated using the carbonization of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). Several characterizing methods, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman analysis were used to study the physicochemical properties of the synthesized anode material. Based upon electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests, the electrochemical properties of the material were explored. The results showed that the carbon coating was capable of enhancing the electrochemical performance of LiTi2(PO4)3 material, whereas it did not affect the crystalline structure of LiTi2(PO4)3. The 3.13 wt% carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3 exhibited significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially the cycling and high-rate performance. Furthermore, the 3.13 wt% carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3 composite delivered the specific discharge capacities of 133.1, 125.6, −1 at the rates of 0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, 10 C, and 20 C, respectively. Moreover, 121.8, 118.7, 115.4, 106.7, and 90.5 mAh g the specific discharge capacity remained stable at 90% after 50 cycles at the rate of 0.2 C. On the whole, the obtained results noticeably suggest that LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon material can be used as an anode with promising application potential for nextgeneration lithium-ion batteries.

Due to the rapid development of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered promising energy storage systems that exhibit high energy and power densities [1–6]. Graphite anodes are commercially used in LIBs, as they are inexpensive, available in abundance, and stable. Nevertheless, the potential of graphite anodes (ca. 0.1 V vs Li) is highly similar to that of metallic lithium because metallic lithium separates out on the surface of aforementioned anodes during the charging process. Therefore, efforts have been made to search for promising insertion host anodes, and such insertion host anodes include TiO2 [7], Li4Ti5O12 [8, 9], LiCrTiO4 [10, 11], and LiTi2(PO4)3 [12]. In addition, since the interstitial and conduction channelsfollow the c-axis direction, where Li-ion can easily take up the interstitial sites, LiTi2(PO4)3 displays high ionic conductivity as a NASICON-type structural compound [13]. Based upon its superior characteristics, LiTi2(PO4)3 performs well in the area of solid-state electrolytes [14, 15] and anode materials [16–19]. The use of LiTi2(PO4)3 anode offers several advantages, including (1) the three-dimensional frame structure makes up for PO4 tetrahedral with TiO6 octahedral and viceversa, which is beneficial to rapid transportation of Li-ion; (2) prominent thermal stability during Li-ion insertion/extraction processes due to the presence of high bond strength of P-O covalent bonds; and (3) flat operating potential during the charging/discharging processes along with the insertion of two moles of lithium per mole of LiTi2(PO4)3 [20–22]. However, pure LiTi2(PO4)3 suffers from low electronic conductivity, which results in poor cycling stability and rate capability. In order to enhance the electrochemical performance, various carbon sources have been studied to modify LiTi2(PO4)3, and include glucose [21], phytic acid [23], phenolic resin [24], ethylenediamine (EDA) [25], polydopamine (PDA), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) [26]. For instance,

Aravindan et al. [22] synthesized LiTi2(PO4)3 using a modified pechini-type polymerizable complex method, followed by glucose pyrolysis treatment, which exhibited an initial dis−1 at a current density of charge capacity of 117 mAh g −1. Roh et al. [27] reported the fabrication of 15 mA g LiTi2(PO4)3/reduced grapheme oxide nanocomposite with a simple microwave-assisted one-pot procedure followed by calcination, which showed the discharge capacity of −1 at 0.1 C rate. He et al. [24] fabricated the Sn138 mAh g doped LiTi2(PO4)3/C on Ti sites using sol–gel method with phenolic resin used as the carbon source and reported a dis−1 at 0.2 C with aqueous charge capacity of 118.9 mAh g electrolytes.

However, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) is a supramolecule and consists of seven glucopyranoside units linked through α-1,4linkages, which is toroidal in shape with a hydrophobic inner cavity and a hydrophilic exterior [28]. Due to the special structure, β-CD has emerged as an ideal host material to accommodate various guest molecules, which can be applied to a wide range of areas, such as pharmaceutical industry, drug delivery, and catalysis [29]. Additionally, β-CD can provide porous carbon with high electronic conductivity during the sintering process at high temperature in an inert atmosphere [30]. In this study, LiTi2(PO4)3 anode material is synthesized using a facile sol–gel method, followed by carbon coating using the carbonization of β-CD.

Based upon a facile sol–gel method, followed by carbon coating process using the carbonization of β-cyclodextrin, the NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon (LTP@C) compound was prepared. All the reactants were of analytical grade and used as obtained without further treatments. In a typical sol– gel process, 6.80-g Ti(OC4H9)4 was introduced to 40-ml ethanol while being magnetically stirred till the solution turned homogeneous. Then, 0.39-g Li2CO3 (5% excess) was dispersed in a Ti(OC4H9)4/ethanol solution. Then, 3.45-g NH4H2PO4 and 3.84-g C6H8O7 were separately dissolved in 15-ml distilled water and successively introduced dropwise into the above solution. The solution was continuously stirred for 12 h in a water bath. Finally, the gel was formed and moved to a vacuum drying box, where it was dried for 12 h at 80 °C. The achieved gel precursor was fired at 800 °C for 8 h in flowing air to synthesize the pure phase LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP), which was then ball-milled for 3 h to mitigate aggregation. Subsequently, the LTP powder was fully mixed with β-cyclodextrin solution with a carbon content of 2, 5, 8, and 11 wt%, where 2, 5, 8, and 11 wt% were the theoretical carbon contents of LTP@C. Lastly, the mixture was dried to removethe water and calcined under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h to produce LTP@C nanocomposites, which were labeled as LTP-1, LTP-2, LTP-3, and LTP-4, respectively.

X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku SmartLab) equipped with Cu Kα radiation was used within the range of 10–80° to study the crystalline structure of the synthesized material. The carbon contents of the composites were analyzed using thermal analyzer (TGA 5500, TA instruments). The morphologies of the samples were observed using field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS Sigma 500). A transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai F30, 300 kV) was used to study the microstructure and lattice fringes of the composites. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha) equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source was used to ascertain the valence states and surface elemental compositions of the samples. The Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman imaging microscope (Thermo Scientific DXR2xi) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm using an argon ion laser at a laser power of 2 mW.

Based upon the two-electrode CR2032 coin cell, all the electrochemical characterization studies were evaluated. The active material, carbon black, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) were mixed in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 and then added to an appropriate amount of Nmethylpyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a slurry. The slurry was coated on an Al foil (25 μm thickness) that served as a current collector, and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Metallic lithium foil was used as the reference and counter electrodes. A microporous polypropylene membrane (Celgard 2500) was used as a separator in each cell. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6, which was dissolved in a diethyl carbonate (DEC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) mixture (1:1 vol./vol.). All cells underwent the assembly in an argon-filled glove box. In the case of various current densities between 1.5 and 3.5 V, the galvanostatic charging/discharging (GCD) tests were performed on a Land CT2001A battery test system. At ambient temperature, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were carried out using a CHI604D electrochemical workstation. The CV curves −1 within the were obtained at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s voltage range of 1.5–3.5 V. The EIS spectra were obtained with a 5-mV voltage amplitude within the frequency range of 100 kHz–0.01 Hz. The electronic conductivity of LTP@C and pure LTP electrodes were obtained via EIS method by using the same electrochemical workstation.

In short, LTP@C composites were fabricated using a facile sol–gel approach. The composites were coated with carbon from β-cyclodextrin carbonization with the carbon content varied to values of 0.92, 1.96, 3.13, and 4.21 wt%. The optimized synthesized LTP composite exhibited an initial specific −1 at the rate of 0.2 C and exhibited a capacity of 131.2 mAh g stable discharge capacity of 90% after 50 cycles. The LTP-3 −1 even at still exhibits high specific capacity of 90.5 mAh g the high rate of 20 C, which corresponds to 74.3% of the capacity achieved at 1 C. Therefore, the control of appropriate amount of carbon for the proposed composites is very important. The 3.13 wt% carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3, which exhibits remarkable cycling performance and rate capability, has the uniform carbon layer of 5 nm. The LTP@C composite is considered a prospective anode for next-generation anode materials to be used in LIBs due to its superior fast-charging capability and cycling stability.
