Preparations and physico-chemical characterizations of NASICON-type compounds in the system Li1+x IV(PO4)3 (AIV=Ti or Ge) are described. AlxA2 255)x Ceramics have been fabricated by sol-gel and cogrinding processes for use as ionosensitive membrane for Li+ selective electrodes. The structural and electrical characteristics of the pellets have been examined. Solid solutions are obtained with Al/Ti and Al/Ge substitutions in the range 0 20)x 20)0.6. A minimum of the rhombohedral c parameter appears for x about 0.1 for both solutions. The grain ionic conductivity has been characterized only in the case of Ge-based compounds. It is related to the carrier concentration and the structural properties of the NASICON covalent skeleton. The results conﬁrm that the Ti-based framework is more calibrated to Li+ migration than the Ge-based one. A grain conductivity of 10 255)3 S cm 255)1 is obtained at 25 14)C in the case of Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ti1 1)7(PO4)3. A total conductivity of about 6 2)10 255)5 S cm 255)1 is measured on sintered pellets because of grain boundary eects. The use of such ceramics in ISE devices has shown that the most conﬁned unit cell (i.e. in Ge-based materials) is more appropriate for selectivity eect, although it is less conductive.# 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Fast ionic compounds with 3D NASICON-type framework structures were discovered in the 70s and were synthesized and characterized essentially for energy storage applications.1,2 They are also promising materials as sensitive membranes, in sensor devices, because they present interesting selectivity properties. They were proposed for such applications in 19843,4 and tested for Na+ potentiometric measurements using Na1+xZr2SixP3 255)xO12,5 the optimized composition being x=2–2.2.6

In this way, investigations for lithium ion analysis were made more recently using Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 (where x=0.3 and x=0.5).7,8 However, the selecsuch NASICON-type Li+ ceramics tivity of against the interfering ions Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ (cations present in physiological media) is not su 129)cient for their use in Ion Selective Electrode (ISE) devices,7,8 in particular for biomedical applications. As sodium is the principal cation in biological ﬂuids, Na+ interference must be minimized for such applications.9

The NASICON crystallographic structure of IV(PO4)3 (AIV=Ge, Ti and Zr) was identiﬁed NaA2 in 1967–1968.10 The general formula of NASI(M0)n(M00)m[A2B3O12] CON-type compounds with n=0–1 and m=0–3.11 The structure can be described as a covalent skeleton [A2B3O12] 255) constituted of AO6 octahedra and of BO4 tetrahedra which form 3D interconnected channels and two types of interstitial spaces (M0 and M00) where conductor cations are distributed. The compounds crystallize with a rhombohedral structure in the R3C space group, but cell distortions leading to a monoclinic symmetry have been reported.1,2,11,12 The conductor cations move from one site to

[h=[H2O]/[A(OR)n], where A(OR)n=alkoxide] was used (h 25)400). In the presence of water excess, hydrolysis polycondensation reactions occur and colloidal precipitates are formed. Our procedure diers on three points from those described by Tohge et al.19 and Ando et al.,20 for LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ti1 1)7(PO4)3, respectively:

. a high hydrolysis ratio is used, . NH4H2PO4

for avoiding precipitation of TiO(PO4)2, is chosen, . and the product is dried by freeze drying to

Co-grinding powders Li2CO3 (Janssen1 99% pure) Al2O3 (Baikowski1 99.99% pure), TiO2 (Merck1 99% pure) and (NH4)2HPO4 (R.P.1 99% pure) were used as the starting materials. The stoichiometric mixtures were ground for about 100 h in ethanol with zirconia grinding balls. Then the dried powder was calcined for 2 h at 900 14)C and ground again. The last steps (calcination and grinding) were repeated twice as indicated by Aono et al.15

 Ceramic fabrication Powders were pressed into pellets. The used isostatic pressure was 2500 bars (sol–gel powders) and 3500 bars (co-ground powders). The shrinkage

another through bottlenecks of which the size depends on the nature of the skeleton ions and on the carrier concentration in both type of sites (M0 and M00). Consequently, the structural and electrical properties of NASICON-type compounds vary with the composition of the framework. For example in the compounds of general formula LiA0 IV(PO4)3, the cell parameters a and c x depend on the A0IV and A00IV cation size.13 The lowest unit cell has been obtained for LiGe2(PO4)3. For improving the Li+ selectivity of the ISE using Li-NASICON as ceramic membranes, we have undertaken to optimize the composition of such compounds with an unit cell more adapted for selective lithium exchange.

IV(PO4)3 compounds (with AIV=Ti or Ge) seem to be a good choice and, in the present work, a comparative study of such materials based on Ti and Ge is described. The morphological properties of the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis, the structure by X-ray diraction and the electrical properties by impedance spectroscopy. The materials have been fabricated mainly by a sol–gel process because the main advantage of such a route is the preparation of very reactive powders having good sintering capabilities. A comparison with a classical co-grinding route is made for Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 compounds. The characteristics of ion sensitivity and selectivity are reported in details elsewhere.9 In the present paper only main results concerning the selectivity will be mentioned and discussed.

Published results concerning such materials have usually related to materials prepared by a cogrinding method.13–18 The quality of samples (porosity and grain boundary phase) seems to play a conductive properties.15–18 major Therefore, a sol–gel method was developed for the preparation of Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 (x=0 and 0.3)7 and we have extended such a process for Gebased compounds. A detailed description of the preparation has been reported elsewhere7 and only the main steps are given below.

Sol–gel powders The reactants are titanium, germanium and aluminum alkoxides (Ti(OC4H9)4 Janssen1 99% pure, Ge(OC2H5)4 Strem1 99.99% pure and Al(OC4H9)3 Janssen1 97% pure) and lithium and ammonium salts (CH3COOLi+2H2O Strem1 98% pure and NH4H2PO4 Fluka1 >99% pure). The synthesis steps are given in Fig. 1. A high hydrolysis ratio

Physico-chemical Characterizations of Powders and Ceramics

Experimental The thermogravimetric analyser (T.G.A.) was coupled to a Netsch1 Simultaneous Thermal Analyser STA 409. The heating rate was 1 14)C min 255)1. The microscopic analysis was carried out by SEM (JEOL1 JSM 6400).

The powder speciﬁc areas were determined by BET (Micromeritics1 2100E1) using N2 as adsorbed gas, the samples being degased at 150 14)C.

The structural analysis was conducted with a Siemens1 D500  18)/2 18) diractometer using K 11)1 Cu radiation (l=0.15406 nm). The cell parameters were calculated with the soft Win-Metrics1 (Siemens).

High purity silicon was mixed with the powder sample as internal standard.

The crystallization temperatures of ceramics were determined by DTA (Setaram1 MDTA 85) with a heating rate of 10 14)C min 255)1.

Impedance spectroscopy (impedance analyser HP1 4192 ALF) was used for the electrical characterizations. The frequency range was 13 MHz– 5 Hz and the voltage amplitude was 100 mV. The measurements were performed under a primary vacuum between 200 and 25 14)C on pellets covered with Au blocking electrodes which were deposited using an Edwards1 Coating System E 306A evaporator.

The nature of the alkoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4 or Ge(OC2H5)4) modiﬁes the morphology of the raw powders (LiTi2(PO4)3 or LiGe2(PO4)3) (Fig. 3). Figure 4 represents the thermogravimetric results. Below 150 14)C, a 7% weight loss for both types of product is attributed to residual solvent evaporation (alcohol and water). At higher temperature, a faster and more signiﬁcant weight loss is observed for LiGe2(PO4)3. The high hydrolysis susceptibility of transition metal alkoxides is well known21 and because of the high hydrolysis rate this might explain a ﬁner grain size of LiTi2(PO4)3 compared
Structural properties The crystallization temperatures of the sol–gel materials have been studied by thermal analysis. They are identiﬁed by an exothermic peak on the diagrams and are given in Table 3. The aluminum doping causes a signiﬁcant decrease in the crystallization temperature. It is due to the decrease in the melting temperature with the increase in the x value observed on Li1+xAlxGe2 255)x(PO4)3.14

The symmetry is rhombohedral with a R-3C space group. General results for the cell parameters reﬁnement (hexagonal unit) are summarized in Table 4 for Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3. They are in accordance with literature data for x=0.15,23

Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 samples were synthesized to a satisfying fraction of the theoretical density (85 to 93%). As can be seen from the X-ray diffraction analyses compounds Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ti1 1)7(PO4)3 elaborated either by co-grinding or by sol–gel seem to be single-phase materials.

The hexagonal unit cell parameters a and c of Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 6(a). The a parameter decreases with increasing the x values as has also been reported by Aono et al.15 The c parameter passes through a minimum at x=0.1 and then increases with x up to x 20)0.6, contrary to

Aono et al.15,16 who observed a decrease in the range 0 20)x 20)0.4. Aono et al.16 obtained single phase compounds for x 20)0.3 only. In the present results, Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 sol–gel samples are single-phase materials for 0 20)x 20)0.6. Such results may be attributed to the synthesis method, similarly to the synthesis of LiZr2(PO4)3 obtained in single phase only when it is elaborated by sol–gel route, as mentioned by Winand et al.13 For x=0.7, aluminum phosphates and oxides precipitate and splitting of some diraction peaks was observed. The latter has been attributed to a structure distortion due to a high doping rate (high x value). Aono et al.15 have also observed such a distortion when x exceeded the solubility limit of the doping cation in the LiTi2(PO4)3 phase. In that case the structure changes from a rhombohedral to a monoclinic symmetry.

Results were less satisfying with Li1+xAlxGe2 255)x (PO4)3 sol–gel samples due to the presence of a GeO2 precipitated phase regardless of the value of x. Moreover the samples were less dense (between 70 and 90%), without any correlation with the x value. The hexagonal unit cell lattice parameters are shown in Fig. 6(b). Our data are consistent with the literature ones for x=0.13,24 For x=0.7, the formation of aluminum phosphates was detected. Splitting of the (1-0-4) diraction peak was observed for 0 20)x 20)0.7. The resulting diraction line has been described in published works17 and indexed to the LiGe2(PO4)3 phase. However, not all authors have detected this eect.14 No

Fig. 5. X-ray diractograms of Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ti1 1)7(PO4)3: (a) cogrinding sample (sintered at 950 14)C); (b) sol–gel sample (sin-signiﬁcant variation of the a parameter as a function of x was observed on our samples. The variations in the c parameters were analogous to those found for the Ti-based compounds.

Such an explanation must be improved because for both types of substitution we have observed a minimum for x=0.1 and an increase of c for 0.1<x<0.6. Several phenomena play a determinant role in the inﬂuence of the cationic substitution on the structure.26 Such an increase could be attributed to the new occupancy of the conduction sites when the Al3+ doping (and consequently Li+ doping) takes place. During the substitution, the additional Li+ ions are localized in the M00 sites and this leads to a minimal occupancy of the M0 sites and consequently to a maximal repulsion along the c axis as in Na+NASICON materials.2 Our results seem to indicate that the M00 occupancy is the principal eect in Li+-NASICON for the higher x values. This is contrary to the Li1+xAlxA2 255)x(PO4)3 results reported by Aono et al.15,16

Nevertheless it should be noted that regardless of the x value, the cell volume is lower for Ge-based compounds due to the lower ionic radius of Ge4+ compared to Ti4+. The cell volume decrease is about 6%. It is not very much changed by the Al/A substitution ratio as reported by Li et al.14

Electrical properties The total conductivity ( 27)T), i.e. grain and grain boundary system, was calculated from the total impedance value (RT) determined from the impedance diagrams (Fig. 7). Arrhenius plots are shown in Fig. 8 for Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ti1 1)7(PO4)3 elaborated by the two dierent processes. At room temperature,  27)T is 10 255)4 S cm 255)1 and 1.5 2)10 255)5 S cm 255)1 the coground and the sol–gel materials, respectively. Activation energies for the total ionic conductivity are 0.42 and 0.39 eV, respectively. As mentioned before, sintered co-ground pellets show a lower grain size than the sol–gel ones. Hence, the higher conductivity observed with the co-ground samples cannot be linked to an increase of the grain contact area which would lead to a decrease in the intergranular impedance.27 In the same way than Aono et al.17 explain their results, the lower conductivity observed with sol–gel pellets could be due to the intergranular precipitation of a dispersed phase invisible by X-ray diraction. In our results this product could be LiTiOPO4 which was identiﬁed by Raman scattering spectroscopy28 in the Li1+xAlxTi2 255)x(PO4)3 sol–gel compounds. A sample of the pure LiTiOPO4 phase was synthesized and does not present observable ionic conduction below 200 14)C.28 Furthermore in impedance spectroscopy, the depression angle  12) increases generally with the inhomogeneity. So, the higher  12) value material observed on sol–gel samples ( 255)20 14) compared to  255)13 14) on the co-ground pellets) could be due to the the grain presence of boundaries. No study on the correlation of the quantity of such a phase at the grain boundaries and the blocking eect on the total conductivity was made on those materials, because it would be too consequent and out of our ﬁeld of investigation

Table 6. Total ionic conductivity at room temperature and activation energy of the sol–gel materials (materials for ISE devices). Nevertheless it could be of a fundamental interest.

The total conductivity ( 27)T) and the activation energy (Ea) at room temperature as a function of the compositions of the sol-gel materials are given in Table 6. For Geand Ti-based materials,  27)T increases with the doping level and hence with the carrier concentration.ionic

by RC! 14)=1 at the top of the semicircles in the Nyquist diagrams) as generally reported for pure NASICON phases is higher than 105 Hz at room temperature. Thus, relaxation frequency observed on Fig. 7 is not characteristic of a pure fast conductor. The obtained electrical response is essentially due to blocking eects of the ionic conductivity at the grain boundaries. Therefore an attempt was made to examine the dierent electrical contributions separately. For Li1 1)1Al0 1)1 Ge1 1)9(PO4)3, the impedance diagram studied after subtraction of the low frequency part (relative to the electrode reaction) is shown on Fig. 9. It allows to determine Rg (grain impedance) and Rgb (grain boundary impedance). Arrhenius representations of 1/Rg, 1/Rgb and 1/RT are shown in Fig. 10. Activation energies were found to be 0.31 and 0.46 eV for the NASICON-phase conduction and the grain boundary, respectively. These results are in good agreement with these of Aono et al.17 who reported activation energy values of 0.38 and 0.46 eV for these types of conduction. Therefore, as mentioned by these authors, the total conductivity of such materials seems to be limited by blocking eects at the grain boundaries. Aono et al.15–18

have the Li3A2(PO4)3 phase on the porosity and have observed a correlation between the porosity of samples and their conductivity (with a porosity up to 30%).

Potentiometric sensors were fabricated with fast ionic compounds as selective membrane according to the following electrochemical cell: Ag 255)AgCl=LiCl 10 255)1 mol l 255)1=Ionic Conductor= Analyzed Solution==Ref: Electrode  133)SCE 134)

The selectivity properties of Li+-NASICON have been examined from the values of the potentiometric interference coe 129)cients (also named in the literature ‘potentiometric ion selectivity coe 129)cients’) KPot i;j where i is the primary ion and j the interfering ion. The coe 129)cients have been determined by the mixed solution method with a ﬁxed lithium level. Experimental part has been described

in details elsewhere.

It must be mentioned that the grain conductivity of the Li+-NASICON is higher for the Li1 1)3Al0 1)3 Ti1 1)7(PO4)3 membrane than for the Li1 1)3Al0 1)3Ge1 1)7 is 10 255)3 and (PO4)3 one 1.6 2)10 255)4 S cm 255)1, respectively). It appears clearly that the contraction has a positive eect on the selectivity and a negative eect on the conductivity. The optimal size for the selectivity is smaller than the optimal size for the conductivity by Li+, i.e. the mobility (the concentrations of mobile ions can be considered constant for the two compositions). Nevertheless this eect is not a disadvantage for the use of such membranes in potentiometric measurements, because the conductivity values are always very higher than the usual membrane ones. A conductivity of about 10 255)4 S cm 255)1 is confortable when it is compared to those of the usual potentiometric membranes (from 10 255)5 down to 10 255)12 S cm 255)1). For the proton interference, it was reported elsewhere that the interference process result principally hydroxide groups.31,32 The interference is essentially function of the composition and the synthesis method and not a function of the crystalline cell. It was remarked than the H+ interference is lower for the Li+-NASICON membrane than for the Na+NASICON one which is a compound based on silica involving silanol groups.

reactions with surface effects, caused by the presence of impurities which precipitate at the ceramic grain boundaries. These ﬁndings are in accordance with those reported by Aono et al.17 The results of the present study indicate that Li+-NASICON grain conductivity  27)g depends essentially on the carrier concentration for the Ge-based compounds. Furthermore, at a constant doping content (x),  27)g values of the Ti-based materials are greater than those of the Ge-based ones. Thus, the [Ti2P3O12] 255) skeleton seems to be better calibrated than [Ge2P3O12] 255) for Li+ motion. The Ge-based framework is too conﬁning for optimal lithium migration. Such phenomenon could be a disadvantage for electrochemical cells but not for potentiometric sensor devices.

The more positive point of such a study is that the more conﬁned unit cell is appropriate for selective behaviour in ISE devices, because the mobility of the interfering ion should be considerably lowered, more lowered than the Li+ one. So, the selectivity coe 129)cient against Na+ can be improved by a factor higher than one order of magnitude if the Ge-based material is chosen.

The sol–gel route has allowed the synthesis of ﬁne ceramic powders (0.2 to 0.4 mm in diameter). It leads to sintered materials of general formula IV(PO4)3 (AIV=Ti or Ge) having Li1+xAlxA2 255)x grain size considerably higher than those elaborated by the classical co-ground process.

Both types of substitutions (Al/Ti and Al/Ge) yield solid solutions in the range x=0.1–0.6. For x=0.7, aluminium oxides and phosphates precipitate. The variations of the cell parameters a and c (hexagonal unit cell) studied as a function of the doping rate x show that the a value increases with increasing cation ionic radius in the octahedral position (Al3+, Ti4+ or Ge4+), whereas the parameter c seems to be related to the conduction site occupation, i.e. the doping content x.
