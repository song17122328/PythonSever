In this paper, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with the NASICON-type structure was evaluated for the first time as a possible host structure of Co2+ for obtaining an inorganic pigment with violet color. The powders were synthesized by solution combustion synthesis using glycine (G) and urea (U) as fuels and different oxidizer-to-fuel (O/F) ratios when ammonium nitrate was used as an extra-oxidant. However, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technics showed that the as-prepared powders were amorphous, which is due possibly by the effect of fire retardant of the diammonium hydrogen phosphate used as a source of phosphate during the synthesis. The calcination temperature for the as-prepared powders was established using Differential scanning calorimetry and Thermogravimetry (DSC/TGA), which showed crystallization temperatures less than 900 °C. Therefore, the powders were calcined at 900 °C for 3 h and the formation of the NASICON structure was confirmed using XRD and FTIR. The morphology was evaluated using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the micrographs shown aggregated particles with irregular shapes. The optical properties of the inorganic pigments were studied using diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (Uv–Vis–NIR) spectroscopy, which showed that the band gap of the samples was Eg,indirect = 3.13 eV for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and Eg,indirect = 3.17 eV for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. For this reason, the band gap of the system does not depend on dopping with Co2+ for the concentration used. Thus, the mechanism of color is due to electronic transitions in DMSO-d6 orbitals with octahedral coordination for Co2+ in NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. TSR (total solar reflectance) between 700 nm and 1800 nm were 95.94% for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and 81.41% for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. These results show that the pigments could be potential candidates for the application as cold pigments.

Inorganic pigments are materials used since prehistory to give color to another substance with the aim of decoration or protection [1]. Nowadays, it is of great importance to modify the optical properties of the plastics, paints, ceramics, cosmetics, cement, and wood, among others using particles of inorganic pigments, which present processes of scattering and absorption when interacting with the electromagnetic radiation.

Recently, it is of scientific and technological interest to investigate for new inorganic violet pigments because traditional pigments are obtained with high concentrations of cobalt, which has exposure limits in humans [2] such as on Co3(PO4)2. In recent years, alternative violet pigments have been prepared using different methods of synthesis, for example: Mg2-xCoxSiO4 synthesized by sol-gel synthesis [3], Co2-xMgxP2O7 obtained by co-precipitation route [4], CoZr4(PO4)6 prepared by solid-state reaction and sol-gel synthesis [5] and Nd2Si2O7 synthesized by co-precipitation method with different precipitants [6]. However, there is still interest in finding others inorganic violet pigments.

The NASICON structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was obtained for the first time in 1993 using the sol-gel synthesis [7], its structure is formed by tetrahedra of PO43− that share all their vertices of oxygen with octahedra of TiO68− forming a covalent [Ti2(PO4)3]- skeleton, which accommodates the Mg2+ cations in octahedral coordination within the M(1) sites with rhombohedral R-3c. Also, the NASICON structure Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with rhombohedral crystal structure and space group R-3c was synthesized by the hydrothermal method where the Co2+ cation is in octahedral coordination within the M(1) sites [8]. However, the optical properties of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 doped with Co2+ has not been reported.

The method of synthesis by solution combustion (SCS) has been used since 1987 [9] to obtain simple and complex oxides with different properties, such as magnetic properties of Fe3O4 [10], electrical properties of calcium phosphates [11], optical properties of Sr3Al2O6 co-doped with Yb3+ and Pr3+ [12], catalytic properties of Co3-xFexO4 in methane combustion [13] and TiO2:Pt for photocatalytic application [14]. SCS employs a self-sustaining exothermic reaction of oxidation-reduction between a fuel and an oxidant that allows reaching high temperatures in short reaction times with a simple experimental assembly [15]. SCS has also recently been used in the synthesis of inorganic pigments, such as: red perovskites of YAl1-yCryO3 [16], blue spinels of Mg1-xCoxAl2O4 [17], brown-green spinels of Fe1-xCoxCr2O4 [18], green spinels of Ni1-xFexCr2O4 [19] and green spinel of ZnCr2O4 [20].

For the first time, this work offers a systematic investigation of the host structure NASICON of composition Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 when Mg2+ is substituted by Co2+ to obtain a NASICON-type Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 inorganic violet pigment synthesized by solution combustion.

The host structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and the inorganic pigment Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 with NASICON-type structure were synthesized by solution combustion using glycine (G) (NH2CH2COOH, Alfa Aesar, 100% of purity) and urea (U) ((NH2)2CO, Merck, 100% of purity) as fuels and magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2 - prepared in the laboratory), titanyl nitrate (TiO(NO3)2 - prepared in the laboratory), cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2*6H2O, Baker, 99% of purity), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, Merck, 99% of purity) and nitric acid (HNO3, Scharlau, 65% w/w) as oxidants, and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4, Scharlau, 99% of purity) was used as a source of phosphate. The use of glycine and urea as fuels is due to the fact that it is known that they are readily available and relatively cheap. On the other hand, the stoichiometric composition of the metal nitrates, the ammonium nitrate and the fuel was calculated using the total oxidizing and reducing valences of the oxidizer (O) and the fuel (F) which serve as numerical coefficients for stoichiometric balance so that the equivalence ratio (O/F) is unity, therefore, the energy released is at a maximum [21]. According to the concepts used in propellant chemistry, the elements C, H, Mg, Co, Ti are considered as reducing elements with the corresponding valencies +4, +1, +2, +2 and + 4 (or valency of the metal ion in that compound), respectively. The element oxygen is considered as an oxidizing element with the valency −2. The valency of nitrogen is considered to be zero [9]. Accordingly, the oxidizing and reducing valencies of the compounds used in the combustion mixtures can be calculated by

A mixture is said to be stoichiometric when the oxidizer/fuel molar ratio is unity (O/F = 1), fuel lean when O/F > 1, and fuel rich when O/F < 1 [9]. Using the equation (1) with O/F = 1.0 in the synthesis of NASICON-type Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the fuel quantities were 0.77 moles of glycine and 1.17 moles of urea.

For a typical synthesis, 4 g of the host structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was synthesized as follows. First, the titanyl nitrate was obtained from titanium (IV) isopropoxide (Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, (Alfa Aesar, 95% of purity, density of 0.995 g cm−3), for this 6.124 mL of titanium (IV) isopropoxide using a micropipette (Transferpette S) were mixed with 20 mL of distilled water under vigorous stirring at 4 °C during one hour to obtain titanyl hydroxide. Then, the titanyl hydroxide was mixed with 5 mL of nitric acid in solution to obtain the titanyl nitrate according to the chemical reaction previously reported by Patil [9], while the magnesium nitrate was obtained with the reaction of 0.2073 g of magnesium oxide (MgO, Carlo Erba, 99% of purity) and 5 mL of nitric acid in solution. The nitrates were mixed with distilled water under constant stirring, And then, 4.0752 g of diammonium hydrogen phosphate was mixed with 5 mL of nitric acid in solution in order to avoid precipitation of phosphates. Finally, 0.5940 g of glycine was used as fuel with O/F = 1 ratio. The mixture was slowly evaporated at 90 °C until the gel was formed. Then, the gel was slowly heated until there was a flameless reaction with high amounts of gases emitted. The as-prepared powder was calcined at 900 °C during 3 h. Others reaction mixtures were made using ammonium nitrate as extra-oxidant to change the O/F ratio (1 mole of NH4NO3 for O/F = 1.1; 2 moles of NH4NO3 for O/F = 1.2 and 3 moles of NH4NO3 for O/F = 1.3) with the aim of increasing the temperature. The previous procedure was also used with urea as fuel with the same O/F ratios. Also, all the experiments with glycine and urea as fuels and O/F (1.0, 1.1. 1.2 and 1.3) using NH4NO3 were used in the synthesis of Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3.

Crystalline phases were determined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Philips equipment using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with a 2θ between 5° and 75°. For the identification of the phases were used the High Score Plus software and the – International Centre for Diffraction Data (JCPDS – the number of the card) ICDS 2011 database. The infrared spectra were recorded from 400 cm−1–4000 cm−1 using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR, Shimadzu IRAffinity-1S) with attenuated total reflection (ATR) and a maximum resolution of 0.5 cm−1.

The thermal behavior of the as-prepared powders after combustion was followed by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a Shimadzu TGA-50 model and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Netzsch 404 F1 Pegasus. The samples were placed in a platinum crucible and heated with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 between 25 °C and 1000 °C, under the flow of 20 mL min−1 of nitrogen atmosphere with the aim to study the crystallization temperature.

The surface morphology of polycrystalline samples of the inorganic pigments was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Carl Zeiss, Evo MA10).

Analysis of diffuse reflectance Uv–Vis–NIR and colorimetric coordinates CIEL*a*b* of the pigments were performed on a Uv–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer Cary 5000 (Agilent, USA) with a spectral range between 200 nm and 1800 nm using an integrating sphere (DRA - 1800) with a sphere diameter of 150 mm. Colorimetric data were measured by combining object spectral data with data representing a CIE standard observer of 10° and a CIE standard illuminant D65 (daylight). In this method, L* is the lightness axis [black (0) - white (100)], b* is the blue (−) and yellow (+) axis, a* is the green (−) and red (+) axis. The chroma is C*ab = ((a*)2 + (b*)2)1/2, as is described in the standard practice ASTM E308 [22].

The ASTM standard number G173-03 (ASTM G173-03, 2003) is used to calculate the TSR in the wavelength range from 700 nm to 1800 nm. The function TSR is given by(2)where R(λ) is the spectral reflectance measured from the experiment and Eλ is the solar spectral irradiance got from ASTM standard G173-03 [23].

Fig. 1a–b show the XRD patterns of the as-prepared powders obtained by solution combustion using glycine (G) and urea (U) as fuels, and varying the oxidant-to-fuel (O/F) ratio for the host structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, and when is doped with Co2+. The presence of an amorphous “halo” around 2θ = 27° was observed in all the powders, which indicates the formation of amorphous phases due to low temperatures in the reactions even with the addition of the ammonium nitrate as an extra-oxidizing, this is due to the flame retardant effect that occurs when diammonium hydrogen phosphate is used [24]. The thermal decomposition of diammonium hydrogen phosphate releases phosphoric acid and pyrophosphoric acid resulting in flame inhibition. Thus, the oxidizing atmosphere is reduced, which causing changes in the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio and in turn, requires an appreciably higher temperature for the ignition of the combustion reaction [25], so the heat of the combustion reaction is low for obtaining the NASICON-structures Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. These observations of amorphous phases in the as-prepared powder after combustion are similar to the results reported by Vijaya et al. in the synthesis by combustion of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 with NASICON structure [26]. The increase of ammonium nitrate in the mixture of reaction, although it does not allow to reach the temperature for the formation of the desired phase, there seems to be an increase in the degree of crystallization which is due to the slight increase in temperature that occurs during the reaction.

Fig. 2a–b show the FTIR spectra of the as-prepared powders, in all the as-prepared powders of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2a) the vibration modes of -OH at 3672 cm−1 and 3743 cm−1 corresponding to adsorbed water in the powders because the powders were stored in a humid atmosphere. Typical absorption bands of the vibration modes of methyl symmetric C-H stretching at 2977 cm−1, methyl asymmetric C-H stretching at 2897 cm−1 and the mode of vibration methyl symmetric C-H bending in 1399 cm−1 [27] are in all as-prepared powders less in the powders of NASICON-type Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2b) when the glycine was used as fuel which indicates that the reactions of combustion depend on fuel and of the nitrate present in the precursor. The PO43− have Td symmetry, and nine internal modes are distributed as Γd = A1 + E + 2F2. The free PO43− tetrahedra belongs to the Td group. The vibrations of this group are symmetric stretching vibration ν1(A1) = 938 cm−1, symmetric deformation ν2(E) = 420 cm−1, antisymmetric stretching vibration ν3(E) = 1020 cm−1 and antisymmetric deformation vibration ν4(E) = 567 cm−1. All the fundamentals are Raman active, but only ν2(E) and ν4(E) are active in the infrared [8]. FTIR spectra show stretching vibration with a broadband around 1055 cm−1 of PO43− in the powders of NASICON-type Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2a), while in the powders of NASICON-type Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2b) is present in approximately 960 cm−1. These infrared spectra are common for amorphous phases with overlapping bands. Therefore, the presence of organic matter points indicates that the temperature was not high enough to pyrolyze the excess organic matter, which indicates the low temperatures of the combustion reactions.

Fig. 3a–d shows the thermal analysis of the as-prepared powders with O/F = 1.0. In the case of the Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 using glycine as fuel (Fig. 3a), the TGA curve shows a first mass loss of 9% between 25 °C and 150 °C with a small endothermic band in DSC, which is associated with the loss of water adsorbed by the sample. In the region between 150 °C and 500 °C, there is a mass loss of 8% with a small band endothermic around 400 °C. This can be attributed to the decomposition of the organic matter present in the sample. Finally, in the region between 500 °C and 1000 °C there is no loss of mass, but there is an exothermic band with a peak temperature in approximately 770 °C, which corresponds to a process of crystallization. Whereas on Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 using urea as fuel (Fig. 3b), the total mass loss was of 17.5% with a crystallization temperature around 770 °C. For Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 3c), using glycine as fuel there is an exothermic process of crystallization very sharp at 778 °C being the most pronounced of all. Finally, the powder of Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 3d) using urea as fuel shows a crystallization around 770 °C, this is due to that the combustion with urea is less intense than with glycine, leaving more carbon or organic matter in the powder as was evidenced by FTIR. The results indicate that the calcination temperature for the formation of the NASICON phase is higher than 800 °C. This is according to the previous report of the synthesis of NASICON-type Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 by the sol-gel technique where the crystallization began at 766 °C [7].

Fig. 4a–b show the XRD patterns at room temperature of the calcined powders at 900 °C for 3 h. It is observed that the main phase of the host network Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with Rhombohedral structure (JCPDS 01-082-0297) and space group R-3c is present in all the samples, but there is a secondary phase of TiP2O7 (JCPDS 038–1468) with strong peaks around: 2θ = 22.5°, 2θ = 26.9° and 2θ = 27.7° which decreases when the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio is increased, this is due to the differences in the amorphous as-prepared precursors, because the conditions of reaction with ammonium nitrate increase the temperature of the reaction [9,15]. Zao et al. [28] synthesized the NASICON structure with composition of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 by sol-gel and found the same mixture with the impure phase of TiP2O7 which was associated with the intrinsic disorder of the structure where the Mg2+ ions are able to occupy the positions of Ti4+ in the three-dimensional structure of NASICON in a statistical way [7], but the Ti4+ does not occupy the M(1) sites in the structure. It is interesting to look that NASICON-type structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 4a.) shows the formation of the desired phase with low presence of the TiP2O7 as secondary phase when the as-prepared powder using glycine as fuel and with O/F = 1.3 was calcined. The effect of the formation of the substitutional solid solution Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 4b.) shows the formation of the desired phase with low presence of the TiP2O7 phase only when the as-prepared powder using glycine as fuel with O/F = 1.3 was calcined, which present the influence of the amorphous phase in the process of crystallization of the NASICON phase.

Fig. 5a–b shows the FTIR spectra of the powders calcined at 900 °C for 3 h. In all spectra are the characteristic bands for stretching mode of PO43−group around 956 cm−1, 1049 cm−1, asymmetric stretching mode of ν2 = 644 cm−1 and asymmetric stretching mode of ν3 = 1089 cm−1, also there is a band of TiO6 of stretching mode in ν2 = 644 cm−1 for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. Similarly, these bands are present in all powders of NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. This spectral behavior is reported in NASICON structures [29].

Fig. 6a–h show the SEM micrographs of the pigments obtained at 900 °C and 3 h for the NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 which show the formation of mixture of aggregates with plate shape and agglomeration of primary particles of irregular shape, which is due to the evolved gases during the combustion reaction [30], there is no noticeable change in the microstructures of powders when different oxidizer-to-fuel ratios and fuels were used.

Fig. 7a-p. show the digital images of the calcined powders at 900 °C for 3 h with colors: white Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and violet Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3.

Fig. 8 a–b. show the Uv–Vis–NIR spectra of calcined pigments at 900 °C for 3 h of NASICON-type Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. There is a very strong absorption band centered around 320 nm associated with electronic transitions of O2−(2p6) →Ti4+(3d0) [8]. It is very interesting to look that the shape of the Uv–Vis–NIR diffuse reflectance spectra of the powders is similar for the oxidizer-to-fuel (O/F) ratios studied being higher than 90% between 420 nm and 1800 nm, which indicates that during the synthesis process in the crystallization of the pigments there is no an effect of the microstructure in optical properties of the powders, since the dispersion of the electromagnetic radiation depends on the scattering centers such as pores, secondary phases, particle's surface and grain boundaries.

Diffuse reflectance Uv–Vis–NIR spectra showed diffuse reflectances higher than 60% between 800 and 1800 nm for Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 8b) with electronic transitions of d-orbitals for Co2+ in octahedral coordination around 537 nm of (4T1g(F) → 4T2g(P)), in approximately 660 nm for (4T1g(F) →4A2g), a spin-forbidden band around 840 nm and other around 1576 cm−1 (4T1g(F) → 4T1g(P)) [31].

The band gap values were estimated from Uv–Vis diffuse reflectance spectra using the Tauc's plot α(hν) = B(hν - Eg)n, with n = 1/2 for an indirect allowed transition (plotted as α(hν)1/2 versus hν) or n = 2 for a direct allowed transition (plotted as α(hν)2 versus hν), α is the absorption coefficient, B is the absorption constant, ν is the ligth frequency (s−1), Eg is the band gap (eV), h is the Planck's constant (J.s) and the Kubelka-Munk function F(R) = (1-R)2/R, where R is diffuse reflectance, (with F(R) ≈ α, for practical purposes) were used [32].

Until now, the authors did not find reports about the type of transitions in Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, therefore, the Fig. 8 shows the band gap values estimated using n = 2 and n = 1/2 for direct and indirect allowed transitions, respectively. The band gap energies were determined by the intersection of the horizontal axis and the tangent line to the absorption curve at the inflection point with the following values: Eg,direct = 3.36 eV and Eg,indirect = 3.13 eV for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, Eg,direct = 3.34 eV and Eg,indirect = 3.17 eV for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. It is worth noting that the band gap of the samples does not depend on dopping with Co2+ for the concentration used. Thus, the mechanism of color is due to electronic transitions in DMSO-d6 orbitals of Co2+ when is in octahedral coordination in Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3.

Solar radiation consists of 5% Uv radiation, 43% visible radiation and 52% near-infrared radiation. The pigments with colors can absorb a lot of visible radiation and reflect little radiation. Therefore, we focus on their near-infrared reflectance, and the main near-infrared radiation region ranges from 700 to 1800 nm, within which the most of solar energy lies [33]. Thus, calculating the TSR using ASTM G173-03 between 700 nm and 1800 nm for the samples synthesized using glycine as fuel and O/F = 1.3 were 95.94% for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and 81.41% for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. These results enhance the use of the pigments as potential candidates for the application in cold pigments.

The color coordinates CIEL*a*b* of calcined pigments at 900 °C are shown in Table 1. The samples of NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 are white with low negatives values of a* (green) and b* (blue). The powders for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 are violet color with positive values of a* (red) and negative value of b* (blue) due to absorption of visible light for Co2+ in octahedral coordination, whereas the lightness L* value is less than the host structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. It is important to note that the chromatic coordinates of the calcined powder with (O/F = 1.0, G) are L * = 64.20, a * = −5.99, b * = −3.47 and the chroma = 6.92 of the structure Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 do not show an appreciable change with respect to the fuel type and the O/F ratio, the low chroma indicates that all the powders are achromatic white, which shows that there is no absorption of light in the visible region, it can be used as a host lattice for chromophoric cations, as is the case of Co2+. On the other hand, the chromatic coordinates of the powders that correspond to Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 show significant changes with respect to the fuel and O/F ratio. As an example, the mean of a * = 4.3 and b * = −16.9 coordinate for the pigments obtained with glycine and a * = 5.8 and b * = −14.6 for the pigments synthesized with urea. There is a clear effect of the kind of fuel in the color of the powders. Also, the chroma of the powders shows differences when O/F is changed, for example using glycine in O/F = 1.0 is 18.9, but with O/F = 1.2 is 15.2 which is due to changes in the microstructure of the powders.

The results show that there is no change in the colorimetric coordinates when increasing the oxidizer-to-fuel ratio, which indicates that the dispersion properties of light in the visible have not been varied by the microstructure of the powders, neither changes in the valency and not coordination of the cation.

Inorganic violet pigments Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 were synthesized by solution combustion for the first time using glycine and urea as fuels, and with different ratios oxidizer-to-fuel using ammonium nitrate as extra-oxidant with the aim of increasing the temperature of combustion reaction, but XRD and FTIR showed that the as-prepared powders were amorphous in all experiments, which is due to low temperature of combustion reaction for the presence of ammonium phosphate, because is a fire retardant. Therefore, there is an incomplete combustion. The thermal analysis for as-prepared powders with O/F = 1 showed that crystallization temperature for obtaining NASICON-type Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 is around 770 °C. Inorganic pigments showed diffuse reflectances higher than 60% between 800 nm and 1800 nm for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3, and the band gap of the samples were Eg,indirect = 3.13 eV for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and Eg,indirect = 3.17 eV for Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3, which show that the band gap of the samples does not depend on dopping with Co2+ for the concentration used. Thus, the mechanism of color is due to electronic transitions in d orbitals of Co2+ in octahedral coordination for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. The CIEL*a*b* color coordinates of NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3 showed that calcined powders are violet with values in the red (+) and blue (−) axes of the CIEL*a*b* system, and with less lightness than host structure, but there is a clear effect of the kind of fuel and O/F ration in the color of the powders. SEM images showed a microstructure with agglomerates. TSR between 700 nm and 1800 nm for the samples with O/F = 1.3 and glycine as fuel were 95.94% for NASICON Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and 81.41% for NASICON Mg0.45Co0.05Ti2(PO4)3. These results enhance the use of the pigments as potential candidates for the application of cold pigments.
