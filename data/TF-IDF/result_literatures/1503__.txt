The arsenate(V) NaTi2[AsO4]3 has been synthesized by a solid-state reaction route using a salt ﬂux. Its structure has been solved and reﬁned from single-crystal X-ray data: NASICON-type, R¯3c, a = 8.8057(5), c = 22.2406(15) ˚A, Z = 6, wR(F2) = 0.0617 for 576 unique reﬂections and 30 variables. The NaTi2[AsO4]3 structure consists of a three-dimensional framework of corner-sharing AsO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra. The negatively charged [Ti2As3O12] framework gives rise to two different interstices. The Na+ cation is located on the 6b position with a trigonal antiprismatic coordination and enhanced anisotropic displacement parameters.

In the last three decades, complex oxides with formula AA 1) 3B2[XO4]3, where A are the general monovalent (alkali, Cu+, Ag+, . . .), divalent (alkaline earth, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, . . .) or trivalent (rare earth) cations, B trivalent (Fe3+, Er3+, . . .), tetravalent (Ti4+, Sn4+, Ge4+, . . .) or even pentavalent (Nb5+, Sb5+, . . .) cations, and X = As, Ge, Mo, P, Si have been widely studied. Besides the rich structural chemistry, the interest in these materials mainly concerns the remarkable electrochemical properties of selected oxides with potential application as solid electrolytes, gas sensors, or battery materials [1 – 8].

The NASICON structure of Na4Zr2[SiO4]3 was ﬁrst reported by Sizova et al. [9]. It is characterized by a three-dimensional framework of BO6 octahedra, sharing corners with XO4 tetrahedra and forming tunnels which may be vacant ( 1)4NbTi[PO4]3) [10], partially ﬁlled ( 1)1Na3Fe2[PO4]3 [11], Ag 1)3Ge2[PO4]3 [12],Sr0.5 1)0.5 1)3Zr2[AsO4]3 [13], Ca 1)3TiFe[PO4]3 [14], Pr0.33 1)0.67 1)3Zr2[PO4]3 [15]), or fully occupied by A and A 1) ions (Na4Zr2[SiO4]3 [9]). The A ions are sandwiched between two BO6 octahedra along the c axis giving rise to a trigonal antiprismatic coordination whereas the A 1) ions are 6or (6+2)-coordinated to the oxygen atoms depending on the composition [9, 11]. These few examples underline the rich crystal chemistry of NASICON-related materials.

During our recent salt ﬂux synthesis of arsenide oxides [16, 17] we obtained NaTiO[AsO4] [18] with LTCaTiO[SiO4]-type structure as a by-product. During the bulk synthesis of NaTiO[AsO4] a new arsenate(V), NaTi2[AsO4]3, was discovered. Its crystal structure is reported herein.

NaTi2[AsO4]3 was prepared by solid-state reaction from a mixture of arsenic (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999 %), titanium dioxide (Chempur, > 99.99 %) and a NaCl (Merck, > 99.5 %) / KCl (Chempur, 99.9 %) salt ﬂux (1 : 1 molar ratio) with a 2 : 3 : 10 molar ratio. The arsenic was puriﬁed by fractional sublimation [16]. The mixture was put in an alumina tube which was sealed under vacuum in a silica tube. The tube was heated at 500 ◦C for 12 h and at 850 ◦C for 48 h under controlled partial pressure of oxygen (KClO4). By decreasing the temperature at a rate of 20 ◦C/h to r. t. we obtained few colorless crystals of NaTi2[AsO4]3 (cubes),NaTiO[AsO4] (needles or octahedra) and KTiO[AsO4] (plates). NaTi2[AsO4]3 was then synthesized from a stoichiometric mixture of Na2CO3, NH4H2AsO4 and TiO2. The mixture was ﬁred at 400 ◦C for 6 h and at 750 ◦C for 48 h with intermediate grindings. The analysis of the obtained powder showed the presence of NaTiO[AsO4] beside the major phase NaTi2[AsO4]3. When one ﬁres the mixture at higher temperature (950 ◦C) the amount of NaTi2[AsO4]3 decreases in favor of NaTiO[AsO4].

Semiquantitative EDX analyses of many crystals including the one investigated on the diffractometer (Fig. 1) were carried out with a Leica 420i scanning electron microscope with Ti, InAs, MAD-10 feldspar (for K), and albite (for Na) as standards. The experimentally observed compositions were close to the ideal ones (NaTi2[AsO4]3, NaTiO[AsO4] and KTiO[AsO4]).

The polycrystalline sample obtained after dissolving the salt ﬂux in demineralized water was characterized by a Guinier pattern (imaging plate detector, Fujiﬁlm BAS-1800) with CuKα1 radiation and α-quartz (a = 4.9130, c = 5.4046 ˚A) as an internal standard. Taking the presence of two phases (NaTi2[AsO4]3 and NaTiO[AsO4]) into account, a full pattern matching reﬁnement was performed with the JANA2006 program package [19]. The background was estimated by a Legendre function, and the peak shapes were described by a pseudo-Voigt function. This allowed us to conﬁrm the biphasic mixture of the sample (Fig. 2). The reﬁned lattice parameters (R¯3c, a = 8.8191(3), c = 22.2749(7) ˚A and P21/c, a = 6.7288(5), b = 8.7820(4), c = 7.2583(5) ˚A, β = 114.961(4)◦) are in agreement with those obtained by singlecrystal diffraction for NaTi2[AsO4]3 and NaTiO[AsO4] [18], respectively.

A suitable crystal for X-ray diffraction was selected on the basis of Laue photographs on a Buerger camera (using white Mo radiation). The data collection was carried out on a Stoe IPDS-II diffractometer using MoKα radiation. Data processing and all reﬁnements were performed with the JANA2006 program package [19]. A Gaussian-type absorption correction was applied, and the shape was determined with the video microscope of the Stoe CCD camera. Details about the data collection and crystallographic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The extinction conditions observed for the NaTi2[AsO4]3 crystal agreed with space group R¯3c. The atomic positions of isotypic NaTi2[PO4]3 [20] were used as starting parameters. With anisotropic displacement parameters for all positions, the residuals converged to the values listed in Table 1. The reﬁned atomic positions and anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) are given in Tables 2 and 3.

As emphasized in Fig. 3, the NaTi2[AsO4]3 structure consists of a three-dimensional network of cornersharing AsO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra. The [Ti2As3O12]1− framework contains two interstices. The Na atom is found in a six-coordinated trigonal antiprismatic site formed by two faces of two TiO6 octahedra along the c axis with Na–O distances of 2.489 ˚A. This corresponds to the alkali ion position in NaTi2[PO4]3 [20], KTi2[PO4]3 [21] and RbTi2[PO4]3 [22]. The enhanced anisotropic displacement parameters (U11 = U22 = 0.0381(13) ˚A2) are indicative of sodium mobility as frequently observed in NASICON materials [8, and refs. therein]. The bond valence sum (BVS) of 1.08 is in good agreement with the value expected for Na+ (Table 4). A distortion is observed in the TiO6 octahedra, i. e. 3 × 1.883 and 3 × 1.967 ˚A. The average Ti–O distance of 1.925 ˚A is smaller than the value of 2.005 ˚A estimated from the effective ionic radii of six-coordinated Ti4+ and O2− [23]. Such short distances occur often in titanates with NASICON structure such as in LiTi2[PO4]3 (dmin = 1.880 and dmax = 1.976 ˚A) [21], CuTi2[PO4]3 (dmin = 1.896 ˚A and dmax = 1.958 ˚A) [24] or KTi2[PO4]3 (dmin = 1.886 ˚A and dmax= 1.933 ˚A) [21]. This explains the slight overbonding of the titanium with a BVS = 4.485. Due to this steric strain the anisotropic displacement parameters of the O1 oxygen atoms are enhanced (Table 3). The arsenic atoms are four-coordinated to oxygen atoms. The [AsO4] tetrahedra are quite regular with an average As–O distance of 1.668 ˚A which is lower than the value of 1.735 ˚A estimated from the effective ionic radii of four-coordinated As5+ and O2− [23]. The calculated BVS value 5.22 shows that the As5+ cation is also slightly overbonded.
