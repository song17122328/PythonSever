NASICON-related  phosphates  are  a  large  family  of  transition metal  compounds  with  a  AxBy(PO4)3 nominal  stoichiometry,  where A  is  usually  a  monovalent  or  bivalent  cation  and  B  is  a  tri-,  tetra-, or  penta-valent  state  [1–3].  The  NASICON  structure  is  built  up  by  a three-dimensional  framework  of  BO6 octahedra  and  PO4 tetrahedra  sharing  all  vertices  [4–6].  The  framework  has  vacant  octahedral sites  where  cations  A  are  located.  Two  kind  of  interstitial  sites  are commonly  named  as  M1 and  M2.  One  M1 site  per  formula  unit  is sharing  faces  with  two  adjacent  BO6 octahedra  along  the  hexagonal c-axis.  These  chains  are  mutually  linked  by  PO4 tetrahedra  sharing corners  with  BO6 octahedra.  In  addition,  three  M2 vacant  sites  per formula  unit  with  distorted  coordination  are  disposed  among  these chains  and  interconnect  with  M1 sites  [7,8].  The  occurrence  of  these interconnected  vacant  sites  and  multivalent  metal  ions  favors  the insertion  reactions  of  alkaline  ions  and  hence  have  been  regarded as  potential  electrode  material  for  lithium  batteries  [9–12].

Several  authors  have  reported  the  synthesis  and  structure  of ternary  phosphates  including  titanium  and  divalent  3d  transition metals  M2+ [13–16].   Research  on  M0.50Ti2(PO4)3 (M  =  Mn,   Co,  Fe, Cu)  reveal  that  M2+ cations  occupies  half  of  the  M1 sites  in  the Ti2(PO4)3 framework.  The  increase  of  ionic  radius  of  the  M2+ cation induces  an  elongation  of  this  octahedral  site,  involving  an  increase of  the  c  axis.

The  electrochemical  insertion  of  lithium  has  been  investigated in  related  compounds.  Thus,  Aatiq  et  al.  have  studied  electrochem≤ ical  lithium  intercalation  of  Mn0.5−xCaxTi2(PO4)3 (0    0.5)  [17]. Two  Li  ions  can  be  inserted  without  altering  the  phosphate  framework,  although  a  redistribution  of  the  divalent  cation  over  all  M1 sites  was  determined.  However,  results  on  the  behavior  of  these electrode  materials  during  an  extended  cycling  are  not  yet  reported. The  aim  of  this  work  is  the  study  of  the  electrochemical  performance  of  Mn0.5−xCoxTi2(PO4)3/C  composites  (x  =  0,  0.25,  and  0.5) series.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  these  electrode  materials  prepared  by  a  sol–gel  route  was   evaluated  in  lithium  cells  upon long  cycling.

Samples  with  the  nominal  stoichiometry  Mn0.5−xCoxTi2(PO4)3 were  prepared  by  a  single  precipitation  method.  For  this  purpose,  stoichiometric  amounts  of  Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O  (Panreac), Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O  (Panreac)  and  NH4H2PO4 (Aldrich)  were  dissolved  in  deionized  water.  Then,  5  mmol   of  citric  acid  was   added as  a  carbon  source  in  the  cathode  composite.  Eventually,  a  diluted solution  of  titanium  isopropoxide  in  ethanol  was  poured  to  reach the  ﬁnal  stoichiometry.  The  hydrolysis  provoked  by  Ti(IV)  cations produced  a  gel  which  was   vigorously  stirred  to  ensure  homogeneity.  After  the  solvent  evaporation,  the  solid  precursor  was  recovered and  ground.  The  so  obtained  precursor  was  eventually  annealed  at 750 ◦C  for  12  h  under  an  argon  atmosphere.  The  decomposition  of the  citrate  precursor  in  the  inert  atmosphere  yield  a  black  product due  to  the  presence  of  carbon  particles.  The  carbon  content  in  these transition  metal  phosphate/carbon  composites  was  determined  by

using  a  Elemental  CHNS  Eurovector  EA  3000  analyser.  Mass  percentage  values  ranging  between  3  and  4%  were  recorded  for  the studied  samples. The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  were  recorded  in  a  Siemens D5000  diffractometer.  The  samples  were  scanned  between  10◦ and  70◦ 2   degrees  by  a  step  scan  mode  (0.04◦ each  30  s).  Unit cell  parameters  were  calculated  using  Fullprof  software.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  images  were  recorded  in  a PHILIPS  CM-10  microscope.  The  chemical  state  and  compositions of  electrode  materials  were  analyzed  by  using  X-ray  Photoelectron  Spectroscopy  (XPS,  SPECS  Phobios  150MCD)  with  Mg   K  source ×   10−9 mbar.  Thin  ﬁlm  samples  were and  a  chamber  pressure  of  4  attached  to  holder  and  subjected  to  high  vacuum  overnight.  Eventually,  the  sample  holder  containing  the  degassed  sample  was transferred  to  the  analysis  chamber  for  XPS  studies.  The  outer  surface  was  grasped  by  using  an  Ar+ ions  gun  during  90  min.  Binding energies  were  referenced  to  the  C  1s  line  of  the  adventitious  carbon located  at  284.9  eV.  The  curve  deconvolution  of  the  obtained  XPS spectra  was  obtained  using  the  Casa  XPS  program.

The  electrode  materials  were  prepared  by  mixing  the  phosphate  sample,  carbon  black  and  PVDF  (polyvinylidene  ﬂuoride) in  a  80:10:10  ratio,  respectively.  A  slurry  was  formed  by  adding N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  which  was  subsequently  ball  milled  at 500  rpm  for  several  hours.  The  working  electrode  was   prepared by  pasting  the  mixture  on  a  9  mm  aluminum  disk  and  dried  at 120 ◦C  under  vacuum.  Cycling  performance  was  performed  using two  electrodes  Swagelok  type  cells  using  a  lithium  disk  (diameter of  9  mm)   served  as  a  counter  electrode.  The  electrodes  were  separated  by  glass  ﬁber  sheets  (GF/A-Whatman)  soaked  in  1  M  LiPF6 (EC:DEC)  acting  as  electrolyte  and  assembled  in  a  glove  box  under a  controlled  argon  atmosphere.  These  cells  were  galvanostatically cycled  between  1.6  and  4.2  V  at  several  C  rates  using  a  multichannel galvanostat  Arbin.  The  charge  and  discharge  rate  was   expressed  as C/n,   where  n  is  the  number  of  hours  needed  for  the  reaction  with  1 lithium  per  formula  unit  at  the  applied  current  intensity.

An  Autolab  PGSTAT12  system  was  used  to  carry  out  Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS).  For  this  purpose,  the electrode  was  assembled  in  a  three-electrode  Swagelok  type  cell using  a  lithium  disk  as  a  reference  electrode.  The  cell  was  cycled, stopped  at  the  end  of  the  nth  discharge  and  let  to  relax  for  at  least 12  h  to  achieve  quasi-equilibrium  system.  The  impedance  spectra were  recorded  by  perturbing  the  equilibrium  potential  by  an  AC voltage  signal  of  5  mV   which  was  applied  from  100  kHz  to  2  mHz.

Fig.  1  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  the  Mn0.5−xCoxTi2(PO4)3 samples.  The  structure  of  Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 is  isotypical  to  those  of Ca0.50Ti2(PO4)3 [18]  and  Fe0.50Ti2(PO4)3 [13]  being  indexed  in  the space  group  R-3.  Otherwise,  Co0.50Ti2(PO4)3 is  commonly  indexed in  the  R-3c  space  group  [19].  In  order  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  the different  ionic  radius  of  cobalt  and  manganese,  a  simple  ﬁtting  of trigonal  unit  cell  dimensions  (with  hexagonal  axes)  was   carried  out. The  cell  parameters  are  written  in  Table  1.  These  values  are  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  literature  and  progressively  increase according  to  the  larger  radius  of  manganese  (II)  ions.  Nevertheless, minor  peaks  were  present  as  impurities  in  the  cobalt  containing compounds.  These  signals  were  ascribed  to  Co0.50TiO(PO4)3.  In  fact,

the  difﬁculty  of  the  synthesis  of  these  NASICON  structures  as  pure phases  has  been  previously  reported  [20–22].

Transmission  electron  micrographs  revealed  well-crystallized particles  for  all  samples  (Fig.  2).  However,  smaller  particles  were

observed  for  the  cobalt  containing  sample.  Thus,  particles  mostly sizing  a  few  tenths  of  nanometers  form  aggregates  leaving  enough void  space  among  them  to  ensure  a  good  electrode/electrolyte  contact  for  the  latter  phosphate  sample.  Contrarily,  large  particles  were observed  for  the  manganese  sample.

Lithium  cells  assembled  with  the  electrode  materials  were  subjected  to  an  extended  galvanostatic  cycling  at  C/10.  Fig.  3  shows  the voltage  versus  lithium  content  plots  for  the  studied  samples.  A  signiﬁcant  contribution  to  the  overall  reversible  capacity  is  observed

in  the  low  voltage  region  as  a  quasi-plateau  at  ca.  1.7  V  for  cobalt containing  samples,  which  accounted  for  around  40%  of  the  total delivered  capacity  for  Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3.  On  the  contrary,  a  voltage drop  is  observed  for  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 at  the  lower  cut-off  voltage.  A shortening  of  this  feature  is  observed  upon  the  second  discharge. However,  its  contribution  to  the  total  capacity  is  still  observed  in the  second  cycle  and  will  be  discussed  below  on  extended  cycling. The  derivative  proﬁles  allowed  discerning  the  different  stages in  the  lithium  insertion  and  deinsertion  during  the  ﬁrst,  second and  tenth  cycles  (Fig.  4).  Previous  reports  on  the  electrochemical lithium  insertion  on  Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 upon  the  ﬁrst  cell  discharge have  evidenced  the  successive  ﬁlling  of  unoccupied  M1 sites  and then  M2 sites  [17].  Particularly,  lithium  insertion  in  M1 sites  is characterized  by  a  small  reduction  signal  at  ca.  2.9  V  and  its  oxidative  counterpart  at  ca.  3.1  V.  This  signal  shows  different  intensity depending  on  cycle  number  and  cobalt  content.  It  should  be  noted that  Aatiq  et  al.  [17]  found  that  similar  plateaus  in  Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 were  only  visible  after  prolonged  relaxation.  Thus,  kinetic  effects could  account  for  the  observed  changes  in  the  intensity  of  the reduction  peaks  in  Fig.  4.

Lithium  insertion  in  M2 sites  until  the  complete  reduction  of Ti4+ to  Ti3+ was   evidenced  by  the  appearance  of  several  reduction peaks  between  2.2  and  2.5  V.  For  Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3,  three  signals  at 2.5,  2.4  and  2.2  V  are  observed.  Based  on  neutron  diffraction  studies, Delmas  et  al.  [23,24]  have  described  the  M2 sites  as  large  cavities which  accommodate  different  tetrahedral  sub-sites  depending  on the  transition  metal  occupying  the  M1 site  and  the  distribution  of titanium  in  the  framework.  According  to  this  model,  the  reduction peaks  can  be  ascribed  to  the  lithium  insertion  into  these  subsites.  During  the  second  discharge,  the  intensity  of  the  peak  at  ca. 2.5  V  notoriously  decreases  for  Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3,  while  the  reduction  peaks  tend  to  coalesce  for  the  cobalt  containing  compounds. Finally,  the  changes  in  the  proﬁle  of  the  derivative  curve,  from  the second  to  the  tenth  cycle,  were  more  important  for  Co0.50Ti2(PO4)3 what  undoubtedly  will  have  a  strong  inﬂuence  in  the  electrochemical  performance  in  a  long  cycling.

For  Co0.50Ti2(PO4)3,  an  additional  reduction  signal  is  detected between  1.6  and  1.8  V  which  is  clearly  irreversible  in  the  subsequent  charge.  This  effect  is  observed  as  a  highly  broadened band  centered  at  ca.  2.0  V  during  the  ﬁrst  discharge  and  eventually  disappears  during  further  cycling.  Considering  the  Ti4+ to Ti3+ reduction  as  the  main  electrochemical  process,  an  excess of  charge  of  0.6  electrons  per  mole  was  recorded  at  1.6  V.  On decreasing  the  cobalt  content,  this  effect  is  shifted  to  a  low  voltage  value  as  observed  by  the  partially  recorded  signal  at  ca.  1.6  V in  Mn0.25Co0.25Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig.  4)  and  at  ca.  1.0  V  in  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (not  shown).  Similar  results  have  been  reported  for  Co0.5TiOPO4 [25]  and  Ni0.5TiOPO4 [26,27]  in  which  the  additional  reaction  with lithium  was  ascribed  to  the  M2+/M0 reduction.  The  feasibility  of this  reversible  reduction,  usually  named  as  conversion  reaction, has  been  extensively  researched  in  oxides  and  oxysalts  [28,29]. In  fact,  a  study  of  the  MnxCo3−xO4 series  as  potential  anodes revealed  capacities  of  400  mAh/g  and  a  decrease  of  the  cell  potential  for  the  transition  metal  reduction  when  cobalt  is  substituted  by manganese  [30].  Similarly  to  the  tendency  detected  in  these  phosphates.  In  order  to  explain  this  fact,  we  must  refer  to  the  Gibbs free  energy  change  ascribable  to  the  lithium  reaction  with  CoO (−347.01  kJ/mol)  and  MnO   (−119.17  kJ/mol).  According  to  these values,  equilibrium  potentials  of  1.798  V  and  1.032  V  can  be  calculated  for  the  cobalt  and  manganese  oxides,  respectively.  Similar changes  in  voltage  from  Co  to  Mn   phosphates  could  justify  the absence  of  any  reduction  signal  over  1.6  V  in  the  manganese  containing  compound.

there  is  a  change  in  the  Ni  oxidation  state  which  can  be  correlated to  the  appearance  of  new  phases  at  a  low  voltage  plateau  [31]. Ni2+ is  reduced  to  metallic  nickel  but  partially  oxidized  to  Ni+, on  the  subsequent  charge.  To  clarify  this  question,  Co  2p  XPS spectra  of  pristine  and  discharged  electrodes  of  Co0.50Ti2(PO4)3 were  recorded  (Fig.  5).  The  spectrum  of  the  pristine  materials is  characterized  by  large  bands  at  782.1  and  787.3  eV  which  are assigned  to  the  main  Co  2p3/2 transition  and  the  corresponding satellite  in  Co(II)  (Fig.  5a).  Additional  bands  at  797.9  and  803.9  eV

ascribable  to  the  Co  2p1/2 transition  conﬁrm  the  presence  of  cobalt in  a  divalent  state.  Minor  bands  at  778  and  794  eV  are  ascribed  to the  presence  of  CoP.  To  verify  this  result,  phosphorous  element was   also  analyzed  (Fig.  5b).  A  large  and  a  small  signals  appearing  at 133.8  and  129.5  eV,  can  be  assigned  to  phosphate  and  phosphide anions,  respectively  [32,33].   Therefore,  the  reducing  atmosphere created  by  the  carbothermal  reaction  probably  leads  to  the  formation  of  CoP.  The  fact  that  this  species  could  only  be  detected  by XPS  involves  the  presence  of  a  negligible  residual  amount  mainly located  at  the  particles  surface.  The  spectrum  of  the  discharged electrode  showed  an  increase  of  the  intensity  of  bands  at  ca.  778 and  794  eV,  reﬂecting  the  electrochemical  reduction  of  Co(II)  to Co(0).  This  result  allow  us  to  correlate  the  reduction  signals  at  ca. 1.7  V  and  the  corresponding  excess  of  charge  to  cobalt  reduction [30,34].

A  close  inspection  of  the  oxidation  signal  in  samples  charged from  different  lower  cut-off  voltages  evidenced  an  asymmetric  proﬁle  (Fig.  6),  indicative  of  two  components.  The  relative  intensity  of the  component  located  at  ca.  2.48  V  increases  when  the  cell  is  discharged  at  1  V  before  charging.  Hence,  we   can  ascribe  this  oxidation signal  to  the  reverse  process  of  the  conversion  reaction  undergone at  ca.  1.70  V  during  discharge  (see  Fig.  4).  Otherwise,  the  signal  at ca.  2.54  V  is  assigned  to  lithium  deinsertion.

The  analysis  of  the  XRD  patterns  of  a  discharged  Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 electrode  revealed  a  set  of  broadened  reﬂections  shifted  toward  low angles  as  a  consequence  of  the  lithium  insertion  (Fig.  7).  The  pattern  corresponding  to  the  cycled  (discharge  and  charge)  electrode shows  narrow  signals  at  2-␪   values  close  to  those  of  the  pristine material.  This  fact  evidences  the  reversibility  of  the  insertion  reaction  in  these  compounds.

The  extended  galvanostatic  cycling  of  lithium  cells  was  carried  out  at  C/10  (Fig.  8).  The  lithium  cells  for  Mn0.25Co0.25Ti2(PO4)3 and  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 respectively  delivered  132.5  and  124.1  mAh/g after  the  ﬁrst  discharge.  These  values  are  close  to  the  theoretical  lithium  insertion  of  two  ions  and  the  corresponding of  Ti4+ to  Ti3+ reduction.  In  contrast,  the  ﬁrst  discharge  for for  183.85  mAh/g  and  continuously Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 accounted  decreased  to  98.5  mAh/g  after  50  cycles.  Contrarily,  more  constant capacity  values  were  registered  for  the  manganese  containing  compounds.  Thus,  the  additional  capacity  provided  by  the  partially reversible  cobalt  reduction  is  progressively  lost  on  cycling.  This trend  is  also  observed  when  the  electrodes  were  cycled  at  several rates.  The  curves  displayed  in  Fig.  9  reveal  that  the  presence  of  manganese  effectively  contributes  to  reduce  the  polarization  between

charge  and  discharge  and  the  capacity  loss  expected  for  the  increase of  the  current  intensity  passing  through  the  cell.

Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  is  a  helpful  technique  to  understand  the  contribution  of  the  electrode–electrolyte interphase  impedance  to  the  migration  of  lithium  ions.  Fig.  10 displays  the  Nyquist  plots  obtained  from  previously  discharged three  electrodes  the  studied

electrode  materials.  Also,  a  second  spectrum  was  recorded  for  each sample  after  the  sixth  discharge  to  determine  the  effect  of  cycling on  the  cell  impedance.  The  spectra  are  characterized  by  two   overlapped  and  depressed  semicircles  at  high  and  medium  frequencies and  a  straight  line  at  low  frequencies.  The  semicircles  are  commonly  attributed  to  the  migration  of  lithium  ions  through  the solid  electrolyte  interphase  (SEI)  and  to  the  charge  transfer  (CT) at  the  electrode/electrolyte  interphase,  respectively  [35].  The  overall  impedance  of  the  interphase  could  be  inferred  from  semicircles diameter  at  the  horizontal  axis.  However,  more  accurate  resistance values  (RSEI and  RCT)  can  be  calculated  by  ﬁtting  the  spectrum  to  an equivalent  circuit,  as  described  elsewhere  [36].  The  values  are  written  in  Table  2.  The  cobalt  containing  compounds  reveal  a  slightly lower  RSEI than  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 after  the  ﬁrst  discharge.  In  turn,  a linear  increase  of  RCT is  observed  when  cobalt  is  substituted  by manganese.  The  lower  resistance  values  recorded  for  the  cobalt containing  compounds  is  a  factor  that  may   contribute  to  the  initially

Table  2 Electrical  resistance  of  Mn0.5−xCoxTi2(PO4)3/C  composites  as  calculated  by  ﬁtting their  impedance  spectra.

high  capacity  values  recorded  for  the  ﬁrst  cycle.  After  six  discharges, a  minor  increase  of  the  RSEI value  for  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 or  even  low values  for  the  cobalt  containing  phosphates,  evidence  the  efﬁciency of  this  passivating  ﬁlm  to  ensure  lithium  migration  on  cycling. Contrarily,  a  signiﬁcant  increase  of  the  charge  transfer  resistance is  determined  in  all  samples.  This  effect  is  more  pronounced  for Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and  may   justify  the  capacity  fading  observed  on  an extended  cycling  (Fig.  8)  and  for  cells  subjected  to  high  kinetic  rates (Fig.  9).

The  electrochemical  performance  of  the insertion reaction  has  been  evaluated  in  three  Mn0.5−xCoxTi2(PO4)3/C  composites,  being  x  =  0,  0.25,  and  0.5.  The  use  of  a  carbonaceous composite,  generated  upon  the  thermal  decomposition  of  a  citrate  precursor,  ensured  a  good  electrical  conductivity.  The  cell parameters  increased  when  cobalt  was   substituted  by  manganese as  expected  form  the  larger  ionic  radius  of  the  latter  one.

The  electrochemical  insertion  of  lithium  is  revealed  by  the  existence  of  several  plateaus  at  2.9  and  2.5  V.  The  numerous  reduction signals  observed  at  the  latter  voltage  region  reveal  the  complexity of  the  insertion  in  the  large  M2 vacant  sites  which  are  composed  by sub-sites  with  different  symmetry.  Moreover,  an  additional  reduction  signal  is  observed  at  1.6–1.8  V,  mainly  for  Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 which is  responsible  for  the  large  initial  capacity  recorded  for  this  compound.  The  signiﬁcant  changes  in  the  discharge  proﬁles  recorded for  Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3 can  be  correlated  to  cobalt  reduction.  The  partial reversibility  of  this  conversion  reaction  is  responsible  for  the  progressive  capacity  fading  for  this  compound.  Even  though,  capacity values  over  110  mAh/g  were  retained.

The  presence  of  manganese  led  to  good  cycling  stability  at  C/10 and  capacity  retention  at  high  kinetic  rates.  The  impedance  spectra showed  that  these  results  can  be  directly  related  to  a  high  stable electrode–electrolyte  interphase  which  avoids  a  large  increase  of the  charge  transfer  resistance  values  upon  cycling.
