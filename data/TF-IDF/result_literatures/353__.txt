In the years to come, all-solid-state Li or Na batteries1 are expected to replace conventional systems2 that still rely on flammable aprotic electrolytes. Ceramic cells may take advantage of highly flexible design possibilities if batteries with dimensions in the mm range are considered.3,4 Moreover, ceramic batteries are going to withstand higher temperatures than their analogous cells with liquid components.

For their realization, ceramic electrolytes with suﬃciently high ionic conductivities are, however, needed.5–9 The overall performance of NaSICON-type (Na SuperIonic CONductor) conductors10,11 has attracted renewed interest to study the influence of synthesis conditions and dopants on morphology and ion dynamics.

In contrast to LiTi2(PO4)3-based ceramics, including those in which Ti4+ is partly replaced by Al3+, LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) shows a much better stability against Li anodes. If in contact with a Li metallic anode LZP forms stable decomposing products, such as Li3P and layer-structured Li8ZrO6, that are able to conduct Li ions when present as thin layers. Importantly, this interphase also reveals suﬃciently good wetting properties with respect to both Li metal and the electrolyte.15 LZP crystallizes with diﬀerent structures, ionic conductivities sensitively depend on both the overall morphology and the defect chemistry involved. The ionic conductivity can be improved by incorporating diﬀerent metals such as Y3+, Sc3+, Al3+, La3+ or Ca2+; this strategy is usually accompanied by a stabilization of the rhombohedral structure.13,16–22 LZP is typically prepared at calcination temperatures of ca. 1173 K, the phase appearing under these conditions is denoted as the α-phase of LZP, which is subdivided in a orthorhombic form (α) and a monoclinic one (α′). 


Sample preparation LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) was prepared via a classic solid-state reaction by mixing stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (Sigma Aldrich ≥99%), (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma Aldrich ≥99.9%) with either ZrO2 (Sigma Aldrich ≥99%) or Zr(CH3COO)4 (= Zr(ac)4). The starting compounds were mechanically milled for 2 hours by using a high-energy planetary ball mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 7 Premium line) at a rotation speed of 400 rpm. We used ZrO2 beakers (45 mL), which were filled with 180 balls made of ZrO2 (5 mm in diameter). The subsequent calcination process was carried out in Al2O3 crucibles at 900 °C (heating rate 10 °C min−1) for 10 hours, where the decomposition of the hydrogen phosphate starts and initiates the reaction with Li2CO3. The resulting white powder was milled again for 2 hours at 400 rpm to guarantee a good contact between the particles. Finally, the mixture was pressed with 0.4 tons into pellets with a diameter of 5 mm. The pellets were filled into Al2O3 crucibles and sintered at 1150 °C (heating rate 10 °C min−1) for 20 hours. To incorporate Ca2+ into LZP we used CaCO3 (Alfa Aesar, >99%). An excess of 10 wt% Li2CO3 should compensate the loss of lithium during the high temperature heating process leading to Li1.4Ca0.2Zr1.8(PO4)3 (LCZP). For the synthesis of LZP (and LCZP) using Zr(CH3COO)4 we needed to prepare the acetate as follows.31 20 mmol Zirconium oxochloride (Sigma-Aldrich 99.99%) was dissolved under reflux in 100 mL of a mixture of MeCOOH (Sigma-Aldrich ≥99.5%) and Me(COO)2O (Sigma Aldrich ≥99%) (1 : 9). After the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, a white crystalline deposit appeared. Finally, it was filtered and dried at 60 °C under vacuum.


The sample obtained after the calcination process and the finally sintered product were characterized by X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRPD). We used a Bruker D8 Advance diﬀractometer operating with Bragg Brentano geometry and Cu Kα radiation. Diﬀractograms were recorded in air atmosphere and at room temperature covering a 2θ range from 20° to 100° with a step size of 0.02° (2 s per step). Rietveld analysis (X-PertHighScorePlus (PANanalytical)) was used to refine the diﬀraction data.

For the impedance measurements the sintered samples were equipped with gold electrodes by a sputtering process. Gold electrodes with a layer thickness of 100 nm were applied on both sides with a sputter coater (LEICA EM SCD 050) to ensure a good electrical contact. To avoid any influence of moisture, the samples were dried at 60 °C under vacuum prior to the impedance measurements.

Impedance spectra were recorded with a Novocontrol Concept 80 broadband dielectric spectrometer equipped with a BDS 1200 cell combined with an active ZGS cell (Novocontrol). We measured complex impedances over a frequency range of ten decades (10 mHz to 10 MHz). The temperature in the sample holder was varied from 173 K to 473 K in steps of 20 K; the temperature program was automatically controlled by a QUATRO cryosystem (Novocontrol). During the measurements a dry nitrogen atmosphere was build up around the sample in the cryostat to avoid any contamination with water and/or oxygen.


The Zr2(PO4)3 framework of rhombohedral NaSICON-type LZP consists of two ZrO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra sharing O atoms. The octahedral and tetrahedral units are alternating with the cations to form infinite chains parallel to the ternary axis of the structure.


To determine which capacitances C govern the responses P1 and P2, we used the equation for a parallel-plate capacitor for an estimation C = ε0εr A/d. Here ε0 represents the electric field constant (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), A the area and d the thickness of the sample. While the DC plateau (P2) at high frequencies is characterized by C = 1.2(1) × 10−12 F, for the plateau at lower ν we found C = 2.3(2) × 10−11 F. Therefore, the plateau associated with C in the pF range represents the bulk response, whereas P1 seen at lower frequencies is additionally governed by grain boundary contributions (g.b.) for which capacitances in the order of 10−11 F are typically expected.

In the Arrhenius plot of Fig. 4b, σDCT of the two plateaus P1 and P2 is plotted vs. the inverse temperature T. σDCT does not change when several heating and cooling runs were performed. The lines in Fig. 4b refer to fits according to σDCT (P1, P2) ∝ exp(−Ea/(kBT )); kB denotes the Boltzmann’s constant and Ea the corresponding activation energy. For LiZr2(PO4)3 prepared from ZrO2 we obtain Ea(P2) of 0.41(1) eV (in agreement with ref. 15 (0.40 eV) and ref. 25 (0.39 eV)), whereas for LiZr2(PO4)3, when using Zr(ac)4 as starting material, Ea increases to 0.44(1) eV (see Fig. 4b). At room temperature, the ionic conductivities of P2 are 3.6(2) × 10−5 S cm−1 and 3.4(2) × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. For the sake of clarity, in Table 1 all activation energies Ea are listed, the table also includes values referring to Li1+2xCaxZr2−x(PO4)3 (x = 0.1, x = 0.2) that has been prepared from ZrO2.

Unfortunately, by using Nyquist diagrams (see Fig. S3†), which show complex plane plots of the imaginary part Z″ of the complex impedance, Z, vs. its real part Z′, the faster relaxation process, corresponding to P2, cannot be resolved prop-


Instead, we used the complex modulus M″(ν) reperly. resentation46 to visualize the two processes, see Fig. 5a and 6 (Fig. 6b includes data for Li1+2xCaxZr2−x(PO4)3 prepared from ZrO2).

At suﬃciently low temperatures two relaxation peaks M1 and M2 appear (see the orange arrows in Fig. 5a). These peaks are separated by two orders of magnitude on the frequency scale. This distance on the frequency scale is comparable with the ratio of σDC,P2 : σDC,P1; thus, they refer, as is seen in Fig. 6 to the plateaus P1 and P2 governing σ′(ν). As expected the two electrical relaxation frequencies mirror the ratio in conductivities. The peak with the larger amplitude (M2) corresponds


In order to compare activation energies extracted from σDC(P1, P2) we determined characteristic electrical relaxation frequencies 1/τM using the modulus peaks of Fig. 5a. 1/τM refers to frequencies at which the peaks appear. A comparison of activation energies for selected compounds is shown in Fig. 5b; errors are, at least, in the order of ±0.01 eV.

As mentioned in the beginning, Ca2+ incorporation increases the ionic conductivity of LZP. Fig. 6b shows the change in σDCT (P1, P2) of Li1+2xCaxZr2−x(PO4)3 prepared from ZrO2 for x = 0, x = 0.1 and x = 0.2. Most importantly, while σDCT (P2), which refers to bulk ion dynamics, is only slightly aﬀected by x (Ea ranges from 0.41 eV to 0.43 eV, see Fig. 6b and Table 1 that also includes the prefactors), Ca2+ incorporation mainly reduces the g.b. resistance. We clearly see that σDCT (P1) is by two orders of magnitude larger than that of the sample with x = 0, see Fig. 6b. Most likely, the sintering process benefits from a Ca-rich composition, which helps reducing the blocking nature of surface regions of the Li1+2xCaxZr2−x(PO4)3 crystallites. For x = 0.2 we obtain σDC(P2) = 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 293 K. This value is only slightly lower than that of Li et al.15 (3.8 × 10−5 S cm−1) when samples are compared that have been prepared by conventional sintering. If pellets were fired by spark plasma sintering, bulk values of 1.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 were reported.15 It would be interesting to see, in coming studies, whether Ca2+, here acting as a sintering aid, segregates in the g.b. regions; such segregation would explain the finding that ion transport in the bulk regions is only little aﬀected by Ca2+ incorporation.

Careful inspection of σDCT (P1) reveals that, if the samples with x = 0.2 is considered as an example (Fig. 6b), a slight kink is seen for temperatures well above room temperature; the activation energy changes from 0.48 eV to 0.38 eV at higher T. Presumably, Ca2+ in the grain boundaries influences the Li+ arrangements in these regions. Li+ order/disorder phenomena might lead to such changes.

Importantly, we recognize that R1 passes through two maxima located at Tmax = 282 K and 492 K, respectively. In general, at Tmax the motional correlation rate 1/τc is related to ω0 via the relation τcω0 ≈ 1. The so-called motional correlation rate 1/τc is identical, within a factor of two, with the Li+ jump rate 1/τ.48,50 For R1ρ, this maximum condition changes to τcω1 ≈ 0.5.51 As ω0 and ω1 diﬀer by more than three orders of magnitude, we are able to characterize Li+ motional correlation rates in LCZP with values in both the kHz and MHz range.52

Here, we approximated the superposition of the two R1 rate peaks by a sum of two Lorentzian-shaped spectral density functions J (ω0, T ) ∝ τc/(1 + (ω0τc)β) according to the concept introduced by Bloembergen, Purcell and Pound (BPP) for 3D isotropic diﬀusion,53,54 see dashed line in Fig. 7a that follows the R1 rates. For each peak we used a single term to deconvolute the temperature dependence of the overall R1 rates measured, cf. the dashed-dotted lines in Fig. 7a, which will be discussed below. The rate 1/τc usually obeys the Arrhenius relation 1/τc = 1/τc,0 exp(−Ea/(kBT )); 1/τc,0 represents the preexponential factor that is typically identified as the “attempt frequency” of the jump process.55

In general, J (ω0, T ) is the Fourier transform of the underlying motional correlation function G(t′).48 If G(t′) is or can be well approximated with a single exponential, β equals 2. Values smaller than 2 are expected for correlated motion, which is, e.g., seen for cations exposed to an irregularly shaped landscape. In such a landscape short-ranged Li+ potential diﬀusion will be diﬀerent to long-range ion transport. In particular, forth-and-back jumps or, more generally speaking, localized motions will govern the rate R1 in the low-temperature regime, which is characterized by τcω0 ≫ 1. In this regime −β with (1 < β ≤ 2). β < 2 produces asymwe have J (ω0) ∝ τc metric rate peaks which are often found for structurally complex ion conductors with a non-uniformly shaped energy landscape. Ion dynamics in this regime are anticipated to be aﬀected by correlation eﬀects because of both structural disorder and strong Coulomb interactions of the moving ions.56 As the peak is asymmetric, the activation energy on this side of the peak, Ea, low, is lower than that of the high-temperature flank, Ea, high; the two values are linked to each other via Ea, low = (β(ρ) − 1)Ea, high. In the regime τcω0 ≪ 1, that is, on the high-temperature side of the peak, many jump events are sensed during one Larmor precession and the probability is high that also these jumps contribute to longitudinal relaxation which are characterized by higher activation energies. Usually, on this side of the rate peak R1(1/T ) long-range Li ion dynamics is sensed; in this limit we obtain J (ω0) ∝ τc.29

In the present case, approximating the rate peaks with a sum of two BPP-type spectral densities yields activation energies of Ea,1 = 0.210(5) eV and Ea,2 = 0.143(5) eV. As both rate peaks join up, information on β are diﬃcult to obtain. Here, the fitting routine yields β = 2 for the two peaks resulting in symmetric peaks with Ea, low = Ea, high = Ea,i (i = 1, 2). Note that the peak at higher T (i = 2) is only partly visible which influences the precise determination of Ea, high. We clearly recognize that Ea,i as determined from R1 SLR NMR turned out to be significantly lower than Ea obtained from σDC measurements describing bulk ion dynamics. The fact that Ea,i < Ea, DC shows that the number of jump events seen by NMR does not include all types of jumps needed for long-range diﬀusion. Obviously, the spin-fluctuations sensed by NMR are already suﬃcient to generate a full R1 peak. Thus, we conclude that the Li+ ions in LCZP are highly mobile on a short-range length scale while long-range ion transport is, however, characterized by much larger activation energies than 0.2 eV. This situation resembles that of Li+ ion dynamics in argyrodite-type Li6PS5I, which has been studied recently by our group.42 Here, we assume that rapid forward–backward exchange processes between the sites A1 and A2 might be responsible for the peaks seen in NMR spin–lattice relaxometry. A2 sites might be occupied in samples with x > 0. Here, especially the peak appearing at Tmax = 282 K for Li1.4Ca0.2Zr1.8(PO4)3 points to rapid (localized) exchange processes with residence times in the order of several ns. According to ω0τc ≈ 1 we estimate that at Tmax the jump rate should be in the order of 1/τ = 7.3 × 108 s−1 ≈ 109 s−1. A very similar behavior has recently been seen also for NaSICON-type Na3.4Sc0.4Zr1.6(SiO4)2PO4.

To complement our R1 measurements, we carried out spinlock NMR SLR measurements at a locking frequency of 20 kHz. As expected we detected a prominent spin-lock NMR peak R1ρ(1/T ) at much lower temperature than 492 K. A single peak appears at Tmax = 293 K. It turned out to be slightly asymmetric with an activation energy of Ea, high = 0.185(5) eV and Ea, low = 0.168(5) eV. At first glance we would say that the R1ρ peak might correspond to the R1 peak seen at Tmax = 492 K. Keeping, however, both the locking frequency of only 20 kHz and the rather low activation energy of 0.185 eV in mind, the R1ρ peak belonging to R1(1/T ) with Tmax = 492 K would be expected to appear at much lower temperatures than ambient. Even if we replace ω1 by an eﬀective frequency ω1, eﬀ (>ω1), which takes local magnetic fields into account that increase ω1, no satisfactory joint fit results that is characterized by the same Ea and the same τc,0 for the two peaks. Here, only unreliably high ω1, eﬀ values reaching the MHz range would result in a joint fit connecting the two peaks. Table 2 shows an overview of the results obtained from analyzing the three peaks individually by BPP-type spectral density functions. It also includes the amplitudes CNMR in R1(ρ) = CNMR J (ω0, T ). We see that the amplitudes of the two R1 rate peaks diﬀer by approximately one order of magnitude. Most likely, stronger quadrupolar relaxation governs the peak appearing at higher T. The corresponding prefactor 1/τ0 is relatively low, while that of the peak showing up at 282 K (1/τ0 = 5.9 × 1012 s−1) is consistent with frequencies typically expected for phonons.

The above-mentioned jump rate derived from SLR NMR at Tmax (1/τ = 7.3 × 108 s−1) can be converted into diﬀusion coeﬃcients with the help of the Einstein–Smoluchowski equation according to DNMR = a2/(6τ), which is valid for 3D diﬀusion.29 As an estimation, by inserting a = 6.3 Å, which is simply the shortest Li–Li distance, we obtain DNMR = a2/(6τ) = 4.8 × 10−11 m2 s−1. Assuming the interstitial sites A2 participating in exchange processes DNMR reduces to 1.8 × 10−11 m2 s−1. 


We used a conventional solid-state reaction procedure to synthesize NaSICON-type LiZr2(PO4)3 and investigated both its ionic conductivity and Li+ diﬀusivity by broadband conductivity measurements and NMR spectroscopy. Ca2+ incorporation helps prepare Li1+2xZr2−xCax(PO4)3 crystallizing with rhombohedral symmetry. While bulk ion dynamics is not influenced by the Ca2+ content, the grain boundaries in LZCP turn out to be less blocking for Li+ ions as compared to the sample with x = 0. We observed an increase in the low-frequency ionic conductivity by two orders of magnitude when 7Li increasing x from x = 0 to x = 0.2. For Li1.4Ca0.2Zr1.8(PO4)3 NMR relaxometry revealed rapid localized Li+ jump processes with activation energies of 0.21 eV and 0.14 eV. The diﬀusioninduced rate peak seen at 282 K points to a very high jump rate in the order of 109 s−1 at this temperature. On the other hand, 7Li spin-alignment echo spectroscopy confirmed that long-range of Li1.4Zr1.8Ca0.2(PO4)3 needs to be characterized by an activation energy of 0.41 eV as determined by variable-frequency conductivity measurements.
