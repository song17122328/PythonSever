High-resolution powder neutron diffraction data have been collected at room temperature on the triclinic a9 phase of LiZr (PO ) (HRPD, ISIS Facility, U.K.). Rietveld reﬁnement analysis (space group C1; Z 5 4; a 5 15.0718(2), b 5 4 3 8.8556(1), c 5 9.1234(1) A, a5 89.660(1), b5 123.912(1), g5 90.429(1)8) and Fourier difference maps have revealed the presence of monoclinic pseudo-symmetry 2 x, y, 1/2 2 z for all atoms but lithium, which is disordered over two sites Li1 and Li2 with occupancies 0.71(3) and 0.29(3), respectively. The ﬁnal agreement indexes are R 5 0.0672, wR 5 0.0919, 2R(F ) 5 0.0603 for 92 reﬁned parameters. Both Li1 and Li2 are in distorted tetrahedral coordinations, with kLi–Ol 5 2.09 and 2.18 A, respectively. Pairs of centrosymmetrical Li1 sites are located within half of the available M9 holes of the NASICON structure, which are split into two independent sets by triclinic breaking of symmetry. This accounts for the lower conductivity of the triclinic phase.

Within the family of NASICON-type ionic conductors, sodium-based compounds have been thoroughly investigated both from the structural and from the electrical point of view [1,2]. Much less is known about features of lithium phases, Li being a poor X-ray scatterer, and also because of difﬁculties in producing single

the detailed structural crystals with controlled and reproducible lithium content [3]. On the other hand, a full knowledge of the Li atomic environment is essential to understand the mechanisms of ionic mobility in these phases. Their importance in particular for applications to high temperature lithium batteries has been reviewed recently [4]. We have thus started a systematic investigation of such materials by high-resolution neutron powder diffraction. important system of

the family is LiZr (PO ) , which is known to exhibit a complex polymorphism. According to whether synthesis is carried out at 1200 or 9008C, two different phases

X-ray diffractometry (Siemens D500 apparatus, CuKa radiation, t(step) 5 4 s, D(2u) 5 0.028) proved the reaction to be complete, with no presence of the b9 phase described in Ref. [5]. At ﬁrst, the diffraction pattern could be indexed according to the same monoclinic unit-cell (space group C2/c) given in [3,5], but on closer inspection the hkl and hk1 reﬂections appeared to be split consistent with triclinic C1 symmetry, as reported recently [6]. The following unit-cell parameters were obtained, by least-squares reﬁnement of 48 d hkl values in the range 1.879 to 6.366 A: a 5 15.079(4), b 5 8.855(2), c 5 9.123(3) A, a5 89.7(1), b5 123.95(4), g5 90.44(5)8, in agreement with previous results [6].

Neutron diffraction data were collected, at room temperature, on the time-of-ﬂight High Resolution Powder Diffractometer (HRPD) at the ISIS spallation pulsed source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, U.K.). The 2 cm sample was contained in a vanadium can under vacuum. By use of the backscattering counter bank at 2u5 168.38, a full intensity proﬁle (4226 data) was recorded in the d range 0.7 to 2.5 A (12 h) with maximum resolution of Dd/d ł 4 3 10 , and a preliminary data reduction was performed, including merging of outputs from single counters in the bank and correction for detector efﬁciency as a function of neutron wavelength. Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out by the GSAS computer package [12]. The background intensity was modelled by a Chebyshev polynomial of ﬁrst kind with 12 coefﬁcients, and the peak shape by a convolution of a pseudo-Voigt function (linear combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian components, with s and g half-widths, respectively: sample contribution) with two back-to-back exponentials (instrumental and moderator contributions) [13]. Linear dependencies of the s and g parameters on d were assumed: s5 sd , g5g d . The mixhkl ing coefﬁcient and the full width of the pseudo-Voigt function depend on s and g according to equations given in Ref. [14].

By a ﬁrst analysis of the Bragg peak positions, the true unit-cell appeared to be unambiguously triclinic, as in the X-ray case. However, owing to the small distortion of the a and g angles from 908, at ﬁrst we attempted to reﬁne the structure in the monoclinic C2/c space group, with such angles constrained to be right. The atomic coordinates of the rhombohedral ¯R3c structure [3] were transformed into the monoclinic reference by [ 2 1/ 0/0 0 3] matrix 1 1 ] ] 2 2 multiplication followed by [ 0] translation; the 1 1 ] ] 4 4 symmetry centre at the 3 site corresponds to that shifted by [ to the centre conventionally chosen as origin in space group C2/ c. The reﬁnement converged to R 50.23, indicating that a monoclinic pseudo-symmetry was certainly present but the true structure was surely triclinic. Thus the twofold axis 2x, y, 2z was removed and the structure reﬁned in space group C1, omitting Li from the set of atoms in the unit-cell and using isotropic displacement factors. Convergence was attained at R 50.072, so as to conﬁrm the validity of the triclinic structural model. Subsequent Fourier difference maps showed the position of Li unambiguously as the strongest negative peak (the neutron scattering length of Li is negative, unlike Zr, P and O), located quite off the symmetry centre in a distorted tetrahedral environment. The corresponding Li1 atom was included in the reﬁnement, allowing its occupancy to vary. A value of o.f.50.76(9) was obtained, indicating some deﬁciency and possible disorder. Upon further examination of the Fourier difference map, a low negative peak was detected with acceptable crystal–chemical surroundings for Li. This second lithium atom (Li2) was reﬁned with the constraint of the sum of the two Li occupation factors being 1. The ﬁnal cycle converged to the agreement factors indicated in Table 1, with values of the unit-cell constants and of the atomic coordinates and isotropic thermal parameters reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The experimental, calculated and difference proﬁles are shown in Fig. 1.

An attempt to introduce and reﬁne anisotropic displacement factors failed, as some of them went non-positive deﬁnite and the R index hardly improved. The presence of some amount of Li disorder was conﬁrmed, although quantitative results concerning Li2 are affected by a large uncertainty, as these small effects contribute very little to the total scattering power. It should be stressed, however, that reﬁning successfully such a complex structure, with 57 independent atomic coordinates and the additional

The crystal structure of a9-LiZr (PO ) 4 3 is shown in Figs. 2–4, emphasizing the arrangement of PO 4 coordination tetrahedra and ZrO octahedra sharing corners. All atoms in the asymmetric unit (Table 2) have been arranged in pairs (without and with apex) related by the pseudo-symmetry operation 2 x, y, ] 2 z, except for P2, which lies slightly off the 1 2 pseudo-twofold axis itself, and for Li1 and Li2. The average shifts with respect to the exact 2 x, y, 2 z operation are 0.013, 0.020 and 0.012 for the x, y and z fractional coordinates, respectively, and are clearly signiﬁcant by comparison with the corresponding e.s.d.’s. This is conﬁrmed by comparing the corresponding bond lengths of pseudo-symmetrical P and P9 tetrahedra, and Zr and Zr9 octahedra (Table 3), which show meaningful deviations: cf., e.g., the P1–O2/P19–O29 and Zr1–O3/Zrl9–O39 pairs of bonds. Bond valences were computed according to the formula given in Ref. [17]: s 5exp[(r 2 r ) / ˚ 0.37], where r 51.617, 1.928 and 1.466 A for P–O, Zr–O and Li–O, respectively, and r is the individual bond length. The bond valence sums on P1,

arrangement of lithium only. We shall examine separately the surroundings of the primary Li1 and secondary Li2 positions over which lithium is disordered.

However, from the qualitative point of view only Li really violates the monoclinic symmetry of the structure, because neither Li1 nor Li2 have pseudosymmetrical companions, and they lie far away from the pseudo-twofold axis. Thus we can conclude that the slight triclinic distortion of the other atoms and of the unit-cell geometry is fully driven by the

In the monoclinic C2/ c derived ¯ conﬁguration, this site degrades to local symmetry 1 and multiplicity 4, with equivalent positions 3 ] 4 . In the triclinic C1 structure, the 0, 1 1 3 3 ] ] ] ] 4 2 4 4 become independent on sites at 1 1 ] ] 4 4 ¯ losing the twofold axis, each with local symmetry 1 and multiplicity 2: we shall denote them M91 and M92, respectively. Therefore, all octahedral holes ¯ must be either occupied by Li or empty in the R3c and C2 /c structures, while in the C1 case half of them only may be occupied, too. This is what happens in the structure of a9-LiZr (PO ) , where Li orders over half of the available octahedral cavities corresponding to the M92 sites, while holes surrounding M91 sites are empty (Fig. 2). However, in order to fulﬁl stoichiometry constraints two cen-

and Li2 sites. As for the M9 holes, half are occupied each by two centrosymmetrically-related Li1 sites, and the other half are empty. Therefore, a less favourable conﬁguration for lithium mobility is attained, with respect to that feasible for the hightemperature rhombohedral a phase, where all M9 holes are symmetry-equivalent and a disordered distribution of Li1 sites is expected. This is consistent with the observed trend of ionic conductivity for the a9 and a phases. A neutron diffraction study of a9-LiZr (PO ) above the transition temperature is in progress, and the results will be reported elsewhere [18].
