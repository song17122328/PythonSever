The potentiometric response of the Na+ ion selective electrode based on NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) as well as the impedance of the NASICON/solution interface have been measured in NaCl, LiCl and KCl aqueous solutions. The behavior of the NASICON was successfully explained on the basis of the Eisenman model which involves an ion exchange process between the membrane and the solution. The apparent ion-exchange densities and potentiometric selectivity coe 129)cients of the NASICON membrane have been determined for Na+, Li+ and K+ ions. The higher the apparent standard ion-exchange current density is, the better is the selectivity. However, no simple relationship can be established between these two parameters. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The NASICON of composition Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is a fast Na+ ion conductor [1]. It can be described as a lattice of tetrahedra (SiO4, PO4) connected to ZrO6 octahedra. The Na+ cations are located inside this lattice on stable sites. The number of positions to accommodate Na+ ions is larger than the actual number of cations. The NASICON was proposed as the sensitive membrane in a Na+ ion selective electrode (ISE) [2, 3]. This membrane was shown to be rather selective. coe 129)cients, K pot, The determined by steady-state measurements [4] and transient [5], were found to be in the range 0.06–5  2) 10 255)5 for K pot Na,Li and 3  2) 10 255)3–5  2) 10 255)5 for K pot Na,K.

In the present work, the kinetics of ion exchange at the NASICON/solution interface was investigated by impedance spectroscopy. This method was successfully used to study the behavior of an ion sensitive membrane [8]. In previous experiments [9, 10], it was shown that impedance measurements could be applied to study the NASICON/solution interface since the bulk and interfacial processes could be separated easily. The present study was focused on the impedance characteristics of the NASICON in contact with aqueous solutions containing alkali cations such as Na+, Li+ and K+. Speciﬁc attention was addressed to the aging of the interface and the determination of the mechanism of the interface. EMF measurements were also performed in parallel with the impedance measurements using the same operating conditions in order to see if a correlation between the

ion transfer at selectivity coe 129)cient and the kinetic parameters determined by impedance could be found as proposed by Xie and Cammann [11] on LaF3 and PVC based membranes.

The experimental details of the procedure for the NASICON sample elaboration have been described previously composition Na3Zr2Si2PO12 was synthesized by the sol–gel process. The ceramic pellets were obtained by isostatic pressing and sintering under air, at 10008C. Their density was of the order of 90% of the theoretical density. The purity of the sample and crystallographic structure were checked by X-ray diraction. The conductivity was determined by ac impedance spectroscopy. It is well known that sintered NASICON may show the presence of additional zirconia. Pure single phase NASICON and NASICON containing a small amount of ZrO2 were tested to see if the presence of zirconia could induce some behavior change. Before they were used, the samples were polished with successive waterproof silicon carbide papers and diamond paste down to 1 mm.

The membrane was mounted in a PVC tube with a liquid internal reference system as depicted in [4]. EMF values were measured with a Aries 20000 high impedance millivoltmeter (Radiometer-Tacussel). The external reference electrode was a saturated calomel electrode used with a junction. 0.1 M BaCl2 was used as the supporting electrolyte to ﬁx the ionic strength of the solution. Selectivity coe 129)cients were determined from the electrode potentiometric response in solutions containing cations of one type only (separated solution). Their values were obtained by identiﬁcation of the E = f(log c) calibration curve with the Nickolskii– Eisenman equation [12] taking into account the detection limit of the electrode. The separated solution was chosen because it corresponds to the experimental conditions of the impedance measurements. For comparison, the selectivity coe 129)cient was also determined by the mixed solution-ﬁxed interference method as recommended by IUPAC and proposed by Xie and Cammann [11]. For ﬁxed interference concentrations high enough with respect to the detection limit of the ISE, the value of the selectivity coe 129)cient was similar to that determined by the separated solution method.

A general form of the impedance diagram in 0.1 M NaCl is represented in Fig. 1. It is of one semi-circle for the single phase material and of two semi-circles for the NASICON containing zirconia. For the single phase material (Fig. 1A), the high frequency intersection of the semi-circle with the real axis corresponds to the total resistance of the membrane and the solution. The contribution associated to the conduction inside

found to mainly depend on the pretreatment of the NASICON, e.g. fresh or aged membrane. To precise this point, the interface resistance for a 0.1 M sodium chloride solution was measured as a function of the time on a membrane which has never been exposed to water. A typical result is reported on Fig. 2. Whatever the NASICON membrane, no interfacial resistance was evidenced at short time of exposure to 0.1 M NaCl solutions. The interfacial resistance increased slowly with time. A t 1/2 dependence was observed with a good accuracy. The capacitance was found to decrease with time. The decrease was not as high as the resistance increase.

The size of the surface interfacial semi-circle could be reduced by polishing the NASICON surface. With an old sample, the interfacial resistance was always evidenced. This indicates that the aging process involves a modiﬁcation of the NASICON surface. Ahmad et al. [13] have suggested that NASICON reacts with water. In a recent study [14], we have shown that all the NASICON samples react to some extent when they are in contact with water, due to the dissolution of secondary phase dispersed in the sample and soluble in water. This phenomenon might be also responsible for the variation of the interfacial resistance even if the real nature of the interfacial resistance increase is not clear as yet. To support this assumption, the behavior of a NASICON membrane in contact with aprotic solvent was also studied as a function of time. No variation of the interfacial resistance was noticed as a function of time in acetonitrile and propylene carbonalso conﬁrmed with the ate. This point was NASICON-polyethyleneoxide polymer interface [15].

The interfacial resistance was measured for different Na+ concentrations in water. As expected, the interfacial resistance decreases as the Na+ concentration increases. The plot of log R versus log c gives a straight line. Depending on the measuring conditions, the slope may be any value between 0.3 and 0.8. When the surface resistance is measured after one hour of exposure to the solution (no aging of the interface due to water), a slope of 0.5 is approximately obtained. Rhodes and Buck [16] also found that the Ag2S membrane depends on the square root of the external bathing concentration.

The interfacial capacitance does not vary with the sodium bathing concentration in water. It is of the order of 1 mF cm 255)2. This may indicate that it is mainly ﬁxed by the NASICON.

The characteristic parameters of the impedance 0 and y) have been determined by identiﬁ(Rint, Cint, ZW cation as a function of the nature of the cation and its concentration. The value of the resistance associated to the high frequency semi-circle was found to greatly depend on the nature of the cation in solution. In the concentration range 10 255)2–1 M, the resistance was observed to increase as the concentration of cation in the solution was decreased. The plot of log Rint versus log c gave almost parallel straight lines for Na+ and Li+ ions. The interfacial resistance could be expressed as Rint  136) R0c 255)a where cI is the concentration of I+ ions in the solution.

A similar relation has been observed by Xie and Cammann on PVC and LaF3 based ISE [11]. Typical values of R 0 and a are reported in Table 1. For all the sample tested, the resistances were always in the order R0 133)NaCl 134)<R0 133)LiCl 134)<R0 133)KCl 134):

The interfacial capacitance was almost independent of the cation concentration in solution. The values measured for the dierent cations are reported in Table 2. For a given sample, the observed capacitance was almost of the same order of magnitude whatever the nature of the cation. A slight increase was result conﬁrms that the interfacial capacitance seems to be rather linked to the NASICON membrane. It may be attributed to the double layer in the NASICON resulting from the non-uniform distribution of charge in the NASICON near the surface. However, with

The impedance was measured for different concentrations of Li+ and K+ in solution of ICl (I = Li or K). The diagrams were recorded after one hour of exposure in order to reach the steady state and minimize the eects of the aging process due to water, previously evidenced. A typical result is shown in Fig. 3. In addition to the semi-circle resulting from the interfacial resistance and capacitance, we observe for the Li+ and

The parameters of the low frequency straight line were studied as a function of the cation and its concentration in solution. The impe0 was found to be independent of the concendance ZW tration of the cations in solution but greatly dependent on the nature of the cations. The results of Table 3 show that the impedance ZW W 133)Li 134)<Z 0 Z 0 The y coe 129)cient was almost equal to 0.5 for the high concentration of K+ in solution indicating a Warburg type impedance. For Li+, the slope of the straight line was always lower than 458 and y almost equal to 0.2.

Brumleve and Buck [17] have calculated numerically the impedance response of a membrane with no anionic conduction, permeable to M+ and N+ cations, with biionic boundary conditions (i.e. M+ exchange on one side and N+ exchange on the other side). For a low rate of the interfacial process, the impedance plot shows an interfacial rate arc and a severely depressed Warburg like diusional arc as observed in the present work. This lead us to propose that the high frequency semi-circle could be due to the slow ion exchange at the interface and the low frequency straight line to the interdiusion of the cations inside the NASICON membrane. In the general case treated by Brumleve and Buck [17], no analytical expression of the impedance can be obtained. In order to obtain an analytical expression of the impedance system, we have

assumed that the NASICON could act as a supporting electrolyte for Li+ and K+, i.e. the variation of the electrical potential inside the membrane could be neglected. This assumption is likely to be valid since the concentration of mobile Na+ ions and mobility are high in the NASICON, i.e. Na+ are the majority carriers. With this approximation, the impedance response was calculated. The diusion was assumed to be linear with semi-inﬁnite boundary conditions. It leads to Eqs. (3) and (4) similar to those established for a redox system [18]. The interfacial resistance can be assimilated to the transfer resistance, Rt, given by Rint  136) Rt  136) RT F 2

R, T, and F have their usual meanings.

observed

 255)a. This shows that our impedance resistance varies as cI measurements may be explained by the Eisenman model [19] which is based on the existence of an ionic exchange equilibrium between the membrane and the solution. This is also in agreement with the ionic exchange properties of NASICON membrane previously evidenced [6].

According to this interpretation, the ionic exchange current density can be deduced from the interfacial resistance by i0  136) RT F

Comparison between the dierent cations shows that the ionic exchange currents at the NASICON/water interface are in the order i0 133)Na 134) > i0 133)Li 134) > i0 133)K 134): 0 . The The diusion coe 129)cient can be deduced from ZW comparison between Li+ and K+ shows that the diusion coe 129)cient of Li+ inside the membrane is almost ten times higher than that of K+ ions as expected from literature [1].

Fig. 4 compares the impedance spectra obtained in solutions of NaCl in water and NaCl in 0.1 M BaCl2. An additional capacitive loop appears at low frequencies in the presence of BaCl2. The interfacial resistance also increases while the interfacial capacitance is not modiﬁed signiﬁcantly. The low additional semi-circle is highly dependent on the Na+ concentration in the solution. The variations of its characteristic parameters are reported in Fig. 5. In the Na+ concentration range 10 255)3–1 M, the resistance is inversely proportional to  255)0.9. Concerning the cathe Na+ concentration RintAcNa pacitance, it obeys the relationship CintAcNa +0.9 in the Na+ concentration range 0.1–1 M. Below 0.1 M, the capacitance is approximately constant. It must be emphasized that in this concentration range, the determination of the capacitance is less accurate. The order of magnitude of the capacitance 0.1–1 mF cm 255)2 is typical of a ‘pseudo-capacitance’ [22].

Fig. 6 shows that the same type of impedance diagram is obtained with tetrabutylammonium bromide as the supporting electrolyte. Furthermore, stirring of the solution does not have any inﬂuence on the impedance. This allows us to suggest that the low semi-circle may be due to a limitation by the available sites partially blocked by the cations of big size such as Ba2+ and TBA+ on the surface, i.e. the Na+ transfer across the interface may occur through an intermediate adsorbed state (surface adsorption) as proposed by Farrington and Briant [20] to describe the mechanism of Na+ transfer across the b alumina/propylene carbonate interface.

The theoretical impedance can be calculated as proposed for a redox system in an adsorbed phase [18]. It leads to the equivalent circuit of Fig. 7, where the transfer resistance Rt, the adsorption resistance Rads and adsorption capacitance Cads can be expressed as Rt  136) RT F 2

selectivity can be evaluated by means of impedance analysis. This point has also been observed by Xie and Cammann [11] on LaF3 and PVC membrane and Masuda et al. [21] on a perchlorate ion-selective electrode. These authors have observed that the ratio of the ion-exchange currents of an interfering ion and the primary ion is numerically similar to the potentiometric selectivity coe 129)cient of the ISE. The ratio of the ion exchange current densities in the case of NASICON membranes are reported in Tables 4 and 5. They obey the same trend as the selectivity coe 129)cient but are not a numerical measurement of the selectivity coe 129)cient. On both samples, the exchange current ratio seems to be always higher than the selectivity coe 129)cient.

According to the mechanism proposed in the previous part, the ratio of the standard exchange current densities can be simply related to the ratio of the apparent standard rate constant of transfer by [14]

Experimental results have shown that the transfer coefﬁcient was almost the same for all the cations and close to 0.5. Thus,

According to Eisenman [19], the potentiometric selectivity coe 129)cient can also be expressed as a function of the exchange equilibrium constant and the mobilities of the cations inside the membrane uI and uNa accord-

where k 4 and k 3 are the rate constant of cation transfer from the membrane to the solution and from the solution to the membrane, respectively. k1 and k2 are the rate constant of adsorption of Na+ ions on the NASICON surface and desorption, respectively.

This shows that Rt, Rads and Cads vary with the Na+ concentration in solution, as observed experimentally for the high Na+ concentrations. From Eq. (11), an apparent exchange standard rate constant of transfer can be determined by identiﬁcation to Eq. (3). In that case k 0 I  135) represents the apparent standard rate constant of exchange in BaCl2 0.1 M.

ing to the following equation:

This shows that the relationship between the ratio 0(I)/i0 0(Na) and the potentiometric selectivity coe 129)cient i0 is not simple and involves the rate constants and the mobilities of the cations inside the membrane. In a recent publication [6], we have roughly estimated the exchange constant for a NASICON membrane by XRD and solution analysis. They were almost equal to unity. The present results could indicate that the rates of exit from the membrane are not controlled by the cation mobility only.

The potentiometric behavior of the NASICON/solution interface at equilibrium can be explained by the Eisenman model which is based on the existence of an equilibrium of ionic exchange at the interface. Impedance diagram analysis allows us to propose a mechanism of cation exchange between the solution and the NASICON membrane. This mechanism could be described by two steps: the ion transfer at the membrane/solution interface and interdiusion of the cations inside the material. In BaCl2, an additional adsorption step is suggested. The apparent ion-exchange current density determined by ac impedance varies in the same way as the selectivity and can be used for evaluating the selectivity of an ISE based on NASICON. Nevertheless, no trivial link can be established between the ratio of the ionexchange current densities and the potentiometric selectivity. The selectivity of the electrode can only be qualitatively evaluated by means of impedance analysis.
