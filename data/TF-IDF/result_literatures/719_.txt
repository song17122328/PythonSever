Solid electrolyte is the functional material in whichonly single ion species generally migrate as a charge carrierin solid.
This is quite different from a liquid electrolyte thatcations and anions conduct simultaneously.
Because of thisunique characteristic of selective ion migration, solidelectrolytes are expected to be applied to the various kindsof electrochemical devices such as chemical sensors andrechargeable batteries.
In the solid electrolyte field, it is widely accepted anidea that ion migration is highly influenced by the valencestate of the conducting ion species; the higher the valence ofthe conducting ion species, the stronger the electrostaticinteraction with counter ions surrounding the conductingspecies, and therefore, ions having high valence state isregarded to be poor migrants in solids.
As a result, while various kinds of cations have being discovered to conduct insolids, many researchers have paid great attention to thedevelopment of solid electrolytes whose conducting speciesare such as H+, Li+ and Na+ due to their smooth ionmigration in solids.
Because of vigorous exertion for improvement of such monovalent cation conduction insolids, we have realized various kinds of energy devicessuch as Li+ ion batteries, fuel cells, and NAS battery.
However, the demand of developing the next generationbattery possessing higher energy density steadily increases,and the divalent cation conductors are expected to be acandidate for the component of the next generationrechargeable battery since the divalent ions can theoreticallycarry twice electron compared with monovalent ion.
