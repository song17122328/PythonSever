Fe-substituted NASICON was prepared by co-precipitation method and the content of iron at different oxidation states was estimated by Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy (MS). Compounds with different phase composition were obtained depending on the preparation procedure. In the case of samples sintered in reducing atmosphere, NASICON containing di- and trivalent iron was detected. The lattice constants were calculated by Rietveld method. Higher values of the unit cell parameters for Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 compared to the structural analogue g-Na3Fe2P3O12 indicated the partial replacement of smaller Fe3+ ions by bigger Fe2+ and Zr4+ in the NASICON lattice. The validation of Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy as the useful tool in the calculation of iron content was also performed. The sintering in air led to the multiphase product, which was identified by XRD and MS.

NASICON (Na+ Super Ionic Conductor) is a name of compounds showing high ionic conductivity. These materials have been proposed for use as the solid electrolyte in solid-state electrochemical devices such as gas sensors, ion sensors and Na-S batteries [1–3]. The structure of NASICON is described by the general formula AMM0P3O12, where A can be alkali ions and M, M0 can be tri-, tetra- and pentavalent ions. A ions are located in two sites. In type I, A ions are sandwiched between two MO6 (or M0O6) octahedra along the c axis giving rise to disorder octahedral coordination. In II type, the A sites are perpendicular to the c axis with trigonal prismatic coordination. The structure is characterised as the 3-dimensional network of MO6 (or M0O6) octahedra, sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra and forming tunnels which may be vacant, partially or full occupied by A ions. Ionic conduction takes place when A ions move from one site to another through ‘‘bottleneck’’ formed by oxygen ions [4]. The complicated electronic and crystallographic structures of NASICON, as well as a doping in cationic and anionic sublattices give many possibilities of modification of its electrical properties. The doping by transition metals such as Fe, Nb, Ti, Vor Cr improves an ionic conductivity and generates electronic component. It was supposed that the introduction of Fe2+ and Fe3+ into a lattice, results in a mixed conductivity, thus making possible to use it as the electrode material [5–7]. All NASICONs containing iron crystallise in rhombohedral structure and are isostructural with g-Na3Fe2P3O12 [6–7]. Homogenous solid solution Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 was obtained for 0 < y < 0.5 by solid-state reaction. The investigations of unit cell parameters showed the decrease of lattice constants with increasing iron content (y), as the result of the partial replacement of bigger Zr4+ (rZr4þ ¼ 0:079 nm) and Fe2+ (rFe2þ ¼ 0:074 nm) ions by two smaller Fe3+ (rFe3þ ¼ 0:064 nm) [5]. The best electrical conductivity at 300 8C with similar ionic and electronic components was found for the composition of y = 0.33 in Na3Zr1?yFe1-y2+Fe2y3+P3O12. This system will be subjected in our work. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy has been used to investigate the oxidation states and the iron coordination in NASICON-type NASICON e.g. Li3Fe2P3O12 [6] or NbTiP3O12 [8]. For the sample containing only Fe3+ (Li3Fe2P3O12) M o¨ssbauer spectra showed a very narrow doublet with small quadrupolar splitting. As the Fe2+ increased two doubles appeared assigned to trivalent and divalent iron [6]. The values of isomer shift and quadrupolar splitting, characteristic for Fe3+ in high-spin octahedral configuration were detected in Ca0.5NbFeP3O12 [7]. The large quadruple splitting corresponding to Fe2+ and Fe3+ was observed in Mo¨ssbauer spectrum for its reduced product Ca0.5NbFe1?xFexP3O12. In addition, the value of isomer shift was typical for divalent iron in high spin octahedral coordination [7]. Barry et al. observed the change in intensities on the Mo¨ssbauer spectra depending on phase composition [8]. Mo¨ssbauer parameters, representative for Fe2+ were estimated for single-phase Fe0.33NbTiP3O12. In comparison, Mo¨ssbauer spectra taken for the same sample after sintering in air showed additional patterns, typical for octahedrically coordinated Fe3+ in hematite phase, together with doublets corresponding to divalent iron existing in the main product (Fe0.33NbTiP3O12). The variation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ intensities on Mo¨ssbauer spectra depending on heat treatment was also discussed [8]. In this work, we have applied Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy in order to estimate the presence and content of iron at different oxidation states in NASICON synthesized by co-precipitation method. The phase identification and calculations of the unit cell parameters were obtained from X-ray diffraction. All results are compared with NASICON containing only Fe3+ ions and referred to the literature data for similar compounds. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy is applied for the first time to investigate metal incorporation into Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 framework.

Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 for y = 0.33 was prepared by co-precipitation method from aqueous solutions of NaOH (POCh, Poland), (NH4)2HPO4 (Aldrich), ZrO(NO3)2 (0.1205 g ZrO2 in 1 g of solution), Fe(NO3)3?9H2O (0.0796 g in 1 g of solution) (Aldrich), which were mixed in stoichiometric amount, assuming Zr/Fe (1/2) molar ratio. All reagents were stirred to form a gel-like solid bulk. Precipitate was dried at 150 8C, calcined at 700 8C for 24 h and grinded in 2-propanol for 5 h using zirconia grinding balls. The dried material was formed into discs with 13 mm diameter and pressed isostatically at 300 MPa. In order to obtain different materials, the one containing only Fe3+ (sample A) and the other containing both Fe3+/Fe2+ ions (sample B), sintering was performed at different oxygen partial pressure, at the same temperature (850 8C) and time (3 h). Sample A was sintered in air and sample B at pO2 ffi 10?13 Pa. In order to estimate the stability of sample B, material was investigated by thermogravimetry in air (data not shown). The significant mass increase above 600 8C (followed by the surface oxidation at 360 8C) and red color of sample after TGA experiment showed formation of the multiphase product with a similar composition (identified by XRD) like sample A. X-ray diffraction (X’Pert Philips) was applied for the phase identification. Unit cell parameters were calculated by Rietveld method from measured XRD patterns in 2Q range of 10–1308 (0.0088 step and 200 s). X’Pert Plus software coupled with X’Pert MRD Philips instrument was used for data analysis. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The Mo¨ssbauer effect measurements were performed at room temperature in the transmission geometry using a constant acceleration type spectrometer in the velocity range from ?nmax to nmax (from ?10 to 10 mm/s and from ?5 t o 5 mm/s) using Fe57 as a source. The spectra were folded and analysed using the least-squares Mo¨ssbauer fitting program MOS.

X-ray diffraction measurement identified rhombohedral Na3Fe2P3O12 as the main phase, rhombohedral Fe2O3 and patterns belonging to nonstoichiometric sodium and zirconium phosphates: NaZr1.88P3O12, N a2ZrP2O8 or Na5?4xZr1+x(PO4)3 in material sintered in air (Fig. 1a). The multiphase product containing trivalent iron (red color of sample A, insert Fig. 1a) was always obtained after sintering in air. The X-ray diffraction of material sintered in the conditions of reduced oxygen pressure (sample B) was found to be single phase (grey color) and free from detectable iron (e.g. Fe3O4) o r zirconium (e.g. ZrO2, NaZr1.88(PO4)3) impurities (Fig. 1b). This phase was isomorphous with Na3Fe2P3O12. The unit cell parameters of Na3Zr1?yFe1?y+2Fe2y+3P3O12 were calculated using Rietveld method by fitting X-ray diffraction data with literature data for rhombohedral (space group R¯3c (167)) gNa3Fe2P3O12 (ICSD 89991) [9–14,19]. The calculated lattice constants of Na3Zr1?yFe2+1?yFe3+2yP3O12 showed higher values (a = 0.8848 nm, c = 2.1997 nm) in comparison with g-Na3Fe2P3O12 (a = 0.8727 nm, c = 2.1807 nm), as the result of the partial replacement of the smaller Fe3+ ions by bigger Fe2+ and Zr4+ (2 Fe3+ = F e2+ + Z r4+) in the Na3Fe2P3O12 framework. These results were confirmed by the following Mo¨ssbauer effect studies. The room temperature Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of the product obtained after calcinations in reducing atmosphere is shown in Fig. 2b. In order to compare the difference in the shape of spectra and Mo¨ssbauer parameters the results for sample A are also included (Fig. 2a). The velocity was estimated experimentally. For sample B below ?4 and above 4 mm/s any changes in transmission were detected in contrast to sample A. The experimental data (black circles) were fitted using program MOS. The doublet corresponding to Fe3+ (dotted line) and the summarized component of Fe2+ (dashed line) form the theoretical spectrum, which is drawn in solid line (Fig. 2b). The deconvolution of Fe2+ signal into four peaks (solid lines A, B, C, and D) is also shown in Fig. 2b. Mo¨ssbauer parameters for samples A and B are presented in Table 1. Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of the multiphase product containing different Fe3+ compounds (sample A) is shown in Fig. 2a. The quadruple doublet corresponds to the high spin Fe3+ ions in octahedral coordination. The shape of spectra is similar like obtained for the different NASICON-type compounds containing trivalent iron [6,7,18]. In addition, sample A shows sextet characteristic of Fe2O3 phase. We may observe six magnetic splitting signals because iron nucleus can exist in six equal positions. All Fe3+ ions in Fe2O3 are in octahedral coordination [16,17]. This phase is also detected by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1a). The similar spectrum, composed by Fe3+ signals from two different phases (in phosphate and oxide) was presented earlier for FexNbTiP3O12 [8]. Na3Zr1?yFe2+1?yFe3+2yP3O12 (Fig. 2b) shows an asymmetric Mo¨ssbauer spectrum, which can be fitted by two quadrupolar split components corresponding to divalent and trivalent iron. This indicates on the incomplete reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. The large values of quadrupolar split and isomer shift are referred to the Fe2+ in high-spin octahedral configuration, while smaller values are characteristic for trivalent iron in octahedral sites (Table 1). In addition, the presence of FeO6 and ZrO6 (which the cations may be Fe2+, Fe3+ and Zr4+) octahedra around the Fe2+ species causes the displacement of Fe2+ ions from the regular octahedral coordination and is reflected by components C-D on the Mo¨ssbauer spectrum (Fig. 2b). Quadrupolar splittings of C and D components are smaller in comparison with to A, B. The change of distortion of the coordinated polyhedra around the divalent iron causes an increase of the lattice contribution to the electric-field gradient, resulting in smaller quadrupolar splittings. The similar values of isomeric shift for Fe3+ in both Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 and samples A (Table 1) indicate on the presence of a very symmetrical Fe3+ octahedra, without a significant influence of surrounding charges (Zr4+, F e3+). The higher value of the Fe2+ isomer shift for sample B in comparison with the same parameter detected for FexNbTiP3O12 may be associated with its longer iron-oxygen distances [8]. However, additional investigations are required for this hypothesis. The isomeric shift and quadrupolar splitting of the Fe3+ component are similar to those obtained for Ca0.5HxNbFe1?xFex(PO4)3 [7]. In addition, the value of Fe2+ isomeric shift observed in our experiment is comparable to the same parameter for Ca0.5HxNbFe1?xFex(PO4)3, but the quadruple splitting of Fe2+ is lower than reported in work [7]. The isomer shift and quadrupolar splitting calculated for Fe3+ in sample A are lower than the same parameters presented for a-Na3Fe2P3O12 [18]. This suggests more symmetrical FeO6 octahedra in the g-Na3Fe2P3O12 framework (the main phase obtained after sintering in air, sample A) and can be explained as the effect of different crystallographic structure (aNa3Fe2P3O12 is monoclinic, space group C2/c [6]). The different crystal symmetries are due to the changes in the distribution of alkali cations within the Fe2(PO4)3 ribbons. In this case, the influence of Na occupations on the symmetry of polyhedra should be expected [18]. The molar amount of iron is calculated from the integrated areas under Fe2+ and Fe3+ peaks (Fig. 2b) according to the following formula [15]: gFe2þ ¼ f Fe2þ ? SFe2þ f Fe2þ ? SFe2þ þ f Fe3þ ? SFe3þ and gFe3þ ¼ 1 ? gFe2þ; where: SFe2þ, SFe3þ area under peaks, f Fe2þ, f Fe3þ recoil-free fractions ( f Fe2þ ? f Fe3þ at room temperature). The molar contents of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions are 0.269 and 0.731, respectively and are slightly higher than assumed (Fe2+/Fe3+ = 1 / 2). Taking into account an experimentally estimated amount of iron in Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 the electroneutrality condition would not be fulfilled as the result of an extended negative charge (?0.345 mol) in the oxygen sublattice. In such case the calculation error (e.g. from the factorization of Mo¨ssbauer spectra) must be considered. We did not find any additional crystalline phase by XRD (Fig. 1b) and from SEM observations (data no shown), which could appear to balance the charges during synthesis of Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12.

In this work, it was demonstrated that the NASICON containing both Fe3+ and Fe2+ in the lattice could be obtained by co-precipitation method and in appropriate sintering conditions. X-ray diffraction results, confirmed by the Mo¨ssbauer effect measurements showed the presence of single NASICON phase, which was isostructural with g-Na3Fe2P3O12. The calculated unit cell parameters of NASICON indicated on the partial replacement of trivalent iron by Zr4+ and Fe2+ in Na3Fe2P3O12 framework and the formation of Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12. The sintering in air led to the multiphase product with different Fe3+ compounds. The Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy was applied for the first time to investigate metal incorporation in Na3Zr1?yFe1?y2+Fe2y3+P3O12 lattice. From the comparison of the shape of spectrum and values of Mo¨ssbauer parameters with results presented by others for similar compounds, it was possible to describe surroundings and the position of iron in the NASICON framework. The Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy can be used for the quantitative analysis of the Fe-modified NASICONs.
