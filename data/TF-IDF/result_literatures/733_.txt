Here we report a novel lithium−selenium (Li−Se) battery with hybrid electrolytesthat permit fast solution-phase Li−Se redox reactions, eliminate polyselenides-shuttling andsuppress the formation of lithium dendrite., 677 mA h g−1 at 0.1C (100% oftheoretical capacity)), superior cycling stability (e.g., 613 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles at 0.8C,fading rate=0.008% per cycle), and promising rate capabilities (e.., 540 mA h g−1 at 1.5C).
With the hybrid electrolytes, we further demonstrate a high Se loading of 5.9 mg cm-2 with astable discharge capacity of 454 mA h g−1 (2.68 mA h cm-2).
Our work demonstrates thatcombining solid state electrolyte with liquid glyme electrolyte is key to achieve stable andhigh-performance Li−Se batteries.
In summary, we report a high-performance and long-life Li−Se battery with hybridelectrolytes that permit fast solution-phase Li−Se redox reactions, eliminate polyselenidesshuttling and suppress the formation of Li dendrite.
The hybrid Li−Se battery demonstrated (1)full utilization of the Se cathode (e.g., 677 mA h g−1 at 0.1C (100% of theoretical capacity));(2) excellent cycling stabilities (e.g., 613 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles at 0.8C, fading rate=0.008%per cycle); (3) promising rate capabilities (e.g., 540 mA h g−1 at 1.5C) and (4) reversibledischarge capacities at high Se loadings (e.g., 454 mA h g−1 at a Se loading of 5.9 mg cm-2).
Together, the Li−Se battery with hybrid electrolytes reported in this work shows significantimprovements compared to previously reported Li−Se batteries in Se content, Se loading, ratecapability and cycling stability (Table S2).
Comprehensive SEM/EDX/XRD and EIScharacterizations revealed superior morphological and electrochemical reversibility of theSe−KB cathode and excellent structural/chemical stability of the LAGP membrane.
Ourdesign of the Li−Se battery with hybrid electrolytes offers a promising pathway towards thedevelopment of low-cost, high-energy and long-life rechargeable Se batteries.
