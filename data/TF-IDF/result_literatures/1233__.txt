The NASICON oxides with general formula Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 (0.1  x  0.2) are prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. The samples are characterized by XRD, SEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and 7Li MAS NMR measurements. The structures are reÔ¨Åned by the Rietveld method from powder X-ray diffraction data. With the introduction of Y3√æ , the volume of the large M1 cavity is reduced conand the rhombohedral NASICON phase is stabilized at room temperature. The bulk and total Li  4 S cm  1 at 25 C, ductivities of Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 sintered by SPS are 1.4  10 respectively; the activation energy is about 0.39 eV in the temperature range 300e473 K.

Limitations of the Ô¨Çammable organic liquid-carbonate electrolytes of the Li-ion batteries and interest in Li-ion batteries using a solid separator of an organic-liquid electrolyte on the anode side and an aqueous or air cathode has stimulated the search for Li-ion solid electrolytes having a room-temperature Li conductivity  1 [1,2]. At present, slightly-modiÔ¨Åed Li1.3Ti1.7 sLi > 10 Al0.3(PO4)3 with rhombohedral NASICON structure [3,4] is the best commercially available oxide Li-ion solid electrolyte. Solid alkaliion conductors with NASICON structure have been thoroughly investigated from both the structural and electrical points of view [5e8].

The crystal structure of NASICON AxB2(PO4)3 is a framework built of corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 octahedra, providing a relatively open, three-dimensional network of sites and

conduction pathways for various A cations. Two main types of cavities, denoted M1 and M2, are generally considered, the former is a six-coordinate site while the latter is an irregular eightcoordinate site. The most important system of the family is LiZr2(PO4)3, which can be expected to be electrochemically stable on contact with lithium metal. The NASICON LiZr2(PO4)3 compound prepared at 1473 K exhibits a Ô¨Årst order transition from the triclinic C1 to the rhombohedral R3c form at about 310 K [9], and the rhombohedral √æ conductivity can be stable only above 50 C. phase R3c with high Li √æ The Li conductivities of the triclinic and rhombohedral phases are  1 close to sLi ¬º 5  10 room temperature, respectively [10,11]. In our previous work we reported that the substitution of 5% of Ca2√æ in LiZr2(PO4)3 can transform the structure to rhombohedral NASICON at room temperature and increase the ionic √æ conductivity signiÔ¨Åcantly [12,13]. The Li conductivity in NASCION LiZr2(PO4)3 should be further improved through optimizing the doping element and content to increase the density of the bulk √æ material and tune the size of the interstitial channel for Li conduction. Here we Ô¨Ånd that with the introduction of Y3√æ , the

Compounds with the chemical formula Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 (0.1  x  0.2) were prepared by solid-state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, Y2O3, ZrO2 and (NH4)2HPO4. The powders were ball-milled with zirconia balls and heated to 900 C to decompose the metal salts. The resultant product was ball-milled and sintered at 1200 C for 20 h. Finally the powders were ballmilled again and pressed into a pellet under 40 MPa and then annealed at 1200 C for 18 h in air; for x ¬º 0.2, the samples was ballmilled again and Ô¨Åred at 1200 C for 18 h to get the NASICON phase. The annealing was done in a platinum crucible. To increase the density of the samples, the powders after sintering at 1200 C for 18 h was sintered by SPS at 1200 C for 20 min under 40 MPa. Powder X-ray diffraction (D8 advance A25, Cu Ka) was employed to monitor the phase formation in the 2q range from 10 to 70 with a step size of 0.02. Structural reÔ¨Ånements of the resulting compounds were performed with Fullprof software. A Ô¨Åeld-emission scanning electron microscope (Quanta FEG650) was used to obtain the fracture surface microstructure of the pellet. The composition distribution of the elements was measured by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC Q200) was used to analyze the phase transformation of Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 (0.1  x  0.2). The experiment was carried out under a static air atmosphere between  90 and 200 C with a heating rate of 2 C min

 1. 7Li NMR spectra recorded under MAS condition were obtained at room temperature using a B-VT 1000/SU07 unit adapted to advance III 400 Bruker spectrometer. The frequency used for 7Li was 155.50 MHz. Spectra were taken after a p/2 pulse irradiation and the interval between successive scans chosen to avoid saturation effects (20e30 s), the spinning rate of samples was 12 kHz and the number of accumulations was 4. 7Li chemical shift values was given relative to 1 M LiCl aqueous solutions.

Ionic conductivity was measured from 300 to 473 K with an Agilent 4294A Impedance Analyzer; the applied frequency range was from 110 MHz to 100 Hz with a 5 mV AC amplitude. Both parallel surfaces of the pellet were sputtered with Li-ion-blocking Au electrodes.

Fig. 1 shows the powder XRD patterns after pressureless sintering and SPS. The diffraction peaks observed were assigned to a well-crystallized rhombohedral NASICON structure. Only a very small amount of YPO4 exists in Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 compound with x ¬º 0.15 and 0.2. An amorphous secondary phase (e.g. P2O5 or Li3PO4) was easily formed during the synthesis of LiZr2(PO4)3, which was conÔ¨Årmed by 31P NMR experiments [9,14]. The lattice parameters, cell volume of Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 obtained by rietveld reÔ¨Ånement and structural data of LiZr2(PO4)3 extrapolated to room temperature from the thermal-expansion data [6] above 150 C are listed in Table 1S. The substitution of Zr4√æ in LiZr2(PO4)3 causes an increase of the lattice parameters and cell volume of the Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 compound. The variations can be caused by the different values of ionic radii of Zr4√æ (0.88 A) ions, √æ and more Li is needed to compensate for the charge balance after the substitution. The lattice parameter c in Li1.2Y0.2Zr1.8(PO4)3 is a little smaller than that in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3, which maybe

caused by the different sintering process. Calorimetric curves obtained during the heating runs of Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 with x ¬º 0.1 and 0.15 are shown in Fig. 1S, no endothermic peak was detected, which indicate that there is no Ô¨Årst order transition from the rhombohedral R3c to the triclinic C1 phase. With the introduction of Y3√æ , the rhombohedral NASICON phase can be stable even √æ :Y3√æ at  90 C. The molar ratio of Li elements was 1.12:0.14:1.87 for x ¬º 0.15, which is in good agreement with the general formula Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3.

Fig. 2S displays the fractural microstructure of the pellet after sintering. The particles are in good contact with each other, and a certain amount of pores in the boundary area after pressureless sintering can be observed. The Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 samples sintered by SPS at 1200 C for 20 min shows better connection and less amount of pores, which can reduce the grain-boundary resistance. The densities of ceramics with x ¬º 0.15 sintered by pressureless sintering at 1200 C for 18 h and SPS at 1200 C for 20 min were about 85% and 90% of the theoretical densities, respectively. An impedance spectrum of the prepared Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 pellet for x ¬º 0.15 measured at 25 C is exhibited in Fig. 2(a). The appearance of a low-frequency tail in the case of ionically blocking electrodes is an indication that the conductivity of Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 is ionic in nature. The bulk and grain-boundary resistance could be obtained by Ô¨Åtting the experimental data with the conventional equivalent circuit consisting of (RbCPE1)(RgbCPE2)(CPE3). The optimized bulk and total conductivities at 25 C  4 and 0.31 10  1 in after pressureless sintering are 1.4  10 Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 with x ¬º 0.15, and the total conductivity can be  4 S cm  1 for samples sintered by SPS further improved to 0.71  10 at 1200 C for 20 min for with x ¬º 0.15, which is higher than that of our previous report on Li1.2Ca0.1Zr1.9(PO4)3 [12,13] and is comparable to that of Al3√æ -contaminated ‚ÄúLi7La3Zr2O12‚Äù [15]. The grainboundary contribution to the total resistance is appreciable and amounts to about 77% and 51% at 25 C sintered by pressureless sintering and SPS, respectively. The bulk and total conductivities at 25 C in Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 with different x are shown in Table 2S, the bulk conductivities in Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 are much higher than that in LiZr2(PO4)3 with NASICON structure near room temperature (sLi z 1  10  1 for a sintered sample of Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.10 and 0.15). The

temperature dependence of the conductivity can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation. sT ¬º Aexp√∞ Ea=kT√û

The activation energy was estimated to be Ea ¬º 0.40 and 0.39 eV sintered by pressureless sintering and SPS from the slope of the  1 plot in the temperature range of 300e473 K log sT versus 1000 T with x ¬º 0.10 and 0.15. The activation energy for the total lithiumion conductivity is smaller than that in rhombohedral Li2Zr(PO4)3 (0.43 eV) [9]. The activation energy for the total lithium-ion conductivity is comparable to Ca2√æ -doping Li2Zr(PO4)3 [11,12] and fast √æ Li garnet conductors such as Li6BaLa2Ta2O12 [16] (0.40 eV), Li7La3Zr2O12 [17] (0.30 eV).

To clarify the inÔ¨Çuence of the doping Y3√æ on the NASICON √æ structure and the Li transport within the framework, the reÔ¨Ånement of Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 structure was done using the Rietveld analysis of powder X-ray diffraction patterns. The localisation of Li atoms using the X-ray diffraction technique is not efÔ¨Åcient due to their low X-ray scattering factor, therefore, only the atomic positions of Zr(Y), P and O atoms within the framework and their anisotropic atomic displacement factors were reÔ¨Åned in the

reÔ¨Ånement. Linear interpolation between a set background points with reÔ¨Ånable heights was used to model the intensity background, and the peak shape was represented by a convolution of a pseudoVoigt function, and the occupancy of Zr atom was also reÔ¨Åned.

The crystal structure of LiZr2(PO4)3 at 873 K in which the lithium was disordered with occupancies of 7% tetrahedral sites (18e) and 13% tetrahedral sites (36f) was adopted as the initial structure model. This reÔ¨Ånement led to a rather good agreement between the experimental and the calculated XRD patterns (Fig. 3) and to low reliability factors (Rwp w 11.0%; RB w 2.3%). Our rhombohedral NASICON Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 had space group R3c with lattice √æ parameter a ¬º 8.8727 and c ¬º 22.1578 A. In NASICON LiB2(PO4)3, Li moves in the B2(PO4)3 framework, which contains an array of M1 interstitial sites separated by an array of M2 interstitial sites, and there are three times as many M2 as M1 sites. The Li only occupies √æ the M1 site in LiTi2(PO4)3 [5] while in LiZr2(PO4)3 about 90% Li occupies the 6-fold disordered 36f tetrahedral site (displaced from M1 site) in M1 cavity and about 10% Li occupies the 3-fold disordered 18e tetrahedral sites (displaced from M2 site) in M20 cavity (Fig.4) at 423 K [6]. The tunnels in LiZr2(PO4)3 are not suitable √æ in size for small Li ion migration, and the ionic conductivity of the system is greatly increased when Zr4√æ in LiZr2(PO4)3 is substituted by a smaller Ti4√æ

Close examination of the atomic positions and interatomic distances shows that the main difference between Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85

and lower ion mobilities [19,20]. The area fraction (Af) of the narrow contribution, representing fast Li ions in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3, amounts to approximately 91%. The size change in M1 and M20 cavity shortened the distance √æ ions inside M1 cavity (roughly 3.83(4) A in between the Li Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 compared to 4.29(1) A in LiZr2(PO4)3 at 150 C) and facilitated the Li transport in the mobile path along Li1eLi10eLi10. network inside the NASICON structure. Doping with Y3√æ concentration in the interstitial space, which introduces Li into interstitial Li1 and Li2 sites and lowers the motional enthalpy Ea by introducing Li coulombic interactions to displace the Li ions from the interstitial Li1 sites.

(PO4)3 at 25 C and LiZr2(PO4)3 structures at different temperatures (150, 400 and 600 C) is the size of M1 and M20 cavity. The Zr(1)e Zr(10), Zr(1)eP(1) and Zr(10)eP(1) in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 (6.2972, 3.4076 and 5.9048 A) in Fig. 4 are much shorter than the corresponding Zr(1)eZr(10), Zr(1)eP(1) and Zr(10)eP(1) distances in LiZr2(PO4)3 [6] at different temperatures (e.g. 6.4115, 3.4374, and 5.9809 A at 600 C); moreover the PeO and ZreO bond lengths also increase in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3, so the volume of the six-coordinated M1 cavity decreases, and then less thermal energy is needed to push the mobile Li into the center of the diffusion pathway. The Li ions which reside in the 6-fold disordered 36f tetrahedral sites in M1 cavity play a major role in the mobile process [6], so the reduced interstitial space will lead to more suitable tunnel for Li transport. The Zr(2)eP(2) interatomic distances (3.535 A) are signiÔ¨Åcantly longer than the corresponding Zr(2)eP(2) distances (e.g. 3.4953 A at 600 C) in LiZr2(PO4)3; a little increase in the Zr(2)eZr(2) distances (4.7817 A) in parallel to c-axis is observed for Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 at room temperature in comparison to what is observed for LiZr2(PO4)3 at 150 C (4.7698 A)and 400 C (4.7798 A). The volume of M20 cavity increases, therefore, the LieO distances increase. The Li ion in the 18e tetrahedral sites inside M20 cavity in LiZr2(PO4)3 is bonded to oxygens strongly due to the short LieO distances, and in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3, the Li ions inside M20 cavity will be activated and contribute to Lithium transport within the framework, due to the bigger size of M20 cavity and longer LieO distance. The size change in M1 and M20 cavity makes an indirect mechanism involving Li2 as intermediate site √æ possible and even Li redistribution in 18e and 36f tetrahedral sites. The ZrO6 octahedra in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 exhibit six almost similar ZreO distances(2.07(0), 2.07(9) A), due to the size change in M1 and M20 cavity, and are less distorted than that in LiZr2(PO4)3 at 150 C, where Li(2) gets closer to Zr2. The PeO distance in Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 (1.52(8),1.53(5) A) are in good agreement with those typically observed in NASICON-type structure.

7Li MAS NMR technique was used to probe Li dynamics in NASICON Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3. In Fig. 5, The 7Li NMR spectrum displayed a resonance at  0.02 ppm; the two-component NMR line was represented by a composite of a broad (Gaussian) and a narrow (Lorentzian) component, which can be assigned to 7Li populations with higher

The NASICON oxides with general formula Li1√æxYxZr2 x(PO4)3 (0.1  x  0.2) were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. With the introduction of Y3√æ , the rhombohedral NASICON phase was stabilized at room temperature. The bulk and total lithium ion conductivities of Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3 sintered by SPS at 25 C were  1, respectively; the acti1.4  10 vation energy was about 0.39 eV in the temperature range 300e 500 K. The dopant Y3√æ reduces the size of the interstitial space in the M1 cavity, and the size change in M1 and M20 cavity facilitates √æ the Li
