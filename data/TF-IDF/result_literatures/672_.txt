Na-ion conducting Na1+x[SnxGe2-x(PO4)3] (x=0,0.25,0.5 and 0.75 mol%) glass samples with NASICON-type phase were synthesized by melt quenching method and glass-ceramics were formed by heat treating the precursor glasses at their crystallization temperatures.
XRD traces exhibit formation of most stable crystalline phase NaGe2(PO4)3 (ICSD -164019) with trigonal structure.
Structural illustration of sodium germanium phosphate [NaGe2(PO4)3] displays that each germanium is surrounded by 6 oxygen atom showing octahedral symmetry (GeO6) and phosphorous with four oxygen atoms showing tetrahedral symmetry (PO4).
The highest bulk Na+ ion conductivities and lowest activation energy for conduction were achieved to be 8.39x10-05 S/cm and 0.52 eV for the optimum substitution levels (x=0.5 mol%, Na1.5[Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3]) of tetrahedral Ge4+ ions by Sn4+ on Na-Ge-P network.
CV studies of the best conducting Na1.5[Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3] glass-ceramic electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window of 6V.
The structural and EIS sstudies of these glass-ceramic electrolyte samples were monitored in the light of the substitution of Ge by its larger homologue Sn.
DTA traces of Na[SnxGe2-x(PO4)3] glass and glass-ceramic samples pointed out that the sample containing x= 0.5 mol% (Na1.5Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3) exhibits the highest chemical stability against crystallization before and after heat treatment ( T= 66 & 60).
The main parent ion- conducting and most stable crystalline phase well to trigonal NaGe2(PO4)3 (ICSD -164019) with space group (R-3 (148) H) framework, however, the crystalline phase NaSn2(PO4)3 was not present, as suggested by XRD traces.
The unit cell volume is observed to be highest (1274 Å) for the highly de-polymerized and best conducting glass-ceramic sample (Na1.5Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3) which is ascribed due to the partial substitution of tetrahedral Ge4+ by Sn4+ ions successfully within the NaGe2(PO4)3 (NASICON) structure.
Structural illustrations revealed that the distance between planar layer of germanium (9.98 Å) show a free void path for migration of Na ions.
These free wider paths for the transmission of Na+ ions of glass-ceramic electrolyte sample are due to R-3 (148) H space group of the Na2Ge(PO4)3 crystal phase which paves the way to form higher concentration of Na-ion conducting path ways leading to achieve the ionic conductivity significantly.
The SEM micro structure reveals that the grain size of major conducting crystalline phase in the sample heat treated at 638 K is dense and much more uniform in nature than that of sample heat treated at 800 K.
The bulk conductivity is achieved to be highest (= 8.39x10-05 S/cm) for the Na1.5[Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3] glass-ceramic sample and slightly increases to 8.42 x10-05 S/cm when it is heat treated to 700 K at 6 hrs without much variation in their activation energies.
CV studies of the best conducting Na1.5[Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3] glass-ceramic electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window of 6V.
Thus, Na1.5[Sn0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3] glass-ceramic electrolyte composition has a great potential for use in Na- ion batteries as a safer and room temperature electrolyte.
