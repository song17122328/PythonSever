An ordered 2D-hexagonal mesoporous Lithium-Aluminum-Titanium-Phosphate (LATP-1) material has been synthesized by using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the structure directing agent (SDA) thorough hydrothermal route.
After acid-ethanol extraction of the as-synthesized LATP-1 material, the extracted white solid product has been characterized thoroughly using small and wide angle powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Ultra-high resolution transmission electron microscopy (UHR-TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Elemental analysis revealed 2.53% Li, 2.02% Al, 4.84% Ti, 28.16% P, 62.44% O in the mesoporous LATP-1 material.
The template-extracted LATP-1 material has been employed as anode and cathode materials for lithium ion batteries: as an anode material, the LATP-1 electrode exhibits stable discharge-charge performances with delivered capacity of 121 mAh.g-1 and 117 mAh.g-1, respectively and a high coulombic efficiency.
Our experimental results revealed that an ordered 2D-hexagonal mesoporous lithiumaluminum- titanium-phosphate material LATP-1 can be synthesized by using CTAB as a template under hydrothermal conditions.
Characterization results revealed that LATP-1 has 2Dhexagonal mesophase, which is useful for the electrochemical application.
The electrochemical measurement of this material has been performed both as anode and cathode material using cyclic voltammogram studies and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles.
As an anode material, the LATP-1 electrode exhibits stable discharge-charge performances after 50 cycles with delievered capacity of 121 mAh.g-1 and 117 mAh.g-1, respectively together with a high coulombic efficiency of 94% compared to its ability as cathode materials.
Thus, the synthesis of mesoporous lithium-aluminum-titanium-phosphate material and its electrochemical results reported herein may open a fresh outlook to explore it as an anode material in Li-ion batteries.
