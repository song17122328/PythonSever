Sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type solid electrolytes, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP), have high lithium ion conductivity and chemical/electrochemical stability. In this study, we proposed a new sol-gel route to synthesize LATP precursor powder. The LATP powder was prepared from lithium nitrate (LiNO3), aluminum phosphate (AlPO4), ammonium phosphate (NH3PO4), and titanium isopropoxide (Ti-(OCH(CH3)2)4). The LATP electrolyte with high relative density (99%) and lithium ion conductivity (4.2 × 10−4 S/cm at 30 °C) could be fabricated by sintering the precursor powder at 1000 °C for 6 h. XRD analysis results revealed that the electrolyte sample sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h was impurity-free single phase LATP. FE-SEM observations showed that the grain size and density increased with increasing sintering temperature. AC impedance spectra and SEM observations suggest that the enhanced lithium ion conductivity was due to an increase in grain size and density of the LATP electrolyte.

Recently, the lithium ion battery market has been growing with increasing demand. There are two reasons for this increase in demand. First, in Europe, as the government has increased regulation of gasoline vehicles, electric vehicles were inevitably developed. Second, due to the high energy density and easy charging/discharging of lithium secondary batteries, almost all portable electronic devices use lithium secondary batteries [1], [2], [3], [4]. All solid-state batteries using solid electrolytes have a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries and can reduce the number of parts and packaging space, thereby saving weight and volume while using the same amount of power [5], [6]. To increase the size and, thus, the energy density of the lithium secondary battery while maintaining stability, the use of a solid electrolyte is required in place of the conventional flammable organic liquid electrolyte.

NASICON-type Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) ceramics are typical lithium ion conducting materials, with ion conductivities as high as 10−4 S·cm−1 at room temperature [7]. In addition, LATP is chemically stable in humidified air or carbon dioxide [8] and is expected to exhibit a high oxidative potential (4.21 V) compared to LiPON (2.63 V) or garnet-type electrolytes (2.91 V) [9]. In recent years, LATP has attracted significant attention as a promising solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries [10], [11].

LATP can be synthesized by solid-state reaction [12], melt-quenching [13], and sol-gel techniques [14]. The melt-quenching is somewhat complicated because the glass frit prepared by melting at 1300 °C or higher is pulverized into powder form and then heat-treated to obtain crystallized LATP grains. The sol-gel method has advantages and challenges; the advantages include purity, homogeneity, ease in controlling size and microstructure, and low-processing temperature [15], [16]. On the other hand, the choice of precursor, the optimization of the reaction catalysis, and the use of solvents for precursor dissolution are very important issues concerning the sol-gel technique [17], [18], [19]. In this study, LATP powders were synthesized by the sol-gel technique from lithium nitrate, aluminum phosphate, and titanium iso-propoxide to induce a rapid gelation reaction without further dissolution. Fully densified LATP electrolytes were successfully fabricated from the sol-gel-derived powder. The lithium ion conductivity of LATP was measured from a symmetrical cell consisting of the LATP electrolyte and Pt blocking electrodes, and the effects of the bulk and grain boundaries on the conductivity were investigated.

A stoichiometric amount of lithium nitrate (LiNO3, 98%, Junsei), aluminum phosphate (AlPO4, 99%, Acros), and ammonium phosphate (NH3PO4, 98%, Alfa Aesar), which were used as starting materials, was dissolved in DI water at a molar ratio of 1.3:0.3: 3:800 respectively. A clear solution could be obtained after stirring the solution for 1 h. Then 1.7 mol of titanium iso-propoxide (Ti-(OCH(CH3)2)4, Samchun Pure Chemicals) was added to the solution. Gel-like precipitates were prepared by adding the titanium iso-propoxide to the solution. The precipitates were dried at 100 °C for 12 h in the oven, followed by heat-treating at 450 °C for 2 h. The obtained powder was uniaxially pressed into disc-shaped pellets and then sintered at 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C for 6 h. Some electrolyte samples were sintered at 1000 °C for 1, 3, 6, and 12 h to investigate the effects of sintering time on density and microstructure. Sintered electrolyte samples were polished to a thickness of 1 mm, and platinum electrodes were coated on both surfaces of the disc samples for electrochemical performance analysis.

The phase identification of calcined powders and sintered electrolyte samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, RU-200B, Rigaku Co., Ltd.) with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. The microstructure was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F, JEOL). Bulk densities were determined from Archimedes’ method.

AC impedance spectra were obtained under open circuit conditions with an excitation potential of 20 mV over the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz by an impedance analyzer (IM6e, Zahner). Two Pt wires from two electrodes were connected to the working and counter terminals of the impedance analyzer.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the powder sample calcined at 450 °C for 2 h and the disk samples sintered at 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C for 6 h. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the calcined powder sample showed a broad pattern with low intensity between 20 and 30° with no peaks due to crystalline phases, indicating that it is amorphous. In the case of the sintered samples, peaks corresponding to the crystalline phase appeared, and they could be identified as crystalline LATP. In the electrolyte samples sintered at 800, 900, and 1100 °C, peaks at 22, 28, 32, and 36° were detected and were attributed to AlPO4, which is often observed as a secondary phase during the sintering of LATP [20]. The content of the AlPO4 phase was dependent on the sintering temperature; the 1100 °C-sintered samples showed large amounts of the AlPO4 phase and this result is due to lithium evaporation at high temperature. In contrast, there were no secondary phases nor an unreacted AlPO4 phase when the sintering was conducted at 1000 °C. Small amounts of AlPO4 was detected in the 800 and 900 °C-sintered samples and a local lithium deficiency in the calcined powder sample is responsible for the formation of AlPO4.

SEM images of electrolyte samples sintered at 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C for 6 h are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a)–(d) reveal cube-like LATP grains, and their morphology was maintained, irrespective of sintering temperature. In addition, an increase in density and grain size was observed as the sintering temperature increases. The grain sizes of 800 and 1100 °C-sintered samples were estimated to be approximately 1 and 10 μm, respectively. As can be seen in Fig. 2(d), 1100 °C-sintered sample showed more porous structure than 1000 °C-sintered samples. This phenomenon is associated with the evaporation of lithium at high sintering temperature.


Fig. 3(a) shows AC impedance spectra of symmetrical cells with LATP electrolytes sintered at 800, 900, 1000, and 1100 °C for 6 h, measured at 30 °C. Fig. 3(b) shows the impedance spectra of symmetrical cells with LATP sintered at 1000 °C for 1, 3, 6, and 12 h. The impedance spectra exhibit a semicircle at high frequency followed by a spike at low frequency, often observed in symmetrical cells with blocking electrodes [21]. The semicircle is related to lithium ion conduction in the bulk LATP (grains and grain boundaries), and the spike is related to electrode polarization, i.e., blocking of ions at the Pt electrodes.


The diameters of the impedance semicircle shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) correspond to the resistance of the LATP electrolyte, which includes its grain and grain boundary resistances. The lithium ion conductivities of the LATP electrolytes fabricated by various conditions were calculated from the following formula, and their values are listed in Table 1. In this formula, l is the thickness of the LATP electrolyte, A is the area of the Pt blocking electrode, and R is the resistance of the LATP electrolyte determined from impedance spectra. Relative densities of LATP electrolyte samples are also shown in Table 1.

The lithium ion conductivity increases as the sintering temperature increases. In contrast, the conductivity of the 1100 °C-sintered sample was lower than that of the 1000 °C-sintered sample. The highest lithium ion conductivity of 4.172 × 10−4 S·cm−1 was obtained in the electrolyte sample, sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h. The increase in conductivity with respect to the sintering temperature is due to the relative density enhancement. As can be seen in Fig. 2, SEM images reveal that pores in the sintered LATP disappeared, and denser microstructures were obtained as the sintering temperature was increased from 800 to 1000 °C. In addition, the increase in grain size of the LATP electrolyte is another reason for the improved conductivity. Generally, the ionic conductivity increases with increasing grain size because the lithium ion moves faster through grains rather than the grain boundary [22], [23]. In contrast, the reduced conductivity observed in the electrolyte sample sintered at 1100 °C is associated with the formation of the secondary phase (AlPO4) or lithium evaporation during high-temperature sintering, as was described in 
To investigate the effects of sintering time on microstructure and lithium ion conductivity, LATP electrolyte samples were sintered for different times. SEM images of LATP electrolyte samples sintered at 1000 °C for 1, 3, 6, and 12 h were shown in Fig. 4. The LATP sample sintered for 1 h were porous, and its microstructure was somewhat inhomogeneous, consisting of fine (∼1 μm) and large (4–5 μm) grains. This result indicates that the low lithium ion conductivity of the LATP electrolyte sintered at 1000 °C for 1 and 3 h is due to the decreased bulk density. In the case of the LATP electrolyte sample sintered at 1000 °C for 12 h, small particles were detected at grain boundaries, assigned as AlPO4. As was described before, the AlPO4 secondary phase appeared when the sintering was performed at high temperatures or prolonged times because of severe lithium evaporation and the resulting lithium deficiency in the LATP crystal structure. The presence of the AlPO4 secondary phase resulted in a reduced lithium ion conductivity of the electrolyte sample sintered for 12 h.

In this study, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) solid electrolytes were fabricated by sintering sol–gel derived precursor powder at various temperatures and times. The main findings are as follows:
(1)Single-phase LATP could be obtained by sintering the precursor powder at 1000 °C for 6 h.

(2)Sintering at high temperature (1100 °C) resulted in the formation of the AlPO4 secondary phase in LATP, which deteriorated the lithium ion conductivity of LATP electrolytes.

(3)The lithium ion conductivity of LATP electrolytes was strongly dependent on density, grain size, and the amount of the secondary phase (AlPO4).
