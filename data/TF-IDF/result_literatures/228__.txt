This  study  reveals  the  storage  mechanism  and  feasible  diffusion pathway of Zn-ion in NaV2(PO4)3 cathode for Zn-ion  batteries.  Structural  evolution  of  electrode  material  during  electrochemical  cycling  was  studied  by  ex  situ  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  and  X-ray  absorption  spectroscopy  (XAS),  which  revealed  the  charge  compensation  mechanism  and  that  local  structure  and  phase  evolution  are  highly  reversible.  The  ionic  migration  mechanism  of  Na+  and  Zn2+  in  NVP  was  theoretically  studied  by  ab  initio  molecular  dynamics  (AIMD)  and  climbing-image  nudged  elastic  band  (CI-NEB)  calculations.  Combining  Voronoi  decomposition  with  the  crystallographic information,  all  possible  polyhedral  sites  in  NVP  structure  were  identified  for  the  first  time  and  Zn2+  storage  mechanism  based  on  intercalation  of  Zn2+  to  both  M1  and  M2  sites  of ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 was subsequently uncovered by the analysis  of the AIMD simulations. More importantly, the dynamic Na+/ Zn2+  mixed  occupation  at  M1  and  M2  sites,  enabled  by  their  concerted migration, was found to improve the cycling performance,  mechanical  properties,  and  electrical  conductivity  of  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 compared to the sodiated Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode.  The new insight into Zn2+ intercalation and dynamics in NVP  unlocked  by  activating  the  M1  sites  can  help  the  community  rediscover  a  large  class  of  NASICON  materials  in  which  both  M1 and M2 sites are involved in ion migration in a concerted  fashion,  thereby  offering  opportunity  for  substantial  improvements in the performance of Zn-ion batteries.


The NaV2(PO4)3 was prepared by electrochemically extracting  two  Na+  ions  from  Na3V2(PO4)3.  First,  Na3V2(PO4)3  powder  with  high  crystallinity,  conformal  nano-coating  of  carbon  (≈2.7 wt% carbon content), and uniform size of around 500 nm  was synthesized via the sol–gel method (Figure S1, Supporting  Information). Then, Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode was charged to 1.7 V  versus Zn/Zn2+ using Zn as anode under a constant current of  0.2  C  and  a  constant  voltage  at  1.7  V.  As  shown  in  Figure  S2,  Supporting  Information,  the  charge  capacity  is  120  mAhg−1,  corresponding  to  two  Na+  extracting  from  Na3V2(PO4)3.  The  XRD peaks of the obtained NaV2(PO4)3 could be indexed to R c3   space group (167). The Rietveld refinement results (Figure 1a;  Table  S1,  Supporting  Information)  indicate  that  NaV2(PO4)3  retained  the  rhombohedral  structure  and  the  lattice  parameters decreased to a = 8.427 Å and c = 21.510 Å, with the volumetric change of −8.6% compared to Na3V2(PO4)3. This is also  consistent  with  the  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  results  indicating  the  reduction  of  the  rhombohedral  unit  cell  from  Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV2(PO4)3, as shown in Table S1, Supporting  Information.  The  remaining  3D  NASICON  framework  with  abundant  unoccupied  sites  in  NaV2(PO4)3  facilitates  the  guest  ions to diffuse in the curved channel. It is known that the bottleneck sizes (the radii of the circumcircles of the corresponding  oxygen triangles, as shown in Figure S16, Supporting Information)  of  two  possible  ionic  migration  channels  in  NaV2(PO4)3  are  ≈2.10  Å,[26,27]  which  is  much  smaller  than  the  zinc-ion  hydrate  radius  (4.30  Å).  Such  bottleneck  sizes  only  allow  the  intercalation  of  Zn2+  species.  The  typical  scanning  transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image and element mapping  results  (Figure  1b)  of  NaV2(PO4)3  electrode  demonstrated  that  the NaV2(PO4)3 particles were uniformly coated by carbon that  provided  excellent  electron  transfer  during  ions  intercalation  into NaV2(PO4)3.the properties electrochemical of  NaV2(PO4)3/Zn  were  tested  in  a  concentrated  electrolyte.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  aqueous  Zn-ion  battery  is  known  to  be  affected  by  the  concentration  of  electrolyte.  Recently, Wang et al.[28] reported a concentrated electrolyte (1  m  Zn(TFSI)2 + 20 m LiTFSI) that greatly improved the stability of  Zn anode and the coulombic efficiency of battery. In our work,  the  electrochemical  performance  of  NaV2(PO4)3/Zn  cells  using  different concentration of Zn triflate as electrolyte was tested. As  shown in Figure S3, Supporting Information, the ionic conductivity  of  the  electrolyte  is  27  mS  cm−1,  which  is  similar  to  the

Charge/discharge  curves  of  the  first  two cycles (Figure S4, Supporting Information) display a severe  overcharge and low coulombic efficiency for the first cycle when  1  m and 2  m Zn triflate were used as electrolyte. Notably, as the  concentration was increased to 3.8  m concentration, the battery  exhibited  the  stable  potential  curves  and  coulombic  efficiency  as well as the desirable cycling stability (Figure 1c,d). It remains  90  mAh  g−1  over  40  cycles  with  almost  100%  coulombic  efficiency (Figure 1d). This value is much higher than that for the  battery using Zn acetate as electrolyte, which was also tested in  our study (Figure S5, Supporting Information) and reported previously.[24] In addition, the curves in Figure S4, Supporting Information,  showed  larger  overpotential  for  the  second  cycle  than  that  in  Figure  1c,  which  might  be  due  to  dissolution  of  active  material  and  side  reaction  between  electrode  and  electrolyte  in  the  low  concentration  of  electrolyte.  These  findings  demonstrate  that  electrochemical  stability  of  aqueous  batteries  can  be  considerably  improved  by  optimizing  electrolyte  composition,  which could eliminate the detrimental effects, such as electrolyte  decomposition,  dissolution  of  active  materials,  and  other  side  interfacial reactions on the electrochemical stability of batteries. Furthermore, we find that the voltage plateau for (de)intercalation of Zn2+ is about 0.2 V lower than that of Na+ (Figure 1c).  The first charge voltage plateau at ≈1.4 V is attributed to the Na+  deintercalation  from  Na3V2(PO4)3  (Figure  1c),  while  the  thermodynamic  equilibrium  potential  from  galvanostatic  intermittent  titration  technique  (GITT)  result  (Figure  S6,  Supporting  Information) for the (de)intercalation of Zn2+ shows flat voltage  plateau at about 1.1/1.2 V in the following discharge/charge process. The first discharge capacity is 102 mAh g−1, corresponding to the intercalation of about 0.86 Zn2+ per ZnNaV2(PO4)3. The  ex  situ  XRD  results  show  that  new  peaks  appeared  when  the  battery was discharged to 1.15 V (Figure S7, Supporting Information)  demonstrating  the  coexistence  of  two  phases  during  the  Zn-ions  (de)intercalation.  This  result  is  consistent  with  our formation energy result for the intermediate compositions  based on the DFT calculations. The thermodynamic formation  energies  of  Zn-ions  in  NaV2(PO4)3  at  a  range  of  different  Zn  concentration  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  (x  =  0.167,  0.333,  0.5,  0.833,  1,  1.167,  1.333,  1.5,  1.667,  and  2)  were  assessed  by  the  DFT.  For  each  concentration,  several  different  potential  site  occupancy  configurations  were  calculated.  It  is  shown  that  the  transition  between  NaV2(PO4)3  and  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  proceeds  as  a  twophase  reaction  (Figure  S8,  Supporting  Information),  and  the  potential of Zn2+ intercalation into NaV2(PO4)3 (NaV2(PO4)3 →  ZnNaV2(PO4)3, 1.254 V) is about 0.25 V lower than that of Na+  intercalation into system (NaV2(PO4)3 → Na3V2(PO4)3, 1.512 V)  (Figure 1e).


To  understand  the  origin  of  structural  stability  and  reversibility  of  the  structural  changes,  the  local  structure  evolution  and  mechanical  stability  of  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  cathode  during  Zn2+  intercalation  were  investigated.  X-ray  absorption  spectra  including  X-ray  absorption  near-edge  structure  (XANES)  and  extended  X-ray  absorption  fine  structure  (EXAFS)  at  V  K-edge  were carried out to identify the reversible local structural change  and charge compensation during charge/discharge. The energy  shift  of  the  absorption  edge  in  normalized  V  XANES  spectra  (Figure 2a) depicts the valence state of V cation of the electrode,  which shows that the absorption edge shifts to lower energies  during  Zn2+  intercalation  and  gradually  increases  to  higher

The dashed lines are the iso-Young’s modulus lines  in GPa. The two dotted lines correspond to G/B = 0.5 and G/B = 0.55. e) Partial density of states of ZnNaV2(PO4)3. The projected density of states for  O-2s2p, V-3d, P-3s3p, Na-3s3p, Zn-3d, and Zn-4s orbitals are illustrated by wine, olive, gray, red, violet, pink colors, respectively, and the total density of  states (TDOS) of ZnNaV2(PO4)3 are shown in orange.

The  edge  position  and  shape  return  to  original  state  of  NaV2(PO4)3  at  the  charged  state,  demonstrating  the  reversible changes in vanadium valence state and local structure  during charging/discharging. The Fourier transformed spectra  of the electrode at fully charged and discharged state are shown  in Figure 2b, which reveal the contributions of individual shells  of  neighboring  atoms  around  vanadium.  Vanadyl  VO  bond  length was obtained by fitting the first shell of EXAFS spectra,  which shows the reversible changes of VO bond length during  charge/discharge. The average VO bond length of the pristine  NaV2(PO4)3 and ZnNaV2(PO4)3 (discharged to 0.8V) is 1.93 and  2.08 Å, respectively, which matches well with our DFT calculation  results  (1.95  Å  for  VO  bond  length  in  NaV2(PO4)3  and  2.05 Å for that in ZnNaV2(PO4)3, respectively), indicating slight  increase  of  VO  bond  length  during  Zn2+  intercalation.  The  reversibility of the structural changes was further confirmed by  ex situ XRD results. When the battery is charged to 1.7 V and  then discharged to 0.8 V, the spectra showed highly reversible  changes  in  the  peak  positions.  During  the  discharge  process,  the  diffraction  peaks  shift  to  lower  angles  compared  to  those  of  NaV2(PO4)3,  indicating  the  lattice  expansion  caused  by  the  intercalation of Zn2+ ions into the NaV2(PO4)3 lattice. The total  volume expansion is ≈4.7%, which is similar with the result of  Zn2+  intercalating  into  monoclinic  LiV2(PO4)3.  Interestingly, such values are smaller than the expansion (≈8.6%) during the  complete sodiation from NaV2(PO4)3 to Na3V2(PO4)3.


To  further  understand  the  effect  of  the  unit  cell  volume  changes  on  electrochemical  and  mechanical  stability  of  the  Zn-NVP-based batteries, we investigated the elastic properties of  the  (Na,  Zn)V2(PO4)3  system.  Full  elastic  tensor  (Cij),  bulk  (B),  shear  (G)  and  Young’s  (E)  moduli,  and  Poisson’s  ratio  (ν)[29,30]  of  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  and  Na3V2(PO4)3  were  calculated  using  DFT,  as  shown  in  Figure  2d  and  Table  S2,  Supporting  Information.  The  relative  elastic  moduli  follow  the  order  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  <  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  <  NaV2(PO4)3.  The  calculated  bulk,  shear  and  Young’s  moduli  (Table  S2,  Supporting  Information)  of  Na3V2(PO4)3 were found to be 95.3, 52.8, and 133.7 GPa, respectively, which were lower than those of ZnNaV2(PO4)3 (102.9, 53.6,  and  136.9  GPa,  respectively),  indicating  that  the  robustness  of  the structure increases on replacing 2Na with Zn in Na3V2(PO4)3.  Moreover, according to the empirical Pugh formula,[31] the ratio  G/B can be used to distinguish the ductile and brittle behavior  of  intermetallic  and  metalloid  compounds.  The  values  of  G/B  for  both  Na3V2(PO4)3  and  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  are  greater  than  0.5.  Therefore,  both  are  brittle  materials.  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  displayed  lower  G/B  (≈0.52)  and  higher  Poisson’s  ratios  (0.28)  than  Na3V2(PO4)3,  which  demonstrates  that  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  is  less  brittle  (Figure  2d).  As  mentioned  above,  the  volume  expansion  of  NaV2(PO4)3  upon  complete  Zn2+  intercalation  was  smaller than that of Na+ intercalation. Although it is a dynamic 

The  electronic  conductivity  is  another  essential  factor  the  electrochemical properties of an electrode. Here, the electronic  total density of states (TDOS) of NaV2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)3, and  ZnNaV2(PO4)3 were calculated to uncover the electronic structure  changes  during  the  Na/Zn-ions  intercalation/deintercalation  process  (Figure  S9,  Supporting  Information).  It  is  shown  that in Na+/Zn2+ intercalated NVP system, the additional electrons  of  3s1(Na)/3d10(Zn)  hybridize  with  the  unoccupied  3d  orbital of V4+ lay at about 1.40 eV (Figure 2d), resulting in the  widening of the bandgap from 1.40 eV in NaV2(PO4)3 to 2.52 eV  in  Na3V2(PO4)3  and  1.90  eV  in  ZnNaV2(PO4)3,  respectively.  More importantly, the higher energy level of Zn-3d orbital than  that  of  Na-3s  orbital  leads  to  lower  energy  of  V-3d/O-2p  antibonding orbitals located at the bottom of the conduction band,  leading  to  a  smaller  bandgap  of  ZnNaV2(PO4)3  (Figure  3e).  Therefore, in general, (de)intercalation of Zn-ions improves the  electronic  conductivity  compared  with  that  of  Na-ions  in  the  NaV2(PO4)3 battery.

Aberration-corrected  STEM  images  with  atomic  resolution  provided  further  information  on  the  Na+/Zn2+  distribution  in 

Na3V2(PO4)3 and ZnxNaV2(PO4)3. Figure 3a–c shows the schematic diagram of the unit structures for Na3V2(PO4)3 (Figure 3a)  and  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  (Figure  3b,c)  along  the  [221]  direction.  High-angle  annular  dark-field  (HAADF)-STEM  images  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  (Figure  3d)  and  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  (Figure  3e,f)  are  shown  in  Figure  3d–f,  in  which  the  bright  spot  (red  circles)  could be attributed to the V atoms due to the Z-contrast nature  of  HAADF-STEM  image.  The  patterns  are  in  good  agreement  with the patterns of atoms in the schematic structure, implying  that  Na3V2(PO4)3  and  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  have  the  same  atomic  arrangement.  From  the  intensity  profile,  the  distance  of  VV  ion  columns  (dv–v)  along  the  marked  direction  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  (0.498  and  0.37  nm)  is  higher  than  that  of  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  (0.463 and 0.347 nm), which confirms the shrinkage of unit cell  of the Zn2+-intercalated NVP system due to the more mechanically stable of the Zn2+-intercalation NVP system to accommodate the strains. More interestingly, compared with the images  of  Na3V2(PO4)3,  the  bright  dots  at  both  M2  sites  and  M1  sites  are clearly visualized in the images of ZnNaV2(PO4)3. Since Na  atoms are not visible in the HAADF images, these bright dots  could be associated only with the occupation of Zn2+ at the M1  and  M2  site.  Thus,  taking  advantage  of  the  contrast  between  Zn2+  and  Na+,  we  used  aberration-corrected  STEM  to  directly  visualize  Zn  distribution  and  confirm  the  mixed  occupancy  of  Na+/Zn2+  at  both  M1  and  M2  sites  in  the  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  system. This observation is different from previous report that  the M1 sites in the rhombohedral NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3  is inactive during Na+ (de)intercalation.[23] However, the conclusion  in  ref.  [23]  was  drawn  based  on  indirect  evidence  of  the  X-ray  powder  diffraction  data  analysis.  In  contrast,  in  Zn-free  NVP  the  M1  remains  inactive.  As  shown  in  Figure  S10, 

A  more  detailed  information  of  the  global  ions-diffusion  paths  in  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  was  obtained  from  the  bond  valence  energy  landscape  (BVEL)  calculations  (Figure  S13,  Supporting  Information).  The  results  indicate  a  high  diffusion  barrier  (up  to  1.0  eV)  for  direct  M2–M2  Zn2+  diffusion  (Figure  S13a,  Supporting  Information),  which  is  consistent  with  the  NEB  results  that  ZnM1  transport  involves  concerted  mechanism  with  the  assistance  of  M1  sites.  More  importantly,  although  M2  is  at  relatively  higher  energy  site  for  Zn2+  occupation,  the   energy barrier for Zn2+ hopping to its neighboring local minima  M1  site  is  not  significantly  high  (≈0.50  eV,  Figure  S13b,  Supporting  Information).  This  facilitates  the  Na+/Zn2+  concerted  migration between M1 and M2 sites in ZnxNaV2(PO4)3.

To  confirm  and  further  kinetically  characterize  the  mixed  occupation of Na+/Zn2+ at both the M1 and M2 sites, we carried  out  ab  initio  molecular  dynamics  simulations.  The  distribution  of  Na+/Zn2+  in  the  structure  was  analyzed  using  Voronoi  decomposition. All possible polyhedral sites of the NaV2(PO4)3  structure,  including  lattice  M1  and  M2  sites,  and  interstitial fivefold oxygen-coordinated M12 site between them were identified (Figure S14a,b, Supporting Information). Then, using the  geometric  hull  analysis,  the  location  of  all  the  Na+  and  Zn2+  ions  was  assigned  to  the  M1O6,  M2O8,  and  M12O5  polyhedra  for each MD snapshot (Figure S14c, Supporting Information).  The  evolution  of  the  M1,  M2,  and  M12  site  occupation  by  Na+  and  Zn2+  sites  over  time  for  NaZn0.125V2(PO4)3  is  shown  in  Figure  4a,b.  It  appears  that  for  most  events  Na+  and  Zn2+  jump from one M1 or M2 site to the adjacent M12 site and then  jump  back.  From  correlating  the  occupation  of  the  adjacent  sites by Na+ and Zn2+, it can be clearly deduced that the ionic  migration takes place by a concerted mechanism involving the  concerted motion of Na+ and Zn2+ ions within 1 ps (Figure 4c,d  and  Figure  S15,  Supporting  Information).  Examination  of  the  snapshot sequences for specific Na+ and Zn2+ pairs, as shown  in  Figure  4c,d,  revealed  that  both  the  Na+  and  Zn2+  located  at  M1 site are pushed by the neighboring M2 ions in a concerted  event,  resulting  in  the  stable  time-averaged  occupation  of  Na+  and Zn2+ at both the M1 and M2 sites. The concerted redistribution  of  Na+and  Zn2+  between  M1  and  M2  sites  observed  in  our AIMD simulations is in complete agreement with the NEB  calculations  and  STEM  results  and  confirm  the  central  role  of  Zn2+  for  the  improvement  of  electrochemical  performance  observed  for  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3.  The  fully  consistent  results  of  both  experimental  and  theoretical  methods  (HAADF-STEM,  AIMD,  CI-NEB,  BVEL)  for  the  first  time  provide  strong  evidence of the mixed occupation of Na+/Zn2+ at the M1 and M2  sites and facile migration of Zn2+ via concerted mechanism in  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3. Generally, the mixed mobile ion effect where a  partial exchange of the mobile ion in a material to another type  of mobile ion leads to a decrease in ionic mobility. However, we  found an exception owing to a concerted hopping mechanism  in this system, where both Na+ and Zn2+ participate. This result  is  similar  to  the  mixed  mobile  ion  effect  in  silver–sodium– phosphate glasses.

In summary, this study clearly demonstrates the viability of  NaV2(PO4)3 as a cathode material for Zn ion aqueous batteries.  The  aberration-corrected  STEM  was  used  to  directly  visualize  Zn2+  distribution  in  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  with  atomic  resolution.  The fully consistent results of both experimental and theoretical  methods  (HAADF-STEM,  AIMD,  CI-NEB,  BVEL)  revealed  for  the first time mixed occupation of Zn at both the M1 and M2  sites  in  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3.  Such  mixed  occupation  is  enabled  by  the concerted migration of Na+/Zn2+ ions between M1 and M2,  which also activates the M1 site for ion (de)intercalation of Zn2+  in  NVP.  Such  mixed  occupation  and  concerted  migration  of  Na+/Zn2+ in ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 during Zn2+ intercalation benefits  stabilizing  the  crystal  structure,  mechanical  properties,  and  electrical conductivity. This fundamental knowledge would help  to  design  the  M1-site  activated  NASICON  cathodes  with  high  reversibility  and  rate  capability.  In  addition  to  improved  cyclability, ZnNaV2(PO4)3 also showed better mechanical properties  allowing to accommodate the strain induced by the ion intercalation.  Further  study  of  the  electronic-structure  suggested  that  the additional electrons of 3d10 Zn2+ increase the electron conductivity  of  ZnxNaV2(PO4)3  compared  to  that  of  Na3V2(PO4)3.  Overall,  the  results  demonstrate  that  the  M1-site  activated  rhombohedral NASICON-type ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits  superior  electrochemical  properties,  high  structural  stability, 

The  Na3V2(PO4)3/C  composite  was  synthesized  by  typical  sol–gel  and  high-temperature  solid-phase  method.  Sodium  acetate  (CH3COONa)  as  sodium  source,  ammonium  metavanadate  (NH4VO3)  as  vanadium  source,  ammonium  dihydrogen  phosphate  (NH4H2PO4)  as  phosphorus  source,  citric  acid  (C6H8O7)  as  complexing  agent  and  carbon  source,  deionized  water  as  solvent  were used as the start materials. The detailed operation was as follows:  4  mmol  NH4VO3  was  dissolved  in  hot  water  at  80  °C;  then  6  mmol  sodium  acetate  and  6  mmol  NH4H2PO4  were  added.  This  caused  the  solution  to  turn  pale  yellow,  and  finally  4  mmol  of  C6H8O7  was   added. The mixture was continuously heated and stirred at 80 °C until  the solvent evaporated and only gelatin remained. The gelatin was dried  at 150 °C in a vacuum oven for 5 h. The resulting powder was ground  in an agate mortar to mix uniformly. Eventually, under the environment  of  H2/Ar  (1:9),  the  dried  powder  was  first  heated  to  400  °C  for  4  h,  and  then  sintered  at  800 °C  for  another  12  h  to  obtain  Na3V2(PO4)3/C  composites.

The  morphology  of  the  obtained  material  was  characterized  by  field  emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  (FE-SEM,  Hitachi  S-4800)  and  high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy  (HRTEM,  JEOL)  with  the  magnifications  ranging  from  10  000×  to  500  000×.  An  aberration-corrected  STEM  (JEOL  2100F,  Tokyo,  Japan)  was  performed.  The  phase  and  structure  of  pristine  Na3V2(PO4)3/C  powders  were  verified  by  XRD  (ADVANCED  D8)  in  the  range of 2-theta from 10° to 80°. The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of  the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample was obtained using a Diamond TG thermos  analyzer.  The  XAS  analysis  was  performed  at  the  optical  dispersive  EXAFS (ODE) beamline at SOLEIL synchrotron, France. The as-prepared  and  charged/discharged  powder  samples  were  ground  in  an  agate  mortar  and  homogeneously  spread  on  a  piece  of  Mylar  film  (75  mm  thick) in an Ar-filled glove box. The samples were sealed with a Kapton  foil  in  the  glove  box  before  being  taken  out  for  XAS  analysis.  XAS  was  recorded in transmission mode at the V k-edge. The spectra of metallic  iron  foil  were  recorded  every  2  h  during  the  measurement,  which  was  used for energy calibration.

The batteries were assembled in air. Active  material, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in a mass  ratio of 8:1:1 were fully mixed in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) to form a  slurry; then the slurry was stirred for 12 h and scraped on a Ti film. After  being dried at 80 °C for 12 h in oven, the cathode was punched as a disk  with a diameter of 10 mm. The Swagelok-type cells were assembled with pure zinc foil as the anode, Na3V2(PO4)3/C as the cathode, and a glass  fiber as the separator. The electrolyte was 3.8 m Zn triflate (3.8 mmol of  Zn triflate was dissolved in 1 g H2O). The charge/discharge and cycling  ability  of  cells  were  recorded  on  a  LAND  battery  test  system  between  0.6  and  1.7  V  versus  Zn/Zn2+.  To  obtain  NaV2(PO4)3  electrode,  the  Na3V2(PO4)3 was charged to 1.7 V at 0.5 C versus Zn/Zn2+ using Zn as  anode under a constant current of 0.2 C and a constant voltage of 1.7 V.  The  electrode  was  taken  out  and  washed  with  DI-H2O  to  remove  the  residual electrolyte. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT)  was performed by charging/discharging at 0.2 C for 1 h and relaxing for  2 h to the equilibrium state and then repeating this process for the full  voltage  window  of  operation.  Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS) of symmetric cell using two stainless-steel plates as electrodes and  glass fiber as separator was tested in the frequency range of 100 kHz to  100  mHz  and  an  excitation  amplitude  of  5  mV.  The  ionic  conductivity  was calculated from EIS results by the formula as follows: where L stands for the thickness of the separator, S stands for the area of  the stainless steel electrode, and R is the resistance of the membranes.
