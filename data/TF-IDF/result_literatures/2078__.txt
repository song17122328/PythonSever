Phospho-silicates compounds of zirconium, bismuth and lead or cadmium were prepared according to a sol-gel process. Lead compound crystallizes in a Nasicon type structure where bismuth and lead only occupy every second M1 site, i.e. the 3b site of R 3# space group. A leaching study at room temperature was performed in acid or basic medium. The maximum value of metal concentration is low even at low pH, and this concentration decreases rapidly when the pH increases. A surface process involving the release of metal and phosphate ions is proposed. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

With time, it appears that human activities have generated many detrimental effects. Among them, the problems of radioactive wastes and heavy metal pollution become crucial.

The problem arising with the storage of such elements is to ﬁnd a matrix which resists geological damages such as leaching and weathering. In the multi-barrier concept to the storage of radioactive elements or heavy metal, the ﬁrst barrier can be made by the matrix itself [1, 2], as in the case of monazite (LnPO4, Ln: rare earth) [3] or boro-silicates glass [4] which exhibit strong resistance to leaching damage.

Lead is a common metal in nature where it is emitted by manufacturing or other human activities. Lead and several other heavy elements such as cadmium or bismuth are considered to have cumulative toxic effects. Synthesis of new materials was undertaken in order to develop a matrix able to immobilize heavy atoms. In the literature, little work has been carried out on the chemical corrosion of phosphate compounds with NaZr2(PO4)3 type structure (noted [NZP]) [5]. We have chosen to study the leaching behavior of compounds pertaining to phospho-silicate family already prepared in [6]. Bi1/3Pb1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3 and Ln1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6, Ln 5 La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Er, Yb, were synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction. A structural information has been obtained from spectroscopic studies of Ln1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6: Eu31 phases [7].

This paper reports the crystal and chemical studies of Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 phases, and gives the results of leaching study performed at room temperature, in aqueous medium using variable pH.

The synthesis of Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 was performed by the sol-gel route according to Bakhous et al.’s process [6]. The cadmium source was an aqueous solution of Cd(NO3)2, 4H2O. The temperatures and times for crystals to grow were about 700°C, 24 hours, and 750°C, 48 h, for lead and cadmium phases respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained at room temperature using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer and CuKa radiation. Cell reﬁnements were performed using cellref, a program based on least squares method [8]. The collection of intensities necessary for the structure reﬁnements of the Bi1/3Pb1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3 phase was performed on a Seifert XRD 3000TT diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator set on the diffracted beam. XRD patterns were recorded using the CuKa radiation in the 2u range (10 –120°) with a 0.02° (2u) step size and 36 second counting time. Table 1 gathers the experimental conditions of measurements and the results of the Rietveld reﬁnement, Fullprof [9].

The behavior of the compounds containing Bi, Pb and Cd elements versus pH of aqueous solutions was followed at room temperature. This study was performed in an acid medium— perchloric acid (non-complexing agent), nitric acid (complexing agent) [10]—and basic medium (NaOH). The operating process was the following: for each experience, 200 mg of powder were mixed with 6 cm3 of acid or basic solutions (the concentrations of the acid solutions varied from 1 M to 1024 M and those of basic solutions from 10214 M to 1027 M) in a glass container. Samples were stirred continuously during a month. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm during 15 mn using a Sigma-202MC, the solutions were ﬁltered on a Sartorius

The XRD patterns of compounds Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 are similar to that of [NZP] [5]. They can be indexed in the rhombohedral system with space group R 3# or R32. Cell parameters, using a hexagonal type cell, are presented in Table 2. The speciﬁc mass determined by picnometry allows to determine the multiplicity of the formula unit.

The comparison of the cell parameters of Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3 phases with those of M0.5Zr2(PO4)3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 phases [11] reveals that the increase of the average ionic

This behavior shows the size effect of the ion M, which might indicate an occupation of these ions in sites M1 (6b) of the [NZP] structure. Furthermore, the lowering of symmetry from R 3#c to R 3# could be due to vacancies, which appear in every second M1 site [12].

The thermal stability of these compounds was studied by XRD from room temperature to 1400°C. The decomposition starts at about 900°C with formation of b-Zr2P2O9 and BiPO4 in addition to [NZP] type compound; moreover a variation of composition occurs when temperature increases.

The Rietveld method [13], was used to reﬁne the XRD powder pattern of Bi1/3Pb1/6 Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3 phase. In the ﬁrst attempt, the coordinates of the NaZr2(PO4)3 atoms were taken as starting point. Reﬁnements in the space group, R32, lead to large agreement factors and inter-atomic distances without physical meaning. The second attempt performed with space group R 3#, as in Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 [14], gave better results. An assignment of Bi/Pb, Zr and O to two series of independent sites was chosen. Both reﬁnements lead to a rejection of an occupation of site M2 (18e, space group R 3#c) by any atoms.

Next, a statistical distribution of Bi or Pb in sites (3a) (0 0 0) and (3b) (0 0 2) of R 3# space group was tried. Reﬁnement led to acceptable agreement factors with an occupation factor of one site equal to zero and a quite high thermal displacement factor. But, if all Bi or Pb atoms were located in one of the (3a) or (3b) sites, the agreement factors decreased to 5 0.05. Figure 1 shows the comparison between experimental and RBragg calculated patterns. Final atomic coordinates and thermal displacement factors are gathered with occupation assignments in Table 3. Selected inter-atomic distances and bond angles are displayed in Table 4.

The Bi and Pb atoms were distributed only in (3b) site. The structure is built up on a tridimensional network made of ZrO6 octahedra and (P, Si)O4 tetrahedra sharing corners. The ZrO6 octahedra are distorted as revealed by Zr-O distances ranging from 2.02Å to 2.09Å, and 2.05Å to 2.24Å for Zr1 and Zr2 sites, respectively (Table 4). The distortion of (P, Si)O4 tetrahedra can be observed looking at the O-(P, Si)-O angles which range from 93(2)° to 120(2)° (average 109(2)°) and (P, Si)-O distances, from 1.44(6)Å to 1.57(2)Å (average 1.51(4)Å). These distances enter the domain of P-O or Si-O bond distances commonly agreed [15]. Such distortions were already observed in compounds containing lone pair elements [16] or metals with distorted surrounding [17, 18]. The (P, Si)O4 group appears very sensitive to its surrounding. The (Pb, Bi)-O distances of 2.64(6)Å are longer 31 1 than the sum (2.48Å) of the atomic radii of corresponding atoms assuming rM 21)]/3 5 1.08Å [19]. This infers that bonds around Bi or Pb are probably of the ionic type. rPb The IR spectra of phosphate compounds exhibit three groups of bands corresponding respectively to: the stretching of P-O bonds (v1 and v3 between 1250 and 900 cm21), the bending of O-P-O bonds (v2 and v4 between 700 and 400 cm21) and the phonons (400 –50 cm21). Figure 2 presents the IR spectra of Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 compounds together with the one of NaZr2(PO4)3. The Bi-M spectra exhibit a number of bands more intense than those of sodium compound, which generally indicates a decrease of the symmetry of the (P, Si)O4 group [20]. Table 5 lists the infrared absorption frequencies. The IR spectra of the Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3 compounds show a shift of the stretching bands (v1 and v3) towards high frequencies with respect to those of the Na compound. This

can be attributed to the occupation of every second M1 site of the Nasicon structure (site 3a non occupied, site 3b occupied, space group R 3#), which leads to a more effective distortion of the tetrahedral groups [21], the cationic surrounding of these groups being perturbed by these vacancies.

The leaching in acid medium, perchloric or nitric, of the Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 phases was performed in order to study the stability of these phases towards the attack of H3O1 ions and the associated anions (ClO4

However, it must be noticed that leaching in acid medium comes with an augmentation of 32 anions was performed in conjunction the leachant pH. A quantitative analysis of the PO4 32 ions was determined from the pH with the Cd analyses. The concentration of the PO4 variation that occurs during the leaching process. The equation used involved the threeequilibrium dissociation constants of H3PO4:

Dimerisation of H3PO4 was ignored because of its lower concentration in examined media [22].

that of Cd [10]. Nevertheless, this behavior can be understood assuming that Bi is more strongly bonded to PO4 in the crystal than is Cd.

In the case of Bi1/3Pb1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3, Figure 5 reports the variation of lead concentration versus the pH of the leaching solution. In HClO4 medium, lead concentration decreases quickly in the 0 # pH # 4 range and slowly for pH $ 4. In HNO3 medium, Pb concentration was immeasurable for pH $ 2. The comparison of these results allows to observe a greater release of lead in perchloric medium than in nitric one, particularly in the 2– 4 pH domain. Taking into account the complexing phenomenon, this result appears 2 [10], with a unrealistic because NO3 larger concentration of Pb21 in NO3 2 expected. This infers that solubility in that case managed not only by complexation but also by other unknown physic-chemical phenomena. 32 anions at various pH was calculated according to 1. This 32] vs. pH

concentration decreases when pH increases (Figure 5). 

The variation of Bi concentration in solution versus pH is presented in Figure 6. The solubility of this element decreases when the pH of the solution increases. This behavior is similar to the one already observed with Cd in both HClO4 and HNO3 leachater (see Figure 4). The comparison of the Bi and Pb yields in perchloric and nitric solutions shows that the release of Bi is larger than the Pb one. This can be due to a combination of the amount of Bi and Pb in the starting material and of the charge and the size of the corresponding ions. 21 5 1.19Å) [19]. Effectively, Bi31 ions are Bi31 is smaller than Pb21 (rBi more complexed by PO4

32 than Pb21 in aqueous medium [23, 24].

In order to know the effect of leaching on the crystallinity of the materials, XRD powder pattern samples were compared before and after leaching. No variation of the patterns was observed with no modiﬁcation of the position and intensity of the reﬂections.

The study of the basic pH domain (7 # pH # 14) reveals smaller concentrations of Cd, Pb and Bi in the leaching solution than in acid condition. Consequently, the hydrolysis effect may not affect the solubility of the compounds. If this phenomenon occurs, an increase of the cations concentration must be observed. So, the low dissolution at high pH is only favored 32 ions of the surface of the materials, normally low in this pH by dissolution of the PO4 domain. A similar dissolution mechanism has already been observed in lead glasses [25,26]. An attack of the surface of the solid and a release of phosphate ions is followed by complexation in aqueous medium of Cd21, Pb21 and Bi31 by PO4 32, which favors the solubility of these cations.

The phosphosilicates Bi1/3M1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3; M 5 Cd21, Pb21 have been synthesized by a sol-gel process. Their structure is of [NZP] type and corresponds to rhombohedral system, space group R 3#. Using this space group, a powder structure reﬁnement by Rietveld method of the lead phase was carried on. It indicates that only the M1 (3b) site, of the two possible M1 sites, is ﬁlled by Bi31 and Pb21 ions. These compounds present a great resistance to dissolution even in acid medium. At room temperature, the mass concentration of lead, cadmium and bismuth in the leaching solution (HNO3, 1M) are 0.5%, 1.9% and 2% respectively. The release of these cations occurs during a surface process accompanied by a release of phosphate ions, which complex the considered cations. These materials of Nasicon type structure can be considered as good candidates to immobilize heavy atoms detrimental to environment. A similar study at higher temperature should be extended to other toxic metals.
