Li2O-Al2O3-GeO2-P2O5 (LAGP) glass ceramics (GC) has potential for use as solid state electrolyte in Li-ion rechargeable batteries with better safety and thermal stability. In this work LAGP glass-ceramics with nominal composition of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5P2.9Si0.1O12, have been prepared and structural studies have been carried out to understand the effect of Al3+ and Si4+substitution in place of Ge4+ and P5+. Glass was prepared using melt quenching technique and converted into glass-ceramics by controlled heat treatment. We observed that the entire glass has changed in to crystalline form. Phase formation was confirmed using XRD (X-ray diffraction) and ND (Neutron diffraction). Rietveld refinement analysis was used for structural analysis using both ND and XRD data. Analysis showed better refinement in ND and the nuclear density information of two different positions of Li+ ion (M1&M2) was revealed from Fourier maps using ND data. This helps to predict the pathway of Li diffusion in the structural units and optimize the conductivity of material. Results showed expansion of c-axis and reduction of a-axis with substitution of Al3+ in place of Ge+4. Bottleneck for Li+ ion conduction found to increase making an easier path for conduction. The study was further correlated from the recorded local structural data using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman Spectroscopy.

Li-based NASICON (NaSuper-Ionic Conductor) type materials (LiM(IV)2(PO4)3, M(IV): Ge, Ti, Zr etc.) show high ionic transport properties and find a potential application in Li-ion batteries as solid state electrolyte. These are currently used in Li-ion battery over the flammable liquid electrolytes [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] to address the issue of safety. Apart from improved Li-ion conductivity, this kind of solid state electrolyte also showed good water/air stability for use as separator in Li-air battery [7], [8], [9], [10]. In SSEs ionic conduction mechanism is primarily governed by the microstructure and the local environment of the conducting ion. It is very much necessary to study the unit cell structure of the NASICON to understand and optimize the mobility of Li+ ion in the material, to achieve a desirable ionic conductivity value.

In NASICON structure (space group: R-3c), columns of M(IV)O6 octahedra are linked with PO4 tetrahedra [11] and the MO6 octahedra locates on the three-fold axis of the unit cell. Li+ ion reside at the center of the trigonal antiprism in [M(IV)2P3O12]-framework and this is a low packing density structure built with vortex-sharing polyhedral (M(IV)O6, PO4) [12]. The low packing density indicates that there are a number of coordination sites for cations (+). The M1 position of the Li+ ions, is 6-fold coordinated and fully occupied. There is another position, M2 which is 8-fold coordinated and it is initially unoccupied. But during addition of Al3+ ions the occupancy of M2 is increased as additional Li+ ions start filling that position to balance charge. Each M1 site is concurrently surrounded by six M2 sites, and, accordingly, the multiplicity of the M2 site is three times that of M1 [13]. The main restriction to the Li+ ion motion comes from the window between the M1 and M2 positions made of three oxygen atoms which are bonded to Ge atom. In most of the LiM(IV)2(PO4)3 compounds, Li+ ion occupy almost exactly at M1 position, while LiZr2(PO4)3 shows distorted tetrahedral coordination around the M1 site [14]. Substitution with trivalent metal ion according to the formula Li1+xM(III)xM(IV)1-xP3O12(M: Al, Cr, Ga etc. 0 <x < 1) creates new Li+ ion population at M2 site for charge neutrality.

Earlier, some studies on NASICON-type phases have already been carried out using neutron diffraction [15], [16], [17]. Among them, single crystal X-ray and powder neutron diffraction study on NASICON-type Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (0 ≤x ≤ 0.5) crystal was carried out by Redhammer et al. [18]. They also found the second position of lithium at (0.07,0.34,0.09) which is later denoted as M2. Two different wavelengths (1.333 and 2.665 Å) of neutrons were used in their study. Similar study on Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns of NASICON-type Li1.2 + xTi1.9−xFexCa0.1(PO4)3 (x = 0.1–0.4) samples were also carried out by Gregorio F. Ortiz et al. [19]. They revealed existence of an orthorhombic (Pnma) phase along with the major phase R-3c. The substitution of Ti4+ by Fe3+ and Ca2+ causes an increase in unit cell parameters of the rhombohedral phase. Structural studies using NMR and X-ray diffraction of Li1-xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 were carried out by Maud Barre et al. In this study, Rietveld refinement of the XRD revealed that at room temperature the structures are R-3 and P-3 for 0.6 ≤x ≤ 0.9 and x = 1.0 respectively, while R-3c space group was observed for 0 ≤x ≤ 0.5 [20]. M Guin et al. studied the structural investigation of the substitutional disorder and position of the Na+ ion in Na3+xSc2SixP3-xO12 (0 <x < 0.8) samples using Neutron diffraction analysis [21]. In this study, the refinement of the structure showed two phases, one rhombohedral Si-rich phase and another monoclinic Na3Sc2P3O12 phase. Similarly, Kahlaoui et al. studied the structure of NASICON-type Li1-xTi2-xNbx(PO4)3 (0 ≤x ≤ 0.5) compounds. For the Li rich (x ≤ 0.1) samples, they got the values of residual factor of weighted pattern between 9.3% and 10.4% and for Nb rich (x > 0.2) samples, it is from 11.2% to 18.9%. In the same study the value of P-O distances for Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 sample are between 1.52(2) and 1.56(8) [22]. It is found that when low Z elements are present in the sample, neutron diffraction shows more accuracy in refining the structural parameters.

In present work we aim to see the structural changes in NASICON phase due to substitution of Ge4+ by Al3+ and Si4+ in place of P5+ atom. Additional Li+ ion was incorporated to balance the charge neutrality. The Li2O-Al2O3-GeO2-P2O5 (LAGP) glass ceramic sample was prepared by melt-quench technique followed by controlled crystallization. The material shows good ionic conductivity value of 2.45  10−4 S/cm at RT [23]. Joint Rietveld refinement analysis was done using both neutron diffraction data and X-ray diffraction data to get the crystallographic positions and crystal chemical environment of the Li+ ions and predict the channels of Li ion conduction. To complement the long range structural studies, local structure using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were carried out which help in prediction of the size of the bottleneck for conduction path.

Glass sample with composition Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5P2.9Si0.1O12 (LAGP1) is prepared by standard melt-quench technique. One batch of 100 g weight was prepared by taking initial constituents, in the form of carbonate and di-ammonium hydrogen phosphate of proportionate amount. The charge was calcined by holding the batch at decomposition temperature of each initial constituent for sufficient time. The calcination process was repeated to ensure complete decomposition after through mixing&grinding. The calcined charge was mixed and ground properly and melted in a Pt-Rh crucible at around 1450–1550 °C. The melt was held at the melting temperature for 1–2 h for homogenization and poured on a metal plate. The glass was annealed at around 400–450 °C for 4–6 h and cooled down to room temperature slowly.

Nature of crystalline phases formed in the glass ceramics (GC) sample was identified using powder X-ray diffractometric technique (XRD) (Model Bruker 8 tools) with Cu Kα was used as radiation source. The scanning was done in the two theta range of 14–70°, with step width of 0.02° and scan rate of 0.5 s/step. For the structural characterization, neutron diffraction data was collected with the linear 5-PSD based powder diffractometer at 100 MW Dhruva Research Reactor at BARC, Mumbai, in the two-theta range of 8–135° [24]. The total data collection time was 15 h. About 5 g of sample was packed in a vanadium can and diffraction data were collected in Debye–Scherrer mode. The other details of the neutron diffraction data collection parameters are given in Table 1. Micro Raman spectroscopy was done using a micro-Raman instrument model: Invia-Reflex (M/s Renishaw, UK) with 532 nm laser as excitation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was carried out in a DESA-150 electron analyser coupled with Mg Kα (1253.26 eV) X-ray source. B.E of the instrument was calibrated with Au-4f7/2 photo peak at 83.95 eV.

Joint Rietveld refinement was carried out with the collected XRD and ND data using FullProof software [25]. This gives us a structural model agreeing with both XRD&ND data giving us high confidence in the obtained model. Pseudo-Voigt profile function was used for Refinement process. Initially the zero shift, displacement, transparency and scale factor were refined. Automatic background point file was created using WinPLOTR software and used as the initial values. Background was refined with linear interpolation between two given points. Subsequently, unit cell parameter, background, FWHM and shape parameters were further refined. Instrumental FWHM parameters were used as the initial values. After refining the positional co-ordinates and Debye-Waller factors, site occupancies were refined. Neutron diffraction helps in the accurate determination of occupancies and positions of light elements like Lithium&oxygen while X-ray Diffraction data helps for heavy elements. Initial values of the site occupancy multiplier were calculated from the stoichiometric composition given in Table 2. All the estimated standard deviations were multiplied by multiplier obtained using the method outlined by Berar et al. [26], [27].

Joint Rietveld refinement was carried out using the collected neutron and X-ray diffraction data with the model based on the typical NASICON structure: space group R-3c and unit cell parameters given in ICSD file of pure LiGe2(PO4)3. The observed and calculated neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The details of various profile parameters and structural parameters obtained are shown in Table 2. A minor amount (0.63 wt%) of Li2Ge4O9 impurity phase was detected in ND pattern only during the refinement, along with the major NASICON phase of 99.37% weight fraction. Simulated NASICON unit cell and its projection on b-c plane, using the joint Rietveld refinement, are shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). Here GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are linked to each other [28], [29]. Li+ ions reside in two positions: M1 (0,0,0) site (6-fold co-ordination), which is directly located between two GeO6 octahedra and M2 (0.07,0.34,0.08) site (8-fold co-ordination), which is located between two columns of GeO6 [30], [31], [32]. In the absence of Al3+, Li+ ions occupy only M1 position, but with Al3+substitution, M1 occupancy decreases and M2 occupancy increases resulting an electrostatic repulsion between these two sites (M1&M2) and to minimize the repulsive effect, Li+ ion preferentially occupies M2 position [33]. The obtained refined unit cell parameters are Å, Å. These values indicate the insertion of Li+ ion into M2 position and Al3+ ion into the center of the octahedral, due to Li-O attractive force with nearest oxygen atoms in - plane. Thus the value of  is reduced and as M1 occupancy is reduced, the attractive force between Li+ and surrounding oxygen atoms of GeO6 get reduced. Simultaneously, the repulsion of two octahedral groups increases the value of c-axis [34]. Site occupancies were refined, at the same time, and the values are given in Table 3. These values suggest the decrease in M1 occupancy and the insertion of Al and Si atoms in place of Ge and P respectively. Refined atomic positions of the atoms are also given in Table 3.

Fig. 4 shows the observed Fourier map of the nuclear densities of Li1 and Li2 positions using GFourier program. Both Li1 and Li2 positions are observed with considerable interatomic distance. Interatomic distances and angles are given in Table 4. The bond lengths of Al/Ge-O in distorted GeO6 are 1.86(1) Å and 1.89(1) Å which are slightly more than the values as reported for LiGe2(PO4)3 [30], because of the lower electronegativity of Al atoms than the Ge atoms. Assuming Li atoms to be located at M1 and M2 sites the average values of Li1-O and Li2-O bond lengths are 2.260(9) Å and 2.370(9) Å respectively. These values are larger than those for non-substituted LiGe2(PO4)3 because the Li ions located at M2 positions attract the oxygen atoms linked to M1 positions and increase the bottleneck size. Fig. 5 shows the close view of the polyhedra and the Li1, Li2 positions. From the calculated unit cell using the refinement, it is observed that each Li1 atom is surrounded by six Li2 atoms which is consistent with the earlier reported data. PO4 tetrahedra shows weak angular dispersion of the O-P-O angle between 103.1(1)° to 115.3(9)° around the ideal value of 109.45° [30]. The value of average distance of P-O1 and P-O2 is 1.51(1) Å, which is less than the reported values for LiGe2(PO4)3 (1.525 Å) [30], [35]. This may be because of Si4+ substitution in place P5+ site. More angular dispersion shows flexibility of the structure allowing easy migration of ions.

XPS study was carried out to get information about site occupancies, oxidation state and see their neighboring coordination. The BEs (binding Energies) of Li1s, Al2p, Ge3d, Si2p and P2p are summarized in Table 5. Fig. 6 shows the presence of a broad peak of Li 1s present around 55 eV. On deconvolution showed two subpeaks positioned at 55.2 and 56.4 eV. These indicate the existence of populated M1 and M2 positions by Li atoms. The high BE of M2 sites imply high ionicity of the Li-O bond causing a high mobility of Li+ ion [36]. There is a slight change in BE value for Al2p as compared to Al2O3 given in literature because of the different surroundings of Al atom in LAGP (Fig. 7). The BE value of 75 eV of Al2p could be attributed to Al-O bond in AlO6 [37]. Fig. 8 shows the deconvoluted Ge3d peak. Lower BE at 33.1 eV indicates the Ge-O bond in GeO6 octahedra and this value is slightly higher than the value as reported for GeO2 which implies that Ge4+-O bonds are more ionic in this system than any other compound consisting Ge4+ ion surrounded by oxygen atoms [37], [38]. On the other hand, the higher subpeak at 34.1 eV is may be due to Ge-O-Li bond because Li+ ions reside between GeO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in the crystal and Ge is more electronegative than Li. The observed P2p peak, shown in Fig. 9, is at the BE of 134.3 eV. This peak includes the contributions from P-O-P or P = O bond and P-O-(Li, Ge, Al) because the electronegativity is higher than the other atoms present in this system [39]. Si2p peak has been observed at 102.9 eV and this could be attributed to the existence of Si4+-O in the sample. Fig. 10 is shown the XPS peak of O1s deconvoluted into two subpeaks: 530.9 and 531.8 eV. The low energy component is due to non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms and the high energy component is because of bridging oxygen (BO) atoms. These two distinct contribution can be understandable as glass-ceramics samples are consisted of crystalline materials grown in a glassy matrix [37].

Raman spectra was recorded to see the local structure and bonding of LAGP glass ceramics. As local structuring has high impact on the size of the bottleneck of the conduction pathway, it is important to have the idea of the local structure in LAGP glass ceramic sample. Fig. 11 shows Raman spectra of LAGP glass ceramics recorded in the range of 200–1300 cm−1. Figure shows the presence of number of broad bands in the region of 300–530 cm−1, 550–650 cm−1 and in the range of 900–1200 cm−1. These bands are corresponding to the bending, symmetric and antisymmetric stretching of the different PO4 structural units [32], [35]. In NASICON mainly PO4 structural units are responsible for Raman scattering. In LAGP glass ceramic structure it is seen that these PO4 groups are linked between columns of GeO6/AlO6octahedra, sharing the oxygen atoms with Ge4+/ Al+3 and Li+ ions in the structure. In the spectra the bands present within 300–530 cm−1, are due to both P-O-Ge and P-O-Al bending modes, whereas the bands observed in the range of 500–800 cm−1 are due to asymmetric bendings of PO4 structural units [32], [35]. In general Ge-O-P bending vibrations is seen around 580 cm−1 for GeO4 structural units whereas bands at higher values around 660 cm−1 are seen due to Ge-O-P bending modes. The high value of the bending frequencies is understandable because in Ge-O-P there is a greater crowding of O due to GeO6 groups, which makes Ge-O-P bending more difficult. The bands observed above 900 cm−1 are assigned to symmetric stretching of PO4 tetrahedra. The vibrational features of the phosphate group in the region between remain intense, and the subpeaks in this region reflect an increase in the degree of modification in their local structure due to Al substitution. Particularly the bands at around 1008 cm−1 are attributable to P-O-Ge6 which are higher than P-O-Ge4 stretching at around 950 cm−1. Fig. 12 shows the deconvoluted and expanded feature of the band located in the range of 900–1200 cm−1. It is clear from the figure that the deconvoluted peaks are broader as compared to LGP shown in reference [32]. According to Barj et al. the peak broadening in Raman spectra comes from the disordered PO4 tetrahedra [40], [41]. In Al substituted NASICON it is seen that as ionic radii of both Al+3 and Ge+4 are very close to each other and therefore the broadening in the peaks can be explained due to formation of new Li-O bonds at M2 site which necessarily affect the P-O bonding and create broadening in the Raman spectra [33], [42].

XRD and ND confirm the formation of Lithium Germanium Phosphate (LGP), NASICON phase in the Glass ceramic system. Substitution of Al showed a peak shift in both the patterns. Joint Rietveld refinement of ND and XRD shows quite accurate structure of the crystal. The nuclear density map shows the positions of the Li1 and Li2 sites. The refined results show higher value of Li-O than the unsubstituted phase. This increases the size of bottleneck making an easy path for ionic conduction. Analysis shows an increase of c-axis and decrease of a-axis with substitution. Because of the presence of both lighter (Li, Al, P, Si, O) and heavier (Ge) atoms, joint refinement of ND and XRD has more usefulness for the structural analysis of NASICON phase. Local structural analysis using XPS and Raman spectroscopy also confirmed the alteration of local structure and its effect on size of the conduction pathways.
