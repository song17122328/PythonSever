This work shows, for the first time, the critical influence of pressure during the hot sintering stage on the ionic conductivity of the lithium super ionic conductor Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. A hot press method is developed to obtain high ionic conductivities at the significantly decreased densification temperature of only 650 °C by applying pressure (56 MPa). Considering the possible initiation of undesirable decomposition reactions when cathode materials are annealed at high temperature (typically ≥700 °C), the use of high pressure at 650 °C can significantly limit the formation of degradation by-products. This study determines the criteria required to optimize the pressure and temperature parameters for enhancing the total ionic conductivity. Finally, this study reports an all solid-state battery based on a LiFePO4 olivine cathode prepared at 650 °C showing very good Li-intercalation/deintercalation performance. Good ionic interfacial contact is achieved without using polymer and liquid electrolyte.
The world is moving toward a green revolution in order to reduce pollution and the CO2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Lithium batteries represent a transformational technology for powering electric vehicles (EVs).[1] Our society needs increasingly safe and high-performance energy storage devices. Lithium metal is regarded as the best anode for the nextgeneration of rechargeable batteries.[2] Indeed, replacing graphite with metallic lithium at the negative electrode will be at least double the specific energy values of those of today's lithium ion batteries, depending on the cathode chemistry. However, in actual practice, the use of lithium metal as an anode with a flammable liquid electrolyte[3] is limited by the possible formation of lithium dendrites,[4] which can cause dangerous short circuits. The use of a solid electrolyte represents a quantum leap because it can act as a physical barrier to prevent short circuits while increasing the battery's energy density and safety enabling all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB). Several solid electrolytes based on polymer,[5] ceramic,[6] or hybrid polymer–ceramic[7] materials have been proposed in the literature. One critical issue with the processing of ceramic solid electrolytes is their high-temperature densification (over 800 °C) over a long period of sintering. For example, garnet lithium lanthanum zirconate (mainly Li7La3Zr2O12 with gallium or aluminum doping) requires at least 1000 °C for 10–12 h,[8] while the super ionic conductor (NASICON) structure forms at ≈850 °C after 5 h.[9] A long period of sintering at a high temperature (over 700 °C) is not chemically compatible with commercial cathode stability. Moreover, at high temperature, a side reaction occurs between the high-voltage cathode and garnet, forming insulating side products, such as cobalt lanthanate.[10] Thus a lower temperature (<700 °C) is highly desirable to enable an all ceramic battery. Since 2012, Sakamoto's group has been a pioneer in the preparation of Li7La3Zr2O12 pellets by combining temperature and high pressure in a hot press.[11] A few studies have been reported in the literature on hot-pressing methods to densify the NASICON-type solid electrolyte Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP). In 2019, Kotobuki et al.[12] reported a multi-step process to densify LAGP using a hot press at 600 °C under Ar, followed by sintering under air at 800 °C for 8 h. The final preparation of a solid-state cathode is still challenging. In 2018, Yu et al.[13] reported a full battery
based on Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. The authors prepared a pellet at 1100 °C in an air atmosphere. Then, an anode composed of LiTi2(PO4)3/C powder, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 solid electrolyte powder, carbon black powder, ethyl cellulose, and a binder powder at a weight ratio of 45:25:15:15 was coated on the surface of the pellet by adding N-methyl pyrrolidone as a solvent. The cathode was prepared by following the same method, while replacing LiTi2(PO4)3 with Li3V2(PO4)3. In relation to the atmosphere used, it is impossible to sinter a cathode for ASSLB in the presence of oxygen because the conductive carbon would be oxidized. Thus, an inert atmosphere becomes mandatory. The present study investigated the use of a hot press for NASICON densification. It was observed that (a) the LAGP solid electrolyte could be densified at a moderate temperature (600–650 °C instead of 850–950 °C) by applying an external pressure in the hot press for a short period (1 h) instead of using a long sintering process of 10–15 h, as reported in literature; (b) the LAGP was significantly affected by the inert atmosphere during sintering at high temperature because it easily lost oxygen, forming reduced metallic germanium (GeIV → Ge0), segregated to AlPO4, and nanoscale LiGe2(PO4)3. Moreover, this paper reports the preparation of a complete solid battery at 650 °C using LiFePO4 as the cathode, which demonstrated a capacity of ≈115 mAh g−1 after 10 cycles when using a current density of C/30 and temperature of 80 °C.
LAGP pellets were sintered in an argon-filled hot press based on commercial sub-micron particles (see Section 4 and Figure S.1, Supporting Information, for more details). The influence of the pressure during the sintering process was studied. Figure 1a shows the micrograph of LAGP pellet after conventional sintering at 850 °C for a long period in air. Figure 1b shows LAGP hot-pressed pellets at 650 °C, the density obtained (≥99%) under the condition of 650 °C/112 MPa/1 h—is higher than that from the conventional sintering at 850 °C/10 h. The conductivities of the LAGP pellets fabricated at 650 °C under different pressure conditions were evaluated using the AC impedance technique. Their corresponding AC impedance plots, presented in Figure 2a, were compared with that for the pellet prepared according to the standard method at 850 °C without applying pressure. The ceramic samples were characterized by one depressed semicircle at the high-frequency region, representing the total impedance, which included the mixed bulk and grain boundary impedances. These two independent phenomena were not well separated in the impedance spectra because of the temperature range selected (20–80 °C) but were easily seen at lower temperatures.[14] The low-frequency intercept of the semicircle on the Re(Z) axis corresponded to the sum of the grain and grain boundary resistances that were used to calculate the total ionic resistance.[15,16] The experimental data were fitted with an equivalent circuit that is usually employed to interpret LAGP impedance spectra. It was composed of a series of resistances (R) and constant phase elements. Finally, a constant-phase element, attributed to the blocking interfaces between the silver-paste-covered electrodes and LAGP ceramic electrolyte, was used to match the inclined line obtained at low frequencies.[17,18]
The total ionic conductivities (σ) for all the samples were calculated using Equation (1), and taking into account the total ionic resistance and sample dimensions for each pellet:
where l, A, and R represent the thickness of the LAGP pellet, area in contact with the stainless-steel electrode, and total ionic resistance, respectively.
The Arrhenius plots in a temperature range of 80 °C (353 K) to 20 °C (293 K) for the LAGP-850 (▪), LAGP-650-0MPa (○), LAGP650-56MPa (▾), and LAGP-650-112MPa (▴) pellets are presented in Figure 2b. The method of densification (i.e., temperature and pressure) strongly impacted the ionic conductivities. Values of approximately 1.22 × 10−4, 1.99 × 10−5, 2.25 × 10−4, and 3.29 × 10−4 S·cm−1 were calculated at 20 °C for the LAGP-850, LAGP650-0MPa, LAGP-650-56MPa, and LAGP-650-112MPa pellet samples, respectively. According to SEM images of the pellet surfaces (Figure 1b, left), at 650 °C with no pressure applied, many large pores are seen due to poor densification of the ceramic electrolyte under pressureless condition. Consequently, the resistance associated with the grain boundaries (Rgb) increased, and the total ionic conductivity was approximately one order lower than that obtained for an LAGP pellet densified at 850 °C. Interestingly, applying a constant pressure of 56 or 112 MPa to the pellet during sintering at 650 °C led to better ionic conductivities than that for the standard LAGP pellet sintered at 850 °C with no pressure. This is in accordance with SEM analysis that revealed more homogeneous microstructure with lower porosity. This densification technique is particularly interesting because it can lead to lowering fabrication cost by considerably reducing the sintering temperature and time.
The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity makes it possible to calculate the activation energies for all the samples by applying the Arrhenius equation:
Based on the Arrhenius plots of Figure 2b, activation energies ranging from 0.34 to 0.44 eV were calculated for the different LAGP pellets. These values are similar to those generally reported for this NASICON type ceramic electrolyte[14–19] although some variations have been observed as a result of using various sintering and compaction methods, which evidently affect the microstructures and densities of ceramics.[20] However, for the same sintering temperature (i.e., 650 °C), the activation energy for Li-ion transport in the LAGP pellet seemed to decrease when the applied pressure was increased. Thus, values of 0.44, 0.41, and 0.34 eV were obtained for solid electrolytes fabricated at 650 °C with no pressure, and under constant pressures of 56 and 112 MPa, respectively. As the intrinsic grain conductivity is the same for the three samples, the differences obtained here reflect the grain boundary effect. With high density and large grain size, the grain boundaries contribute less to the ionic resistance, as shown in Figure 2a.
During our investigation, we observed that when a high pressure was applied at a temperature higher than 750 °C resulted in the formation of dark blackish pellets instead of those obtained at 750 °C with a standard white/grey color, as shown in Figure 3a. After hot-pressing sintering at 750 °C, the pellets looked thinner than those formed at 650 °C, suggesting the (a) denser LAGP and (b) formation of gaseous species. At a temperature >650 °C, the pellets became very fragile and difficult to handle. The EIS data and corresponding Arrhenius plots for the LAGP-600-56 MPa, LAGP-650-56MPa, and LAGP-75056MPa pellets are shown in Figure 3b,c. The beneficial effect of combining a high temperature and pressure during sintering was validated by maintaining a pressure of 56 MPa and increasing the temperature from 650 °C to 750 °C. In fact, the total ionic conductivity was slightly higher when the sintering temperature was increased to 750 °C. Below 650 °C the ionic conductivity is strongly reduced: applying 600 °C and 52 MPa the ionic conductivity at room temperature is 4.16 10−5 S·cm−1 (see Figure 3c). The higher conductivity of LAGP at 650 °C with respect to the same sample at 600 °C is probably due to the fact that at 600 °C LAGP is too close to its crystallization temperature of 605 °C.[21] More interestingly, in comparison to the standard pellet fabricated at 850 °C (with no pressure), the conductivity of the LAGP-750-56MPa pellet was 3.5 times higher at 20 °C. Finally a lower activation energy was obtained for the sample prepared at 750 °C under a constant pressure of 56 MPa. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of the two samples are shown in Figure 4a. Almost all the diffraction lines from both samples are indexed to LAGP (PDF: 04-022-7674), except a small peak, marked with *, from the 750 °C sintered sample is attributed to AlPO4. The up-shift and broadening of the diffraction are clearly observed (see inset) when the temperature was increased from 650 °C to 750 °C at a constant pressure of 56 MPa. The peak up-shift indicates the shortening of the lattice parameters which is possibly owing to the losses of Al3+/ Ge4+ and O2− ions due to the formation of AlPO4 and reduction of Ge4+ to Ge0, see Figures 6 and 7 . There are several factors that may possibly contribute to the peak broaden; (a) more defects were introduced in the crystal lattice at 750 °C; (b) presence of L(A)GP phase with less ordered structure, which is confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy in Figure 5a–c. The sample annealed at 650 °C and 56 MPa (Figure 5b) is more crystalline than the sample annealed 750 °C and 56 MPa (Figure 5c) that shows weaker reflection on (012) planes. An analysis of the pellet annealed at 750 °C under a pressure of 56 MPa showed the segregation of phases enriched with aluminum, as seen in the SEM image and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDXS) spectrum in Figure 4b, meanwhile a small AlPO4 peak was detected in the same sample via XRD.
Figure 6a shows evidence of the formation of nanosized particles apparently having formed due to partial decomposition of LAGP that led to formation of impurity phases. The nanoparticles contained more Ge than that in the original LAGP if normalized with P content, and only trace amounts of Al (Al/ Ge < 0.02). These suggests the newly formed nano-particles are possibly LGP in which more Ge content than the orginal LAGP due to the replacement of Ge4+/Ge3+ to Al3+ in the structure. The Si peak (Si*) was a spurious signal from the detector, which was visible at lower counts. The powder was analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which showed the presence of metallic germanium (Ge0) in the 750 °C sample (by O2 loss after GeIV disproportionation GeIV → GeII + Ge0). The powder was analyzed using XPS in both the survey and high-resolution modes. Regarding the chemical composition, as assessed by the XPS survey spectra, no significant difference in composition was noticed between the samples annealed at 650 and 750 °C. For the sample annealed at 650 °C, the highresolution spectrum of Ge 3d displays only one peak, centered at 33.7 eV , associated with the Ge4+ state.[22] When annealed at 750 °C, this Ge 3d spectrum shifts to a lower binding energy. In addition, the spectrum deconvolution exhibits two peaks: a major contribution from Ge3+ at 33.5 eV , and a minor one from metallic germanium (Ge0, at 31.2 eV). Peak shifts of ≈0.4–0.5 eV were also observed in the P2p and Al2p spectra, suggesting a different charge distribution between samples. In fact, this shift to lower binding energies at 750 °C, compared to 650 °C, is correlated to the reduction of the germanium oxidation state from Ge4+ to Ge3+ and Ge0. This result is in agreement with the STEM-EDXS quantification reported in Figure S2, Supporting Information. It can be observed that there is a loss of oxygen (high (Ge+Al)/O and P /O ratio) when the temperature is increased from 650 °C to 750 °C. This implies some of the germanium oxide underwent a redox reaction (disproportionation) into metallic germanium and oxygen gas. These results show that hot pressing LAGP requires a moderate temperature in order to avoid side reactions. Hot pressing (under an inert atmosphere) above 650 °C triggers a complex decomposition mechanism (Figure 6d) involving partial LAGP particle breakdown via segregation into AlPO4 and LiGe2(PO4)3 accompanied by redox breaking of Ge-O bonds into metallic germanium. When 56 MPa and 750 °C were applied, the LAGP pellets became very fragile but very conductive. The cause of the mechanical strength loss was probably related to O2 degassing as a result of the germanium reduction that induced crack formation. It is very difficult to prepare batteries when the electrolyte is difficult to handle. Therefore, a temperature of 650 °C and pressure of 56 MPa were selected to prepare a solid battery.
An all-solid battery was assembled following the procedure reported in the Section 4. The battery was cycled at 80 °C and a current of 100 µA corresponding to C/40. We observed a first capacity of 125 mAh g−1 after the first cycle and 115 mAh g−1 after 10 cycles (Figure 7a). The operating temperature was limited by the use of a PEO:LiTFSI protective layer between the LAGP solid electrolyte and lithium metal anode. The cathode and solid electrolyte were analyzed using SEM and EDXS, as shown in Figure 7b. It is clear that germanium and oxygen were homogenously distributed on the carbon paper support, cathode layer, and solid electrolyte, while iron was confined to the cathode side. At higher C-rate (C/24), after a first capacity discharge of 85 mAh g−1, the battery was able to cycle for almost 30 cycles. By computed tomography scan (CT-scan) we could observe the formation of cracks after cycling as reported in Figure S3, Supporting Information: the capacity may be ascribed to a mechanical stress inside the cell. Despite the low C rate, to our knowledge, the results represent some of the best reported data for an all-solid cathode–ceramic phosphate solid electrolyte interface. Oxide cathode materials, such as LiCoO2 and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 suffer much more from O2 loss than olivine phosphate cathodes, hence maybe more prone to reaction with LAGP if the latter is not properly processed based on the findings of the present work. Among all of the olivines, LiFePO4 was selected because of its high relative stability compared to other ones, such as LiCoPO4.
This was the first study to demonstrate the beneficial influence of pressure during sintering (hot pressing) on the total ionic conductivity of a NASICON-type Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 solid electrolyte. A total conductivity of ≈3 × 10−4 S cm−1 is obtained at room temperature by applying a pressure of 56 MPa and heating at 650 °C for 1 h. The pressure and temperature applied had to be moderate to avoid side reactions, such as disintegration of the LAGP ceramic, phase segregation (splitting LAGP into AlPO4 and LiGe2(PO4)3), and the formation of metallic germanium. The results will assist in understanding the densification mechanism of NASICON electrolytes and open up possibilities for new methods to improve the contact between cathode and solid electrolyte materials by avoiding the use of polymer and/or liquid electrolytes.
Materials: LAGP was purchased from MSE (USA) (see Figure S1, Supporting Information), and an argon-filled hot press was purchased from OxyGon (New Hampshire, USA).
Hot-Press Method and Battery Assembly: Using the standard method, 0.350 g of LAGP was pressed using a 13 mm diameter stainless steel die. In an alumina crucible, the pellets were embedded in mother powder annealed under air at 850 °C in a muffle furnace. In the hot press method, 0.75 g of LAGP was pressed using a 16 mm diameter titanium–zirconium–molybdenum die in a hot press by applying a pressure of 0, 56, or 112 MPa at 650 °C. After sintering the XRD measurement were performed on a SmartLab diffractometer (RigakuJapan) with Co-Kα radiation. The spectra were collected approximately every 5 min with scan-step size 0.04o. In a typical all-solid battery, when using 650 °C and 56 MPa for 1 h, 0.05 g of a cathode material composed of LiFePO4 (50%), LAGP (45%), and graphite (5%) was pressed with 0.5 g of LAGP between two graphite foil layers. A 10 µm PEO:LiTFSI (EO:Li = 20:1) interlayer was used between the LAGP and lithium. The Li//PEO-LiTFSI//LAGP//LFP-LAGP all-solid battery was prepared by hot pressing lithium metal and an LAGP//LFP-LAGP half-cell at 80 °C using a PEO-LiTFSI interlayer to protect the lithium metal from side reactions with LAGP.
Electrochemical Characterizations: After densification, the pellets were polished. A silver ink was applied to both sides of the pellets. The ionic conductivity was measured at 25 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 80 °C. The all-solid batteries were cycled at 50 °C and 80 °C at C/40, where 1C = 3.8 mAh. Before and after cycling the battery was analyzed by CT-scan Microfocus X-ray made by SHIMAZU (Japan).
Electron Microscopy and Chemical Mapping: Scanning transmission electron microscopy images were acquired in annular dark field mode (ADF-STEM) on a JEM-2200FS transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV (JEOL, Japan). Chemical mapping was performed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDXS) in the scanning mode. Prior to microscopic examination, the LAGP powder samples were manually ground in a toluene solution and deposited on ultrathin carbon (≈3 nm thick) support grids. The electron diffraction (ED) was calculated using xHREM (HREM Research, Inc.) from a slab ≈50 nm thick, obtained from the reference structure ICSD no. 69764.
LAGP cross section were prepared using an Ar Ion Milling IM4000 Plus (Hitachi, Japan) with a ion beam energy of 6 kV with a fast and 30°rotation for 4 h. The cross section surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscope (SEM) Lyra 3 (TESCAN) and elemental composition obtained using windowless EDXS Extreme (Oxford instruments). The micrograph and X-ray map were acquired at an accelerating voltage of 5 and 10 kV , a probe current of 500 pA, and a working distance of 10 mm.
X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy: The surface chemical composition of grinded electrolytes was assessed with XPS using a PHI 5600-ci spectrometer (Physical Electronics). An achromatic aluminum X-ray source (1486.6 eV) was used to record the survey spectra (0–1400 eV), while high-resolution (HRXPS) spectra (P2p, Ge3d, and Al2p peaks) were obtained using an achromatic magnesium X-ray source (1253.6 eV). For both sets of spectra, no charge neutralization was applied. The detection angle was set at 45° with respect to the surface. The curve fitting procedures for the different elements were performed by means of a least-square Gaussian–Lorentzian peak fitting procedure, after Shirley background subtraction.[23]
