Understanding the conductivity variations induced by compositional changes in sodium super ionicconducting (NASICON) glass materials is highly relevant for applications such as solid electrolytes forsodium (Na) ion batteries.
In the research reported in this paper, NASICON-based NCAP glass(Na2.8Ca0.1Al2P3O12) was selected as the parent glass.
The present study demonstrates the changes in theNa+ ion conductivity of NCAP bulk glass with the substitution of boron (NCABP: Na2.8Ca0.1Al2B0.5P2.7O12)and gallium (NCAGP: Na2.8Ca0.1Al2Ga0.5P2.7O12) for phosphorus and the resulting structural variationsfound in the glass network.
For a detailed structural analysis of NCAP, NCABP and NCAGP glasses,micro-Raman and magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopictechniques (for 31P, 27Al, 23Na, 11B and 71Ga nuclei) were used.
The Raman spectrum revealed that theNCAP glass structure is more analogous to the AlPO4 mesoporous glass structure.
The 31P MAS-NMRspectrum illustrated that the NCAP glass structure consists of a high concentration of Q0 (3Al) units,followed by Q0 (2Al) units.
The 27Al MAS-NMR spectrum indicates that alumina exists at five differentsites, which include AlO4 units surrounded by AlO6 units, Al(OP)4, Al(OP)5, Al(OAl)6 and Al(OP)6, in theNCAP glass structure.
The 31P, 27Al and 11B MAS-NMR spectra of the NCABP glass revealed the absenceof B–O–Al linkages and the presence of B3–O–B4–O–P4 linkages which further leads to the formationof borate and borophosphate domains.
The 71Ga MAS-NMR spectrum suggests that gallium cations inthe NCAGP glass compete with the alumina cations and occupy four (GaO4), five (GaO5) and six (GaO6)coordinated sites.
The Raman spectrum of NCAGP glass indicates that sodium cations have also beensubstituted by gallium cations in the NCAP glass structure.
From impedance analysis, the dc conductivityof the NCAP glass (3.13  108 S cm1) is slightly decreased with the substitution of gallium (2.27 108 S cm1) but considerably decreased with the substitution of boron (1.46  108 S cm1).
Thevariation in the conductivity values are described based on the structural changes of NCAP glass with thesubstitution of gallium and boron.
