A   compact   stabilized   zirconia-based   planar-type   solid   state   electrochemical   gas   sensor   using   columbite type   MnNb2O6 sensing   electrode   (SE)  was   designed   and   developed,   aiming   at   monitoring   low   concentration   of  SO2 at  high   temperature.   Among   the   different   sensing   electrode   materials   calcinated   at   800, 1000   and   1200 ◦C,  the   device   utilizing   MnNb2O6-SE   sintered   at   1000 ◦C   displayed   the   highest   response −27  mV   to  5   ppm   SO2 and   the   low   detection   limit   of  50   ppb   at   700 ◦C.  A   linear   dependence   of   V of  for  the   sensor   attached   with   MnNb2O6-SE   sintered   at   1000 ◦C  on  the   logarithm   of   SO2 concentration in  the  range   of  0.05–5   ppm   at   an   operating   temperature   of   700 ◦C   was   achieved,   which   the   sensitivity −13   mV/decade.   The   present   sensor   showed   fast   response   time   of   37   s   to  1   ppm   SO2 at   700 ◦C.  Furwas   thermore,   the   present   device   also   displayed   good   continuous   response   and   recovery,   high   temperature stability   and   selectivity   toward   various   interfering   gases   at   700 ◦C.   Additionally,   the  sensing   mechanism   related   to   mixed   potential   was   proposed   and   further   demonstrated   based   on   the   measurement of   polarization   curve.

Sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  is  an  important  hazardous  and  harmful  gas in  the  atmosphere,  which  is  emitted  from  the  industrial  production  such  as  combustion  of  coal  and  fuel  oil,  and  natural  processes like  volcanic  eruption  or  forest  ﬁres  [1,2].  It  directly  contributes  to the  formation  of  acid  rain  and  causes  the  acidiﬁcation  of  soils,  lakes and  streams.  Furthermore,  the  high-level  SO2 in  air  can  bring  about nausea,  chest  tightness,  respiratory  illness  and  the  aggravation  of cardiovascular  disease  [3–6].  The  study  shows  that  repeated  exposure  to  less  than  5  ppm  of  SO2 can  cause  permanent  pulmonary impairment  [7].  Facing  signiﬁcant  health  risk  and  environmental challenge,  there  is  an  immediate  demand  for  the  development  of simple,  reliable  and  convenient  gas  sensor  for  the  selective  and sensitive  detection  of  SO2 in  various  scenarios.

Fortunately,  solid  electrolyte  type  gas  sensor  featuring  miniaturization,  low  cost,  excellent  sensing  property,  good  chemical and  mechanical  stability  has  the  potential  to  meet  the  abovementioned  conditions  and  has  attracted  more  and  more  attentions. Currently,  numerous  research  groups  have  developed  various  SO2 gas  sensors  by  employing  different  types  of  solid  electrolytes,  such as  alkali  metal  sulfates  [8,9],  Na-␤-alumina  [10],  NASICON  [11–13] and  stabilized  ZrO2 [14–16].  Based  on  the  above  result  reported, most  of  sensor  based  on  different  sensing  mechanisms  displayed good  sensing  performance  to  relative  high  concentration  range  of SO2.  Until  now,  there  have  been  very  few  reports  concerning  the fabrication  of  solid  electrolyte  gas  sensor  for  very  low  concentration of  SO2.  However,  the  short-term  and  long-term  tolerance  limits  of human  body  to  SO2 are  5  and  2  ppm,  respectively,  the  acceptable limit  to  SO2 in  ambient  air  is  much  less  [1,7].  Therefore,  it  is  helpful and  meaningful  work  for  developing  gas  sensor  based  on  solid  electrolyte  for  detection  of  SO2 at  very  low  concentration  levels  below 5  ppm.  In  our  previous  report,  we  proposed  the  mixed  potential type  electrochemical  gas  sensors  based  on  stabilized  zirconia  solid electrolyte,  which  could  detect  sub-ppm  level  of  gases,  such  as  H2S [17]  and  acetone  [18].  Nevertheless,  for  mixed  potential  type  gassensor,  the  selection  of  a  suitable  sensing  electrode  material  is  one of  the  most  important  points  to  achieve  high  sensing  property.

In  this  study,  the  ambitious  objectives  of  the  present  work were  to  fabricate  and  develop  mixed  potential  type  gas  sensor utilizing  yttria  stabilized  zirconia  (YSZ)  as  solid  electrolyte  and a  new  columbite  type  composite  oxide  (MnNb2O6)  as  sensing electrode  (SE),  which  was  applied  for  detection  of  SO2 at  low concentration  level  below  5  ppm.  The  effect  of  calcination  temperature  of  MnNb2O6-SE  on  the  sensing  characteristic  was   tested. Furthermore,  the  SO2 gas-sensing  performance  was   systematically investigated  and  sensing  mechanism  was  also  discussed.

The  MnNb2O6 composite  oxide  material  was  synthesized  by a  facile  sol-gel  method  according  to  the  procedure  described  in Ref.  [19].  The  sensor  was  fabricated  using  the  YSZ  plate  (8  mol% × Y2O3-doped,  2  mm    2  mm  square,  0.3  mm  thickness,  provided  by Anpeisheng  Corp.,  China).  A  point-shaped  and  a  narrow  stripeshaped  Pt  electrode  (reference  electrode,  RE)  were  formed  on  two ends  of  the  YSZ  plate  using  a  commercial  Pt  paste  (Sino-platinum Metals  Co.,  Ltd.),  and  sintered  at  1000 ◦C.  The  various  sensing  materials  obtained  by  sintering  at  different  temperature  (800,  1000  and 1200 ◦C)  were  mixed  with  a  minimum  quantity  of  deionized  water, respectively.  The  resultant  paste  was  covered  on  the  point-shaped Pt  with  a  ﬁne  brush  to  form  stripe-shaped  sensing  electrode  (SE), and  then  the  device  was  sintered  at  800 ◦C  for  2  h  to  gain  good contact  between  the  sensing  electrode  material  and  electrolyte. The  Pt  heater  formed  on  Al2O3 substrate  was  then  attached  to  the YSZ  plate  by  the  inorganic  adhesive,  which  provided  the  required heating  temperature  for  the  sensor.  The  schematic  diagram  of  the fabricated  sensor  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.

X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  of  SE  materials  were  measured by  Rigaku  wide-angle  X-ray  diffractometer  (D/max  rA,  using  Cu K␣   radiation  at  wave  length  =  0.1541  nm).  The  surface  morphology  and  microstructure  of  the  SE  materials  were  obtained  using ﬁeld-emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  (FESEM,  JEOL  JSM7500F,  with  an  accelerating  voltage  of  15  kV).  Themogravimetric analysis  and  differential  scanning  calorimeter  analysis  (TG-DSC) were  carried  out  using  a  NETZSCH  STA  449F3  simultaneous  thermogracimetric  analyzer  in  air  from  30  to  1300 ◦C  at  a  heating rate  of  10 ◦C/min.  The  electric  potential  difference  (V)  between  the SE  and  the  RE  was  measured  with  a  digital  electrometer  (Rigol. DM3054)  when  the  sensor  was  exposed  to  air  or  sample  gas.  Each measurement  situation  kept  consistent  and  the  results  obtained were  recorded  with  a  computer  connected  to  the  electrometer.  The current-voltage  (polarization)  curves  of  sensors  were  carried  out  by means  of  the  potentiodynamic  method  (CHI600C,  Instrument  corporation  of  Shanghai,  China)  using  a  two-electrode  conﬁguration in  the  base  gas  (air)  and  the  different  concentration  of  SO2 gas  (1

(a)  TG-DSC  curves  of  prepared  gel  precursor;  (b)  XRD  patterns  of  products derived  from  calcinations  of  as-synthesized  gel  precursors  at  different  temperatures ( 2))  Nb2O5.and  5  ppm  SO2 +  air)  at  700 ◦C.  The  complex  impedance  measurements  of  the  sensors  in  air  and  5  ppm  of  various  tested  gases  were performed  by  using  an  impedance  analyzer  (Solartron,  1260  and Solartron,  1287)  in  the  frequency  range  of  0.1Hz–1  MHz  at  700 ◦C. The  amplitude  of  the  AC  potential  signal  was  ﬁxed  at  300  mV  in  all measurements.

To  understand  the  thermal  behavior  and  further  determine the  sintering  temperature  of  as-synthesized  gel  precursor,  TG-DSC curves  were  investigated  as  displayed  in  Fig.  2(a).  From  the  TG curve,  three  main  steps  of  weight  loss  were  observed.  The  ﬁrst  slight weight  loss  below  120 ◦C  appeared,  accompanied  with  endother-mic   behavior.  Such  process  could  be  attributed  to  the  removal  of free  water  from  the  gel  precursor.  The  following  obvious  weight loss  observed  in  the  range  of  150–500 ◦C  and  exothermic  behavior  occured  at  around  241 ◦C  demonstrated  the  combustion  and decomposition  of  ammonium  nitrate  and  organic  components. Finally,  at  the  temperature  range  of  500–672 ◦C  and  over,  the  mass loss  of  8.7%  existed,  corresponding  to  a  sharp  exothermic  peak  and  a wide  range  exothermic  peak,  which  means  that  the  transformation of  amorphous  to  metal  oxide  and  gradual  crystallization  growth  of pure  phase  MnNb2O6.  Based  on  above  TG-DSC  analysis,  XRD  measurements  were  conducted  on  products  derived  from  calcinations of  as-synthesized  gel  precursors  at  different  temperatures  and  the results  are  presented  in  Fig.  2(b).  It  is  clear  that  the  product  calcined at  400 ◦C  was  amorphous  and  did  not  contain  crystalline  inorganic salts.  The  phase  of  MnNb2O6 formed  when  the  calcination  temperature  was  600 ◦C,  but  Nb2O5 with  orthorhombic  existed.  All  the diffraction  peaks  of  products  above  800 ◦C  are  readily  assigned  to orthorhombic  columbite  structure  of  MnNb2O6,  which  matched well  with  the  reported  values  of  the  standard  JCPDS  card  No.  33899,  respectively.  No  diffraction  peaks  of  any  other  impurity  are observed,  which  indicates  that  the  single  phases  of  MnNb2O6 with columbite  structure  were  formed.  The  sharp  diffraction  peaks  for three  kinds  of  composite  oxide  materials  sintered  at  800,  1000 and  1200 ◦C  were  observed,  which  suggested  the  good  crystalline nature.  Therefore,  MnNb2O6 obtained  in  the  calacination  temperature  range  of  800–1200 ◦C  was  investigated  as  the  sensing  electrode materials  in  the  following  work.  The  morphology  of  MnNb2O6 sensing  electrode  materials  sintered  at  different  temperatures  (800, 1000  and  1200 ◦C)  was  characterized  by  FESEM  and  the  result  is exhibited  in  Fig.  3.  The  SEM  image  clearly  revealed  that  the  loose and  porous  structure  on  the  surface  of  MnNb2O6 was   observed  and the  particle  size  of  increased  gradually  with  the  increasing  of  sintering  temperature.  MnNb2O6 sensing  electrode  material  sintered  at 1000 ◦C  is  composed  of  particle  with  dimention  of  around  800  nm. According  to  the  research  result  acquired  previously  [20–23], the  sensing  property  of  the  sensor  was  signiﬁcantly  affected  by  calcination  temperature  of  sensing  electrode  material.  Consequently, the  gas  sensing  performance  of  sensors  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE calcinated  at  different  temperatures  (800,  1000  and  1200 ◦C)  to  SO2 was  investigated.  Fig.  4(a,b)  shows  the  response  of  three  sensors  to 5  ppm  SO2 at  700 ◦C.  It  is  observed  that  sensor  utilizing  MnNb2O6SE  calcinated  at  1000 ◦C  exhibited  the  higher  response  value  to 5  ppm  SO2 than  those  of  devices  using  MnNb2O6-SE  annealed  at other  temperatures.  The  sensor  fabricated  can  be  expressed  as  the following  electrochemical  cell:

In  air:  O2,  MnNb2O6/YSZ/Pt,  O2 In  SO2 gas:  SO2 +  O2,  MnNb2O6/YSZ/Pt,  SO2 +  O2 When  the  device  was  exposed  to  SO2 atmosphere,  the  following two  electrochemical  reactions  (the  cathodic  reaction  of  oxygen  (1) and  the  anodic  reaction  of  SO2 (2))  occured  simultaneously  at  TPB (triple  phase  boundary,  the  interface  of  SE/Electrolyte/target  gas) and  formed  a  local  cell  and  then  mixed  potential  generated  at  the  SE when  the  cathodic  and  anodic  reaction  reached  the  dynamic  equilibrium.  The  sensing  signal  is  achieved  by  the  potential  difference of  the  sensing  electrode  and  reference  electrode. Cathodicreaction  :  O2 + Anodicreaction  :  SO2 +

In  the  case  of  present  sensor,  the  sensing  signal  is  largely  dependent  on  the  SO2 concentration  participated  in  electrochemical reaction  and  degree  of  electrochemical  Reactions  (1)  and  (2)  at TPB  of  MnNb2O6/YSZ/SO2.  As  indicated  in  Fig.  3,  the  sizes  of  pore and  particle  for  MnNb2O6-SE  increased  with  the  increasing  of  the sintering  temperatures.  The  larger  porous  channels  decreased  SO2 consumption  in  the  process  of  diffusion  in  MnNb2O6 electrode layer  and  facilitated  more  SO2 gas  to  reach  the  TPB,  which  participated  directly  in  electrochemical  reactions.  Thus,  the  sensitivity of  sensor  may   be  improved  with  the  increasing  of  sintering  temperature.  However,  the  particles  of  MnNb2O6 became  too  large with  the  further  increase  of  calcination  temperature  and  then  the interface  area  of  the  enlarged  particle  and  YSZ  increased,  but  TPB area  reduced.  In  this  case,  the  electrochemical  reaction  active  sites decreased  because  of  reduction  of  TPB  length,  that  is,  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1200 ◦C to  SO2 decreased  obviously,  compared  with  those  of  sintered  at 800  and  1000 ◦C.  Based  on  considering  these  factors,  when  the annealed  temperature  is  1000 ◦C,  the  excellent  balance  of  the  diffusion  of  SO2 passed  through  MnNb2O6–SE  layer  and  TPB  area was  achieved.  In  order  to  further  clearly  understand  the  degree of  electrochemical  reaction  at  TPB  for  sensors  attached  with  different  sensing  electrodes,  the  polarization  curves  of  the  sensors attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  800,  1000  and  1200 ◦C  both in  the  air  and  sample  gas  (5  ppm  SO2 +  air)  at  700 ◦C  were  measured,  as  shown  in  Fig.  4(c).  The  cathodic  polarization  curve  was obtained  in  air,  and  the  anodic  polarization  curve  was  obtained by  subtracting  in  air  from  in  sample  gas.  It  is  obvious  that  the anodic  polarization  curve  of  the  SO2 electrochemical  reaction  for the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  annealed  at  1000 ◦C  shifts downward,  in  comparison  to  devices  using  other  two  kinds  of sensing  electrode  materials.  According  to  mixed  potential  model [24–28],  the  higher  SO2 sensitivity  can  be  generated  by  an  increase in  the  electrochemical  catalytic  activity  to  the  anodic  Reaction  (2). In  this  case,  the  sensor  utilizing  MnNb2O6-SE  calcinated  at  1000 ◦C received  the  highest  response  value  to  SO2 in  the  examined  concentration  at  700 ◦C.  Therefore,  we  paid  considerable  attention  to the  sensor  utilizing  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  in  the  following  content.  Additionally,  the  polarization  curves  for  the  sensor attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  in  different  concentrations  of  SO2 were  obtained  and  displayed  in  Fig.  4(d).  The  mixed potential  can  be  estimated  from  the  intersection  of  the  cathodic and  anodic  polarization  curves.  Based  on  the  comparison  of  the mixed  potential  estimated  values  and  the  potential  difference  values  experimentally  observed  to  different  concentration  of  SO2 for fabricated  device,  the  estimated  values  (−15.5  and  −27.5  mV)   for sensors  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  toward  1 and  5  ppm  SO2 are  in  close  agreement  with  those  the  potential  dif−27  mV).

Such  a ference  values  experimentally observed  well  coincidence  of  both  values  indicates  that  the  fabricated  device is  based  on  the  mixed-potential  mechanism  [29–33].

The  operating  temperature  is  one  of  the  most  important  parameter  for  the  valuable  sensor  and  affected  signiﬁcantly  the  gas sensing  properties.  Therefore,  the  temperature  dependence  behavior  of  the  sensor  using  MnNb2O6-SE  calcinated  at  1000 ◦C  to  SO2 
was  investigated.  Fig.  5  shows  the  response  and  recovery  curves for  the  sensor  using  MnNb2O6-SE  annealed  at  1000 ◦C  to  5  ppm SO2 at  different  operating  temperatures.  Obviously,  the  response of  fabricated  sensor  to  5  ppm  SO2 presents  a  trend  of  “increasemaximum-decrease”  during  the  operating  temperature  changing process  and  the  highest  response  value  was  obtained  at  700 ◦C.  At a  low  operating  temperature,  activation  energy  is  too  insufﬁcient to  generate  electrochemical  reaction,  leading  to  a  low  response.  As the  operating  temperature  increased,  the  overall  electrochemical reaction  at  TPB  is  accelerated  and  thus  contributes  to  a  signiﬁcant enhancement  of  response.  Beyond  the  optimum  operating  temperature,  a  high  temperature  inhibits  diffusion  of  gas  to  TPB  and  the desorption  process  of  SO2 occupies  a  dominant,  resulting  in  reduction  of  response.  Consequently,  the  optimal  operating  temperature for  the  present  sensor  was  considered  to  be  700 ◦C.

(a)  Response  transients  for  the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  toward  different  concentrations  of  SO2 in  the  range  of  0.05–5  ppm  at  700 ◦C  and dependence  of  V  on  the  logarithm  of  SO2 concentrations  (inset);  (b)  response  times  for  the  present  sensor  to  different  concentrations  of  SO2 at  700 ◦C.

The  response  and  recovery  transients  for  the  sensor  attached with  MnNb2O6-SE  calcinated  at  1000 ◦C  toward  different  concentrations  of  SO2 in  the  range  of  0.05–5  ppm  at  700 ◦C  have  been measured,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  The  same  times  exposed  to  air  and different  concentration  of  SO2 are  kept  consistent  in  each  measurement  concentration  situation  and  the  response  signal  exposed  to SO2 at  last  minute  as  the  response  value  to  assure  the  accuracy.  It  is seen  that  the  responses  for  the  sensor  fabricated  to  0.5  and  5  ppm −27  mV   at  700 ◦C,  respectively. SO2 is  still  as  large  as  Furthermore,  it  is  surprising  that  the  sensor  fabricated  could  detect even  the  low  concentration  of  50  ppb  SO2,  which  the  response  value −2.5  mV.   However,  the  V  of  the  present  sensor  increased was  to  a  maximum  value  then  quietly  decreased  and  did  not  reach  to saturate  values  when  the  sensor  was  exposed  to  the  higher  concentration  of  SO2 gas  (>1  ppm).  The  reason  may   be  as  follows: The  electrochemical  reaction  for  the  present  mixed  potential  type sensor  occurred  at  the  TPB  of  MnNb2O6-SE/YSZ/SO2 gas.  And  the sensing  signal  of  the  sensor  depended  on  the  concentration  of  SO2 at  TPB  and  the  amount  of  active  sites  of  TPB.  For  the  low  concentration  range  of  SO2,  the  amount  of  TPB  active  sites  for  the  present sensor  was  enough  to  provide  the  electrochemical  reaction,  and  the sensitivity  of  the  sensor  was  mainly  related  to  the  amount  of  SO2, which  reached  the  TPB  of  MnNb2O6-SE  and  directly  participated  in the  electrochemical  reaction.  Thus,  the  V   gradually  increased  to  a maximum  value  at  the  lower  concentration  of  SO2 gas.  The  amount of  active  sites  palyed  the  dominant  role  in  the  electrochemical reaction  when  the  sensor  was  exposed  to  the  higher  concentration  of  SO2.  In  the  initial  phase,  the  enough  active  sites  promoted the  electrochemical  reaction  of  SO2,  which  gradually  got  a  high response  value.  And  then,  some  of  active  sites  were  taken  up  as  the electrochemical  reaction  progress  and  the  response  value  quietly decreased.  Furthermore,  according  to  continuous  measurement results,  the  sensor  fabricated  could  restore  the  original  sensing performance  when  the  device  was  exposed  to  SO2 again.  In  this case,  the  present  sensor  exhibited  good  SO2 response  characteristics.  The  dependence  of  V  for  the  sensor  using  MnNb2O6-SE sintered  at  1000 ◦C  on  the  logarithm  of  SO2 concentration  at  700 ◦C is  exhibited  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  6(a).  Almost  a  linear  relationship between  the  V  and  the  logarithm  of  SO2 concentration  in  the examined  range  of  0.05–5  ppm  at  700 ◦C  is  observed,  which  conforms  to  mixed  potential  type  sensor  [34–36].  The  sensitivity  of  the −13  mV/decade.  Besides,  the  response  time  of fabricated  sensor  is  the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  was   also further  evaluated  according  to  Fig.  6(a).  Generally,  the  response time  deﬁned  as  the  time  required  by  the  sensor  to  attain  90%  of  the stable  potential  value  at  operating  temperature.  Because  the  sensor  response  showed  a  peak  at  the  beginning  and  then  decreasedand  did  not  reach  to  stable  value  when  the  sensor  was   exposed  to high  concentration  of  SO2.  In  this  case,  in  order  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  the  results,  we  chose  the  90%  response  of  peak  value  (the transient  stability  of  the  response  value)  for  fabricated  sensor  to 2  and  5  ppm  SO2 as  the  response  times,  respectively.  As  shown  in Fig.  6(b),  the  response  times  to  0.5  and  2  ppm  SO2 are  55  and  19  s, which  exhibits  fast  response  rate.  And  the  response  time  during  the examined  concentration  range  gradually  decreases  with  increasing  SO2 concentration,  which  may   be  attributed  to  the  lower  SO2 concentration  requiring  more  time  to  reach  dynamic  equilibrium. As  mentioned  above,  the  sensing  behavior  of  the  present  device exhibited  the  excellent  linear  relationship  between  potential  difference  and  logarithm  of  SO2 concentration,  which  can  be  explained by  the  mixed-potential  mechanism.  The  potential  response  to  SO2 in  air  for  the  sensor  fabricated  can  be  treated  quantitatively.  For the  SO2–O2 atmosphere,  the  cathodic  and  anodic  current  densities  for  Reactions  (1)  and  (2)  should  be  expressed  by  the  following equations,  respectively. −   V 0 O2

The  mixed  potential  VM is deﬁned  as  the  electrode  potential  (V)  at  which  the  absolue  values of  current  densities  are  equal  and  can  be  represented  by  following Equation:   V0 − VM =gated  and  results  obtained  are  shown  in  Fig.  9.  Based  on  reported previously  [19,37–39],  the  resistance  at  higher  frequencies  for  the sensor  fabricated  is  mainly  contributed  to  MnNb2O6-bulk  resistance  (including  the  small  YSZ-bulk  resistance).  And  the  interfacial resistance  is  given  by  the  resistance  value  at  the  intersection  of the  large  semi-arc  with  the  real  axis  at  lower  frequencies  (around 0.1  Hz).  Evidently,  the  resistance  at  high  frequencies  was  almost constant  even  if  the  sensor  was   exposed  to  different  tested  gases. However,  when  the  sensor  was  exposed  to  5  ppm  of  SO2,  the  interfacial  resistance  at  the  lower  frequency  was  obviously  decreased compared  with  the  interfacial  resistance  measured  in  other  gases. Changes  in  the  interface  resistance  measured  in  different  atmosphere  revealed  the  electrochemical  catalytic  activity  toward  the examined  gas  species  [40,41].  Thus,  it  can  be  speculated  that  the catalytic  activity  to  the  electrochemical  reaction  of  SO2 for  present sensor  at  TPB  was  high,  which  generated  the  largest  sensing  magnitude  toward  SO2.

The  stability  as  another  important  sensing  performance  parameter  for  gas  sensor  in  practical  application,  the  long-term  stability of  the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  to 2  and  5  ppm  SO2 in  14  days  constant  high  temperature  of  700 ◦C test  periods  is  depicted  in  Fig.  10.  For  the  response  transients  of the  present  device  toward  different  concentrations  of  SO2 in  the measurement  process  of  long-term  stability,  times  exposed  to  air and  SO2 are  kept  consistent  in  each  measurement  situation  and  the response  exposed  to  SO2 at  last  minute  as  the  response  value.  It  is clearly  seen  that  the  change  amplitude  of  the  response  for  the  sensor  using  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  varied  slightly  to  2  and 5  ppm  SO2 at  700 ◦C  during  two   weeks  measurement  periods.  In order  to  further  illustrate  quantitatively  the  change  amplitude  of the  V  with  time,  the  change  of  the  V  ( 5)Vs)  for  the  sensor  is  given by    100%],  where  Vn and  V0 denote the  V   of  the  sensor  on  the  n  and  initial  day,  respectively.  The  quantitative  results  show  that  the  change  amplitudes  of  the  response  for −26.1% fabricated  sensor  to  2  and  5  ppm  SO2 on  the  14th  day  are  −14.9%,  respectively,  which  further  testiﬁed  good  stability  of and  the  device  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C.

In  summary,  the  mixed  potential  type  solid-state  electrochemical  SO2 sensors  utilizing  columbite-type  composite  oxide MnNb2O6-SE  calcinated  at  different  temperatures  (800,  1000  and 1200 ◦C)  were  fabricated  and  their  sensing  properties  were  investigated  at  700 ◦C.  As  a  result,  the  sensor  attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE sintered  at  1000 ◦C  displayed  the  largest  sensitivity  and  the  low detection  limit  of  50  ppb  to  SO2 at  700 ◦C.  Importantly,  the  present

When  O2 concentration  is  ﬁxed,  Eq.  (7)  is  simpliﬁed  to  the  following  equation: VM =V0 − It  can  be  clearly  indicated  that,  from  Eq.  (10),  the  linear  relationship  between  VM and  the  logarithm  of  SO2 concentration  displays negative  slope  (−nA)  under  the  ﬁxed  concentration  value  of  O2,  in agreement  with  result  observed  experimentally  in  inset  of  Fig.  6(a). Such  theoretical  analysis  further  demonstrated  that  the  sensor attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  obeyed  the  mixed potential  theory. The  continuous  response  and  recovery  transients  of  the  sensor  utilizing  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  toward  1  ppm  SO2 at 700 ◦C,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  7.  The  response  of  the  present  device toward  1  ppm  SO2 was  effectively  reproduced  in  the  examined seven-time  cycles,  which  was  conﬁrmed  that  the  sensor  exhibited good  repeatability.  Additionally,  selectivity  is  an  important  evaluation  criterion  for  gas  sensor.  Consequently,  the  responses  of  the present  sensor  to  various  types  of  gases,  such  as  NO2,  CH4,  CO, C2H4,  NO,  Cl2,  H2S  and  NH3,  were  investigated  at  700 ◦C  and  results obtained  are  summarized  in  Fig.  8  (all  the  target  gas  concentration are  5  ppm).  It  was  revealed  that  the  present  fabricated  sensor  displayed  much  higher  response  toward  5  ppm  SO2 in  comparison  to other  test  gases.  These  results  demonstrate  that  the  sensor  has  the excellent  selectivity  to  SO2 as  oppose  to  any  other  interfering  gases. In  order  to  explain  clearly  the  excellent  selectivity  of  the  sensor attached  with  MnNb2O6-SE  sintered  at  1000 ◦C  to  SO2,  the  complex  impedance  of  the  device  fabricated  in  air  and  5  ppm  of  various test  gases  including  SO2,  NO,  NO2,  H2S  and  Cl2 at  700 ◦C  is  investi-
