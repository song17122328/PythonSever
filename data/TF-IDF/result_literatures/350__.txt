In  this  study,  we  demonstrate  that  the  introduction  of  the  SBA-15 mesoporous  material  improves  the  ionic  conductivity  of  lithium  aluminum  titanium phosphate  (LATP)  electrolytes.  SBA-15-doped  LATP  was  prepared  by  both  the conventional solid-state and sol-gel methods. The experimental results show that this introduction  of  SBA-15  can  refine  the  grains  of  LATP  and  improve  its  ionic conductivity  despite  the  decrease  in  the  measured  density  upon  doping.  The  doped LATP shows the highest ionic conductivity (4.42×10-4Scm-1) and the lowest activation energy  (0.24eV)  at  3wt%  SBA-15.  The  improvement  in  the  ionic  conductivity  is attributed to the presence of an amorphous layer due to the mesoporous nature of the 

All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLBs) with high safety performance and large energy densities are considered the most promising energy storage devices for future applications[1–3]. Solid lithium-ion electrolytes, which are key components of ASSLBs,  can  be  divided  into  three  categories:  organic  polymers,  oxides  and sulfides[4]. Polymer electrolytes have been studied for decades but still present many problems, such as flammability and insufficient lithium ion transport ability, that must be addressed urgently[5,6]. Among the inorganic electrolytes, lithium ion conducting oxides such as perovskite-type, NASICON-type, and Garnet-type oxides are generally more stable in ambient air and at high temperature than sulfides. Therefore, lithium ion  conducting  oxides  are  expected  to  be  used  in  lithium-sulfur  batteries  and lithium-air batteries in the future[7–9]. 



Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3(LATP,  0.1≤x≤0.5)  of  the  NASICON  type  is  now  intensively studied  because  of  its  high  ionic  conductivity,  easy  synthesis,  low  cost  and  good chemical  stability[10,11].To  date,  various  synthesis  methods  have  been  used  to prepare  LATP  electrolytes,  such  as  the  solid-state  reaction[12,13],  sol-gel  [14–17], hydrothermal  synthesis[18],melt-quenching[19],  solution  based  processes[20]and coprecipitation  [21].  The  preparation  process  has  a  significant  influence  on  the electrochemical  performance  of  LATP  because  it  determines  the  microstructures, phase  purity  and  relative  density.  In  addition,  much  attention  has  been  devoted  to further improving the ionic conductivity of LATP by doping with other elements such as Ga, Sc and Nb, and by adding sintering aids including LiBO2[22–25]. 


Mei et al.[26] incorporated SiO2 as a second phase into Li0.5La0.5TiO3 and found that  an  amorphous  boundary  layer  can  be  formed  that  increases  its  grain  boundary conductivity.  Choi  et  al.  reported  that  the  introduction  of  mesoporous  materials (MCM-41) strongly improves the ionic conductivity of LiBH4 due to the effect of the nanoconfinement  of  MCM-41[27,28].  The  SBA-15  ordered  mesoporous  silica  has received  increasing  attention  in  the  synthesis  of  electrochemical  energy  storage materials  because  of  its  regular  two-dimensional  hexagonal  nanochannels  and favorable  surface  properties[29–31].Chatterjee  et  al.[29]  have  synthesized  a  lithium superionic  conductor  by  growing  a  nanoglass  within  a  mesoporous  SBA-15  silica template  that  exhibits  an  electrical  conductivity  of  ~3  ×10-4  S  cm-1  at  room temperature  and  shows  an  extremely  low  activation  energy  of  0.078eV.  


Therefore,  in  this  work,  mesoporous  SBA-15  material  was  selected  as the  dopant  of  Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  electrolytes  to  achieve  improved  electrochemical performance. Both the solid-state reaction and sol-gel methods were used to prepare SBA-15-doped  LATP  materials  assuming  that  the  interaction  between  SBA-15  and LATP  can  be  different  in  these  two  synthesis  routes.  The  crystal  structure, microstructure, ionic conductivity, activation energy and density were investigated in this study. The mechanism of the interaction of SBA-15 with LATP was discussed. 


The starting materials used for the synthesis of Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3(x=0.3) by the solid-state reaction method were Li2CO3 (98%, Guangfu), Al2O3 (99%, Aladdin), TiO2 (99%,  Kermel)  and  NH4H2PO4  (99%,  Guangfu).  SBA-15  powders  were  purchased from  Nanjing  JCNANO  (pore  diameter:  ~6  nm,  surface  area:  ~493  m2  g-1).  First, stoichiometric raw powders were weighed and mixed thoroughly in a ceramic mortar, and the dosage of SBA-15 was 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%, 9% or 20% of LATP weight. Then, the mixtures were placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 700°C for 2h to remove the volatiles. Then, the calcined mixtures were transferred to a ceramic crucible for a sufficient  grinding  to  obtain  precursor  powders.  Finally,  the  precursor  powders obtained as described above were pressed into pellets with a diameter of 15mm under a pressure of 10MPa for 10min, and the pellets were sintered at 950°Cfor 4h in a tube 

SBA-15-doped Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3(x=0.3) was also prepared by a modified citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. The raw materials for the synthesis of the products were NH4H2PO4 (AR, Aladdin) and SBA-15 powders (Nanjing JCNANO). The preparation process was as follows:[14] a stoichiometric amount of Ti(OC4H9)4 was dissolved into 20ml of ethanol, and then this solution was added dropwise into 100ml of deionized water.  

A dry black gel was obtained after drying at 150°C for 4h. 

The  dry  gel  was  calcined  in  a  ceramic  crucible  at  500°C  for  4h  to  decompose  and carbonize  organic  compounds,  followed  by  calcination  at  800°C  for  4h  to  obtain SBA-15-doped  LATP  precursor  powders.  The  SBA-15-doped  LATP  pellets  were prepared  by  pressing  the  precursor  powders  with  a  pressure  of  10MPa  for  10  min followed by sintering at 950°C for 6h. 

The  density  of  the  SBA-15-doped  LATP  sample  was  determined  by  evaluating the mass and the volume, with the volume of the sample measured by the Archimedes method. The relative density was the ratio of the measured density to the theoretical density of the silicon-doped LATP, and the theoretical density can be calculated based on the mass fraction of  SBA-15 in the  LATP. X-ray examination was carried out at room  temperature  using  an  X-ray  diffractometer  (XRD,  TongDa  TD-3500)  with  a scanning  step  rate  of  0.02°  s-1  in  the  2θ  range  of  10-75°.  The  microstructure  of  the samples  was  characterized  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (JSM-7800F).  TEM analysis  was  carried  out  using  a  JEM-3010  instrument.  Fourier-transform  infrared (FTIR)  spectra  of  the  obtained  samples  were  collected  using  a  BRUKER  TensorII spectrometer in the range of 400–3000 cm-1. AC impedance data were collected with VersaSTAT3 electrochemical workstation in a frequency range of 1MHz to 0.1Hz at the  temperature  range  of  25-125°C  in  an  increment  of  20°C  and  the  activation energies of the samples were calculated accordingly. 


As discussed above, the introduction of a suitable amount of SBA-15,  whether by solid-state reaction or by sol-gel method, facilitates the migration of lithium ions in LATP. As observed in the TEM images of LATP-3%SBA-15 presented in Fig. 6(a), several LATP grains (dark spheres) were indeed found inside the amorphous SBA-15, and the grain sizes was approximately 5 nm. The SBA-15 in LATP-3%SBA-15 was amorphous  as  previously  mentioned.  The  ordered  mesoporous  structures  were  not observed  because it  was  destroyed  at the  sintering  stage  of  preparing LATP-3%SBA-15.  It  was  speculated  that  during  the  preparation,  LATP  precursors filled the channels of SBA-15 and then formed LATP grains at a later sintering stage, as illustrated in Fig. 6(b). These amorphous boundary layers covering the surface of LATP grains reduce the crystal anisotropy and optimize the lithium ion transfer paths and thus increase the grain boundary conductivity and thereby the total conductivity. 

The peaking of the grain conductivity at a slightly higher amount of SBA-15 indicated that LATP continued to fill the pores of SBA-15 as the SBA-15 doping increased and more  nanosized  grains  were  formed.  When  the  SBA-15  doping  exceeded  3%,  the amorphous insulating SBA-15 began to agglomerate and crystallize as shown by the XRD  patterns,  giving  rise  to  a  reduction  in  the  grain  boundary  conductivity.  The reduction in the grain boundary conductivity is greater than the increase in the grain conductivity.  Therefore,  the  total  conductivity  began  to  reduce  when  the  SBA-15 doping exceeded 3%. 

Infrared  transmission  spectra  of  LATP  and  LATP-3%SBA-15  obtained  by  the sol-gel method are presented in Fig. 7. Clear transmission peaks at 577 and 646 cm-1 appearing for the two samples can be assigned to the Ti-O stretching vibrations of the TiO6  octahedron[35]  and  the  P-O  bending  vibrations  of  the  PO4  tetrahedra[37], respectively.  The  band  detected  at  1022  cm-1  for  LATP  and  at  1023  cm-1  for LATP-3%SBA-15 can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the P-O bonds in PO4 tetrahedra[38]. However, compared with LATP, LATP-3%SBA-15 has a broader peak  in  this  region,  possibly  because  the  bands  overlap  with  the  signal  for  the asymmetric stretching vibration of the Si–O–Si silanol bridge[39]. In addition, a small peak at 796 cm-1 was found in LATP-3%SBA-15 samples that can be assigned to the symmetric  stretching  vibration  of  the  Si-O-Si  silanol  bridge[39].  


NASICON-structured  LATP  doped  with  different  percentages  of  the  SBA-15 mesoporous material were prepared by both solid-state reaction and sol-gel methods. 

Experimental  results  showed  that  for  both  methods,  the  incorporation  of  SBA-15 decreased  the  measured  densities  of  the  samples.  Despite  the  decreasing  density,  a suitable  doping  amount  of  SBA-15  reduced  the  grain  size,  improved  the  total conductivity  and  reduced  the  activation  energy  of  the  total  conductivity  and grain-boundary  conductivity.  Furthermore,  for  both  methods,  the  optimum  doping amount was found to be approximately 3wt%. The improvement in total conductivity originated  from  the  enhancement  in  the  grain  boundary  conductivity  and  was attributed  to  an  amorphous  layer  formed  by  SBA-15  around  the  LATP  grains.  By contrast,  the  doping  of  SiO2  powders  with  the  size  of  1µm  did  not  show  the  same positive effect on the total conductivity of LATP. All of these results showed that the mesoporous  material  can  be  used  to  optimize  the  microstructure  of  lithium  ion conductors and thereby the electrochemical performance of the electrolytes.
