Bulk and nano sized rhombohedral NaTi2(PO4)3 belonging to NASICON family have been prepared by sol-gel method at low temperatures. The products are characterised by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman, SEM and TEM methods. The phase formation of NaTi2(PO4)3 was started at 550°C. The crystallite sizes of NaTi2(PO4)3 prepared at 550°C and 600°C were found to be 35 nm and 37 nm respectively. The nano nature of the samples was confirmed from the line width of powder XRD and Raman lines. The Raman spectra are characterised by bands due to isolated phosphate groups and Ti-O vibrational modes. The morphology of nano crystallites was found to be irregular. The average particle size calculated from TEM was found to be 30 nm and 35 nm for the samples heated at 550°C and 600°C respectively. The high resolution TEM image clearly shows the lattice fringes corresponding to the rhombohedral lattice of NaTi2(PO4)3.

Since Goodenough et al. discovered the high ionic conductivity in Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) (sodium super ionic conductor, abbreviated as NASICON), an explosive growth of literature on these materials was observed [1]. In addition to the high ionic conductivity, this class of materials possess near zero thermal expansion, large surface area due to framework/skeletal structure, ability to exhibit variable resistance in the presence of gases, high thermal stability and high thermal shock resistance [2–5]. Due to these combinations of properties, materials belonging to this family are used as catalysts and catalyst supports, solid electrolytes in fuel cells, hosts for immobilisation of radioactive waste and gas sensors [4]. The structure of these materials is characterised by rigid three-dimensional network of PO4/SiO4 (XO4) tetrahedra sharing corners with ZrO6 octahedra encapsulating the mobile sodium ion in the interconnected interstitial space. The infinite ribbons resulting from this linkage are connected together, perpendicular to the c a x i s b y P O4 (SiO4) tetrahedra to form the NASICON framework [6]. The silicon free compositions (i.e., x = 0) NaZr2(PO4)3 (or NZP) or related NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) also belong to Nasicon group with the same framework structure. The preparation of well crystallised and impurity-free samples is essential for applying these cation-conducting materials to sensors, solid electrolytes and other devices [7,8]. The reported method of preparation of NaTi2(PO4)3 involves heating the TiO2, NaNO3 and NH4H2PO4 at 1200°C for several hours in air [4] or hydrothermally at 200 MPa pressure [9]. Further, it was mentioned in the preparation of related material, Na0.5K0.5Ti2(PO4)3, that titanium pyrophosphate is an intermediate (at 600°C), which decomposes in the presence of sodium and potassium salts at 800–900°C to form Na0.5K0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [ 9 ] . T o o u r knowledge the low temperature preparation of bulk and nano sized NaTi2(PO4)3 is not reported so far. In continuation of our search for better preparative methods of novel materials, we report the preparation of bulk and nano sized NaTi2(PO4)3 employing titanium metal powder as reactant and ethylene glycol as gelating reagent (here after NaTi2(PO4)3 is referred as NTP).

Titanium powder (Sigma-Aldrich, spherical powder-100 mesh), sodium nitrate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, citric acid, ethylene glycol, hydrogen peroxide (30%) and ammonia (25%) (all SD Fine chemicals, 99%) were used as starting materials as received. 0.47 g of Ti powder was added to solution containing 25 ml of hydrogen peroxide and 5 ml of ammonia solution in an ice bath under constant stirring. It takes about 5–6 h for complete dissolution of titanium powder. A yellow gel of composition TiO(OH)2.xH2O was formed after some exothermic reaction [10]. Stoichiometric amounts of sodium nitrate (in 10 ml water) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (in 20 ml water) were added to this gel to get a clear solution. Subsequently, citric acid was added to this resultant solution such that the mole ratio of metal ions to citric acid was 1 : 2. Metal citrates are believed to be formed. The pH of the resultant solution was maintained at 6–7 by adding dilute ammonia solution. The above solution was slowly evaporated on a hot plate under constant stirring till a thick viscous solution was obtained. At this stage, ethylene glycol was added such that the mole ratio of citric acid to ethylene glycol is 1 : 1.2. Then the solution was evaporated at 100°C till a gel was obtained. The temperature was increased to 160–180°C to get a black porous solid. This solid was ground thoroughly using spectral grade acetone to obtain fine powder (designated as ‘precursor’) and heated at 400, 500, 550, 600 and 700°C for 5 h. Scheme 1 shows the flow chart for the sol-gel preparation of NTP. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns obtained on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, D/Max II) using Cu K㼿 radiation (㼿 = 0.1542 nm) were used to characterise the crystalline phase and size of samples. The average crystallite size (D) is estimated using Scherrer equation [11]. The Raman spectra were recorded with Raman spectrometer (Bruker, Equinox 55) using an Nd:YAG laser. The morphology and size characteristics of samples were measured by scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL, JSM-840A) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (FEI, Tecnai G2) operating at 200 kV.

The precursor heated at 400°C and 500°C did not show any diffraction lines indicating the absence of long-range order. The powder X-ray diffractograms of the precursor heated in the temperature range 500–700°C is shown in Figure 1. The powder XRDs of precursor heated at 550°C and above is characterised by d-lines belonging to rhombohedral NTP phase (JCPDS File No: 033-1296) and free from unreacted reactants or undesired products. The broad background (baseline) noticed for samples heated at 550°C and 600°C indicate the presence of trace amount of amorphous material(s). The unit cell parameters deduced from the least square fitting of observed d-lines were found to be a = 8.488; c = 21.789 Å for the sample heated at 700°C, which are very close to those reported values of a = 8.491 and c = 21.785 Å (JCPDS File No: 033-1296). The crystallite size estimated from the line width of intense line (113 plane of NTP) employing Scherrer’s equation was found to be 35 nm and 37 nm for samples heated at 550°C and 600°C respectively. The evolution of powder XRD patterns belonging to rhombohedral phase of NTP suggests the absence of any intermediate phase formation. This is in contrast to the reported preparation of Na0.5K0.5Ti2(PO4)3 where titanium pyrophosphate was formed as intermediate [9]. Cretin et al. have reported the preparation of LiTi2(PO4)3 from Ti(OC4H9)4, CH3COOLi and NH4H2PO4 in ethanol-water medium by sol-gel method at 950°C without any gelating agent [12]. They have noticed that LiTi2(PO4)3 start to crystallise at 640°C and single-phase material was obtained at 950°C [12]. As mentioned in the earlier section, the reported method of preparation of NTP consists of heating the reactants at 1200°C for several hours [4]. Further, many heating cycles are required to obtain single-phase material. The present method of preparation is thus better on account of the lower temperature and is impurity free.

It is well known that powder XRD gives information regarding the presence of longrange order in solids. The presence of short-range order, on the other hand, can be obtained from the Raman spectral results. Therefore, we have recorded the Raman spectra of the precursor heated at all temperatures. The Raman spectra of the precursor heated at various temperatures are shown in Figure 2. The Raman spectra of precursor heated at 400°C and 500°C did not show any characteristic bands observed for TiO2 (anatase or rutile) or any other sodium or phosphorous containing compounds indicating the absence of short-range order. Thus the precursors heated at 400°C and 500°C are truly amorphous. The line width (full width at half maximum, FWHM) of samples heated at 550, 600 and 700°C was found to be 25, 19 and 16 cm–1 respectively. It was reported that large line width of Raman spectral lines could be due to either small particle size or defect structure of the material [13]. As the powder XRD of the samples are characterised by the absence of any super structure lines and corresponds to rhombohedral lattice, we attribute the relatively broad line width observed for the samples heated at 550°C and 600°C to small particle size in congruent with powder XRD results. The Raman spectra of Nasicon type materials are characterised by the bands due to phosphate group and lattice modes of vibration [14,15]. The Raman spectra observed in the present investigation are similar to those reported for NTP [16]. The band positions and the assignments are given in Table 1 along with the positions observed for NTP.

Further structural and morphological characterisation was carried out by SEM and TEM measurements. Figure 3 shows the SEM images of the precursor heated at 550°C. It is composed of irregular shaped particles with a wide distribution in particle size. Figure 4 shows the TEM images of samples obtained at 550, 600 and 700°C along with the SAED pattern obtained for the sample heated at 550°C. The images show irregular shaped particles with considerable agglomeration and wide distribution in particle size. The particle size estimated from these images was found to be in the range 28–32, 33–37 and 55–75 nm for samples heated at 550, 600 and 700°C respectively. The SAED patterns recorded for the samples heated at 550, 600 and 700°C suggest the single crystalline nature of the samples. The particle size obtained from TEM images was in close agreement with the crystallite size obtained from XRD result using Scherrer’s equation. The high magnification TEM was recorded for all the samples. Figure 4(c) shows the high magnification TEM image of the sample heated at 550°C. This image clearly exhibits the lattice fringes indicating the crystalline nature of the sample. The distance between the planes was found to be 3.75 Å, which is close to the reported value of 3.666 Å (1 1 3 plane) (JCPDS File No: 033-1296).

Single-phase nano and bulk NTP were prepared by sol-gel method at low temperatures using ethylene glycol as gelating reagent. The relatively broad line width observed in the powder XRD patterns and Raman spectra of samples heated at 550°C and 600°C suggest the nano nature of the samples. From powder XRD, the crystallite sizes were found to be 35 nm and 37 nm for the samples heated at 550°C and 600°C respectively. Raman spectra show characteristic bands due to phosphate groups and lattice modes. SEM image shows the irregular shape of particles for the sample heated at 550°C. The TEM images of the samples suggest the nano nature of the samples. The particle size estimated from TEM measurements was found to be in the range 28–32, 33–37 and 55–75 nm for the samples heated at 550, 600 and 700°C respectively.
