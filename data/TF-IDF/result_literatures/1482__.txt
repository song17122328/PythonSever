A tubular type sensor utilizing NASICON and a couple of metal oxide sensing electrodes was designed for detecting NH3 and C7H8 simultaneously. Here, NASICON was synthesized by sol–gel process. For detecting NH3 and C7H8, C-doped C2O3 and ZnO–TiO2 were used for the sensing electrodes, respectively. Good linear correlations between the EMF values of the sensor and the logarithm of the concentrations for 50–500 ppm NH3 and 5–50 ppm C7H8 were obtained at 250–400 ◦C. The sensitivities of the sensor to NH3 and C7H8 were −91 and −60 mV/decade, respectively at 350 ◦C. Moreover, the sensor exhibited well selectivity and rapid response–recovery characteristics to NH3 and C7H8.

The main pollutants existed in indoor environment are ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as toluene, xylene, formaldehyde and benzene. Ammonia in house mainly comes from the concrete antifreezer whose main raw materials are urea and ammonia water. The inhalation of ammonia by humans can cause respiratory symptoms such as pharyngitis, cough, hoarseness, hemosputum, chest distress, dyspnea as well as other symptoms (dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, etc.). Toluene of indoor air primarily is derived from some solvents, perfume, detergent, wallpaper, adhesives paint, etc. The inhalation of toluene can result in neurasthenia syndrome, hepatomegaly, female menstruation disorder and some skin disorders, etc. In addition, the toluene concentration is generally utilized to express the total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs). So it is necessary to develop the compact and integrated sensors for detecting ammonia and toluene in indoor environment. At present, various types of ammonia sensors, e.g., conductive type using metal oxide [1], organic thin ﬁlm type [2] and optical ﬁber sensor [3], have been proposed. On the other hand, many kinds of toluene sensors have been reported also, for instance, quartz vibrator toluene sensors [4], metal-oxide-based electronic nose [5]. However, there are no integrated sensors for detecting ammonia and toluene simultaneously up to now.

Recently, solid electrolyte type gas sensors are widely used for detecting CO2, H2S, NOx and Cl2 [6–9] due to their well selectivity, rapid response and good reproducing performances. However, these types of sensors have been studied for measuring ammonia and toluene. Generally, solid electrolyte type sensors are operated at 300–700 ◦C [10,11], so that it is needed to reduce the power dissipation for these kinds of sensors.

This paper presents the fabrication and the sensing properties of the NH3/C7H8 sensor based on NASICON and dual oxide sensing electrodes. C-doped Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2 were testiﬁed for detecting NH3 and C7H8, respectively. The sensing mechanism connected with the mixed potential was suggested for the sensor.

The NASICON precursor was prepared with ZrO(NO3)2, NaNO3, (NH4)2HPO4 and Si(C2H5O)4 by sol–gel process. The detailed process had been described in our previous papers [6,12,13]. ZnO–TiO2 (molar ratio 1:1) was also synthesized by sol–gel method. In this process, Ti(OC4H9)4 and ZnCl2 were used as precursors, C2H5OH was utilized as solvent and CH3COOH as chelating agent. The obtained sol was dried at 100 ◦C for 20 h, and the gel was sintered at 600 ◦C for 3 h. The C-doped Cr2O3 sensing material was prepared by mixing porous carbon nanotubes (Shenzhen Billnt Corporation, China, 10–30 nm for diameter) with Cr2O3 (Shenyang Reagent Corporation), by fully grinding in the agate mortar and sintering at 600 ◦C for 3 h. Weight ratio of carbon nanotubes was 10 wt.%. The formation of single-phase NASICON, ZnO–TiO2 and C-doped Cr2O3 was conﬁrmed by X-ray diffraction (a Rigaku wide-angle X-ray diffraction D/max rA, using Cu K␣ radiation at wavelength  2) = 0.1541 nm) analysis.

The sensor was fabricated using a small alumina tube (8 mm long, 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm in the inner and outer diameter) as shown in Fig. 1. A thick ﬁlm of NASICON was formed on the outer surface of the alumina tube by applying the NASICON precursor paste and sintering at 900 ◦C for 6 h. The mesh-shaped Au electrode was formed on the two ends and the central section of the NASICON layer. Then C-doped Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2 were coated on the mesh-shaped Au electrode at the two ends as the sensing electrodes and sintered at 600 ◦C, and the mesh-shaped Au electrode at the central section was used as reference (counter) electrode. The thickness of the sensing electrodes was approximately 0.5 mm. Here, C-doped Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2 were named as the electrode A and B, respectively, and the corresponding sensors as the sensor A and B, respectively. A Ni–Cr coil (30  3)) was set in the inner of the alumina tube as the heating apparatus.

Gas sensing properties of the sensors were measured in a conventional static testing apparatus. The sample gases containing different concentration of NH3, C7H8, NO2, NO, CO, CH4, H2 and HCHO were obtained by diluting pure gases with O2 (21%) and N2 (79%). When the sensor was exposed to air or a sample gas, the electromotive forces (EMFs) were measured by a digital electrometer and the results obtained were registered with a computer connected to the electrometer.

XRD analysis was used to conﬁrm the crystal structures of NASICON, ZnO–TiO2 and C-doped Cr2O3 nano-powders. Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of NASICON prepared by sol–gel process. The synthesized NASICON is demonstrated to have a single phase of rhombohedral (a: 0.9077 nm, c: 2.3065 nm). The mean crystalline size of NASICON calculated with Debye–Scherrer equation is about 22 nm. Fig. 3 exhibits the XRD pattern of Zn/Ti composite oxide prepared by sol–gel process, and the obtained powder is conﬁrmed to be the mixture of ZnTiO3 with rhombohedral structure (a: 0.5076 nm, c: 1.3920 nm), TiO2 with rutile (a: 0.458 nm, c: 0.295 nm) and anatase structure (a: 0.373 nm, c: 0.937 nm). Fig. 4 shows the XRD pattern of C-doped Cr2O3. The powder is conﬁrmed to be a single phase of rhombohedral (a: 0.495876 nm, c: 1.35942 nm).

Since two sensors (sensors A and B) were made on the same tube, the main problem was to concentrate upon the matching of the best operating temperature and the interference to two sensors from the other gases.

Fig. 5(a) shows the correlations between the EMFs and the logarithm of the toluene concentration for the sensors A and B. It could be seen that the sensitivities (slopes) of sensor A using C-doped Cr2O3 sensing electrode to toluene were very small at 250–400 ◦C. On the other hand, the EMF values of sensor B using ZnO–TiO2 sensing electrode were proportional to the logarithm of toluene concentration, and the slopes were −43, −66, −60 and −42 mV/decade at 250, 300, 350 and 400 ◦C, respectively.

Fig. 5(b) shows the dependence of the EMFs of the sensor on ammonia concentration. The EMF values of the sensor A were almost proportional to the logarithm of the ammonia concentration and the slopes were −60, −73, −91 and −46 mV/decade at 250, 300, 350 and 400 ◦C, respectively. From another point of view, the EMF values of sensor B were proportional to the logarithm of ammonia

Fig. 6. Response transients of the NH3/C7H8 double function incorporate sensor on switching on or off 5, 10, 20, 50 ppm C7H8 and 50, 100, 200, 500 ppm NH3 at 350 ◦C.

concentration too. However, the slopes were quite smaller than those of sensor A to ammonia.

When the sensor A was placed only in the toluene atmosphere, sensor was not sensitive to C7H8, whereas the largest sensitivity of sensor B to C7H8 occurred at 300 ◦C. By contrast, when the sensor was in the ammonia merely, the largest sensitivity of sensor A occurred at 350 ◦C. However, the sensitivity of sensor B to NH3 was much lesser than that of sensor A. Based on the above results, the best operating temperature for the total sensor should be at the range of 300–350 ◦C.

Moreover, the response kinetics of the sensor to NH3 and C7H8 were investigated as shown in Fig. 6. The 90% response times of sensor A using C-doped Cr2O3 sensing electrode to 50 and 500 ppm NH3 were 35 and 30 s, respectively, the 90% recovery times were 60 and 65 s, respectively at 350 ◦C. The 90% response times of sensor B using ZnO–TiO2 sensing electrode to 5 and 50 ppm C7H8 were 60 and 50 s, the 90% recovery times were 50 and 70 s, respectively at 350 ◦C.

Furthermore, the sensor also exhibited well selectivity to ammonia and toluene against the interference gases, such as NO2, NO, CH4, CO, H2, and HCHO at 350 ◦C. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 7. The cross-sensitivities of the sensor to these interference gases were rather small or almost none and indicated excellent NH3/C7H8 selectivity.

As described, the sensor based on NASICON and dual sensing electrodes (Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2) gave good linear correlations between the EMF values and the logarithm of NH3 and C7H8 concentrations. Miura et al. had established a sensing mechanism involving mixed potentials for a group of sensors combining stabilized zirconia with oxide electrodes, such as NOx, H2, CO sensors [14,10,11]. Therefore, a similar sensing mechanism would be attempted to explain the sensing behavior for the present sensors. Here, NASICON acts as an ion conductive layer and Cr2O3 or ZnO–TiO2 plays a role as the sensing electrode.

The sensor attached with Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2 sensing electrodes could be expressed with the following electrochemical cells, respectively: NH3 in air, Cr2O3, Au|NASICON| Au, NH3 in air C7H8 in air, ZnO − TiO2, Au|NASICON|Au, C7H8 in air

For explaining the sensing behavior of the device, XPS analysis was applied for measuring the chemical shift of the related elements (e.g., O1s, Cr2p and N2s) on the surface of porous Cr2O3 before (sample 1) and after (sample 2) exposure to 2000 ppm NH3 at 350 ◦C, the basic pressure of the XPS chamber was over 1× 10−7 Pa. This results had been reported in our previous papers [15]. It was found that the chemical binding energies of O1s, and Cr2p did not change before and after exposure to 2000 ppm NH3. There is no N element in sensing electrode after chemical reaction. It could therefore draw the conclusions that NH3 reaches gas status after reacting with Cr2O3 sensing electrode. The resultants might be N2, N2O, NO or NO2. However, the most possible resultant should be N2 according to the activated energy.

According to the above results, it was proposed that a couple of electrochemical reactions (3) and (4) occurred at sensing electrode A and counter electrodes of the electrochemical cell described by (1), respectively, 2NH3 + 3Na2O(in NASICON) → N2 + 3H2O + 6Na 4Na

+ + O2 + 4e The above two electrochemical reactions constructed a local cell on the sensing electrode–electrolyte–gas interface of sensor A. When the rates of reactions (3) and (4) were equal, they arrived at a dynamic equilibrium, and the potential at the sensing electrode was the mixed potential. In addition, we could deal with the local cell quantitatively. The electric current densities of the oxidation and reduction reactions (3) and (4) can be represented by the following:iNH3 = i0NH3 exp 6˛1F(EM1 − E0 NH3)RT (5)iO2 = i0O2 exp
−4˛2F(EM1 − E0O2)RT EM1 is the electrode potential, F the Faraday constant, R the gas constant and T the temperature. E0, i0 and ˛ are electrode potentials at equilibrium, exchange current density, and transfer coefﬁcient, respectively for reactions (3) and (4). At the equilibrium state, the absolute values of the above electric current densities were equal, but the directions were opposite. So the equilibrium state could be expressed with the following equation: iNH3 + iO2 We supposed the exchange current densities satisfy the following kinetic equations, respectively.= B1Cm1 NH3 = −B2Cn1 O2 Here, C represents the concentrations of NH3 or O2, B1, B2, m1 and n1 are the constants. Through Eqs. (5)–(9), the following equation could be attained. EM1 = E01 + n1A1 ln CO2 2(3˛1 + 2˛2)F EM1 is the electrode potential of the sensing electrode at the equilibrium state, so it is called mixed potential. When the concentration of oxygen is ﬁxed, the mixed potential changes linearly with the logarithm of NH3 concentration, described as follows: EM1 = E 5) 01 Here, = E01 + n1A1 ln CO2 E 5) 01 When the sensor was put in the toluene atmosphere, the most likely product of reaction occurred at sensing electrode B should be CO2. Similar to the reactions in sensor A, a couple of electrochemical reactions (4) and (12) could occur at sensing electrode B and counter electrodes of the electrochemical cell described by (2), respectively, C7H8 + 18Na2O(in NASICON) → 7CO2 + 4H2O + 36Na By treating Eqs. (4) and (12) with the same process described above, we could obtain the following equations: EM2 = E02 + n2A2 ln CO2 (13) Here, CC7H8 is the concentration of C7H8, E02, m2, and n2 were the constants. EM2 is the electrode potential on the ZnO–TiO2 sensing electrodes at equilibrium state. When the concentration of oxygen was ﬁxed, the mixed potential was linear with the logarithm of C7H8 concentration as described in Eq. (14). EM2 = E 5) 02 Here, = E02 + n2A2 ln CO2 E 5) 02 Eqs. (11) and (14) could explain the experimental linearity as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b) very well, but some additional tests for the present sensing mechanism needed to be carried out, such as the relations between the EMF values and the O2 concentration at the ﬁxed NH3 and C7H8 concentrations. These would be perfected in the future study.

A tubular dual NH3/C7H8 sensor combining NASICON with a couple of oxide electrodes (C-doped Cr2O3, ZnO–TiO2) was designed and fabricated. The sensor showed excellent characteristics to NH3 and C7H8. Good linear correlations between the EMF values of the sensor and the concentrations of NH3 and C7H8 were obtained at the concentration ranges of 50–500, 5–50 ppm, respectively at 250–400 ◦C. The sensitivities of the sensor to NH3 and C7H8 were −91 and −60 mV/decade at 350 ◦C, respectively. Moreover, the sensor exhibited well selectivity and rapid response–recovery characteristics to NH3 and C7H8.
