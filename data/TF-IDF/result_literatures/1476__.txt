The  subsolidus  region  of  the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–In2(MoO4)3  ternary  salt  system  has  been studied by X 2)ray powder diffraction. The formation of new compounds Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) and AgMg3In(MoO4)5 has been established. The unit cell parameters of solid 2)solution samples have been determined. The Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3 phase of variable composition has a NASICON 2)type structure (space group R3c) AgMg3In(MoO4)5 is isostructural to sodium magnesium indium molybdate of the same formula unit and crystallizes in triclinic system (space group P1, Z = 2) with the following unit cell parame 2) ters: a = 7.0374(5) Å, b = 17.932(1) Å, c = 6.9822(4) Å, α = 87.309(6)°, β = 100.832(6)°, γ = 92.358(6)°. The compounds Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3 and AgMg3In(MoO4)5 are thermally stable up to 960 and 1030°C, respectively. 

The interactions in systems containing molybdates of mono 2), bi 2) and trivalent metals are of interest from the standpoint of both revealing phase formation reg 2) ularities and synthesizing new materials with various important  physicochemical  properties.  Compounds that  demonstrate  crystallochemical  similarity  to NASICON 2)type ones with a high ionic conductivity [1–5] are promising.

This work studies phase formation in the subsolidus region of the system involving silver, magnesium, and indium molybdates and determines the X 2)ray diffrac 2) tion and thermal characteristics of ternary molybdates and the conditions for their synthesis.

Silver,  magnesium,  and  indium  molybdates  that were  previously  synthesized  by  the  solid 2)phase method  including  the  staged  annealing  of  AgNO3 (pure  for  analysis  grade),  MgO  (chemically  pure grade), In2O3 (pure grade), and molybdenum trioxide (chemically pure grade) in the stoichiometric ratio at 350–450 (Ag2MoO4), Ag2MoO4), 400–750 (MgMoO4), and 400–800°С (In2(MoO4)3) served as initial compo 2) nents. The X 2)ray diffraction and thermal characteris 2) tics of the synthesized compounds agree satisfactorily and with  data  AgIn(MoO4)2 double molybdates were synthesized by a solid 2)phase  method  from  the  relevant  neutral  molyb 2) dates as described in [10–12].

Phase  formation  in  the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4– In2(MoO4)3 system was studied by the intersecting sec 2) tions method in the subsolidus region. The MgMoO4AgIn(MoO4)2  join,  where  intermediate  phases  were formed,  was  studied  over  the  entire  concentration region  in  steps  of  5–10  mol  %  and  in  the  neighbor 2) hood of new compounds, in steps of 2.0–2.5 mol %. While  equilibrium  was  attained,  the  phase  composi 2) tion was monitored by X 2)ray diffraction.

To determine a possible homogeneity region in the Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–In2(MoO4)3 system, Ag1 – xMg1 – x In1 + x(MoO4)3 samples were prepared in Δx = 0.1 steps within the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 and stepwise annealed in air in  steps  of  50°С  starting  at  350°С  with  intermediate grinding every 20–30 h. The annealing duration was 50–100 h at every temperature. Every rise in tempera 2) ture  was  preceded  by  an  X 2)ray  diffraction  study  of  a sample.  The  homogeneity  region  boundaries  were determined  by  X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  in  air 2) quenched samples. The homogeneity extent was esti 2) mated by X 2)ray diffraction from both the absence of impurity lines and the changes in the unit cell param 2) eters of air 2)quenched samples.

X 2)ray  diffraction  studies  were  performed  on  a Brukeraks  D8  Advance  automatic  powder  diffracto 2) meter  (CuKα  radiation,  graphite  monochromator, maximal angle 2θ = 90°, 0.01°–0.02° scan steps, 1 s per point) and on an FR 2)552 monochromator cham 2) ber (CuKα1 radiation, Ge internal standard).

Differential thermal analysis was performed on an MOM  OD 2)103  derivatograph  (heating  rate  was 10 K/min, sample size was 0.3–0.4 g).

Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4 and Ag2MoO4– In2(MoO4)3  systems  were  studied  in  [10–13],  so  we have not additionally considered them.

The  Ag2MoO4–In2(MoO4)3 and  Ag2MoO4– the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4– MgMoO4  In2(MoO4)3  concentration  triangle  are  characterized by the formation of Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3 and AgIn(MoO4)2 double  molybdates.  Silver  magnesium  molybdate Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3 belongs to the Na2Mg5(MoO4)6 struc 2) tural  family,  crystallizes  in  triclinic  system  (space group   Z = 2), undergoes a reversible polymorphic transformation  at  500–530°С,  and  melts  incongru 2) ently  at  740°С.  The  homogeneity  region  expands towards  MgMoO4  to  reach  2.0–2.5  mol  %  at  500°С [10].  The  AgIn(MoO4)2  double  molybdate  exists  in two  polymorphs:  low 2)temperature  α 3)AgIn(MoO4)2 (Na2Zr(WO4)3  structure  type)  transforms  to  high 2) temperature triclinic β 3)AgIn(MoO4)2 (NaIn(MoO4)2 structure type at 600°С. The heating of a metastable phase  obtained  by  quenching  results  in  the  β    α transition  at  ∼450°С.  The  double  molybdate  melts incongruently at 650°С [11–13].

We have not detected any phase on the MgMoO4– In2(MoO4)3 edge under our experimental conditions. To  investigate  the  interactions  in  the  Ag2MoO4– MgMoO4–In2(MoO4)3  system,  we  prepared  mixtures of  neutral  and  double  molybdates  in  a  specified  sto 2) ichiometric  ratio,  including  the  compositions  of  the intersection points for all sections existing in the sys 2) tem. The analysis of the phase composition of the sys 2) tem at intersection points and points located inside the Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–In2(MoO4)3 triangle shows that at  620°С,  phase  relations  are  characterized  by  the quasi 2)binary  joins:  MgMoO4–AgMg3In(MoO4)5, Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3–AgMg3In(MoO4)5,  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3– AgIn(MoO4)2, AgMg3In(MoO4)5–Ag1–xMg1–xIn1+x(MoO4)3, 0  ≤  x  ≤  0.5,  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3–Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x (MoO4)3,  Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3–AgIn(MoO4)2, Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3–In2(MoO4)3,  and AgMg3 In(MoO4)5–In2(MoO4)3 (figure).

According to the X 2)ray powder diffraction data, the synthesized  AgMgIn(MoO4)3  and  AgMg3In(MoO4)5 triple molybdates do not have an appreciable homoge 2) neity  region  along  the  AgIn(MoO4)2–MgMoO4  join. An Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3 phase of variable com 2) position  is  formed  along  the  AgMgIn(MoO4)3– In2(MoO4)3  join  and  represents  an  AgMgIn(MoO4)3 based  subtraction  solid  solution,  whose  single 2)phase region  reaches  x  =  0.5.  Weak  In2(MoO4)3  reflections appear in X 2)ray diffraction patterns at a higher con 2) centration  of  indium  cations.  We  did  not  manage  to separate individual phases at x = 0 and 0.1 by varying the time and temperature of annealing. Along with the Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3 phase, the β 3)AgIn(MoO4)2 double molybdate was revealed in samples.

It should be noted that the extent of Ag1 – xMg1 – x In1 + x(MoO4)3  solid  solution  quenched  from  700°С increases up to x = 0.6.

X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  showed  that  the  Ag 1 – x Mg1 – x In1 + x(MoO4)3 compounds are isostructural to sodium  zinc  scandium  molybdate  [14],  which  has  a rhombohedral unit cell (space group   Z = 6), as to reflection positions and intensity ratios. The indexing results for Ag0.7Mg0.7In1.3(MoO4)3 are given in Tables 1 as an example.

Parameters  of  some  compositions  of  Ag1 – xMg1 – x In1 + x(MoO4)3 solid solution, namely, а, с, and unit cell volume, increase in the region with lower silver con 2) centrations (Table 2).

The  individual  AgMg3In(MoO4)5  was  obtained upon  annealing  for  100–120  h  and  650–700°С.  It  is isostructural  to  NaMg3In(MoO4)5,  which  has  been synthesized by us earlier [15] and indexed in triclinic system (space group P1, Z = 2) with the following unit cell parameters: a = 7.0374(5) Å, b = 17.932(1) Å, c = 6.9822(4)  Å,  α  =  87.309(6)°,  β  =  100.832(6)°, γ = 92.358(6)°,  V  =  863.99  Å3,  ρcalc  =  4.21  g/cm3 (Table 3).

Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x(MoO4)3  is  thermally  stable  up to  960°С;  AgMg3In(MoO4)5  melts  incongruently  at 1030°С. There is no polymorphic transformations.

In  summary,  phase  formation  in  the  Ag2MoO4– MgMoO4–In2(MoO4)3 system was studied for the first time.  New  triple  molybdates  AgMg3In(MoO4)5  and AgMgIn(MoO4)3  have  been  synthesized,  and  the region of AgMgIn(MoO4)3 2)based solid solutions has been  discovered.  Crystallographic  and  thermal  char 2) acteristics  were  determined  for  the  compounds  syn 2) thesized. It has been established that Ag1 – xMg1 – xIn1 + x (MoO4)3, where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6, are related to the NASICON structural  type  (space  group  which  suggests  a high ionic conductivity.
