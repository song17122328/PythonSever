NASICON materials have been extensively studied because of the high conductivity shown by some compositions.1,2 They are versatile materials and can tolerate a wide range of compositional variation. The original NASICONs were solid solutions derived from NaZr2P3O12 by partial replacement of P by Si with Na excess to balance the negatively charged framework to yield the general formula Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 e x e 3). Since then, a large number of related materials have been synthesized including the series Na1+xMM(PO4)3. Partial trivalent metal substitution at the octahedral metal site to give Na1+xZr2-xMx(PO4)3 has been widely studied

The NASICON structure has a negatively charged 3D framework, of general formula M2X3O12, within which the Na+ cations reside, in full or partially occupied sites. The framework is built of XO4 tetrahedra linked by corners to MO6 octahedra. Each XO4 tetrahedron shares each corner with one MO6 octahedron, and conversely, each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different XO4 group. The interstitial voids generated within the network are of two types known as M1 and M2 sites (1:3 multiplicity). The large counterbalance Na+ cations are located in these positions. An initial approach to correlate electrical parameters (ionic conductivities and activation energies) with generic average structural parameters (unit cell constants) was followed by scrutiny of specific structural factors such as the size of the bottleneck that connects the M1 and M2 sites.9 However, to establish possible correlations of this type, full crystal structure information is required. This may be obtained either by single-crystal diffraction or by Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data.

Several NMR studies of NASICONs have been carried out. 31P MAS NMR on the Na1+2xZr2-xMgx(PO4)3 series indicated a nearly random distribution of cations at the octahedral sites.10 Using 23Na MAS NMR data for this series and the Na1-xZr2-xNbx(PO4)3 series,11 the positions of Na at M1 and M2 sites were investigated by applying inversion-recovery techniques. Using 23Na MAS NMR data for Na1+xZr2(PO4)3-x(SiO4)x the quadrupolar parameters for Na at the two structural sites were estimated.12 From variable-temperature 23Na NMR data for Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 (not MAS), it was also possible to characterize sodium mobility.13 This series was also studied by impedance spectroscopy, although only overall conductivities were reported.7 Using a multitechnique approach, combining crystal structure determination, local structure analysis by 23Na and 31P MAS NMR, and electrical conductivity measurement by impedance spectroscopy, we showed that for the phases Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Ti, Sn, Zr, Hf) the sizes of the bottlenecks between M1 and M2 sites correlate with ion conductivity.14

To better understand the dependence of mobility of the charge carrier with the structure and geometry of conduction pathways, the Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 series has been studied by different techniques: XRPD and 31P MAS NMR to characterize the structure combined with variable temperature neutron powder diffraction (TNPD), 23Na T-MAS NMR and impedance spectroscopy to study the sodium mobilities.

The starting mixtures were ground in an agate mortar with ethanol for 1 h, dried, heated in a Pt crucible at 0.5 °C 226)min-1 to 400 °C and left at that temperature for 1 day to release gases (NH3, H2O, and CO2). To avoid unreacted ZrO2 and the formation of MP2O7 byproduct, the samples were heated at 0.5 °C 226)min-1 to 1000 °C with intermediate regrinding (for 30 min every 150 °C). The calcined materials were then reground in a planetary ball mill for 10 min and calcined at 1100 °C for 24 h. This last treatment was repeated twice (for all samples) to obtain homogeneous products. Nine Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 samples were prepared for x ) 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 and are labeled Inx.

XRPD patterns were collected at room temperature using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with (ı/2ı) Bragg-Brentano geometry. To check the progress of the reaction, patterns were recorded between 13° and 50° (2ı) with 0.04° step size and 1 s counting time. To refine the crystal structures by the Rietveld method,15 the profiles were collected between 13° and 125° (2ı) with 0.03° step size and 16 s counting time.

NPD patterns for In0.8 and In1.6 were collected on a D1B diffractometer (at ILL) operating under standard conditions with  236) ) 2.54 Å at 150, 200, 250, and 275 K using a cryostat and 293, 400, and 500 K using a furnace. The bank detector (0.05° step size) was fixed to record a limited but representative region 31°-111° (2ı) for 10 min.

31P and 23Na MAS NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature in a MSL 400 Bruker spectrometer at 161.96 and 105.84 MHz. Samples were spun at 10-12 kHz and spectra taken after  240)/2 pulse irradiation (3-4  237)s). A time interval of 2-90 s between successive scans was chosen, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation times of the nuclei. The number of scans was in the range 10-30. Chemical shifts are given relative to 85% aqueous H3PO4 and to 1 M aqueous NaCl. To reduce Na mobility, 23Na MAS NMR spectra were also collected at  24)200 K under the same conditions. Analysis of both types of spectra was carried out using the Bruker program WINFIT. Deconvolution used a standard, nonlinear least-squares fitting method. The spinning rate and the position, line width, and intensity of components are determined automatically. However, chemical shift anisotropies (¢ 243) and Ł) for 31P and quadrupole constants ( 238)Q and Ł) for 23Na are adjustable parameters that must be determined by trial and error. Impedance data were collected on cylindrical pellets ( 24)10 mm diameter and  24)1 mm thickness) obtained by pressing fine powder at 150 MPa, for 30 s, with 3 wt %/vol PVA aqueous solution added as a binder (one drop each  24)0.2 g). The pellets were heated at 2 °C/min to 800 °C to remove organic matter, sintered at 1230-1300 °C for 2 h, and quenched to room temperature. To reduce possible volatilization of soda, pellets were covered with powder of the same sample during sintering. The porosities estimated from the pellet mass and geometry were in the range 8-23% (sample with x ) 0 was impossible to sinter). Electrodes were made by coating opposite pellet faces with In-Ga alloy ( 24)1:1). The impedance data were collected using a Hewlett-Packard 4192A impedance analyzer over the frequency range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz. The samples were studied from -25 to 200 °C at approximately 15 °C intervals. The pellets were mounted in a conductivity jig whose leads were shielded separately inside a tube furnace or a Dewar. For low-temperature measurements, the samples were allowed to equilibrate for  24)1 h prior to measurements; temperatures were accurate to (1 °C.

Initial XRPD data indicated that the members of this series for x < 1.8 are crystalline single phases which have the rhombohedral R3hc NASICON-type structure. The x ) 2 sample, Na3In2(PO4)3, was a mixture of a NASICON-type phase plus an alluaudite type phase and was not studied further. The crystal structures were refined by the Rietveld method using the structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 as starting model.1 The nominal Zr/In contents were assumed to be randomly distributed over the octahedral sites. It was also assumed, in the starting model, that there was full occupancy of the Na(1) site at (0 0 0; 6b Wyckoff notation) and random distribution of the sodium excess on the M2 site (0.65 0 1/4; 18e). Then, the common overall parameters, scale factor, background coefficients, unit cell parameters, zero-shift error, and pseudo-Voigt coefficients,16 corrected for asymmetry,17 were optimized.

It became apparent, during an early stage of the refinements, that experimental peak intensities, especially those for In1.6 and In1.8, were not reproducible. This was due to the presence of large microparticle aggregates (grains) without random orientation. This “preferred orientation” could not be taken into account using the March-Dollase correction.18 Instead, the successfully adopted method was to prepare random samples using the TASC (tubular aerosol suspension chamber) method19 in which aerosol particles of NASICON were generated by convection in a fluidized bed of glass beads mixed with the NASICON powder. This method of preparation, for In1.6 and In1.8, gave a highly uniform layer of small particles randomly distributed on a glass fiber filter substrate with reproducible XRPD peak intensities.

Once instrumental parameters had been taken into account, positional parameters were refined with the Zr/In ratios fixed at their expected values. This assumption was supported by the absence of impurity phases and by the quantitative analysis of the 31P MAS NMR spectra (see below). The XRPD refinements of the initial model, with full occupancy of Na(1) and the excess sodium on the Na(2) site, yielded large isotropic tem-

Final Rietveld figures of merit were good (Table 1) with RF ranging between 3 and 6%. Final refined unit cell parameters are also given in Table 1, atomic parameters in Table 2, selected distances in Table 3, and angles in Table 4. The areas of the bottleneck triangles, as defined in ref 14, are given in Table 1. As an example of the Rietveld refinement quality, the fit for the combined refinement of In1.6 is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The isotropic temperature factors for sodium atoms obtained from the T-NPD analyses are plotted in Figure 3.

MAS NMR Study. Room temperature 31P MAS NMR spectra for the Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 series (Figure 4) are formed by five components with their corresponding spinning sidebands (not shown). In the NASICON structure, each tetrahedron shares oxygens with four octahedra, two in the same M2(PO4)3 unit and two in adjacent units. On the basis of homogeneous statistical distribution of triand tetravalent cations, the five observed components can be assigned to P(OZr)4, P(OZr)3(OIn)1, P(OZr)2(OIn)2, P(OZr)(OIn)3, and P(OIn)4 environments. The position of the 31P MAS NMR peaks depends on the polarizing strength of cations that share oxygens with the PO4 tetrahedra. Thus, strongly polarizing cations pull the electron density away from oxygens more effectively and cause the NMR peaks to shift to more negative values. This effect is cumulative and produces the five components detected in 31P MAS NMR spectra (Figure 4 and Table 5). The peaks occur at increasingly negative chemical shifts as the number of Zr neighbors increases. In addition to this “first-order” effect, in which the chemical shift values depend on the

but different Ł values, 0 and 0.8, give a satisfactory fit to these spectra. The average line broadenings were 8 and 17 ppm for In0.2 and In0.4, respectively. For x g 0.8 phases, a single signal with axial characteristics was detected. The experimental envelope became sharper and shifted toward more positive chemical shifts as x increased.

Impedance Study. Representative impedance data for one composition at two temperatures are shown as impedance complex plane plots in Figure 7; similar plots were obtained for all compositions. At room temperature, a very broad arc is observed in which at least two poorly resolved components can be distinguished. At lowest frequencies, the beginning of a spike is seen

which is more developed at higher temperatures. The spike has an associated capacitance (calculated from the ¢ ) ( 246)C)-1), of  24)0.1  237)F and, since it is ideal relation Z¢ inclined to the Z¢ axis at  24)70-80°, it indicates a blocking electrode response; therefore, the conducting species must be ionic, i.e., Na+ ions. The total pellet resistance, RT, is obtained from the intercept of the spike and/or the arc (low-frequency end) on the Z¢ axis.

Further information on the electrical microstructure of the sample and the separation of possible bulk/grain boundary contributions is obtained from spectroscopic ¢ plots of the same impedance data (Figure 8). At Z¢ ¢ /M¢ room temperatures, the M¢ ¢ spectrum shows a broadened peak with associated capacitance (calculated from ¢ ) C0/2Cp at the maximum) of  24)6 pF. Since the data M¢ were not corrected for the capacitance of the sample holder (a few pF, in parallel with the capacitance of the sample), this peak certainly represents the bulk response of the sample; the bulk high-frequency permittivity [calculated from  15)¢ ) CA-1l/8.854  2) 10-14, where A is the sample area (area of electrode contact) and l the thickness] is in the range 10-50.

This component dominates the Z¢ ¢ spectrum and, therefore, forms the major part of the total resistance of the samples. A third component in the overall response is evident as a lower frequency shoulder peak in the Z¢ ¢ spectrum, with an associated capacitance of  24)50 pF. This is attributed to a more traditional thin grain boundary region and makes a significant contribution to the overall pellet impedance; because its capacitance is quite high, it is

A solid solution with a wide range of compositions, Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 (0.0 e x e 1.8), has been synthesized. Observed 31P MAS NMR peaks correspond to the five possible phosphorus environments [P(OZr)4-n(OIn)n (n ) 0-4)]. If a random distribution of Zr and In cations

in the octahedra occurs, the intensities of the five possible 31P components should be proportional to (2 x)4, 4(2 x)3x, 6(2 x)2x2, 4(2 x)x3, and x4 values, which is experimentally confirmed. The intensity ratios of each pair of adjacent bands in each sample, corrected for statistical multiplicities, are near to the (2 x)/x values. This behavior indicates that the Zr/In distribution is nearly random and rules out the existence of nanoregions with different metal stoichiometries. Sample compositions deduced from the NMR intensities agree with the nominal values. Hence, it can be concluded that the samples have the expected compositions and are chemically homogeneous.

In a previous work,14 it was shown that the unit cell a and c parameters of Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 increase in the sequence Ti < Sn < Hf < Zr, in agreement with the ionic radii of M4+.20 For the present materials, the unit cell volume expands slightly with substitution of smaller Zr4+ by larger In3+ and the concomitant increase of Na+ content. However, the unit cell changes shape since a increases and c decreases with x (Table 1). These results are in agreement with previous observations.7 The present structural study allows us to explain these changes with x at an atomic level.

On the basis of the structural data obtained by the Rietveld refinements, the anisotropic expansion can be rationalized as follows. The decrease in c with x correlates with a decrease in intralantern P-O(1)-M angles, from 156.9° for In0 to 150.1° for In1.8, leading to a compression of the lanterns in the c direction. Interlantern P-O(2)-M angles do not change appreciably (Table 3). Consequently, the M 226) 226) 226)M intralantern distance decreases strongly, although the M 226) 226) 226)M interlantern distance (also along the c-axis) increases slightly (Figure 11). The evolution of the 31P MAS NMR bands along the series can be rationalized on the basis of these structural changes. The shifts in the 31P peak positions for each set of bands [P(OZr)4-n(OIn)n] have been
XRPD refinements are not stable for Na displaced from the M1 site center. However, the room temperature combined NPD and XRPD refinements showed positional disorder at the M1 site and few if any cation vacancies (<2%). The evolution of the thermally induced disorder of Na at M1 sites was analyzed indirectly by T-NPD by checking the Uiso of Na1 at (000) as a function of temperature. Thermal disorder starts approximately above 250 K for In0.8 and above 275 K for In1.6 (Figure 3). The temperature dependence of this activation is sharp for In1.6 and smoother and larger for the In0.8 sample. Uiso thermal variation of Na at M2, for both samples, is by comparison much smaller. With the limited 2ı range of the NPD data and the anomalously very high Uiso values for Na at M1 above 400 K, it is not possible to confirm full occupancy of M1 at T g 400 K. So, either more extensive Na(1) spatial disorder or vacancy creation or both may occur at T g 400 K. The activation of Na at the M1 site has important implications for both 23Na MAS NMR and impedance studies. The 23Na MAS NMR study gives information about the structural sites occupied by Na and about the changes in Na mobilities as a function of temperature and composition. For In0.2 and In0.4, two signals are needed to explain the patterns recorded at room temperature. The signal at -13 ppm with Ł ) 0 (axial symmetry) is assigned to Na at the center of M1 site, but the second signal at -17 ppm with Ł ) 0.8 must be ascribed to structural sites of lower symmetry. For x g


Some insights into the similarities and differences between the bulk and thick grain boundary regions are obtained from a comparison of the frequency of the maximun of M¢ ¢ , fmax, versus 1/T (Arrhenius plots). Three samples, representative of the behavior of the series, are shown in Figure 12. Due to the frequency limitations of the impedance equipment, M¢ fmax data were obtained over only a limited range of lower temperatures, whereas much more extensive data sets were obtained for Z¢ fmax data occur at 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than corresponding Z¢ fmax data but are essentially parallel for the temperatures over which both M¢ ¢ data were obtained. The ¢ and Z¢ parallel behavior of the M¢ ¢ plots at lower temper¢ , Z¢ atures shows that the conduction mechanism and the

responsible for decreasing the activation energy. The onset of the new regime slightly depends on the Na content as it occurs at lower temperatures as x increases. The existence of two regimes with different sodium mobilities agrees with the NMR results. The Na M1 sublattice “melting” decreases the activation energy as the relative destabilization of that site is essential for ionic conductivity. Charge carriers have to jump through the M1 site in order to migrate.

Na1+xZr2-xInx(PO4)3 0.0 e x e 1.8 materials are single phase solid solutions and the analysis of the 31P MAS NMR peak intensities showed that homogeneous samples free of segregated nanoregions were synthesized. The structure responds to the incorporation of Na on the M2 site by moving the O(1) atoms toward those sites, reflecting the flexibility of the MO6 octahedra. Lowtemperature 23Na MAS NMR spectra show low sodium mobilities, allowing the assignment of the two detected signals to Na cations at the M1 and M2 sites. At room temperatures, Na mobility increases with Na content; for x e 0.4, the Na cations are rather localized, but for x g 0.8 compositions, important mobility gave a single line with averaged characteristics. The Arrhenius plots for the overall conductivites did not show a systematic trend but the plots of the M¢ fmax data showed a clear increase of bulk conductivities with x. T-NPD showed spatial disorder of Na at the M1 site above  24)250 K. The low-temperature activation energies change very little with x, in agreement with negligible variation of the bottleneck size. So, the observed increase of conductivity with x is due to an increase in charge carrier (Na+) concentration. The observed curvature in the Z¢ fmax Arrhenius plots, likely related to the strong thermal disorder of Na at the M1 site, indicates the existence of two regimes with different sodium motion (localized at lower temperatures and extended at higher temperatures) in the series.
