Water-stable and high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes have potential application as the electrolyte of solid state batteries and the separator of high energy density aqueous lithium batteries. The lithium-ion conductivity of the water-stable NASICON-type solid electrolyte of Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP) was enhanced by addition of TiO2 and Al2O3. The highest conductivity of 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3, which is approximately 1.5 times higher than that of LAGTP. The conductivity enhancement could be explained by a reduction of the grain boundary resistance. The three-point bending strength was also increased by addition of Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2. The LAGTP-10 wt% TiO2 composite showed a bending strength of 209 N mm−2, which was 3 times higher than that of LAGTP, and the conductivity was comparable to that of LAGTP.

Recently, more high lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolytes such as glass ceramics of 70Li2S-30P2S5 [1], Li10GeP2S12 [2], and Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 [3] have been reported, the conductivities of which were more than 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature. High lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes have potential applications for all-solid-state batteries with high specify power densities that satisfy safety requirements [[4], [5], [6]]. A high power density battery with a high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of Li10GeP2S12 has been reported [7]. However, the sulfide based solid electrolytes are extremely hydroscopic and react with water in the atmosphere to produce hydrogen sulfide, so that handling of these electrolytes in the atmosphere is difficult.

The NASICON-type lithium-ion solid electrolytes are relatively stable in the atmosphere, so that they can be handled in the open air, which is quite attractive for large-scale battery preparation with low cost. The NASICON-type lithium-ion solid electrolyte of substituted LiTi2(PO4)3 was firstly reported by Aono et al. in 1989 and 1990; the highest conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was reported for Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (M = Al or Sc) [8,9]. After that, many researchers examined the conductivity and lithium-ion diffusion mechanism for the NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes. Imanishi and co-workers examined the stability of the Li1+x−yAlx(Ge,Ti)2−xTi2−x−ySiyP3−yO12 (LATP) glass ceramic from Ohara Ltd, Japan in aqueous solution and reported that it was stable in aqueous solutions with a high content of Li-ions [[10], [11], [12]]. LATP has potential application as a separator for aqueous lithium-air batteries because of its stability in aqueous solution [13]. Recently, Morita et al. proposed a high energy density lithium battery with an aqueous solution of MCl2 (M = Co, Ni) using a NASICON-type solid lithium-ion conductor as a separator [14]. Excellent mechanical properties, such as bending strength and toughness, and high lithium-ion conductivity are required for these applications. The lithium-ion conductivity of the Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 solid solution (LATP) was improved by the partial substitution of Ge4+ for Ti4+. The highest total lithium-ion conductivity (bulk and grain boundary conductivity) of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 (LAGTP) [15], which was stable in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl. The bulk and grain boundary lithium-ion conductivities of LAGTP were 2.35 × 10−3 and 2.87 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. Breuer et al. [16] estimated the bulk lithium-ion conductivity of Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 to be 3.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C from low temperature conductivity data. These results suggest that a reduction of the grain boundary resistance in NASICON-type compounds could increase the total lithium-ion conductivity. Imanishi and co-workers have reported that the grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was significantly reduced by the addition of TiO2 [17]. In this study, we have examined the effect of Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 addition to LAGTP on the lithium-ion conductivity and mechanical properties.

The NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte LAGTP was prepared by the sol-gel method using citric acid, as reported previously [15]. Stoichiometric amounts of Ge(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich) and Ti(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich) were dissolved in ethylene glycol, added to a 0.2 M aqueous solution of citric acid, and then stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain a homogenous solution. After preparation of the gel was completed, stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and NH4H2PO4 (Nakalai Tesque) were added to the gel solution. The molar ratio of citric acid to Li+ + Al3+ + Ge4+ + Ti4+ was 4:1. After a homogeneous solution was formed, the gel was kept at 220 °C for several hours to allow evaporation of the water and to promote esterification and polymerization. The gel was then heated at 580 °C for 4 h to complete the chemical decomposition of nitrate and titanium and germanium ethoxides. The black product with residual carbon was ground to a uniformly fine powder with an agate mortar and pestle to increase the surface area of the sample before heating at 800 °C for 4 h to complete the chemical reaction. The LAGTP powders, with addition of 0–10 wt% of fine powders of TiO2 (High purity chemicals, Japan, average particle size 2 μm), Al2O2 (Alfa Aesar, UK, average particle size 3 μm), or ZrO2 (Tosoh, Japan, TZ-0, average particle size 2 μm) were then ground by wet milling with isopropanol using a planetary mill (Fritsch, Model 7) for 6 h to produce fine powder mixtures. The fine powder was isostatically pressed (150 MPa) into a pellet (ca. 12 mm diameter and ca. 1.5 mm thick) and then sintered at various temperatures for 7 h on a gold sheet to prevent reaction of the sample with the alumina refractory board.

The phase of the synthesized samples was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Rigaku RINT 2500 and Bruker D8) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a scanning step range of 0.02° s−1. The microstructure and morphology of the sintered samples were observed using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX; Hitachi S-4000). The three-point bending strength of the sintered samples was measured at room temperature using a materials tester (Shimadzu EZ-SX500 N). The highest bending strength for three samples was compared as a function of the metal oxide content in LAGTP.

The electrical conductivity of the sintered samples with sputtered gold electrodes was measured in air using a frequency analyzer (Solartron 1200) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The impedance profiles were analyzed to estimate the bulk and grain boundary conductivity using a non-linear instant fit program in the Zview program package (Scribner Associates Inc.).

Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns of LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 950 °C. The LAGTP-xTiO2 samples sintered at 900 °C showed similar XRD patterns. The main diffraction lines were indexed according to the NASICON-type structure [8]. The diffraction lines due to GeO2 were observed for LAGTP with ≥3 wt% TiO2, and those due to AlPO4 and LiTiOPO4 for LAGTP with ≥7.5 wt% TiO2. The contents of these impurity phases and crystal size in LAGTP-xTiO2 estimated by the Rietveld refinement are shown in Table 1. The contents of these impurity phases were increased with x in LAGTP-xTiO2. The changes in the lattice parameters with x in the LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C are shown in Fig. 1(b), where the lattice parameters were measured using silicon internal standard. The a and c lattice constants for the samples sintered at 900 and 950 °C increased with x until 5 wt% (20 mol%) and then remained constant. The increase could be explained by the substitution of the larger ionic radius of Ti4+ (0.745 Å) for smaller ionic radius Ge4+ (0.670 Å) and/orAl3+ (0.675 Å). The atom distribution analysis by using SEM with EDX showed the isolated GeO2 particles. The formation of GeO2 suggests the substitution of Ti4+ for Ge4+.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the surface of LAGTP-xTiO2, The grain sizes of LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 900 °C were in a range of 0.3–1.7 μm (average 0.7 μm) for x = 0, 0.4–1.5 μm (average 0.9 μm) for x = 3 wt% and 0.2–1.9 μm (average 0.54 μm) for x = 10 wt%, respectively. Those for LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 950 °C were in a range of 0.5–1.3 μm (average 0.8 μm) for x = 0, 0.4–2.3 μm (average 1.1 μm) for x = 3 wt%, and 0.2–1.4 μm (average 0.6) for x = 10 wt%, respectively. The crystal sizes of LAGTP estimated from XRD patterns are summarized in Table 1. LATP is considered to form microcracks by large stresses caused by anisotropy in thermal expansion [21]. However, no clear microcracks were observed. As shown in Fig. 2, a large crack was observed for LAGTP sintered at 950 °C, similar to that observed for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 sintered at 1050 °C [20]. No severe cracks were observed for LAGTP sintered at 900 °C, nor for LAGTP-3 wt% or 10 wt% TiO2 sintered at 950 and 900 °C.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) shows impedance profiles of LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C as a function of x, respectively. These impedance profiles have a semicircle that is attributed to the grain boundary resistance [18]. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance, and the diameter of the semicircle indicates the grain boundary resistance. Fig. 3(c) and (d) shows the total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities as a function of x in LAGTP-xTiO2 for the samples sintered at 900 and 950 °C, respectively. The grain boundary conductivity of the samples sintered at 900 °C, which was calculated from the grain boundary resistance and the dimension of the sample, showed a maximum at x = 1 wt% and then was decreased with an increase of x. The bulk conductivities were decreased slightly with x. The decrease in the grain boundary conductivity (high grain boundary resistance) with x ≥ 1 could be explained by highly resistive grain boundary phases of AlPO4, LiTiOPO4 and GeO2, as shown in Table 1. On the other hand, LAGTP without TiO2 and with 1 wt% TiO2 sintered at 950 °C showed low total conductivities of 5.2 × 10−6 and 1.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. These low conductivities are due to the high grain boundary resistance, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The bulk conductivity was increased up to 3 wt% and then decreased with an increase in x. The low bulk conductivity of 0.39 × 10−3 for LAGTP may be due to the estimation of the bulk resistance from the impedance profiles shown in Fig. 3(b), where the bulk and grain boundary impedances were connected in series. The estimation of the bulk conductivity could be influence by a parallel bulk conduction path for the electrolyte with the extremely high grain boundary resistance [19]. The total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities vs. x curves for LAGTP-xTiO2 show maximum conductivities of 1.26 × 10−3, 1.99 × 10−3 and 3.52 × 10−3 S cm−1 at x = 3 and 25 °C, respectively. The bulk conductivity of LAGTP-3 wt% TiO2 is comparable with that of LAGTP sintered at 900 °C. The decrease of the total conductivity for the samples with 5 wt% TiO2 or more could be explained by impurity phases of AlPO4, LiTiOPO4 and GeO2 at the grain boundaries, as shown in Table 1. The large grain boundary resistance of LAGTP and LAGTP-1 wt% TiO2 sintered at 950 °C may be due to residues from incongruent melting of LAGTP at the grain boundary. Differential thermal analysis suggested incongruent melting at around 950 °C for LAGTP. Residues due to the incongruent melting of LAGTP sintered at 950 °C may be amorphous and deposited at the grain boundaries of LAGTP. However, highly resistive grain boundary impurity phases may be not produced for LAGTP-xTiO2 with x ≥ 3, because Ge4+ was substituted for Ti4+. Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 sintered at 950 °C showed no low grain boundary conductivity and a total conductivity of 4.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

The toughness of the lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte is an important requirement for practical applications such as batteries for electric vehicles (EV). Fig. 4 shows the dependence of (a) the relative density and (b) the three-point bending strength on the TiO2 content for LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C for 7 h. The relative densities were estimated from the ratio of the measured density using the volume and mass of the sample, and the densities calculated using the lattice constants, where the contribution of impurity phases was disregarded. The relative density of 94.0% for LAGTP sintered at 900 °C decreased with an increase in x and those sintered at 950 °C showed a maximum density of 94.2% at x = 0.3. The three-point bending strength of LAGTP sintered at 900 °C was 57 N mm−2. The bending strength of the LAGTP-xTiO2 composite sintered at 900 °C was increased slightly with the TiO2 content up to x = 5 and then decreased with further addition of TiO2. The bending strength of LAGTP sintered at 950 °C was extremely low at 0.89 N mm−2 and increased linearly with x. The low bending strength of LAGTP sintered at 950 °C may be due to the cracks as shown in Fig. 3, because the relative density of LAGTP was as high as 90%. The bending strength of LAGTP-10 wt% TiO2 was as high as 209 N mm−2, which is higher than that of 140 N mm−2 for the commercialized glass ceramics based on the NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte and comparable with 140–240 N mm−2 for beta-alumina [22], although lower than that of 300 N mm−2 for pure alumina [23]. The bending strength of the sintered ceramic body generally increases with the relative density by sintering; however, in the case of LAGTP-xTiO2, there is no linear relation between the bending strength and relative density, which suggests that the grain boundary phases play an important role in the bending strength of the sintered samples.

The addition of TiO2 into LAGTP significantly improved the three-point bending strength and the lithium-ion conductivity was enhanced slightly. The effect of Al2O3 addition to LAGTP on the lithium-ion conductivity and three-point bending strength were examined. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows XRD patterns of LAGTP-xAl2O3 (x = 0–10 wt%) sintered at 950 °C for 7 h and lattice parameter change with x of those sintered at 900 and 950 °C, respectively. The XRD patterns of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 900 °C were almost same as those for LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 950 °C. The XRD patterns of LAGTP with ≥3 wt% Al2O3 showed impurity phase of GeO2 and those of LAGTP with ≥5 wt% such as LiTiOPO4, AlPO4 and GeO2. The contents of these impurity phases in LAGTP-xAl2O3 estimated by Rietveld refinement are shown in Table 2. The contents of LiTiOPO4 and AlPO4 were increased lineally with increasing x. The a and c lattice constants were increased with x until 3 wt%. The lattice constant may be reduced by substitution of Al3+ for Ti4+, and may remain constant by substitution of Al3+ for Ge4+ because the ionic radii of Al3+ (0.675 Å) is lower than that of Ti4+ (0.745 Å) and comparable with that of Ge4+ (0.67 Å). Aono et al. observed that the a and c parameters were decreased for Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 with an increase in x, where the samples were sintered at 980–1000 °C [9]. Xuefu et al. [24] instead reported that the a parameter was increased and that the c parameter was decreased with an increase in x in Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8−x(PO4)3. Cretin and Fabry [25] reported that the a parameter decreases and the c parameter increases with x in Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3. Several factors play a role in determining the effect of cation substitution on the structure [26]. Additional Li+ ions are located in the unoccupied Li+ sites by the substitution of Al3+ for Ti4+ or Ge4+ sites, as observed in Na1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 [27], to maintain charge neutrality. The additional lithium ions in these sites lead to repulsion. The molecular form of LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3 is Li1.634Al0.634(Ti,Ge)1.366(PO4)3, assuming Al3+ is substituted for Ti4+ and/or Ge4+. However, the previous results suggest that the solubility limits of Al3+ in LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiGe0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 [9,23] are around 0.4. This result suggests that more Al3+ may substitute for Ti4+ by this method.

Fig. 6 shows SEM images of the surface of LAGTP-xAl2O3. The grain sizes of LAGTP-3 wt% and 10 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 900 °C were in the range of 0.4–1.7 μm (average 0.8 μm) and 0.4–1.0 μm (average 0.6 μm), respectively, Those of LAGTP-3 wt% and 10 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 950 °C were in the range of 0.4–2.2 μm (average 1.0 μm) and 0.4–1.5 μm (average 0.9 μm), respectively which are comparable to those of LAGTP-xTiO2. No severe cracks were observed for LAGTP-3 wt% and 10 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 950 and 900 °C. Fig. 7 shows impedance profiles, and the total, bulk and grain boundary conductivities at 25 °C of LAGTP-xAl2O4 (x = 0–10 wt%) sintered at 900 and 950 °C for 7 h as a function of x. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 900 °C were almost constant up to x = 3 and then decreased with an increase in x. The decrease of bulk conductivity may be due to the compositional change of LAGTP by further formation of impurity phases, as shown in Table 2. As observed for LAGTP-xTiO2 sintered at 950 °C, LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 950 °C showed low grain boundary conductivity at x = 0 and 1 and the highest grain boundary conductivity of 6.65 × 10−3 S cm−1 was observed at x = 3. The bulk conductivity of 0.39 × 10−3 S cm−1 for LAGTP was increased to 1.99 × 10−3 S cm−1 for LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3, which is comparable to those for LAGTP sintered at 900 °C and LAGTP-3 wt% TiO2 sintered at 950 °C. The highest total conductivity of 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 950 °C, which is around 2 times higher than that for previously reported lithium-ion conducting oxide solid electrolytes [5,8,20] and 1.5 times higher than that for LAGTP sintered at 900 °C. The high total conductivity of LAGTP-3 wt% sintered at 950 °C is due to the contribution of high grain boundary conductivity.

Fig. 8 shows the relative density and three-point bending strength of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 900 and 950 °C as a function of x. The relative density of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 900 °C decreased linearly with an increase in x, while that of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 950 °C was increased up to x = 3 and then decreased. The highest relative density was 94% for LAGTP sintered at 900 °C and LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 950 °C. The three-point bending strengths of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 900 °C were almost constant with x, while those of LAGTP-xAl2O3 sintered at 950 °C were increased with x. The highest three-point bending strength of 72 N mm−2 was observed for LAGTP-10 wt% Al2O3.

The effect of ZrO2 addition on the lithium-ion conductivity and mechanical properties of LAGTP was also examined. Fig. 9 shows XRD patterns for LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 950 °C for 7 h. The XRD patterns for LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 °C were almost the same as those sintered at 950 °C. A diffraction peak of GeO2 was observed for the sample with 3 wt% ZrO2 or more. LAGTP with a high content of ZrO2 showed diffraction peaks due to impurity phases such as LiTiOPO4. AlPO4 and Zr2O(PO4)2. The contents of these impurity phases in LAGTP-xZrO2 are shown in Table 3. The lattice constant changes with x in LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C are shown in Fig. 9(b). The a lattice constant of LAGTP sintered at 900 °C was increased slightly with x, while, the a and c lattice constants of LAGTP sintered at 950 °C were increased significantly with x. The increase of the lattice constants is attributed to the substitution of large ionic radii Zr4+ (0.86 Å) for Al3+, Ti4+ and Ge4+ in LAGTP.

Fig. 10 shows SEM images of the surface of LAGTP-xZrO2. The grain sizes of LAGTP-3 wt% ZrO2 and LAGTP-10 wt% ZrO2 sintered at 900 °C were in the range of 0.2–0.7 μm (average 0.4 μm) and 0.2–1.4 μm (average 0.4 μm), respectively. Those of LAGTP-3 wt% ZrO2 and LAGTP-10 wt% ZrO2 sintered at 950 °C were 0.2–1.2 μm (average 0.6 μm) and 0.2–1.2 μm (average 0.6 μm), respectively, which are slightly lower than those of LAGTP-TiO2 and LAGTP-Al2O3. Fig. 11 shows impedance profiles and the total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities of LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 °C were significantly decreased with an increase in x. The decrease in the bulk conductivity may be explained by the substitution of Al3+ and/or Ge4+ for Zr4+, as observed in the change of the lattice constants. The decrease of the grain boundary conductivity with the increase of x may be due to the increase of deposition of ZrP2O7, LiTiOPO4, Zr2O(PO4)2 and GeO2 at the grain boundaries. LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 950 °C showed a low bulk conductivity at x = 0 and 1 as observed for LAGTP-xTiO2. The decrease of the bulk conductivity with an increase in x at more than 3 could be explained by the substitution of Zr4+ for Al3+ and/or Ge4+. The grain boundary conductivity showed a maximum at x = 5. The highest total conductivity of 1.09 × 10−3 S cm−1 for LAGTP-3 wt% ZrO2 was comparable with LAGTP sintered at 900 °C.

Fig. 12 shows the relative density and three-point bending strength of LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 and 950 °C for 7 h. The relative density of LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 900 °C decreased significantly with an increase in x, while the bending strength was in the range of 60 to 90 N mm−2 and showed no systematic change with x. LAGTP-xZrO2 sintered at 950 °C showed a relative density of around 90% and no significant change with x. LAGTP-xZrO2 with x = 0 and 1 sintered at 950 °C showed extremely low bending strength, as observed for both LAGTP-xTiO2 and LAGTP-xAl2O3. The bending strength with more than 3 wt% ZrO2 was around 70 N mm−2. Therefore, the three-point bending strength of LAGTP was not improved by the addition of ZrO2.

The addition of metal oxides such as TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 was examined to improve the lithium-ion conductivity and mechanical properties of the water-stable NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of LAGTP. The bending strength was increased to 209 N mm−2 by the addition of 10 wt% TiO2 to LAGTP, where the lithium-ion conductivity was 0.87 × 10−3 S cm at 25 °C, which is comparable to that of LAGTP. The bending strength of 209 N mm−2 is higher than that of the commercially-available NASICON type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte from Ohara Inc. Japan (140 N mm−2), and is comparable with that of β-Al2O3 (140–240 N mm−2), which is used as the separator for high temperature Na/S batteries [28].

Lithium-ion conductivity of 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 was observed in LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3, where the three-point bending strength was 60 N mm−2. The water-stable lithium-ion conducting solid composite electrolyte of LAGTP-10 wt% TiO2 is the best candidate for the separator in aqueous lithium-air batteries due to its high lithium-ion conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. The high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of LAGTP-3 wt% Al2O3 is thus attractive for application as an electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries.
