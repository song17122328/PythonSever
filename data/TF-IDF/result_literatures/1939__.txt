Four manganese and iron phosphates with alluaudite or ﬁllowite structures have been prepared by solid state reactions: Na2FeMn2(PO4)3, LiNaFeMn2(PO4)3, NaFe3(PO4)3, and Na2Mn3(PO4)3. LixNa2 xFeMn2(PO4)3 with x close to 2 was prepared from Na2FeMn2(PO4)3 by molten salt ion exchange. These materials are similar in stoichiometry to the phospho-olivines LiFe(Mn)PO4, but have a more complex structure that can accommodate mixed transition metal oxidation states. They are of interest as candidates for lithium battery cathodes because of their expected higher electronic conductivity, high intercalant ion mobility, and ease of preparation. Their performance as intercalation electrodes in non-aqueous lithium cells was, however, poor. 
The lithium battery positive electrode couple LiFePO4/ FePO4 has a theoretical capacity of 170 mA h/g with a ﬂat discharge proﬁle at 3.4 V versus Li [1]. Despite its poor electronic conductivity, high utilization has been reported for carbon-coated electrodes at moderate discharge rates [2,3]. The strongly-bonded PO4 units enhance the thermal [4] and electrochemical [5] stability of (Li)FePO4 toward oxygen loss and structural rearrangement. Because it is a two-phase system requiring movement of the phase boundary during charge/discharge [6], high rate cycling yields poor utilization. In addition, the synthesis of LiFePO4 must be carried out under low oxygen partial pressure, and the best electrode materials are obtained with long processing times [7,8]. The goal of the present work was to ﬁnd improved cathode materials containing the inexpensive and low-toxicity metals iron or manganese. 
High electronic conductivity and ionic mobility, inherent stability, ease of preparation, and the ability to accommodate mixed transition metal oxidation states within a given phase were important criteria.
Li0.75Na0.25MnFe2(PO4)3, Na2FeMn2(PO4)3, LiNaFeMn2(PO4)3, NaFe3(PO4)3, and Na2Mn3(PO4)3 were prepared by heating stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3, Na2C2O4, MnCO3, FePO44H2O, and NH4H2PO4 in air at 950 8C in a Pt crucible for 16 h, then quenching in air. LiFePO4 and LiMnPO4 were prepared by heating precursor mixtures in ﬂowing dry N2 at 750 8C for 48 h. LixNa2 xFeMn2(PO4)3 was prepared by ion exchange from Na2FeMn2(PO4)3 in a 10LiNO3/KNO3 melt at 245 8C. The products were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and by transmission mode Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in KBr pellets. Structures were reﬁned by whole pattern ﬁtting of XRD patterns using the program RIQAS (Materials Data, Inc.). Electrodes were prepared by mixing the powders with acetylene black (10 w/o) and polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (5 w/o) in n-methylpyrrolidinone and casting the slurry onto stainless steel current collectors. 
Swagelok-type cells were assembled from 1.6 cm2 working electrodes, lithium counter electrodes, Celgard 3401 separators, and 1 M LiPF6/EC:DMC.
Element ratios and synthesis conditions are given in Table 1 along with results of XRD and FTIR characterization. Single-phase alluaudites were obtained for the compositions Na2FeMn2(PO4)3 (Figs. 1 and 2), and ion-exchanged LixNa2 xFeMn2(PO4)3 (Fig. 3). In Na2FeMn2(PO4)3, sodium ions occupy two sites in the tunnels, surrounded by eight oxide ions at mean distances of 2.52 and 2.67 A˚ , respectively. Exchange of lithium for sodium was complete in the smaller site, with four short Li–O bond lengths of 2.27 and 2.29 A˚ , while almost half the sodium remained in the larger site.
The volumes of the alluaudite phases studied here are close to those of the olivine Li(Fe, Mn)PO4 compounds of similar composition (the volume per transition metal atom in Li0.75Na0.25MnFe2(PO4)3 is 72.2 A˚ 3, that of LiMn0.33Fe0.67PO4 is 73.7 A˚ 3 [18]). Although their theoretical capacities are therefore around 170 mA h/g, the experimental capacities for lithium intercalation and de-intercalation in these materials were surprisingly small (Fig. 5). While reproducible plateaus appear during discharging, the corresponding features during charging are less distinct and there is signiﬁcant hysteresis. No major changes in the voltage proﬁles took place during cycling. The possibility of improving their performance through particle size reduction and carbon coating is being investigated.
Although these easily-prepared iron and manganese alluaudite and ﬁllowite phosphates have electronic and structural properties that make them attractive cathode materials for lithium batteries, their reversible capacities appear to be very limited.
