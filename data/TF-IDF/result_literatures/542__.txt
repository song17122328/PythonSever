The solid state electrolytes based on NASICON structure are widely researched for high-energy solid-state lithium batteries due to its non-flammability, high conductivity, wide electrochemical window and easy process ability. In this paper, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (x = 0.3 and y = 0.4) ceramic electrolyte has been successfully synthesized by the solution-based method at calcining temperature as low as 650 °C. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The effect of preparation conditions on the morphology, crystallinity and ionic conductivity of Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 have been studied in detail. The results showed that the Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 powders have rhombohedral NASICON-type structure, and the Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 pellet sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h exhibits the highest total lithium-ion conductivity (1.33 × 10−3 S cm-1 at room temperature) and the lowest activate energy (0.25 eV). Therefore, the solution-based method will be a significant route for the industrialization preparation of Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12.

All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are a highly promising energy storage device owing to their advantages over traditional organic liquid electrolyte based batteries in terms of energy density, stability, and safety [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. It is well known that safety issues of LIBs resulting from combustion of liquid electrolytes are currently restricting their further application and development [[6], [7], [8]]. However, the non-flammable ceramic electrolytes can provide potential solutions to the major problems encountered in traditional LIBs with liquid electrolytes, such as poor safety, limited voltage, unstable solid-electrolyte interphase formation and poor cycling performance [[9], [10], [11]]. Accordingly, enormous efforts have currently been absorbed in the development of highly reliable inorganic lithium-ion conductors with various crystal structures, such as Li3N [12,13], sulfide-based glasses [[14], [15], [16]], garnet-type doped Li7La3ZrO12 [17,18], perovskite-type Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3 [19,20] and NASICON-type LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Ge, Hf, Zr, Sn) [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]], etc. Among the above mentioned solid-state electrolytes, NASICON-type electrolyte has shown great promise for meeting the much-needed safety and reliability requirements of current commercial LIBs [11,26]. LiTi2(PO4)3 and its derivatives, a classical NASICON type superionic conductor, has attracted a lot of interests because of its high ionic conductivity [[27], [28], [29]] and water stability at room temperature. The crystal structure of LiTi2(PO4)3, based on the NASCION rhombohedral structure (space group of , see Fig. 1), is composed of alternating and corner-sharing [PO4] tetrahedra and [TiO6] octahedra. The structure provides two sites for conduction of lithium-ions, including labeled M1 (6-fold coordinated and located between two TiO6 units) and M2 (8-fold coordinated and lied between two columns of TiO6 units) [23]. Usually, the only M1 sites for pure LiTi2(PO4)3 were fully occupied by lithium-ions due to its lower potential compared with M2 sites.

Although the LiTi2(PO4)3 electrolyte has various advantages such as high safety and stability, it cannot meet the application requirements due to the fact that the actual ionic conductivity is still low. Large efforts have been devoted to improve the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 solid state electrolyte. The introduction of Li salts, such as LiF, LiNO3, Li2O, can effectively enhance the structural integrity as well as density of LiTi2(PO4)3 electrolytes, and thus increase the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 [30,31]. For instance, Xiong et al. utilized LiF as a microstructural modifier to effectively promote the densification of the LiTi2(PO4)3 electrolyte and reduce the grain boundary resistance, thus the electrolyte possesses the high room temperature ionic conductivity of 2.318 × 10−4 S cm−1 [31]. It has been reported that the partial substitution of Ti4+ or P5+ sites in LiTi2(PO4)3 crystal with other cations (e.g., Al3+, In3+, Y3+, Ga3+, La3+, Sc3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+ for tetravalent Ti4+, as well as Si4+, V5+ and Nb5+ for P5+) are very effective to enhance the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 [28]. The lithium aluminum titanium phosphate Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 obtained by a modified citric-acid-assisted sol-gel method exhibits the room temperature ionic conductivity of 5.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 as well as the relative density of 97.0%. The as-prepared LATP was used to composite with a spinel LiMn2O4 cathode and then used in lithium-ion batteries, and the capacity retentions was 96.0% after 100 cycles at 25 °C [32]. Especially the Al and Si co-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 variant (LATSP) possesses the excellent conductivity [33], because such works can not only change bottleneck sizes for lithium-ion migration in the bulk, but also increase the mobile lithium-ion concentration [34].

The formula of LATSP is usually described as Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (x = 0.1/0.3 and y = 0.2/0.4). Based on LiTi2(PO4)3, Ti4+ sites and P5+ sites in LATSP crystal are partly substituted by Si4+ and Al3+, respectively. Doping of Al and Si benefits the movement of lithium-ions among sites because of these sites incorporating greater concentrations of lithium-ions in solid phase. Moreover, the doping nonmetal silicon can improve physical-chemical properties of glass and melt such as thermal stability and fluidity [33]. Among these works, the new solid electrolyte material Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 (LATSP) synthesized by Yi [35] et al. showed high relative density (93–94%) and high ionic conductivity (2–3 × 10−3 S cm−1), which manifested that introducing nonmetal silicon could greatly improve the lithium-ion conductivity. Although LATSP exhibits above obvious advantages, one of the facing challenges as solid state electrolyte in practical applications is the difficulty in mass production.

At present, although the preparation technologies of NASICON-type ceramic electrolytes have been reported, such as solid state reaction [36,37], co-precipitation [38], sol-gel [39], hydrothermally synthesis [40], melt-quenching [41] and spray-drying [42]. The rhombus-like Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 powder was successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal assisted solid-state reaction, which possesses the room-temperature conductivity of 4.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 and the relative density of 97.3% [43]. In addition, Hallopeau et al. synthesized LATP ceramics electrolytes by microwave-assisted reactive, yielding the room-temperature conductivity of 3.15 × 10−4 S cm−1 and the relative density of 88% [44]. However, the synthetic method of the LATSP is relatively few except liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) [35] and melt-quenching methods [33]. It is well known that the above two methods are rarely applied to the mass production of LATSP due to high energy consumption, complicated process and undesirable impurity in the production. Consequently, it is of great significance to seek a low-cost method for the facile preparation of LATSP electrolytes. The solution-based method possesses obvious advantages, including simple procedure, low energy consumption, high composition purity and density as well as improving physical and chemical properties of electrolyte [45,46]. To the best of our knowledge, there were no reports employing the solution method to prepare the LATSP powders. In this work, the facile and cost-effective solution-based method was used for preparing the NASCION type Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 solid electrolyte. In addition, the conductivities of different Al/Si doping amounts samples are summarized in Table S1. The effects of the preparation conditions on the crystal structure and electrochemical performances of the obtained LATSP ceramic electrolyte are studied in detail, such as calcination temperature and sintering temperature.

The solution-based method was used for preparing the NASICON type Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 solid electrolyte. Stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3 (99%, Alfa Aesar), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Alfa Aesar), NH4OH (29.2% solution, Aldrich), tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, Aldrich), ethanedioic acid (99.9%, Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Merck) were used. A schematic of the synthesis process is shown in Fig. 2 to signify the preparation process for LATSP electrolyte pellets. The procedures of the solution-based method are described as follows: firstly, NH4OH (29.2% solution, Aldrich) was added into titanium (IV) isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) placed in a beaker, producing a white gel-like precipitate. The fresh precipitate was repeatedly washed with deionized water to remove the unreacted base and then placed in a glass breaker contained distilled water. The 1 mol L−1 ethanedioic acid (99.9%, Aldrich) solution was added into above solution, and the white precipitate was dissolved to obtain the solution of H2[TiO(C2O4)2]. The stoichiometric Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Alfa Aesar), 99%, Alfa Aesar excess LiNO3 (99%, Alfa Aesar), tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Merck) were added into the aforementioned solution under magnet stirring for 8 h. The obtained material was then dried to remove the redundant water, which produced a white paste of well mixed precursors. The as-prepared powders were firstly calcined at temperatures ranging from 550 to 850 °C for 12 h, followed by the samples were pressed under 100 MPa to form green LATSP pellets with the diameter of 11 mm and the thickness of 1.0 mm. Finally, the pellets were sintered at 900–1200 °C for 6 h.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the LATSP samples were collected on a diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8, Bruker AXS GmbH), equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) and a graphite monochromator operated at 40 mA and 40 kV between 5° and 60° (2θ) at a scan rate of 5° min−1. A scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDXS) (JSM-6100LV, JEOL, Japan) was implemented to investigate the morphologies and elemental distribution of the resulting samples. The lithium-ion blocking electrodes were prepared by sputtering gold layer on both of the pellets for the electrochemical performance measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (VersaSTAT3, Princeton Applied Research, USA) with an AC voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.

After sintering, the LATSP electrolyte pellets were immediately stored in a vacuum drying oven at a temperature of 333 K to avoid moisture. For measurements of ionic conductivity, both sides of the solid electrolyte were sputtered with Au electrodes (ion-blocking electrode). The impedance measurements were carried out on above electrochemical workstation with the testing temperature varied from 298 to 378 K. Besides, any contamination with water or carbon dioxide was avoided as best as possible in the procedures.

The phase purity of the LATSP powders was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fig. 3 exhibits the XRD patterns of the LATSP powders calcined at various temperatures, and the lattice parameters for LATSP calcined at different temperatures are shown in Table S2. It can be found that all diffraction peaks for all the products are accord with the standard pattern of LiTi2(PO4)3 with the space group of , which indicated that LATSP powders with NASICON-structure were successfully prepared. At 550 °C, the first formation of a NASICON structure LATSP phase can be observed. And as the increase of calcination temperatures, the resulting powders are clearly more crystalline. The enlarged XRD pattern especially at 24° has been added in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the LATSP samples calcined at 650–750 °C have high purity and higher peak intensities than others. The results suggested that the LATSP with expected composition and high purity can be obtained at 650–750 °C, and the calcination temperature will play a crucial part in the overall sinterability of LATSP.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM images of LATSP powders calcined at 550–850 °C. As shown in Fig. 4, all LATSP specimens mainly consist of irregular shape particles with the average size of 100–200 nm, and to a certain extent the aggregating phenomenon is presented. Even so, the LATSP powders calcined at 650–750 °C exhibit still relatively regular and homogeneous morphology. The size of LATSP particle agglomeration increases slightly with the increase of the calcination temperature, while agglomeration may impede the transfer of lithium-ions and thus resulting in the decrease of the ionic conductivity.

The impedances of LATSP pellets calcined at 550–850 °C were measured to further determine the optimal calcining conditions. The Nyquist plots of the LATSP specimens calcined at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 5, and each plot consists of a semicircle at high-to-intermediate frequencies and a connected sloped straight line at low frequencies. The left intercept of the semicircle with the real axis (Z′) and the diameter of the semicircle indicate the bulk resistance (Rb) and the grain boundary resistance (Rgb), respectively. And the inclined spike is attributed to the blocking of Li+ at the Au electrodes [47,48]. The corresponding equivalent circuit model shown as insert in Fig. 5 was used to estimate the total resistance for the LATSP electrolyte (Rb + Rgb), in which Rb, Rgb and CPE signify grain resistance, grain boundary resistance and constant phase element, respectively. The total ionic conductivity () for LATSP electrolyte can be calculated using the following equation:(1)where l, Rt and S are corresponding to the thickness, total resistance, and effective area of LATSP electrolyte, respectively. It can be calculated based on the results of Fig. 5 that the ionic conductivities for LATSP pellet samples calcined at 550–850 °C are 1.44 × 10−4, 8.86 × 10−4, 8.22 × 10−4 and 3.76 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. Apparently, the LATSP sample calcined at 650 °C shows the highest ionic conductivity (8.86 × 10−4 S cm−1). Consequently, the optimized preheating treatment condition for obtaining stoichiometric and high purity LATSP powders is 650 °C.

The powders calcined at 650 °C were pressed into pellets and then sintered to the LATSP ceramic pellet. The influence of sintering temperature on the morphologies and electrochemical properties of LATSP ceramic samples were investigated. The XRD data of samples sintered at 900–1200 °C are shown in Fig. 6. It can be found that the LATSP ceramic sample sintered at 900 °C is mainly LiTi2(PO4)3 phase and no impurity phase is seen. The AlPO4 and TiO2 impurity phases begin to appear with the increase of sintering temperature, indicating that the loss of Li2O was more serious at higher temperature. Table 1 lists the calculated lattice parameters for LATSP samples sintered at different temperatures. As seen in Table 1, the lattice parameters of the LATSP pellets nearly remain unchanged, indicating no observable phase separation within the sintering temperature ranges. The values increased slightly compared to the standard data of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (a = 8.5 Å, c = 20.82 Å) [49]. The differences in ionic radii of Al3+ (0.535 Å), Ti4+ (0.605 Å), Si4+ (0.26 Å), and P5+ (0.17 Å) explain the changes in lattice parameters [50]. LATSP has larger lattice parameters compared to Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 due to the substitution of P5+ by larger ionic radius Si4+. Obviously, the sintering temperature in the ranges of 900–1200 °C has less influence on the lattice parameters, indicating the LATSP sample has good structural stability.

The EDS spectra of the powders obtained by grinding the LATSP electrolyte pellet is shown in Fig. 7a, which shows the presence of oxygen, titanium, aluminum, and phosphorus, and the mapping of Li is not provided as Li is below the instrument's range. In addition, no unexpected elements were observed, and the weight ratio of Al/Ti is close to the stoichiometric ratio, which confirms that LATSP powder had been produced and that no foreign elements were present. Fig. 7b–d are the images of oxygen, titanium, aluminum, silicon and phosphorus elements in the LATSP electrolyte, which shows the position of the five elements in the samples.

The microstructure of the LATSP pellets sintered at 900–1200 °C was examined using scanning electron microscopy. As being seen from Fig. 8, the morphologies of the LATSP pellets are closely related to the sintering temperatures. When the sample was sintered at 900 °C, it is not completely crystallized, and the sample seems to be amorphous. As shown in Fig. 8b–d, the grain size and the crystallinity of the sample increases with the increase of the sintering temperature, the grains become gradually distinct. Particularly, the grains can be clearly seen when sintering temperature is 1000 °C and 1100 °C. Unfortunately, the oversintering phenomenon appears when the sintering temperature reaches 1200 °C. At the same time, the particle size increases dramatically and the particles poorly connect to each other. Some pores and cracks can also be seen on the surface of LATSP, which may be due to the large stresses caused by the anisotropy of thermal expansion in LATSP [47,48]. Apparently, the morphology of the LATSP sample sintered at 1000–1100 °C turns out to be closely compact. Usually, the increase of the porosity and the decrease of the density or compactness are not beneficial to the diffusion of lithium-ions.

The electrochemical properties of the LATSP electrolytes sintered at different temperature were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Nyquist plots of the LATSP specimens sintered at the different temperatures are shown in Fig. 9, in addition, the calculated bulk and grain boundary conductivities are summarized in Table 2.

The lithium-ion conductivities of the LATSP electrolytes sintered at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen clearly that the room temperature conductivities increased firstly and then decreased as sintering temperature increased. Besides, it is noticeable that the LATSP electrolyte sintered at 1000 °C exhibits the highest total conductivity at room temperature, which was calculated as 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1. The highest conductivity value is about 4 times higher than that of the lowest one, indicating sintering temperature has great influence on the electrochemical property of the LATSP electrolyte. As shown in Table 2, the relative density for LATSP specimens sintered at 900–1200 °C are 89.27%, 94.32%, 93.65% and 93.11%, respectively. The highest ionic conductivity 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 of the LATSP sample sintered at 1000 °C, which corresponds to the highest relative density 94.32%. Table 4 compares the room-temperature conductivities of LATSP pellet of this work with the NASICON structured solid electrolytes in the references. As seen in Table 4, the room-temperature conductivity of LATSP pellet is comparable to other values.

Generally speaking, according to the temperature dependence of total conductivity, activation energy (Ea), can be calculated by the Arrhenius equation as following:(2)where A, k and T denote the pre-exponential factor, the Boltzmann's constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. The temperature dependence of the total conductivity for LATSP solid electrolyte sintered at various temperatures is displayed in Fig. 11. The logarithm of conductivities for all LATSP specimens is in line with the reciprocal of absolute temperatures. As tabulated in Table 3, the activation energy of the pellets sintered at different temperatures is between 0.25 and 0.29 eV, which characterized the energy barrier related to non-space-charge mediated transport of lithium-ions through the crystalline structure of the LATSP [48]. The variation tendency of the activation energy of LATSP samples firstly decrease and then increase, which is quite contrary to the ionic conductivities. The lowest Ea of 0.25 eV is obtained for LATSP sample sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h corresponding to highest ionic conductivities, which signify lithium-ions move more easily in the lattice and the grain boundaries of the sample in comparison to other LATSP samples.

The high ionic conductivity Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 ceramic electrolyte samples with rhombohedral NASICON-type structure were synthesized by the solution-based method and subsequent calcinations as well as sintering treatment. The study shows that the preparation conditions significantly affect the electrochemical properties of LATSP samples. Especially, sintering temperature has tremendous effect on the impurity phases as well as dense structure, and thus further affects the electrochemical properties. The highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 as well as activation energy of 0.25 eV was achieved for the ceramic sample calcined at 650 °C for 12 h and sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h. Apparently, the high ionic conductivity LATSP ceramic electrolyte obtained by solution-based method provides a new strategy for the preparation of solid state electrolyte for lithium-ion batteries.
