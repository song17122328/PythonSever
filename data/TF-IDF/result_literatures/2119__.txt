The phosphate Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 can be obtained at high temperature (1400°C). It crystallizes in the rhombohedral system (space group R3¯) with parameters ah 5 21.80(5) Å in the equivalent hexagonal cell. Its structure, determined by the Rietveld method, is typical of the Nasicon-type arrangement with a partial occupation of the two M(1) sites [(3a) and (3b)] generated by the space group. The magnetic and luminescent properties are consistent with the crystallographic data and give evidence of the existence of a small amount of Mn31 in such 2x/3Zr2(PO4)3 with x > 0.03. as-prepared samples, the actual composition being Mn21 © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structure of Nasicon-type phosphates whose prototype is NaZr2(PO4)3 [1] consists of a three-dimensional network formed by PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with ZrO6 octahedra.

The site occupied by sodium is an elongated antiprism formed by triangular faces of two ZrO6 octahedra along the c axis of the hexagonal cell. This site is usually called M(1). The phosphozirconate framework also creates a large tenfold coordinated site called M(2). Every M(1) site is surrounded by six M(2) sites sharing common triangular faces. Such phosphates have been studied extensively in various ﬁelds of solid-state chemistry The introduction of 3d ions leads to interesting materials for various catalytic processes, e.g., dehydrogenation and exchange reaction, periodic activity, [2] and for their luminescent properties [3].

For phosphates of composition MII 0.5Zr2(PO4)3, the actual crystal structure is determined by the size of MII. Phosphates with larger ions crystallize in the Nasicon-type, whereas phosphates with smaller ions exhibit the b-Fe2(SO4)3 structure type. The main difference between the two structures results in a different arrangement of the Zr2P3O18 entities giving rise in the ferric sulfate structure to pseudo tetrahedral sites for the small ions [4]. Both varieties have been reported for the manganese compound, since Mn21 has an intermediate ionic size (0.83 Å) [5,6]. The object of the present investigation was to examine the structure of Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 in relation to its luminescent properties.

Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was prepared through a gel route. Stoichiometric proportions of Mn (Cerac, z 8H2O (Merck, 99%) were respectively dissolved in 2.5 N HNO3 99.95%) as metal and ZrOCl2 and water. The solutions were then mixed. The addition of a solution of (NH4)2HPO4 (Merck, 99.5%) in appropriate proportion, under constant stirring, produced a colorless gel, which was heated at 80°C for 24 h. The obtained powder was successively heated at 400, 600, 700, and 900°C in an alumina crucible, with intermediate grinding. The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 1) at this stage of the preparation could not be indexed by assuming either of the expected structure types. Only a ﬁnal heating at 1400°C for 48 h followed by a rapid quench (1400–25°C/2s) allowed a pure Nasicon phase to be obtained. The samples were annealed at 700°C for several days, but no phase transformation was detected. The chemical analysis of the ﬁnal product, which was white-pink in color, is given in Table 1.

The reﬁnement of the structure was carried out using the Rietveld proﬁlation method. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature using a diffractometer with a graphite monochromator. Conditions for the data collection are given in Table 2.

The emission and excitation spectral distribution was obtained with a JOBIN-YVON HRS3 monochromator and detected using a R928 HAMAMATSU photomultiplier. The excitation source was a high pressure xenon lamp emitting between 200 and 1000 nm.

The XRD pattern could be indexed by assuming a rhombohedral cell. The order of magnitude of the parameters in the equivalent hexagonal cell (h) is typical of a Nasicon-type

The initial atomic coordinates were equivalent to those of NaZr2(PO4)3 in the R3¯c space group with a statistical distribution of Mn21 in one-half of the M(1) sites. To reduce the parameter number, constraints on the isotropic displacement coefﬁcients were progressively introduced. Final atomic parameters were satisfactorily obtained by using the R3¯ space group, which allows introduction of an occupancy factor over the 3a (0 0 0) and 3b (0 0 1/2) sites. Which is consistent with the simultaneous investigation of the luminescent properties (see next paragraph). The resulting atomic coordinates and their esd’s are listed in Table 4. A comparison between the experimental and calculated X-ray diffraction data is presented in Fig. 2. Table 5 presents selected bond distances and angles.

The c parameters increase with the ionic radii of the cation in the M(1) sitem whereas the a parameters decrease. The rule governing the variation of the cell parameters of such phosphates was established previously [7]. The value of ch depends not only on the size of M1/M21, but also on the competition between the coulombic attraction occurring in the occupied M(1) site and the O2––O2– repulsions when this site is empty. On the other hand, due to the ﬂexibility of the phosphozirconate network, ah decreases as ch increases. The experimental values of the Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 parameters are consistent with these conclusions (Table 6) [8 –11].

The structure of Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners. The PO4 tetrahedra are regular with a weak dispersion of the O–P–O angles between 105° and 115°, which is about the ideal value of 109.45°. The ,P–O. distance, 1.56 Å, which is typical of monophosphate, is close to the distances found in NaZr2(PO4)3 (,P–O. 5 1.543 Å (1)) and in Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (,P–O. 5 1.53 Å). As emphasized before, manganese ions occupy one-half of the M(1) sites, with a rate of 95% and 5%, respectively, in the 3(a) and 3(b) sites. More speciﬁcally, the Mn(1)–O distance, 2.31 Å, is mainly the result of the the larger h(Mn2)–O distance, 2.45 Å, reﬂects the coulombic attraction; whereas, anionic repulsion in a site, which is almost empty. Finally, since the ZrO6 octahedra share common faces with the M(1) sites, the larger the M(1) site, the smaller the neighboring Zr–O distance, and vice versa: Zr1–O1 (2.16 Å) facing Mn(1) is larger than Zr2–O22 (1.97 Å) facing the vacancy.

The thermal variation of the reciprocal molar magnetic susceptibility between 4 and 300 K is linear (Fig. 3). The straight line intercepts the origin, which excludes magnetic interaction between manganese ions. The experimental Curie constant (2.11 emu K/mol) is slightly lower than the calculated value, assuming all Mn21 in the high-spin state (2.19 emu K/mol). This difference may be the signature of the presence of a small

The emission spectra of Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 under 400 nm excitation are given in the Figs. 4 and 5. At room temperature, three bands are observed at about 570, 610, and 800 nm;

The ﬁrst 3 6A1 transition of Mn21 ions, assuming an octahedral two bands can be ascribed to the 4T1 site. The third band is observed at low temperature under 280 nm excitation (Fig. 5); its origin is discussed in the following paragraphs.

The proﬁle of the excitation spectra recorded at 7 K is independent of the emission wavelength, 570 or 610 nm. The better resolution observed for the ﬁrst spectrum (Fig. 6) allows the various bands to be approximately identiﬁed from the Tanabe–Sugano energy level diagram for a d5 conﬁguration. The crystal ﬁeld strength D and the Racah parameters B

have been calculated with the weak ﬁeld matrices of the quartet levels given by Bingham and Parke [12], in spite of the splitting of the involved excited levels: D 5 7000 cm–1, B 5 618 cm–1, and C 5 3746 cm–1. These results are consistent with the location of Mn21 in octahedral-like sites (Table 7). The crystal ﬁeld and Racah parameters are smaller than the values determined in ﬂuorides in which the Mn21 ions are in octahedral sites: MgF2:Mn D 5 9500 cm–1, B 5 730 cm–1, MnF2 D 5 8400 cm–1, B 5 676 cm–1. The two examples demonstrate the sensitiveness of these parameters to the metal ligand distances. In spite of the fact that these parameters were roughly estimated, their values can be associated with a marked covalent character of the Mn–O bond.

From the respective intensities of the two components of the visible emission band recorded at low temperature, the emission at 570 nm can be ascribed to the manganese in

the emission at 610 nm to the manganese in (3b), in accordance with the cationic distributions. The increase of the 610 nm emission observed at room temperature may be the result of a thermally activated Mn21

Finally it is necessary to discuss the origin of the infrared emission band. Its location and the spectral distribution of its excitation spectrum at low temperature (Fig. 7) exclude a Mn21 center. The indication of Mn31 luminescence can be examined. Broad band emissions appearing at about 800 nm have been attributed to this ion in Mn-doped Y3Al5O12 [13] and in some glasses [14]. In Fig. 7, the small intensity band at about 500 nm is located in the same domain of the absorption spectrum of YAG:Mn31, and the broad band on the high energy side seems typical of a charge transfer transition, e.g., Mn31–O2–. This attribution can explain the magnetic data as well as some features of the luminescent spectra, but it is clear that Mn31 luminescence needs additional investigation.

The evolution of the structure of MII

0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphates was investigated previously by Nomura et al. [5]. As mentioned in the Introduction, the transition between the b-Fe2(SO4)3 structure type and the “true” Nasicon type occurs for the manganese compounds. In our experimental conditions, the low-temperature form of the ferric sulfate type was not detected. The stabilization of the Nasicon type needed a high temperature and a long thermal treatment, these conditions probably being at the origin of the appearance of the Mn31. The Mn–O distances are slightly larger than the interatomic distance in Mn–O (2.22 Å). The luminescence investigation conﬁrms the location of Mn21 in two different sites as well as the presence of a small quantity of Mn31.
