A potassium iron zirconium phosphate, K2FeZrP3O12, was synthesized by thermal treatment of a material obtained by the sol–gel method, mixing two aqueous solutions, the ﬁrst containing KCl, FeCl3 and ZrOCl2, and the second, H3PO4. The crystal structure was reﬁned using powder X-ray diffraction data. The unit cell is cubic, a=10.0554(3) A˚ , space group P213. This compound is the ﬁrst iron zirconium phosphate described with a langbeinite-type structure.
The langbeinite-type mineral family are sulfates with the general formula MI 2 S3O12 (MI=K, Rb, Cs, Tl, NH4; MII=Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd, Fe) [8]. A characteristic feature of such compounds is the presence of large one-valent cations in interstitial holes and relatively small two-valent cations in the network.
At the present time, the phosphates with a langbeinite structure constitute a small group of compounds. In the majority, the network cations are TiIII, TiIV, CrIII, and FeIII, while the interstitial cations are NaI, KI, and BaII: KTi2P3O12 [9], K1.75Ti2P3O12 [10], K2Ti2P3O12 [10,11], KBaFe2P3O12 [12], KBaCr2P3O12 [13], Na2Cr TiP3O12 and Na2FeTiP3O12 [14]. The number of including zirconium, K2YZrP3O12 and compounds K2GdZrP3O12 [15] or hafnium, K2BiHfP3O12 [16] is even smaller.
Notable differences exist between NASICONand langbeinite-type structures [17]. In NASICON, four interstitial sites (holes in the network) are present, while langbeinite has only two. These sites are large enough to accommodate the cations that compensate the charge of the network. In the NASICON structure, the holes can be completely empty. This is not possible in the langbeinite structure. Moreover, the channels between the network holes have narrow in the latter, sample of K2FeZrP3O12 was gently ground in an agate mortar and the data were collected at room temperature over the angular range 11–1101 2y with a step of 0.021 and a count time of 10 s/step. The pattern was indexed using the program TREOR [18] from the angular positions of 26 low-angle accurately measured, unambiguously indexed reﬂections. A cubic cell was obtained: a=10.0511(3) A˚ (ﬁgures of merit: M 26=86 [19] and F 26=83 (0.007, 46) [20]). 
As a starting set for Rietveld analysis, the coordinates were taken from those of KTi2P3O12 [9] with the Fe and Zr atoms initially sharing, with half occupancy, both Mg langbeinite sites and two independent K atoms, with full occupancy, in the two K langbeinite sites. Reﬁnement was carried out in the P213 space group using the FULLPROF program [21]. The peak shape was described using a split pseudoVoigt function. The background was modeled using a linear interpolation between 23 points. Free atomic coordinates reﬁnement led to excessively deviated P–O distances from ideal ones. In order to obtain accurate values for the more structurally relevant metal–oxygen distances, soft constraints were introduced for the PO4 tetrahedron. This does not signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁt (Rwp=11.6 versus 11.5). In the last stages of reﬁnement, the occupancies of metal sites were reﬁned using linear constraints to ﬁx total sites occupancies and formula content.
Fig. 1 shows the powder X-ray diffraction pattern and the difference between the calculated and the observed pattern. The crystallographic parameters are presented in Table 1. Final atomic coordinates, isotropic displacement parameters, bond distances and angles are reported in Table 2. A polyhedral representation of the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2.
This fact prevents cation transport. As a consequence, the cations of a sufﬁciently large size remain captive in the holes and lose their ability to migrate. This fact can be useful in developing materials for the immobilization of toxic cations from wastes, including radioactive waste.
We report here the synthesis and structural characterization of a new phosphate with a langbeinite structure K2FeZrP3O12.
All reagents were of analytical grade (Aldrich) and were used without further puriﬁcation.
The potassium iron zirconium phosphate (dark-gray), K2FeZrP3O12, was prepared as follows: 6.4 mL of 1 M H3PO4 was slowly added, with constant stirring, to an aqueous solution containing stoichiometric quantities of KCl (2 M), FeCl3 (1 M) and ZrOCl2 (1 M). The resultant gel was dried at 851C for 25 h, thoroughly dispersed in an agate mortar and then heated in stages to 6001C, 8001C, 10001C and 11001C for 24 h at each stage, cycling heating stage and dispersion. After each heating step, the sample was examined by powder diffraction, which allowed the formation of the ﬁnal product and the presence of admixture phases in the sample to be controlled. Crystallization of K2FeZrP3O12 takes place at 8001C. The thermal treatment to higher temperatures provokes an increase in the crystallinity of the synthesized phosphate.
The potassium, iron, zirconium and phosphorus contents were determined using a SpectraSpectrometer DCP-AEC after dissolving a weighed amount of sample in HF(aq). Elemental analysis (in wt.): 15.1% K, 10.9% Fe, 17.9% Zr, 18.4% P (calculated for K2FeZrP3O12: 15.33% K, 10.95% Fe, 17.88% Zr, 18.21% P). The infrared spectra were recorded with a Carl Zeiss Jena SPECORD-75 FT-IR spectrophotometer. Micrographs were obtained with a JEOL JSM-6100 electron microscope operating at 20 kV.
MIV occupy the two fourfold Mg-sites of the langbeinite. The actual compound belongs to group (iii), where AI=K, MIII=Fe and MIV=Zr. An open question regarding case (iii), two different metals or the same metal in different oxidation states, is whether there is a random or ordered distribution over the two Mg(II) sites. Isasi and Daidouh [14] propose an ordered structure for Na2FeTi(PO4)3, but is not apparent from the paper whether the authors have explored the disordered possibility. Wulff et al. [15], who made intensity calculations based on different models, indicate a random distribution of ZrIV and YIII/GdIII for K2MZr(PO4)3 (M=Y, Gd), but they did not carry out a Rietveld reﬁnement. For the non-stoichiometric titanophosphate, K2 xTi2(PO4)3, the evolution of the Ti–O distances and calculations of the mean oxidation state for titanium allow the authors [10] to propose a distribution of the TiIII and TiIV ions on both types of site. 
Our structure reﬁnement clearly indicates the existence of occupational Fe/Zr disorder with a relative occupancy of ca. 70/30.
