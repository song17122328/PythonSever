H3 – 2xNbxM2 – x(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe) acid phosphates have been obtained by ion exchange from their lithium forms and X?ray powder diffraction, impedance measurements, and 7Li and 1H NMR spectros? copy . The parameters of the hexagonal unit cell of the proton?exchanged forms differ only slightly from those of the initial lithium compounds. According to 1H NMR data, the proton in the acid phosphates is not hydrated. The conductivity of the acid phosphates at high temperatures depends weakly on their composition and is ~1.7 × 10–7 S cm–1 at 620 K. The activation energy of conduction is 30–33 kJ/mol (430–770 K).

Proton?conducting compounds, which are prom? ising for fuel cell applications, have attracted attention from numerous researchers. They can serve both as membrane materials and as solid electrolytes contain? ing mobile protons [1, 2]. Materials with a NASICON structure are distinguished for their high cationic con? ductivity . However, there is only scarce information concerning NASICON?type proton conductors [3 ⎯7]. The acid zirconium phosphate HZr2(PO4)3 with a NASICON structure was synthesized for the first time by the decomposition of the corresponding ammonium salt obtained by hydrothermal synthesis [3]. Treating the anhydrous acid salt with hot water yields the HZr2(PO4)3 · H2O hydrate, which crystallizes in the hexagonal system [4]. Later, we obtained NASI? CON?type acid zirconium phosphate by ion exchange between its lithium form and HNO3 [6]. These materi? als show high proton conductivity and high thermal stability [6, 7]. There have been no reports on other NASICON? type acid phosphates obtained by ion exchange. It is, therefore, of interest to synthesize new NASICON? type acid phosphates by ion exchange in the earlier studied mixed phosphates Li3 – 2xNbxM2 – x(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe), which are characterized by high cationic mobility [8, 9]. Here, we report the properties of the compounds obtained by ion exchange in Li3 – 2xNbxM2 – x(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe).

Mixed phosphates with the general formulas Li3 ⎯ 2xNbxFe2 – x(PO4)3 (x = 1.25, 1.1, 1) and Li3 ⎯ 2xNbxIn2 – x(PO4)3 (x = 1.05, 1.025, 1.01, 1, 0.99, 0.975, 0.95) were obtained by solid?phase synthesis as described in [10]. Ion exchange was performed in hot concentrated nitric acid for 30 days. The completeness of ion exchange was checked by thermogravimetric analysis and 7Li NMR spectros? copy . Thermal analyses were carried out between 290 and 1220 K using a TG 209 (Netzsch) thermobalance (platinum crucibles, heating rate of 10 K/min). 7Li NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer operating at 116.6 MHz. X?ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (CuKα radia? tion). Diffraction patterns were interpreted using the Rigaku Application Data Processing program pack? age. Broadline 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 120 K on a T esla BS?567A spectrometer (84 MHz) modified for recording broad lines. Ionic conductivity was measured in cylindrical pel? lets (5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height) with plat? inum electrodes in the frequency range of 10 Hz– 2 MHz using a 2V?1 LCR meter. Measurements were taken between 298 and 820 K with 10? to 20?K incre? ments. Conductivity was calculated by extrapolating the bulk conductivity semicircles to the ohmic resis? tance axis.

The X?ray diffraction patterns from all materials obtained by ion?exchange can be indexed in the hex? agonal system. All reflections in the diffraction pat? terns are shifted to smaller angles. Figure 1 shows the X?ray diffraction pattern of HNbFe(PO4)3 and por? tions of the diffraction patterns of the initial lithium niobium iron phosphate and HNbFe(PO4)3. The hkl = 014 and 110 peaks in the diffraction pattern of the ion? exchanged material are resolved. The unit cell param? eters (hexagonal system) depend only slightly on the composition of the material and vary in the following ranges: a = 8.609–8.621 Å and c = 21.754–21.950 Å. Ion exchange in LiNbIn(PO4)3 causes intensity redis? tribution between the hkl = 014 and 110 reflections (Fig. 2). The unit cell parameters of the ion? exchanged material vary in the ranges of a = 8.715– 8.723 Å and с = 22.063–22.124 Å. An analysis of these diffraction patterns suggests that ion exchange in the mixed phosphates takes place through the formation of solid solutions. Note that the unit cell parameters а and с of the ion?exchanged materials are slightly larger than those of the initial lithium forms [8, 9]. This is due to the fact that the lithium and hydrogen ions, small in size, occupy fairly large holes in the NASI? CON structure and do not exert any significant effect on its rigid framework. The X?ray diffraction patterns of some composi? tions show extra, weak broad reflections at 2θ = 25.74° and 27.86°, which are due to the niobium oxyphos? phate phase NbOPO4. The amount of this impurity phase increases with ion exchange time, but it does not exceed 10% for all of the samples examined. T o check the completeness of ion exchange, we recorded the 7Li NMR spectra of the materials before and after exchange. The integrated intensity of the 7Li signal for the proton?exchanged samples did not exceed 5% of the signal from the initial lithium form. The width and shape of the line changed insignifi? cantly . Therefore, the extent of exchange was at least 95%. Thus, the X?ray diffraction and 7Li NMR data suggest that ion exchange takes place via the reaction (1) where M = In, Fe. According to the results of thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 3), the water of hydration is eliminated in two steps. Below 570 K, its amount is 0.01–0.27 mol per formula unit, depending on the sample. The release of constitutional water from the НР groups begins above 570 K and, as judged from the weight loss curve, is incomplete at 1220 K. As a consequence, the extent of ion exchange derived from the thermogravi? metric profile is not quite correct and can be consid? ered only as a lower estimate. For the samples exam? ined here, this estimate is 75–100%, confirming the above NMR data. On cooling, the samples reabsorb water. Anhydrous acid zirconium phosphate is stable in a wide temperature range of 610–810 K [11]. As distinct from HZr2(PO4)3, the Li3 – 2xNbxM2 – x(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe) materials decompose in a wider temperature range. They start releasing constitutional water imme? diately after they have lost the water of hydration, and this process is incomplete even at 1220 K.

Note that niobium oxyphosphate can contain up to three water molecules. Upon heating, this water is eliminated in two stages [12]. At low temperatures, the compound loses the two molecules of crystal water: Nb(OH)2PO4 · 2H2O Nb(OH)2PO4, ( 2 ) At higher temperature, it loses one molecule of consti? tutional water: Nb(OH)2PO4 NbOPO4. ( 3 ) The amount of weakly bound water released at the first stage is determined by the amount of impurity niobium oxyphosphate, while the weight loss at the second stage is independent of it. Figure 4 shows the broadline 1H NMR spectra (120 K) of two samples of the same initial composition HNbIn(PO4)3 obtained by ion exchange in different periods of time. The 1H NMR spectrum of sample 1 appears as a single singlet at ±1.5 G (Fig. 4, curve а), which is characteristic of the proton of the OH group. According to X?ray diffraction and thermogravimetric data, the amount of the impurity (≈10%) and the loss of water are the largest for sample 2. The spectrum of sample 2 (Fig. 4, curve b) is a singlet against the back? ground of a much broader doublet line at ≈ ±7 G, which is characteristic of water of hydration. The inte? grated intensity of this broad line has a fairly low value of ≈40%. This is roughly equal to the proportion of protons from Nb(OH)2PO4 · 2H2O in the sample as a whole. Thus, the water identified in the ion? exchanged materials is due to the presence of impurity niobium oxyphosphate. Figure 5 plots the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of H1.02Nb0.99In1.01(PO4)3 and H1.05Nb0.975In1.025(PO4)3 in the coordinates of the Fren? kel equation: σT = Аexp(–Ea/RT), (1) where Т is temperature (K), А is the preexponential factor, Ea is the activation energy of conduction, and R is the gas constant. The low?temperature conductivi? ties of the samples examined correlate primarily with the amount of water of hydration. Therefore, the low? temperature conductivity is limited by the amount of hydrated niobium oxyphosphate, which was reported to possess a similar conductivity [12]. The conductiv? ity of the samples above 430 K is substantially higher than the conductivity of niobium oxyphosphate and varies only slightly from one composition to another. Therefore, the ionic conductivity in this temperature range is determined by the amount of the exchange products. The activation energy of conduction between 430 and 770 K depends weakly on the compo? sition of the material and is 30–33 kJ/mol. Note that a similar situation is observed for acid zirconium phosphate doped with niobium and yttrium: after a phase transition at 490 K, the conduc? tivities of samples of different compositions are very similar [11]. However, the conductivities of the mate? rials examined here are significantly lower than the conductivity of the corresponding zirconium com? pound. In the X?ray diffraction patterns of the ion? exchanged materials heat?treated at 1270 K for 10 h, the reflections from the main phase are shifted to smaller angles and occur close to the same reflections for the lithium forms before ion exchange (Fig. 6), and their intensities are somewhat lower. The peaks due to the niobium oxyphosphate phase are slightly stronger. Apparently , the acid phosphates decompose upon heat treatment, and this is not accompanied by noticeable structural changes, because the NASICON lattice is fairly rigid. The main phase resulting from annealing is a condensed phosphate containing lithium ions. Note that acid zirconium phosphate decomposes at ≈1170 K to yield condensed zirconium phosphates.

Thus, the H3 – 2xM2 – xNbx(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe) acid phosphates were obtained from their lithium forms by ion exchange and were characterized by X?ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, impedance measurements, and 7Li and 1H NMR spectroscopy . The completeness of ion exchange was verified by 7Li NMR spectroscopy . The resulting compounds crystal? lize in the hexagonal system. As was demonstrated by 1H NMR spectroscopy , the proton in these com? pounds is not hydrated. The conductivity of the acid phosphates at high temperatures depends weakly on their composition and is ≈1.7 × 10–7 S cm–1 at 620 K. The activation energy of conduction is 30–33 kJ/mol (430–770 K).
