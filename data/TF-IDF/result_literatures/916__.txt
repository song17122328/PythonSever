Triple molybdates AgA3R(MoO4)5 (A¼Mg, R¼Cr, Fe; A¼Mn, R¼Al, Cr, Fe, Sc, In) of the NaMg3In(MoO4)5type were synthesized and single crystals of AgMg3R(MoO4)5 (R¼Cr, Fe) were grown.

In their structures,the MoO4 tetrahedra, pairs and trimers of edge-shared (Mg, R)O6 octahedra are connected by commonvertices to form a 3D framework.

Large framework cavities involve Agþ cations disordered on threenearby positions with CN¼3þ1 or 4þ1.Alternating (Mg, R)O6 octahedra and MoO4 tetrahedra in theframework form quadrangular windows penetrable for Agþ at elevated temperatures.

Above 653–673 K,the newly obtained molybdates demonstrate abrupt reduction of the activation energy to 0.4–0.6 eV.

At773 K, AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 shows electric conductivity 2.5  102 S/cm and Ea¼0.39 eV compatible withcharacteristics of the best ionic conductors of the NASICON type.

In the systems containing molybdates of sodium, di- andtrivalent metals, there are two groups of triple molybdates,Na1xA1xR1þx(MoO4)3 and NaA3R(MoO4)5, crystallizing in thestructure types of NASICON [1] and NaMg3In(MoO4)5 [2–6], respectively.

 Both structures do exist in the ternary molybdate systems involving cations of trivalent metals with r(R3þ)o1 Å.

In view of close ionic radii of Naþ and Agþ, the formation ofanalogous phases in similar silver containing systems is ratherprobable.

Indeed, studying the systems Ag2MoO4–AMoO4–R2(MoO4)3(A¼Mg, Co, R¼Al; A¼Mg, R¼In), we have observed the formation ofrhombohedral phases Ag1xA1xR1þx(MoO4)3 of the NASICON typewith wide homogeneity ranges, as well as triclinic triple molybdatesAgA3R(MoO4)5 of the NaMg3In(MoO4)5 type [7–9].

The phase formation features of those triple molybdates may be illustrated with anexample of Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 system studied byus at 773 K [8].

Because of a partial nonquasibinarity of theboundary system Ag2MoO4–Al2(MoO4)3, the limited area Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3–AgAl(MoO4)2 was investigated(Fig.

1) where formation of triple molybdates AgMgAl(MoO4)3 of theNASICON type and AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 (S2) of the NaMg3In(MoO4)5type has been established.

 As seen in Fig.1, the S2 compound has nonoticeable homogeneity range along the AgAl(MoO4)2–MgMoO4 join.

On the contrary, the phase of variable composition Ag1xMg1xAl1þx(MoO4)3 with x up to 0.4 (S1) is formed as a solid solution extending along the join AgMgAl(MoO4)3–Al2(MoO4)3.Silver-containing Ag1xA1xR1þx(MoO4)3 phases [10] withrhombohedral NASICON-like structures demonstrated high ionicconductivity typical for many representatives of this structuralfamily.

In the family of NaMg3In(MoO4)5, the structure – propertycorrelations were not earlier examined, and the present paper isthe first step in this direction.

Thus, the subject of the paper ispreparation, structure determination and characterization ofelectro-conductive properties of triclinic triple molybdatesAgA3R(MoO4)5 (A¼Mg, R¼Cr, Fe; A¼Mn, R¼Al, Cr, Fe, Sc, In)crystallizing in the NaMg3In(MoO4)5 structure.
