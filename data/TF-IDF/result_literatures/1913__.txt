Solid-state electrochemical sensor devices combined with a sodium ion conductor (Na5DySi4O12) disc and metal-sulﬁde sensing electrodes synthesized via solution routes have been investigated for the detection of SO2 in the range 20–200 ppm at 150–400◦C. Among the various sulﬁde sensing electrodes tested, the metal-mono sulﬁde-based electrodes (NiS, CdS, SnS and PbS) gave good SO2 sensitivity at 300–400◦C. The CdS-based solid electrolyte sensor element showed the best sensing characteristics, i.e., the EMF response was almost linear with the logarithm of SO2 concentration in the range between 20 and 200 ppm, with a 90% response time to 100 ppm SO2 of about 2–4 min at 400◦C.
Sulfur oxides (SO2 and SO3; often referred to as SOx) emitting from gasolineor diesel-engines, power stations, and other industrial plants are one of the major sources of acid rain or smog, and harmful for human health. Thus, there is a need for solid-state sulfur oxides sensors, which are reliable, inexpensive, and compact. So far, many kinds of compact SOx sensors using various materials such as solid electrolyte [1–8], oxide semiconductors [9], solid polymer electrolyte [10] and piezoelectric crystal [11] have been investigated. Among them, the solid electrolyte-type SOx sensors are of particular interest from the viewpoints of low cost, high sensitivity, good selectivity and simple device structure.
Many solid electrolyte-type SOx sensors have been reported in literature. These are: solid electrolyte type II [12–14] sensor devices based on the alkali sulfatebased electrolytes [1–8], the solid electrolyte type III [12–14] sensor devices using β-alumina/Na2SO4 [15], CaF2/CaSO4 [16], Ca-β 4) 4) -alumina/CaSO4 [17], CaOZrO2 (CSZ)/K2SO4 [3], Y2O3-ZrO2 (YSZ)/BaSO4K2SO4 [18], MgO-ZrO2 (MSZ)/Li2SO4-CaSO4 [19, 20], Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON)/Na2SO4 [17, 21, 22], YSZ: NASICON/Na2SO4 [23], and MgZr4 (PO4)6/ Na2SO4 [24]-based couples. However, these sensors need relatively high operating temperatures and/or appear to suffer from the chemical instability of the alkali metal sulfates used as the solid electrolyte or the auxiliary phase. Metal-sulﬁde electrodes such as MoS2 [25] and Ag2S-MoSx [26] have been investigated, instead of conventional metal sulfates for the auxiliary phases of CaF2 or Ag-β-alumina based solid electrolyte sulfur gas sensors, respectively. 
These seem to exhibit better sensing performance in a wide temperature range, as well as improve chemical and/or thermal stability. 
More detailed studies, however, are needed about the sensing characteristics involving metal-sulﬁde electrodes.
In our previous study [27], it was found that Na5DySi4O12 (NaDyCON)-based sodium ion conductor shows relatively higher chemical stability in an acidic condition as well as higher ionic conductivity at lower temperatures. It was also demonstrated that metal-sulﬁdes work as sensing electrodes for the NaDyCON-based solid electrolyte SO2 sensor. In this paper, we report results of a systematic study on the sensing properties of various metal-sulﬁdes as sensing electrodes.
Most of the metal-sulﬁdes used as the sensing electrode materials were prepared by the wet-chemical methods using aqueous solutions. Metal-mono sulﬁdes (MS: M = Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) and Ag2S were prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method [28]. Aqueous solutions of metal-chlorides were mixed with urea at room temperature, and then thioacetoamide was added C to form a precipitate, which to the solution at 70 ◦ C for 1 h, ﬁltered and washed with was boiled at 100 C in distilled water, and then heat-treated at 120–300  4) = Ni, Ru) and Bi2S3 Ar. Metal di-sulﬁdes (M were prepared by the ammonium sulﬁde method [29]. Ammonium sulﬁde aqueous solution was slowly added to the aqueous solution of metal-chlorides at room temperature, which was stirred for 1 h and then adjusted to pH < 7 with HCl to get precipitates. The obtained ◦ C in Ar precipitates were ﬁltered, washed, dried at 120 C in Ar for 2 h. Thiospinels and ﬁnally calcined at 300 (Ni3S4, etc.) were prepared by a pH-controlled precipitation method [30]. 
Fig. 2 shows XRD patterns of CdS and NiS2 synthesized by the wet-chemical preparation processes. Although, a low-intensity peak of an impurity phase was observed for CdS, the well-crystallized and almost single-phase CdS and NiS2 were observed. The XRD analysis also revealed that the other metal monoand di-sulﬁdes including the thiospinels prepared by the wet chemical methods showed well-crystallized and almost singlephase sulﬁdes.
Fig. 3 shows XRD pattern of the prepared NaDyC. Well-crystallized and CON disc sintered at 1000 almost single phase Na5DySi4O12 was determined by XRD. The densities of the discs calculated from their mass and dimensions were 3.0–3.1 g·cm −3, which are about 93–95% of the theoretical density [32]. The ionic conductivity of a NaDyCON disc measured by an AC impedance method with Au electrodes was about 1.0 × 10 C, which is comparable to that of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) discs.
The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD: JDX-3500K, JEOL Ltd.) using Cu Kα1 radiation, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM: JSM-6320F, JEOL Ltd.) for phase content and microstructural features.
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the SO2 sensor device using the NaDyCON disc and metal-sulﬁde electrodes with a Au-mesh current collector at the outside surface (Type A) or a Au-mesh sandwiched in between the sulﬁde and the solid electrolyte disc (Type B). A paste prepared with the sulﬁde and turpentine oil was painted onto the surface of the NaDyCON disc, and C for 1 h to form a layer dried and heat treated at 500 of sulﬁde as the sensing electrode. A reference Pt electrode attached on the inside surface of the NaDyCON disc was always exposed to a static atmospheric air.
Sensing experiments were carried out in a conventional ﬂow apparatus equipped with a heating source C. Samproviding temperature in the range of 150–400 ple gases containing SO2 were prepared from a parent gas, i.e., SO2 diluted with nitrogen, by mixing with nitrogen or a dry synthetic air (N2 + O2 gas mixture).
As it is well known that the properties of metal-sulﬁdes are largely dependent on the type of metal cation, the effects of metal cation in the metal mono-sulﬁdes (MS; M = Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu, Ge, Sn, Pb) on SO2 sensing properties were ﬁrst investigated.
Most of the devices showed no response to SO2 at temperatures between 150 and 250 C. Only the NiS-based device showed SO2 response with a slope of −58 mV/decade, while the response time was as ◦ C, the delong as 15 min. At the temperature of 300 vices based on NiS-, CdS-, SnS-, PbS-based electrodes showed SO2 responses with different values of the slope and the response time. At the same temperature CuS-, GeS-based sensors showed no SO2 response, and ZnSbased sensor showed high resistance and poor response characteristics.
Fig. 5 shows the SO2 sensing properties of the elements using metal mono-sulﬁde systems, which ◦ showed SO2 responses at 300 and 400 C, the NiS-based element showed the highest sensitivity (slope) but slow response rate. On the other hand, CdSand SnS-based sensors showed rather large slope and ◦ C. Fig. 6 shows relatively good response time at 400 SO2 sensing properties of the device with the SnS elecC. The device showed good and reversible trode at 400 ◦ EMF responses to SO2 at 400 C. The EMF response was linear with the logarithm of SO2 concentration (log PSO2) between 20 and 200 ppm with a slope of−49 C. The 90% response time (T90) to mV/decade at 400 198 ppm SO2 was about 7 min at 400 C. Table I summarizes the SO2 sensing performance for the sensor devices with metal mono-sulﬁdes, which were stable even in 2N H2SO4 solution at room temperature. 
Solid electrolyte SOx sensor devices using NaDyCON electrolyte and metal sulﬁde electrodes were found to exhibit good sensing performance in the temperature C. The EMF responses were linear range of 300–400 with the logarithm of SO2 concentration between 20– 200 ppm SO2. The device using the CdS electrode with Type B structure gave the best sensing properties.
