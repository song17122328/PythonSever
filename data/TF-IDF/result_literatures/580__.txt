New Al3+ ion conducting solid electrolytes (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x(0 ≤x ≤ 0.4) with Nasicon-structure are successfully prepared by solid state reaction method. The influences of the doped F- content on the properties of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x samples are investigated using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that F- doping can effectively improve the sinterability and the total conductivity of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x samples. Among the solids series, (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 shows the highest conductivity of 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1at 500 °C, which is approximately 7.9 times higher than that of the undoped (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12. The ion transference number of the samples is higher than 0.99 at 300–700 °C. On the basis of the promising properties, a mixed-potential type NH3 sensor based on (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 electrolyte and In2O3 sensing electrode has been developed. The sensing performance of the sensor is evaluated. The mixed-potential type sensor can work at relatively low temperatures of 200–350 °C and an excellent sensitivity of 99.71 mV/decade at 250 °C is obtained. The sensor also displays excellent stability and reproducibility, accompanied by low cross-sensitivities to CO2, CH4 and H2.

Solid electrolytes are outstanding functional materials and prized for their excellent characteristic that only a single type of ion can is the source of conduction in the materials. They have been widely applied in fuel cells, sensing devices, chemical reactors and gas separation membranes. Besides monovalent and bivalent ion conductors, the multivalent ion conducting solid electrolytes possess excellent chemical stability forming an integral part of the solid electrolytes systems. Until now, the multivalent ion conducting solid electrolytes reported in literature include trivalent ions (such as Al3+, Bi3+, Sc3+, Ce3+, La3+,Pr3+, Nd3+, Gd3+) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and tetravalent ions (such as Zr4+, Ti4+, Hf4+) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].

Al3+ ion is the most suitable conducting ion in trivalent ion solid electrolytes, because it has the smallest ionic radius among the above trivalent ions [16]. So far, there are two kinds of Al3+ ion conductors reported in literatures, that is, Al2(WO4)3 with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure and (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 with Nasicon-type structure. The electrical conductivity of Al2(WO4)3 is 3.2 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 600 °C, which is too low to meet the practical application range (≥ 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1). (Al.2Zr.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 was discovered in 2002 and its conductivity can reach 4.46 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 600 °C which is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of Al2(WO4)3 solid electrolyte and comparable with that of commercialized oxygen ion conductors YSZ and CSZ [1]. The (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 has been successfully used as electrolyte to develop gases sensors, including Cl2, NO, CO2, SO2 and NH3 [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. It should be noted that these solid electrolyte type sensors can operate at a low or medium temperature (230–500 °C). However, the conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 is still not high enough for some applications especially at lower temperatures. In order to improve the electrical performances of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12, two strategies have been used, including the enhancement of the density and intrinsic conductivity of the electrolyte. Hasegawa found that B2O3 was an excellent sintering aid for (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 [24]. When 6 wt% B2O3 was added, both the conductivity and mechanical strength of the sample were improved. The electrochemical properties of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 can be improved by the aliovalent doping. Imanaka investigated the cationic substitutions on the Zr4+ or Al3+ sites with Ti4+ or La3+ [16]. The results showed that the [Al0.2(Zr1–xTix)0.8]20/19NbP3O12 (x = 0.2) possessed the optimal lattice volume for Al3+ conducting and the conductivity reached 6.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 600 °C, which was 1.4 times higher than that of (Al.2Zr.8)4/3.8NbP3O12.

Halogen doping on O2- site is another effective strategy to improve the properties of solid electrolytes. Zhou et al. [25] researched the effect of partial substitution of O2- site with halogen (F-, Cl- and Br-) on the properties of BaCe0.90Gd0.1O3-δ (BCG). The results displayed that halogen doping effectively improved the chemical stability in CO2 and H2O steam of BCG without damaging the structure and morphology of BCG. Tarasova et al. [26], [27], [28], [29] investigated the effect of fluorine dopant on the electric properties of Ba2In2O5 with brownmillerite-type of structure. As a result, when O2- was substituted by F-, the concentration and mobility of charge carriers were increased which led to the improvement of conductivity. Song et al. [30] studied the effect of fluorine partially replacing phosphate in Na3V2(PO4)3 forming Na3V2(PO4)2F3 on its electrochemical properties. The introduction of fluorine could effectively enhance the Na+ conduction capability in this electrode material. Since Na3V2(PO4)3 and (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 all belong to NASICON-type compounds, fluorine is chosen to substitute the O site of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 for improving its electrical properties.

NH3 is an important gas which is widely used in chemical industries, refrigeration, fertilizer production and in deNoxing technology. However, NH3 is toxic and even a small concentration of NH3 can pose a threat to human health. So, the electrochemical sensors that can measure the NH3 concentrations continuously are required. The NH3 sensors mainly include the semiconductor type [31] and solid electrolyte type sensors [32], [33], [34]. Nevertheless, the semiconductor type NH3 sensors possess poor anti-interference ability to other gases. In contrast, the solid electrolyte type sensors possess some advantages, such as, good selectivity, stable performance and wide operating temperatures.

In this paper, the Al3+ ion conductor (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 was modified by doping fluorine into the O sites and new electrolytes (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x were obtained. The sample with the best electrical properties among the (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x series was selected as electrolyte to fabricate a mixed potential type NH3 sensor. In2O3 presented excellent gas sensing properties was prepared by hydrothermal method as the sensing electrode [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. The sensing performance of the sensor was investigated.

(Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x(x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) were prepared using the conventional solid-state method at high temperature. According to (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x(x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) stoichiometric ratio, starting materials of Al2O3, ZrO2, Nb2O5, NH4H2PO4 and AlF3 with analytical grade were weighed and mixed in anhydrous ethanol using a ball milling machine for 24 h. And then the powder mixtures were naturally dried and calcined in air at 1050 °C for 12 h, 1200 °C for 12 h and 1300 °C for 12 h. Finally, after milling and drying again, the powder samples were pressed into pellets and sintered at 1300 °C for 12 h in air to obtain dense electrolyte pellets.

In order prepare electrolyte pellets with a bilayer structure, the mixture of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 powder and 30 wt% graphite powder was dispersed into an organic dispersant (terpineol, 94 wt% and ethyl-cellulose, 6 wt%) to obtain an electrolyte slurry. The slurry was screen-printed onto one surface of the above-mentioned dense electrolyte pellets and then sintered at 1250 °C for 3 h in air to form the porous layer on the dense electrolyte pellet. Finally, the electrolyte pellets with a bilayer structure were obtained.

The In2O3 powders were synthesized by hydrothermal reaction method [39]. In a typical process, 5 mmol InCl3·4H2O，30 mmol urea and 15 mmol citric acid were dissolved in 50 mL distilled water. A certain amount of dilute nitric acid was dropwise added into the solution to adjust the pH value in a range of 1–2. After continuously stirring for 1 h, the mixture was transferred into a vessel with Teflon lining and kept at 130 °C for 12 h. The precipitates were then collected using centrifugal separation method after the vessel was naturally cooled to room temperature. The precipitates were subsequently washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol for a few times, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The precipitates were calcined at 600 °C for 3 h in air to obtain the final product.

Characterization of the sample phase composition was performed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, D/MAX2500PC) using Cu kα radiation in the diffraction angle 2θ range of 10–40 degree. The microstructures of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha 1063) was adopted to determine the change of elemental composition on the surface after doping fluorine element. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was used to measure the electrical conductivities under the conditions of the potential polarization amplitude of 5 mV, frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz and temperature range of 300–700 °C. All the electrochemical measurements were performed using a Solartron Analytical SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer with the Solartron Analytical SI 1287 electrochemical interface. The equivalent circuit model consisting of a serial association of (R//CPE) elements (R: resistance; CPE: constant phase element) was used to fit the measured impedance spectra for calculate the conductivities of the samples.

The ion transference number was determined using chronoamperometry with an applied potential of 100 mV for 600 s [40].

To fabricate a sensor based on Al3+ ion conducting electrolyte with In2O3 sensing electrode, the In2O3 ink was firstly synthesized by mixing 30 wt% of the above obtained In2O3 powders and 70 wt% organic dispersant and then printed onto the porous layer of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 pellet with a bilayer structure by screen printing technology. After drying, the samples were kept at 800 °C for 3 h to form the sensing electrode. The Pt reference and collecting electrodes were obtained by painting Pt paste on both surfaces of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 pellet and then heated at 800 °C for 2 h with Pt wires as leads. The schematic illustration of the formed sensor is shown in Fig. 1.

The performance of the sensor was tested in an experimental system equipped with a heated furnace. The NH3 gas concentration was controlled by diluting a 8000 ppm NH3 standard gas (balance is air) using the base gas (air). During the entire experimental run the total gas flow rate was fixed at 200 mL/min. The sensor output was collected by an electrochemical interface system using a two electrode configuration at a temperature range of 200–400 °C.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O12-xF2x powders with different F- content. It can be seen that the main diffraction peaks of the samples correspond to the NASICON type structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 (JCPDS No. 33-1312). In the meanwhile, there appears a small amount of secondary phase of NbPO5 in the compound. As the fluorine content increases from 0.2 to 0.6, the intensity of NbPO5 decreases gradually. However, with further increasing the fluorine content to 0.8, the intensity of NbPO5 increases again.

The unit cell parameters of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O12-xF2x were calculated based on the XRD results and listed in Table 1. With the fluorine content increasing from 0.2 to 0.6, the unit cell volumes of the samples are enlarged, which is attributed to the substitution of each O2- ion by two F- ions for their similar ionic radius (= 1.40 Å, = 1.33 Å) [41], [42]. The relative densities increase with fluorine content increasing up to 0.6 and then decrease with further increasing fluorine content. The highest relative density of 92.90% is obtained for (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6.

Fig. 3 shows the surface and cross-section SEM photos of the (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O12-xF2x. When the fluorine content is 0.2, there are visible pores and cracks appeared on the surface and interior of the sample (as shown in Fig. 3A1 and A2). With the fluorine content increasing, the electrolyte samples gradually become dense without any obvious pores or cracks observed at the surfaces and cross-sections (see in Fig. 3B1 to D1 and Fig. 3B2 to D2). These results indicate that fluorine doping has a positive effect on the sintering property of electrolyte (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O12 [43], [44]. As shown in Fig. 3, the surfaces of the electrolytes are made up with relatively uniform microspheres. With the fluorine content increasing, the particle size becomes large. However, when the fluorine content increases to 0.8, the particle size reduces and the morphology of a large proportion of grains transform from sphere to cube which can be explained that an excess of fluorine element has changed the original structure of the electrolyte.

In order to further research the quantitative elemental distribution of the sample, EDS-mapping of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 (x = 0.3) was measured and the results are presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that F element is evenly distributed in the electrolyte sample, implying that F element is successfully and uniformly doped in the structure of the electrolyte. In addition, the other compositional elements Al, Zr, Nb, P and O are also homogeneously distributed in the sample which proves that the sintered pellets are uniform in texture.

Fig. 5 shows a series of representative electrochemical impedance spectra of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x samples measured at 500 °C along with the corresponding equivalent circuits. For a typical Nyquist plot, an arc is observed at the high frequency region and a tail at the low frequency region which are ascribed to grain boundary resistance and the electrode interface diffusion resistance, respectively [45]. The arc which represents the grain resistance is not observed due to the limitation of frequency range of the frequency analyzer [46]. Thus, the separate contributions from the grain and grain boundary cannot be distinguished. The grain boundary resistance is regarded as total resistance [47], [48]. The similar results are also obtained at different temperatures.

Based on equivalent circuits (Fig. 5E), the experimental data are fitted. The parameter, Rg is the grain bulk resistances. The parameters, Rgb and CPEgb, represent the resistance and capacitance of grain boundary, respectively. The parameters, Re and CPEe, correspond to the effect of the electrode interface diffusion process. It is clearly seen that the experimental data are almost consistent with the fitted results. The conductivities for (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x (x = 0.1–0.4) were calculated using the fitted results. Fig. 6 shows the influence of F content on the conductivities of the samples at 500 °C. As a bench-mark, the conductivity of pure (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 reported in literature [1] is presented as well. It can be seen that the conductivity increases monotonously with the fluorine content increasing from 0 to 0.6. The (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 (x = 0.3) electrolyte shows the highest conductivity among the series, which can be attributed to the expansion of lattice volume, increasing of the sample density and decrease of impurity phase. When the fluorine content increases to 0.8, the conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.6F0.8 (x = 0.4) decreases and is lower than that of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 (x = 0.3), which is possibly caused by the increasing of a second phase.

Fig. 7 depicts the Al3+ ion conductivities of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) dependence on the temperatures with the data of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 as a comparison. The good linear relationships between temperatures and conductivities are observed in the range of 300–700 °C, which follow the Arrhenius equation. The enhancement of conductivities of the samples is achieved by fluorine doping. It can be suggested that the expansion of the lattice volume [14], [49] and bulk density [50] is beneficial to the improvement of conductivity. Furthermore, since the charge number of F- ion is smaller than that of O2- ion, the electrostatic interactions between the Al3+ and the surrounding counter-anions will be reduced after F- ion is introduced to the O2- site of the electrolyte, which make the conduction of Al3+ in the electrolytes easier. When x is 0.3, the sample ((Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6) shows the highest conductivity of 1.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 500 °C, which is approximately 7.9 times higher than that of pure (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12. When fluorine content is further increased to 0.8, the conductivity of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.6F.8 (x = 0.4) decreases, which may be related to the increase of NbPO5 with a quite low conductivity (about 10−6 S cm−1 at 500 °C) [7].

Based on Arrhenius equation, the conduction activation energies of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x series are calculated from the slopes. The activation energies are 49.1, 48.9, 48.4 and 51.3 kJ/mol for the samples with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. Compared with the undoped sample with an activation energy of 52.8 kJ/mol, all the F- ion doped samples have lower activity energy, suggesting that the improvement of Al3+ migration in the electrolytes is realized by F doping. O2- and F- have the similar ionic radius and electronegativity. However, for the charge balance, one O2- ion should be substituted by two F- ions. Therefore, the volume of PO4-xF2x is larger than that of PO4, leading to larger channel, which is beneficial for the Al3+ migration.

To check the contribution from the electronic conduction, the potentiostatic polarization was used to determine the electronic conductivities of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 sample at different temperatures. A typical chronoamperogram of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 (x = 0.3) with a static polarized potential of 100 mV at 500 °C is presented in Fig. 8. It can be clearly seen that after applying a polarization potential, the electrical current values are rapidly decreased and reach a steady state value within 5 s, and then retain that steady value. The ion transference number can be calculated according to the electronic conductivities obtained from the potentiostatic polarization measurement results [51] and the total conductivities from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ion transference numbers of (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 sample at different temperatures are listed in Table 2. Obviously, the ionic transference numbers measured at all temperatures for electrolyte (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F.6 are more than 0.99, implying that only Al3+ ion can migrate in the electrolytes and the electronic conductivity can be neglected. Finally, the (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 electrolyte is selected as electrolyte to develop a NH3 sensor with In2O3 sensing electrode. Fig. 9 shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the sensor. It can be seen that the thickness of the porous layer and sensing electrode are about 20 and 10 µm, respectively.

The sensing performance of the sensor with (Al0.2Zr0.8)20/19NbP3O11.7F0.6 electrolyte and In2O3 sensing electrode toward NH3 was tested at different operating temperature. Fig. 10 shows the response-recovery curves of the sensor operated at 200–350 °C when NH3 concentration was controlled at the range of 100–400 ppm. It can be seen that the sensor shows excellent response-recovery capability without baseline shift, indicating that the sensor possesses a good reversibility. The response signals depend on the operating temperatures. For example, the sensing signals of the sensor to 300 ppm NH3 at 200, 250, 300 and 350 °C are 76.6, 79.4, 76.3 and 69.6 mV, respectively. The sensor operated at 250 °C shows the largest response signal as well as the best response-recovery ability. Furthermore, the response time defined as a time to reach 90% steady value is 4 min and recovery time defined as a time to return 10% baseline value is 10.9 min at 250 °C, which is the shortest among above four temperatures.

The response signal is defined as ΔEMF = EMFs-EMFb, where EMFs and EMFb are responding potential values of the sensor in sample gas and background gas, respectively. The relationship between ΔEMFs and the logarithm of NH3 concentrations is presented in Fig. 11. The response signals increase with the increase of NH3 concentrations and depend linearly on the logarithm of NH3 concentrations at all temperatures. Based on the slopes of the curves, the sensitivities of the sensor at 200, 250, 300 and 350 °C are 83.73, 99.71, 92.50 and 99.44 mV/decade, respectively. The sensor operated at 250 °C displays the highest sensitivity and the best linear relationship between response signal ΔEMFs and the logarithm of NH3 concentrations. Considering the results from Fig. 10, Fig. 11, the optimal operating temperature for the sensor is found to be 250 °C.

Stability of sensor response is one of important properties for a sensor. To evaluate the stability of the sensor, the sensor was exposed in sample gas with alternately changing NH3 concentration between 300 and 400 ppm at 250 °C. As shown in Fig. 12A, the response EMFs kept steady values during 4 cycle measurements, thus the sensor can be deemed to show a good stability during the test of varying concentrations. Fig. 12B displays the response-recovery curve by stepwise varying the NH3 content from 100 to 400 ppm and in the reverse direction at 250 °C. With the increasing/decreasing of the concentration of NH3, a continuous and renewable response signal is detected which indicates that the sensor possesses a fairly good reproducibility as well.

Selectivity is another important factor for industrial application. Thus, the cross-sensitivities of the sensor with In2O3 as sensing electrode to a few typically co-existent gases such as CO2, CH4, H2 and NO2 were examined at 250 °C and the results are shown in Fig. 13. It can be clearly seen that there are almost negligible changes in response signal when 1000 ppm CO2, CH4 or H2 was introduced into the testing gas containing 300 ppm NH3. It should be noted that the concentration of CO2, CH4 and H2 are 3.3 times higher than NH3. However, when injecting 300 ppm NO2 into the testing gas containing 300 ppm NH3, the response value is influenced seriously. As a consequence, the response sensor emf value increases by1.7 times. That is, NO2 gas results in a positive interference to the response of the sensor. A method to minimize or avoid the sensor cross-sensitivity to NO2 needs further research in the future work.

For the sensor based on Al3+ ion conducting solid electrolyte (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 and In2O3 sensing electrode, the following plausible reactions are suggested to occur at the interface between the sensing electrode and (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 and at the interface between the Pt reference electrode and (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6.

The proposed mechanism shows that the reactions are involved in 3 electron process. If the sensor follows Nernstian response, according to Nernst equation the calibrated sensitivities of the sensor should be 31.3, 34.6, 37.9 and 41.2 mV/decade at 200, 250, 300 and 350 °C, respectively. However, the measured sensor sensitivities are 83.7, 99.7, 92.5 and 99.4 mV/decade at 200, 250, 300 and 350 °C, respectively, seriously deviating from Nernstian behavior and further verifying that the response of the sensor follows mixed-potential mechanism. However, the sensing mechanism of the present electrochemical device still needs further investigation.

A series of novel Al3+ ion conducting electrolytes (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12-xF2x with NASICON structure was successfully prepared by the solid-state method. F doping can effectively enhance the material electrochemical performance. Among the material series, (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 (x = 0.3) was found to possess the highest electrical conductivity. Its conductivity at 500 °C is 7.9 times more than that of (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O12 and the ion transference numbers reach 0.999 at 300–700 °C. The mixed-potential type sensor based on (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 electrolyte exhibits excellent sensing performances to NH3 at 200–350 °C, including high sensitivity, good stability and reproducibility. The sensitivity of the sensor reaches 99.71 mV/decade at 250 °C. The sensor also shows excellent anti-interference capability towards CO2, CH4 and H2, except for NO2. How to eliminate second phase NbPO5 in (Al0.2Zr0.8)4/3.8NbP3O11.7F0.6 and avoid cross-sensitivity of the sensor to NO2 needs further research in a future work.
