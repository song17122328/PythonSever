In this work, we report a detailed temperature dependent inelastic light scattering study on a solid electrolyteLiZr1.9Al0.1(PO4)3 as a function of temperature, from 20 °C to 400 °C, in a wide spectral range of 60 - 1250 cm-1. Weobserved a clear signature of structural phase transition around ~ 220 °C marked by the renormalization of the phononfrequencies and integrated intensity.
The phonon modes frequencies above the transition temperature showed nearlytemperature independent behaviour reflecting the disordered nature of the phase transition.
Our detailed analysis of the temperature dependent Raman studies provide a clear evidence for the structural phasetransition, which is disordered in nature, via the anomalies found in the phonon frequencies in almost all the observedmodes and their integrated intensity.
The phase transition temperature decreases from 300 °C in parent compound,LiZr2(PO4)3, to ~ 220 °C in 10% Al-doped system.
The decrease in transition temperature is ~ 25 %.
