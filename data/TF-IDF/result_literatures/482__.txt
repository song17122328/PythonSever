for  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 were prepared with solid-state method at 900 °C for 7 h. In this paper,  we have studied the property of Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 solid electrolyte systems with various  numbers of Al replaced Ti. The highest total electrical conductivity of the sintered pellets for  Li1.45Al0.45Ge0.2Ti1.35(PO4)3 at 25 °C was 1.0×10-3 S/cm, which has NASICON-type crystalline  structure without impurity phase. And the sintered pellet as x=0.45 in Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  systems  also  has  highest  relative  density  of  95.6%  and  highest  three-point  strength  of  90  N  mm-2, respectively. 

Rechargeable  lithium-air  battery  is  a  promising  power  for  electric  vehicles,  because  its  theoretical  energy density is much higher than that of traditional batteries and the cost of materials is lower [1, 2].  Up  to  now,  the  two  types  of  lithium-air  batteries  widely  studied  and  reported  by  researcher  are  non-aqueous  lithium-air  battery  and  aqueous  lithium-air  battery  respectively.  Although  the  energy  density of the lithium-air battery in the aqueous system is lower than that of the non-aqueous battery, it  can overcome the defects of the non-aqueous lithium-air battery, such as the corrosion of Li metal by  the water and carbon dioxide in the open air environment, the precipitate of the reaction products with  high  resistance  in  the  discharge  process  and  the  high  polarization  of  the  Li2O2.  In  the  lithium-air  battery  of  aqueous  system,  due  to  the  violent  reflection  of  the  lithium  metal  in  the  water  solution,  a  solid  electrolyte  of  lithium  ion  conductor  is  needed  as  the  protective  layer  to  isolate  the  lithium  electrode from the aqueous electrolyte and the external environment [3, 4]. 

At present, the electrolytes widely studied by researcher mainly have polysulfide, perovskite-type  (Li3xLa2/3-xB1/3-2xTiO3),  garnet-type  (Li7La2Zr2O12),  LISICON,  NASICON,  wherein,  NASICON-type  solid  electrolyte  not  just  have  high  lithium-ion  conductivity  but  also  exhibit  water-stable  and  lowest  activation energy for lithium-ion migration [5, 6]. In1976, Goodenough designed a three-dimensional  network  structure  possessed  suitable  channels  for  sodium-ion  migration  and  called  this  system  fast  Na-ion  conductor  [7].  The  structure  of  NASICON-type  electrolyte  is  formed  of  PO4  tetrahedron  and  MO6 octahedron linked by their corners. The Li ions occupy two positions in conduction channels, one  M1 sits are full occupied by Li ion, but M2 sits are holes and when Ti ion by substitution of trivalent  ion  the  M2  sits  start  to  be  filled  Li  ion  [8,  9].  

NASICON-type electrolyte is speculated along M1-M2-M1 sites. The conductivity of NASICON-type  electrolyte maybe is related to ionic concentration and migration rate, M2 sites filled with Li ion by the  way of the trivalent ion replaced Ti site can open the bottleneck width [10]. 

In  1990,  Aono  reported  tetravalence  Ti4+  in  LiTi2(PO4)3  system  partially  was  replaced  by  the  trivalent  ion  such  as  Al3+,  Cr3+,  Ga3+,  Fe3+,  Sc3+,  In3+,  Lu3+,  Y3+,  and  La3+  and  found  that  the  conductivity  of  Li1+xMxTi2-x(PO4)3  system  can  be  enhanced  and  the  highest  conductivity  of  7×10-4  S/cm  was  observed  in  room  temperature  when  x=0.3  and  M  is  Al  or  Sc.  The  result  of  enhanced  conductivity was mainly attributed to the grain boundary rather than bulk boundary [11, 12]. All the  time,  researchers  have  been  trying  to  improve  the  grain  boundary  conductivity  of  NASICON  solid  electrolytes  by  replacing  the  sites  of  crystal  structure  in  the  LiTi2(PO4)3  system  by  the  alternative  valence  ions.  The  NASICON  type  NASICON  electrolyte  Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  (LATP)  [13]  and  Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) [14] ceramics obtained by the substitution of Al3+ and Ge3+ for Ti4+ have  the  higher  conductivity  of  10-4  S/cm,  which  greatly  reduces  the  grain  boundary  impedance  of  the  electrolyte. Especially for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte, the conductivity of the sample reached  4.62×10-4  S/cm  [14],  but  the  preparation  of  LAGP  was  complex,  the  mechanical  strength  of  the  samples  was  low  and  the  germanium  salt  was  expensive.  Maddonado-Manso  et  al.  reported  that  the  solid electrolyte Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (LAGTP) samples were obtained by Al3+ partial substitution  of  Ti4+  in  the  LAGP  system.  The  substitution  of  Al3+  made  the  mechanical  strength  and  electrical  conductivity  of  the  precursor  of  Li1.4Al0.4GexTi1.6-x(PO4)3  synthesized  by  sol-gel  method,  the  pellets  were  sintered  at  900  °C  for  11  h  and the maximal total conductivity of sintered pellet for Li1.4Al0.4GexTi1.6-x(PO4)3 was 1.3×10-3 S/cm at  25 °C when x=0.2 [16].  Additionally, The LAGTP composite film  modified with epoxy resin as the  protective  film  of  lithium  metal  electrode  in  the  aqueous  lithium-air  battery  not  only  avoid  water  penetration  completely,  but  also  show  good  chemical  stability  in  the  saturated  solution  of  LiCl  and  LiOH, and have a high conductivity of 5.26×10-4 S/cm at room temperature [17]. Xu also have studied  the  Li1.4Al0.4GexTi1.6-x(PO4)3  glass  ceramics  prepared  by  solid-state  method  and  obtained  highest  conductivity  of  6.12×10-4  S/cm  at  room  temperature  [18].  In  this  paper,  we  prepared  the  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  solid  electrolyte  by  the  solid-state  method  and  studied  their  physical  and  electro-chemical characteristics. 

The  precursor  of  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  was  prepared  with  conventional  solid-state  method.  Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, TiO2, GeO2, Al2O3, and NH4H2PO4 were ball-milled with Zirconia  balls  in  a  zirconia  vessel  for  2  h  at  400  rpm  by  high-energy  mechanical  milling  (HEMM)  with  a  planetary  micro  mill  after  adding  alcohol.  The  obtained  mixed  powders  were  pressed  into  pellets  at  150MPa and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h, then the obtained products were added alcohol for ball milling  by  HEMM  for  4  h  after  the  pellets  were  reground  and  press  into  pellets  at  150MPa.  The  obtained  pellets were sintered at 900 °C for 4 h. After that, the pellets were finely powdered in an agate mortar  and the powder was added alcohol for ball milling for 12 h. Finally, the powder was made tablets and  sintered at 900 °C for 7 h. 

The  phases  analysis  was  operated  by  a  Rigaku  Rint  2500  diffractometer  with  Cu  Kα  radiation  in  the  2θ  range from  10°  to  90°  at  a  scanning  step  rate  of  0.02°/s  as  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  analysis.  The relative densities of Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 pellets were measured by calculating the the ratio of  theoretical  densities  and  actual  measurement  densities.  The  samples  both  side  were  sputtered  a  thin  gold layer as electrodes, then the electrical conductivity of pellets with sputtered gold electrodes were  measured  by  an  impedance  phase  analyzer  in  the  frequency  range  of  0.1  Hz-1  MHz  with  the  bias  voltage at 10mV. The bulk and grain boundray conductivity of samples were calculated from complex  plots by Zview 2. Three-point bending strength of LATP samples was measured at room temperature  by a materials tester (Shimadzu EX-SX 500 N). The obtained dates for different x were compared and  discussed. 

Figure  1  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  the  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  (x=0.4,  0.45,  0.5  and  0.55)  pellets  sintered at 900 °C for 7 h. In the condition x=0.55, the many impurity phases such as AlPO4, LiGe2O7,  LiGe2(PO4)3 and GeP2O7 were observed and x=0.5, just the impurity phases of Li3PO4 were observed,  however  the  samples  are  pure  for  lattice  structure  when  x=0.4  and  0.45.  All  diffraction  lines  of  the  samples  sintered  at  900  °C  for  7  h  were  accordance  with  the  NASICON-type  structure.  In  previous  study, Xu reported LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 phases were observed in LiGe1-xTix(PO4)3 specimens  and no new peak appear, but when x ≥ 0.5 AlPO4 impurity phase began to appear [18].   

Figure 2 shows the changes of the lattice parameters with x for Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 pellets at  room temperature. With x from 0.4 to 0.45, the lattice parameter of a was increased from 0.848 Å to  0.877 Å but the lattice parameter of c was decreased from 2.09 Å to 1.99 Å. However, when x > 0.45  the lattice parameters of a and c were all decreased. Aono found the lattice parameters were decreased  with increasing x in Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 systems, this result is attributed to the substitution of Al3+ with  smaller ionic radius (0.53nm) for Ti4+ with larger ionic radius (0.605nm) [11]. However, the changes  of  the  lattice  parameters  for  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  systems  are  not  fit  with  this  description  of  preceding part, it is inferred that the exist of two phases in Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 [16, 18]. 

Figure  3  shows  the  relative  densities  of  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3  series  pellets  sintered  at  900  °C  for  7  h  with different  x.  The  relative  densities  of  sintered  pellets  were  increased  with  x  until  x=0.45  and  start  to  decline.  The  highest  relative  density  of  sintered  pellet  is  95.6%  when  x=  0.45,  which  is  higher the relative density of 94.4% for LAGTP pellets synthesized by sol-gel method and Shang also  reported the highest relative density of 95.5% for LAGTP pellets by solid-state method [16, 19].   

J. Fu synthesized Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP) pellets by conventional melt-quenching method, and  deeply  studied  the  ionic  conductivity  of  LATP  pellets.  The  bulk  resistance  and  grain  boundary  resistance  of  LATP  pellets  could  be  obtained  by  the  analysis  of  EIS  graph,  the  intercept  of  the  semicircle  on  the  real  axis  at  high  frequency  represents  the  bulk  resistance,  the  diameter  of  the  semicircle  indicates  the  grain  boundary  resistance  [20].  Figure  4  shows  the  complex  impedance  profiles of samples for Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 synthesized with solid-state method as a function of x  at 25°C. Only one large semicircle was observed and a straight line follow it. It’s consistent with the  research of J. Fu. The exist of semicircle is because of grain boundaries, the impedance plots would be  managed  a  suitable  equivalent  circuit  consist  of  two  parallel  combination  of  resistance,  capacitance  and  constant  phase  element  for  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 were increased until x=0.45, it is that due to the substitute of Al3+ for Ti4+ in  Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 systems would open the bottleneck width [10]. After x ≥0.45, the increasing grain  boundary impedance of sintered pellets maybe contribute to the appearance of impurity phase from the  inference of XRD patterns. 

Aono  et  al  referred  that  one  of  important  effect  for  conductivity  of  Lil+xMxTi2-x(PO3)4  system  is  attribution  total  conductivities  of  Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 as a function of the substitute content of Al3+ for Ti4+, the variation trend is  same with Figure 3, our experimental data fit with the the consequence of Aono [15]. The highest total conductivity  of  1.0×10-3  S/cm  were  observed  for  Li1.45Al0.45Ge0.2Ti1.35(PO4)3  at  x=0.45.  Previously,  Maddonado-Manso  for  Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3 series.  The  highest  conductivity  of  1.3×10-3  S/cm  was  measured  at  25°C  for  Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3 pellets synthesized by sol-gel method when x=0.2 and y=0.4 by Zhang [16],  which is slightly higher than been this sample prepared by solid-state method. 

Figure  6  shows  the  three-point  bending  strength  of  Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3  pellets  prepared  by  solid-state  method  related  to  x  at  25°C  [17].  The  maximum  bending  strength  of  90  N  mm-2  was  measured for Li1.45Al0.45Ge0.2Ti1.35(PO4)3, which is higher than the maximum bending strength of 65 N  mm-2 for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 films prepared by sol-gel method by Zhang. 

The  precursor  of  water-stable  lithium-ion  conducting  solid  electrolyte  Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3  series  prepared  by  solid-state  method,  the  pressure  forming  pellets  were  sintered  at  900  °C  for  7  h.  the  highest  conductivity  of  1.0×10-3  S/cm  for  Li1.45Al0.45Ti1.35Ge0.2(PO4)3  was  obtained  at  25  °C  and  the  sample  was  the  purity  phase  by  XRD  pattern  analysis  as  x=0.45,  the  lattice  parameters  a  and  c  of  Li1.45Al0.45Ti1.35Ge0.2(PO4)3  are  0.877  Å  and  1.990  Å,  respectively.  A  three-point  bending  strength  of  90  N  mm-2  was  measured  and  the  relative  density  was  95.6%  for  Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3  sintered  pellet  at  25°C.  The  NASICON-type  LAGTP  sintered  pellets  prepared  by  solid-state  method  have  a  approximative  lithium-ion  conducting  property  and  better  mechanical  strength  contrasted  with  the  NASICON-type LAGTP prepared by sol-gel method and melt-quenching  method, but the solid-state  method  has  the  advantage  of  simple  preparation  process,  low  cost  and  easy  to  mass  production  for  practical application. The LAGTP samples prepared by conventional solid-state method have highlight  performance for promising candidate of solid electrolyte in the Li-S battery, all-solid-state battery and  Li-air battery application.
