Langbeinite-type Ba3V4(PO4)6 has been crystallized from a stoichiometric melt starting from Ba(PO3)2 and V2O3. The crystal structure has been re®ned from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. It consists of a vanadato(III)±phosphate network [V4(PO4)6]6 255), which shows some resemblance to the NASICON structure type. A new method is presented for the visualization of this structural relationship. The single-crystal electronic spectrum of yellow±green Ba3V4(PO4)6 shows the absorption bands typical for the octahedral chromophore [VIIIO6].
In projections of the cubic langbeinite structure along and perpendicular to [111], one can recognize columns built from [VO6] and [PO4] groups having a translational period of one cube diagonal. Within these columns, anionic [V2(PO4)9]21 255) building units and cationic [V6(PO4)3]9+ units alternate, giving to these columns an overall composition [V8(PO4)12]12 255)or [V4(PO4)6]6 255). Perpendicular to [111], these columns are linked by VÐOÐP bridges. Relative to the central column, adjacent columns are shifted 1 2 of the translational period along [111]. In contrast the presence of the [V6(PO4)3]9+ units in the langbeinite structure allows formation of voids large enough to house cations of much bigger size than Na+. The electronic spectrum of Ba3V4(PO4)6 shows transitions at 14 100 cm 255)1 (3T1g ! 3T2g) and 21 900 cm 255)1 [3T1g ! 3T2g(P)]. 
Modelling of the transition energies within the framework of the angular overlap model (Jùrgensen et al., 1963; Richardson, 1993; Figgis & Hitchman, 2000) leads to good agreement with the observed transitions [B = 596 cm 255)1, C/B = 4.8, e 27)(mean) = 7750 cm 255)1, e 25) = 1 4e 27)] . The resulting bonding parameters compare well with those of VP3SiO11 (Droû, 2004), V(PO3)3, V4P6Si2O25 and V4(P2O7)3 (Glaum, 1999), which have been derived in earlier studies.
Crystals of Ba3V4(PO4)6 were grown by melting a homogenized mixture of Ba(PO3)2 (150 mg, 0.5071 mmol) and V2O3 (50.67 mg, 0.3381 mmol) in a platinum crucible in air. The melt [Tm = 1373 (20) K] was rapidly heated, using an electrical furnace, to 1473 K, kept at that temperature for 1 h, cooled to 1073 K at a rate of 10 K h 255)1 and ®naly to room temperature at a rate of 50 K h 255)1. After removing the crucible from the oven, the recrystallized melt was crushed and crystal fragments of the title compound were obtained. Microcrystalline single-phase powders were obtained from pellets (size 4  2) 4  2) 12 mm) of the starting materials Ba(PO3)2 and V2O3 after heating for 3 d at 1323 K in sealed silica tubes (L = 10 cm and D = 1.6 cm) in the presence of 30 mg iodine as mineralizer. Subsequent heating for 21 d yielded small yellow±green crystals of irregular shape.
Quaternary diphosphates AMIIP2O7 (A: Ca, Sr, Ba; MII: Mg, Cr±Zn) allow stabilization of transition metals in comparatively low oxidation states [e.g. Cr2+: CaCrP2O7 (Maaû et al., 2001), SrCrP2O7 (Maaû & Glaum, 2000), BaCrP2O7 (Maaû et al., 2001); Fe2+: CaFeP2O7 (Maaû, 2002), SrFeP2O7 (le Meins & Courbion, 1999), BaFeP2O7 (Maaû, 2002)]. See El Bali et al. (2001) and Maaû (2002) for a complete survey of the AMIIP2O7 family.
Aiming at the synthesis of BaVIIP2O7, we obtained Ba3V4(PO4)6. This quaternary orthophosphate belongs to the large langbeinite (Zemann & Zemann, 1957) structure family. In addition to several sulfates (Speer & Salje, 1986; Moriyoshi & Itoh, 1996; Guelylah, Breczewski & Madariaga, 1996; Guelylah, Madariaga & Breczewski, 1996), many phosphates A2M2(PO4)3 (A: alkali or alkaline earth metal, M: trior tetravalent transition metal or rare earth metal) (Battle et al., 1986, 1988; Norberg, 2002; Albina et al., 2003) and one ¯uoroberyllate K2Mn2(BeF4)3 (Guelylah, Breczewski & Madariaga, 1996) belong to this structure family.
The crystal structure of Ba3V4(PO4)6 might be rationalized as a vanadato(III)±phosphate network [V4(PO4)6]6 255) with Ba2+ ions in interstices for charge balance. Taking into account all O atoms closer to Ba than the nearest cation, 12-fold coordination is observed for Ba1 with a rather irregularly shaped coordination polyhedron, while Ba2 forms nine bonds; in this case, the coordination polyhedron might be described as a triply capped octahedron (Fig. 1). The crystal structure of Ba3V4(PO4)6 is just one of a few examples of a langbeinitetype compound with incomplete occupation of the A sites [compare with K2 255)xTi2(PO4)6 (Leclaire et al., 1989)].
The lattice parameters were re®ned with the program SOS (Soose, 1980), using 29 re¯ections from an image plate Guinier photograph. Site-occupation factors for Ba1 and Ba2 have been re®ned with and without a restraint on their sum; both results are identical within standard uncertainty [with SUMP: s.o.f.(Ba1) = 0.772 (2), s.o.f.(Ba2) = 0.727 (2); without SUMP: s.o.f.(Ba1) = 0.776 (4), s.o.f.(Ba2) = 0.732 (4)]. The maximum and minimum electron-density peaks are located 0.67 and 0.62 AÊ , respectively from Ba2..
