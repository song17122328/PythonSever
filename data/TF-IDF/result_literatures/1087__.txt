The oxysulfate TiOSO4 has been prepared by an easy soft chemistry method based on the dissolution of metallic titanium in sulfuric ◦ C. First member of the phosphate tungsten-type bronze family, this oxysulfate, whose structure offers empty pentagonal acid at 170 + tunnels, is shown to intercalate up to 0.9 Li per formula unit (f.u) and 0.8 Na/f.u. at an average voltage of 2.45 V vs Li /Li and + 2.12 V vs Na /Na, respectively. The intercalation/deintercalation process is reversible according to a solid solution mechanism. Its comparison with the titanium Nasicon shows that it exhibits a similar redox voltage, but a signiﬁcantly larger reversible capacity + /Na after 20 cycles. The open structure of this material, its low cost, and its easy of 120 mAh/g vs Li synthesis, pave the way to the investigation of other transition metal oxysulfates for the realization of electrodes for rechargeable sodium ion batteries.

The electrochemical performance of the TiOSO4 phase was characterized using Swagelok-type cells.20 The positive electrodes were prepared by mixing of 75 wt% active material and 20 wt% of Super P carbon with 5 wt% polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PVDF). All electrodes contained about 5–6 mg of active material (4.5–5.2 mg/cm2). Cells were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glove box with Li-metal as the negative electrode for Li ion cell and Na-metal as a negative electrode for Na ion cell. Two WhatmanGF/D borosilicate glass ﬁbre sheets were used as the separator. For the electrolyte, used 1 M LiClO4 in PC for Li ion cell and 1 M NaClO4 in PC for Na ion cell where shown to give good results. The charge-discharge characteristics were examined at + /Li and room temperature over a voltage range of 2.0 to 3.5 V vs. Li + 1.0 to 3.25 vs. Na /Na at a constant rate of C/100 (corresponding to a theoretical exchange of one electron per formula during charging or discharging for 100 h). The electrochemical studies were carried out at room temperature (RT) using a VMP II potentiostat/galvanostat (Biologic SA, Claix, France). For ex situ XRD studies electrodes were fabricated without PVDF using approximately 100 mg of active material. The Swagelok cells were assembled as described previously. The cells were discharged and charged to various C-rates. After the experiment the cells were dismantled in glove box and powder was collected.

The association of PO4 tetrahedra to transition metal MO6 octahedra has allowed numerous mixed frameworks to be generated, involving large tunnels and cages susceptible to host univalent cations (see for a review ref.1). Several of these oxy-phosphates were revealed to be of high interest for the investigation of electrode materials for Li/Na ion batteries.2–7 In contrast, in the M-S-O systems the association of SO4 tetrahedra to MO6 octahedra is not so easy. As a result, the number of oxysulfates involving an open framework which exhibit electrochemical intercalation is quite limited. Besides the hydroxysulfates, only ﬁve anhydrous sulfates were reported to exhibit Li or Na 12 with the intercalation. Both sulfates Fe2(SO4)3 Nasicon type structure were shown to intercalate sodium. Interestingly the iron phase was revealed recently to be an attractive cathode + material with a 3.2 V potential vs Na /Na and stability over 400 cycles,11 whereas the titanium phase was shown to be an excellent /f.u. leading anode material with a reversible intercalation of 1.7 Na to a capacity of 120 mAh/g at an average potential of 1.5 V.12 Two 14 were recently other iron sulfates, Li2Fe(SO4)2 reported as electrode materials. The ﬁrst one exhibits Li/Na intercalation, but with a reversible capacity lower than 100 mAh/g, whereas the second shows electrochemical insertion of 1.6 lithium atoms at an 15 /Li. A titanium oxysulfate, TiOSO4 average voltage of 3.0 V vs Li was also found to exhibit insertion/de-insertion of 0.9 Li/f.u. at an + average potential of 2.4 V vs Li.

Considering the orthorhombic crystal structure of TiOSO415 (Fig. 1), built up of corner-sharing SO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra, we believe that it should be possible to intercalate sodium in such a matrix.

The latter is indeed isotypic to the ﬁrst member, WOPO4 of the phosphate tungsten bronze structural family (PO2)4(WO3)2m whose ReO3-type layers are connected through PO4 tetrahedra forming empty pentagonal tunnels.18 We have thus carried out a detailed study of electrochemical lithium and sodium intercalation in the oxysulfate TiOSO4. We show that this compound can intercalate lithium and sodium, leading to the oxysulfates Li0.86TiOSO4 and Na0.77TiOSO4 with an excellent reversibility, giving back the sulfates Li0.21TiOSO4 and Na0.19TiOSO4.

X ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was performed with a Bruker D8 diffractometer, using a capillary sample geometry and a Philips X’Pert diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano geometry (CuKα1,2 radiation). 

TiOSO4 was synthesized through a simple reaction of metallic titanium (200 mg) in concentrated sulfuric acid ◦ H2SO4 (50 mL, 12 mol/L). The solution was ﬁrst heated at 170 C for C for 6 hours. It is worth pointing out 24 hours and subsequently at 300 that such a soft chemistry method is very efﬁcient to easily generate thermodynamically stable new phases with an opened framework (see for review).21 The light yellow precipitate is then washed with water ◦ C. A pure phase is obtained, whose X-ray and dried overnight at 100 diffraction pattern (Fig. 2a) was indexed in the Pnma space group, with a = 10.956(1) Å, b = 5.150(1) Å and c = 6.433(1) Å, as previously reported by Gatehouse et al.15 A 300 nm cube-type morphology is observed (Fig. 2b), which attests of its excellent crystallization.

The voltage-composition proﬁles of TiOSO4 for the ﬁrst cycle obtained at C/50 rate and the corresponding derivative curve are reported on Figure 3a . On the ﬁrst /Li leading to a discharge, 0.9 lithium are inserted at 2.45 V vs Li capacity of 150 mAh/g and 0.7 lithium are reversibly extracted and inserted in the further cycles. Similarly Figure 3b shows the voltage composition proﬁle of sodium insertion in to TiOSO4, on ﬁrst dis/Na leading to a charge, 0.9 sodium was inserted at 2.12 V vs Na capacity of 150 mAh/g and 0.65 sodium were reversibly extracted and inserted in the further continuous cycle at a reversible capacity of 108 mAh/g.

To get insight into the lithium/sodium insertion mechanism into TiOSO4, we have performed PITT (Potentiodynamic Intermittent Titration Technique) and ex situ XRD studies. The PITT curves of TiOSO4 for the ﬁrst cycle are shown in Figure 4. The sloping proﬁle of the potential together with the broad peak on the derivative curves (inset Figure 3a–3b) indicate that the electrochemical process is a solid solution for both lithium and sodium insertion. It can be clearly seen that during the ﬁrst discharge with an equivalent galvanic rate of C/100, an exponential decay of the current is observed for all the potential steps in the potential window 1.5–3.5 V; such a behavior conﬁrms the solid solution mechanism.22 Thus, from the current response, we could access to the diffusion coefﬁcient of lithium and sodium ions. −14 cm2/s, The calculated lithium diffusion coefﬁcient is about 4.8.10 23 and also in the and it is consistent with values obtained for LiFePO4 tavorite type phase LiFeSO4F.24 The sodium diffusion coefﬁcient is −15 cm2/s. It is also worth noting that as the particle found to be 5.010 size is relatively large and TiOSO4 insulating, we used ball milling process for 1 hour with 20 Wt% of acetylene black to ﬁnally reach an average particle size of 200 nm and for the calculation we assumed that particles are spherical. Thus, the theoretical speciﬁc capacity (167 mAh/g) can be approached at C/100 rate (molecular weight of TiOSO4 M = 160 g/mol, Q = 26.8/M = 167 mAh/g for one lithium inserted). However, as the C rate is increasing, the amount of lithium and sodium inserted is decreasing: 0.9 Li (150 mAh/g), 0.8 Li (134 mAh/g) and 0.68 Li (113 mAh/g) are inserted in the ﬁrst discharge at C/100, C/50 and C/10 rates, respectively. Similarly 0.9 Na (150 mAh/g), 0.8 Na (134 mAh/g) and 0.65 Na (108 mAh/g) are inserted during the ﬁrst discharge. The cycling behavior of the cells cycled at C/20 rates is reported on Figure + /Li and 100 mAh/g vs 5: a reversible capacity of 120 mAh/g vs Li + /Na after 20 cycles. Aside from an initial capacity loss, all the Na cells show a stable cycling behavior for the 20 ﬁrst cycles.

Even though, there is a large difference in the initial discharge capacities at various C rates due to kinetics limitations, during charge all cells show similar extent of irreversible capacity loss (ICL). Also, as the C rate increases, the voltage polarization is increasing. The very good stability of the material toward the cycling shows an excellent structural ﬂexibility of the material. This observation suggests that the lithium and sodium cations, whose size is smaller than the pentagonal tunnels do not dramatically distort the TiOSO4 framework during the intercalation /deintercalation process.

The a and c parameters increase from a = 10.952 Å and c = 6.430(1) Å to a = 11.125(1) Å, and c = 6.457(1) Å, respectively, whereas b decreases from 5.148 Å to 5.139 Å. It results in a slight increase of the cell volume from 362.59 Å3 to 369.15 Å3 for the insertion of 0.86 lithium. The reversibility of the insertion/extraction process is practically perfect: the lithium de-intercalation gives back the oxysulfate Li0.21TiOSO4, whose cell parameters are very close to the pristine phase (a = 10.902(1) Å, b = 5.141(1) Å, c = 6.443(1) Å). Similarly, ex situ XRD pattern taken at the end of the ﬁrst discharge, shown in Figure 7, conﬁrms that the structure of Na0.77TiOSO4 remains the same. However, it shows a signiﬁcantly larger distortion of the orthorhombic cell. The a and c parameters increase from a = 10.952 Å to a = 11.361(1) Å, and c = 6.430(1) Å to c = 6.461(1) Å, respectively; whereas b increases from 5.148 Å to 5.213 Å. It results in a slight increase of the cell volume from 362.59 Å3 to 382.65 Å3 for the insertion of 0.77 sodium. The reversibility of the insertion/extraction process is practically perfect, similar to lithium. The sodium de-intercalation gives back the oxysulfate Na0.19TiOSO4, whose cell parameters are very close to the mother phase (a = 11.011(1) Å, b = 5.163(1) Å, c = 6.444(1) Å). Note therefore the broadening of the reﬂections together with the appearance ◦ of a broad bump around 24 on the XRD patterns of the discharged and charged phases. This indicates that the distortion introduced by sodium insertion, though it does not destroy the [TiOSO4] framework, induces a partial loss of periodicity. Thus, it is most probable that sodium insertion induces a puckering of the polyhedra, keeping the TiO6 octahedra and the SO4 tetrahedra without breaking the Ti-OS and Ti-O-Ti bonds. Such phenomena are not observed in the case of lithium insertion, due to the much smaller size of lithium which does not affect the [TiOSO4] framework.

These results demonstrate the great ability of the phosphate tungsten bronze type oxysulfate TiOSO4 to intercalate/deintercalate sodium with an excellent reversibility, in spite of the signiﬁcant distortion of the structure. It is worth pointing out that the operating + potential values of 2.45 V vs Li /Na, observed for this oxysulfate values are very close to those reported for the Nasicon

Such values are consistent with the voltage calculations for the lithium insertion into the titanium oxysulredox potential fate estimated to be 2.07 V vs Li from theoretical studies based on DFT and (GGA+U) calculations.25 Importantly, the capacity of this phase of 120 mAh/g at 2.45 V vs + /Na is signiﬁcantly larger Li than for the as-synthesized Nasicon titanophosphates, whose maximum capacity was found to be of ∼ 80 mAh/g in the limit of their reversibility and could be elevated to 120 mAh/g in the case of lithium only by using a LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite.26 The investigation of other titanium oxysulfates will be necessary to determine the role of the structure in the electrochemical properties of these materials.
