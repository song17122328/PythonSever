Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3  (NVMP)  nanoparticles  uniformly  embedded  in  porous  carbon  matrix  are 

prepared  by  a  facile  solid-state  method  and  evaluated  as  a  novel  cathode  for  sodium-ion 

batteries,  delivering  fascinating  performances  in  terms  of  high  discharge  potential,  exceptional 

rate capability, and ultra-long cycling life. In situ XRD, ex situ XANES and XPS analyses reveal 

that  the  electrochemical  process  undergoes  biphasic  transition  and  single  phase  change  with  a 

relatively small volume change, accompanied by the reversible evolution of Mn2+/3+ and V3+/4+ 

redox  couples.  EIS,  CV  measurements  and  DFT  computations  illuminate  the  facilitated 

electron/ion transfer and low ionic migration energy barrier in NVMP. 

Na3V2(PO4)3  is  one  of  the  most  promising  cathodes  for  sodium-ion  batteries  (SIBs) 

due  to  its  three-dimensional  framework.  To  meet  practical  feasibility,  the  substitution  of 

vanadium  with  low-cost  active  elements  is  urgent.  Here  the  Na+  superionic  conductor 

(NASICON)-type  Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3  nanoparticles  homogeneously  embedded  in  porous 

carbon  matrix  are  prepared  and  investigated  as  a  novel  cathode  for  SIBs.  The  as-prepared 

Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C  could  deliver  a  desirable  average  discharge  potential  of  3.43  V  vs. 

Na+/Na  with  fascinating  rate  capability  of  92.7  mA  h  g-1  at  60  C  and  impressive  capacity 

retention  of  87.2%  after  4000  cycles  at  20  C.  In  situ  X-ray  diffraction  reveals  that  the 

electrochemical process undergoes highly reversible biphasic transition and single phase change 

with  a  relatively  small  volume  change  (8.21%),  ensuring  the  high  structural  stability  and 

excellent  cyclic  capability.  The  reversible  evolution  of  Mn2+/3+  and  V3+/4+  redox  couples  upon 

Na+ extraction/insertion has been revealed by the confirmation of valence state via both ex situ 

X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The superior 

performance of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 could be attributed to the high electronic/ionic conductivity 

and  low  sodium-ion  diffusion  energy  barrier,  which  is  supported  by  the  electrochemical 

impedance  spectroscopy  and  cyclic  voltammetry  measurements,  as  well  as  density  functional 

theory computations. 

Sodium-ion  batteries  (SIBs)  have  attracted  extensive  attention  owing  to  the  advantages  of  low 

cost  and  abundant  resources  over  lithium-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  [1-3].  However,  the  radius  of 

sodium (1.02 Å) is much larger than that of lithium (0.76 Å), resulting in sluggish ionic diffusion 

kinetics  associated  with  inferior  rate  capability  and  large  volume  change  correlated  with 

unsatisfactory  cycling  stability  of  the  host  materials  [4-6].  Despite  significant  achievements  in 

improving electrode/electrolyte interface transfer kinetics have been made through modification 

of electrolyte [7,8], it is still imperative to design more applicable electrode materials with high 

performance  for  SIBs  [9-11].  Recently,  tremendous  Na-storage  cathode  materials  with  open 

framework have been explored [12,13], such as layered/tunnel-type transition metal oxides [14-

17]  ,  polyanionic  compounds  [18-23],  Prussian  blue  analogues  [24,25],  and  organic  materials 

[26].  Among  them,  the  Na+  superionic  conductor  (NASICON)-type  polyanionic  phosphate 

Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  with  three-dimensional  (3D)  framework  and  large  tunnels  has  been 

recognized as one of the most promising cathode candidates for SIBs [27]. The NVP can exhibit 

a 3.3-3.4 V voltage platform and a theoretical capacity of 117 mA h g-1 [28]. Nevertheless, it still 

suffers  from  intrinsic  poor  conductivity  and  low  energy  density.  To  alleviate  these  problems, 

various strategies have been proposed, including carbon coating, nanosizing, and cation doping 

[29-31]. As well known, elevating the operating voltage of cathode materials is of great urgency 

in order to meet the practical requirement for energy  density.  Metal ion doping is an effective 

way to improve the operating voltage of NVP, and can simultaneously facilitate the migration of 

Na+. Up to date, numerous metal ions, i.e., Mg2+ [32], Cr3+ [33], Mn2+/Mn3+,  have  been  tried  for  doping  into  NVP,  of  which  the  substitution  of  vanadium  by  the 

earth-abundant  and  electrochemically  active  manganese  has  aroused  a  great  interest.  For example,  Goodenough’s  group  firstly  evaluated  the  Na-storage  behavior  of  Na4MnV(PO4)3  in 

2016, demonstrating two voltage plateaus at 3.3 V and 3.6 V that correspond to the V3+/4+ and 

Mn2+/3+ redox couples, respectively, and delivering a reversible capacity of 90 mA h g-1 at 10 C 

rate  [34].  Inspired  by  this  pioneering  work,  Jiao’s  group  reported  the  preparation  of 

Na4MnV(PO4)3@C@graphene nanocomposites via a simple sol-gel  method, which exhibited a 

high-rate capability of 60.1 mA h g-1 even at 50 C, along with a promising cycling life of 68.8% 

capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 20 C [38]. Then, Masquelier and co-workers examined the 

structural  evolution  of  Na4MnV(PO4)3  during  the  Na+  insertion/extraction.  Three  distinctive 

voltage platforms at 3.3 V, 3.6 V, and 3.9 V can be observed, when the charge cut-off voltage 

was  extended  to  4.3  V.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  synergistic  effect  of  the  V3+/5+  and  Mn2+/3+ 

multi-electron reactions [39]. In such case, an extraordinary charge capacity of 156 mAh g-1 was 

obtained  in  the  first  cycle.  Nevertheless,  there  is  a  fact  that  Na4MnV(PO4)3 suffers  from  poor 

cyclic stability with drastic capacity fading in subsequent cycles, meanwhile, the disappearance 

of the plateau at 3.9 V during cycling is also an indication of low reversibility. The undesirable 

performance could be mainly attributed to the structure failure which is associated with the Jahn-

Teller distortion of MnO6 (Mn3+) octahedra with anisotropic change of Mn-O bond length. This 

phenomenon  commonly  happens  in  most  Mn-rich  cathode  materials  [40,41].  Therefore,  it  is 

highly  desirable  but  remains  a  significant  challenge  to  develop  appropriate  Mn-doped  NVP 

cathode  materials  that  can  synchronously  enhance  the  operating  voltage  and  achieve  the  long-

term cycling stability. 

To  address  this  point,  the  present  work  introduces  a  suitable  amount  of  Mn  ion  into 

Na3V2(PO4)3  to  form  the  Na-rich  Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3  (NVMP)  cathode.  To  the  best  of  our 

knowledge, there is no report on such  material as a SIB cathode,  meanwhile, there is a strong interest  in  its  Na-storage  behavior.  Herein,  carbon-coated  Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3  nanoparticles 

(NVMP/C) were synthesized through a facile wet ball-milling process followed by a solid-state 

reaction, which could deliver an exceptional rate capability of 92.7 mA  h  g-1 at 60 C within a 

wide  voltage  window  of  2.5-4.1 V,  as  well  as  an  ultra-long  cycling  life  of  87.2%  capacity 

retention after 4000 cycles. Such  fascinating performance is outstanding  among  all the cation-

doped  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  materials  reported  so  far.  The  crystal  structure  and  atomic  site 

occupation  of  NVMP  were  determined  by  high-energy  synchrotron  X-ray  diffraction  (SXRD). 

The  phase  transition  of  NVMP  accompanied  by  the  variations  of  V3+/4+  and  Mn2+/3+  redox 

couples upon Na+ insertion/extraction has been revealed by a combination study of in Operando 

XRD,  ex  situ  X-ray  absorption  near-edge  structure  (XANES)  spectroscopy,  and  X-ray 

photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS).  In  addition,  the  Na-ion  diffusion  kinetics  and  migration 

pathways  of  the  NVMP/C  have  been  investigated  by  cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  curves  and 

density functional theory (DFT) computations. 


The Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C were prepared through wet ball-milling followed by a solid state 

reaction treatment. A typical synthesis was as follows: 0.5 mmol manganese (II) acetylacetone 

(C10H14O4Mn, Macklin, AR), 1.5 mmol vanadyl acetylacetonate (C10H14O5V, Aladdin, AR), 3.5 

mmol  sodium  acetate  (CH3COONa,  Aladdin,  AR),  3.0  mmol  ammonium  biphosphate 

(NH4H2PO4,  Aladdin,  AR),  and  0.2  g  ascorbic  acid  (C6H8O6,  Aladdin,  AR)  were  added  to  a 

mixed solution of ethanol and deionized water (Vethanol : Vwater = 2 : 1), the solution was further 

sonicated for 30 min until a homogeneous suspension formed. Subsequently, the suspension was thoroughly  mixed  by  high-energy  ball-milling  at  400  rpm  for  8  h  in  a  planetary  ball  miller 

(Fritsch Pulverisette 7). Then the mixture was dried at 80 °C for 2 h under magnetic stirring and 

further dried at 120 °C for 1 h in an electric oven, the obtained brown powder was then ground 

using  a  mortar. Afterwards, the  precursor was calcined  at 700 °C for 6 h in high-purity  argon 

atmosphere with a heating rate of 4 °C min-1. 

For  comparison,  Na3V2(PO4)3/C  was  prepared  by  the  same  method  without  the  addition  of 

manganese  acetylacetone.  Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3/C  with  lower  or  higher  carbon  content  was 

fabricated by altering the usage of ascorbic acid to 0.05 g or 0.3 g, respectively, with the other 

synthetic conditions keeping constant. The pure carbon was prepared by just calcining ascorbic 

acid at 700 °C for 6 h in high-purity argon atmosphere with a heating rate of 4 °C min-1. 


The crystal structure was characterized by high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) 

using the 11-ID-C beamline at Advanced Photon Source (APS) of Argonne National Laboratory. 

The X-ray wavelength was 0.1173 Å. Other X-ray diffraction powder patterns were collected on 

a  X-ray  diffractometer  (Panalytical  X’Pert  Pro,  Cu  Kα  radiation,  λ  =  1.5417  Å).  Nitrogen 

isotherms  were  measured  using  a  Quantochrome  Autosorb-1MP 

absorption  instrument  at  77  K.  The  morphology  of  as-prepared  materials  was  observed  by 

scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM,  ISS  SUPRA  55)  and  the  microstructure  of  samples  was 

analyzed  by  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM,  JEM  2100)  operating  at  200  KV. 

Thermogravimetric  analyses  (TGA)  were  performed  on  a  TG-DSC  analyzer  (TG,  STA409C). 

The  valence  state  was  investigated  by  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  measurements 

performed with a Kratos AXIS UltraDLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. 

For in situ XRD experiment, a special cell employing aluminum foil as current collector and 

testing  window  was  assembled  to  monitor  in  situ  reaction  during  cycling.  Each  scan  was 

collected in 0.02° increments between 18° and 40° at a scanning speed of 0.04° per second. The 

in situ cell was charged and discharged continuously without interval between every scan. 

For  ex  situ  XANES  measurement,  the  electrodes  at  different  charge/discharge  states  were 

disassembled in a glove box and carefully sealed in Capton film, in order to avoid exposure to 

air.  XANES  spectra  were  collected  on  the  1W1B  beamline  at  Beijing  Synchrotron  Radiation 

Facility  (BSRF).  All  samples  were  recorded  at  the  V  K-edge  and  Mn  K-edge  by  fluorescence 

mode. Later data processing was performed using the IFEFFIT program. 

For the construction of half-cells, the cathode was prepared by casting slurry which consists of 

active materials, super P, and CMC binder with a weight ratio of 75:15:10 using water as solvent 

on aluminum foil. Then the electrodes were dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 6 h, the average mass 

loading of active materials for each electrode was about 1.8 mg cm-2. The 2025 coin-type cells 

were  assembled  employing  Na  metal  as  counter/reference  electrode,  glass  fiber  (GF/D)  as 

separator  in  an  argon-filled  glovebox  with  H2O  and  O2  concentration  less  than  0.1  ppm.  1 M 

NaClO4 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive was used 

as  electrolyte.  The  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  measurements  were  performed  on  a  Land 

battery  testing  system  (CT2001A).  The  applied  current  densities  and  specific  capacity  values 

were calculated based on the mass of NVMP. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at various scan 

rates  (0.1-4.0  mV  s-1)  in  the  voltage  range  of  2.5  to  4.1  V,  and  electrochemical  impedance 

spectra (EIS) with the frequency from 100 kHz to 100 mHz were both recorded on a CHI660C 

electrochemical  workstation  (Chenhua,  China).  For  the  assembly  of  full  cells,  the  presodiated hard carbon attached on copper foil was adopted as the anode, and matched with the NVMP/C 

cathode.  The  active  mass  loading  of  cathode  is  three  times  of  anode  to  balance  the  capacity. 

Finally, the full cell was measured within a voltage window of 2.0-4.0 V. 


Ab-initio  investigations  based  on  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  via  Vienna  ab-initio 

simulation package (VASP) were performed to study the Na+ migration in Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3. 

The  projector  augmented  wave  (PAW)  method  with  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PBE)  function 

was used. The energy cutoff was set to 500 eV and k-point separation of 0.03 Å-1 was adopted. 

The convergence tolerance for the force and energy during relaxation were 0.01 eV/Å and 10-5 

eV,  respectively.  The  climbing  image-nudged  elastic  band  (cNEB)  method  and  bond-valence 

energy landscape (BVEL) were used to simulate the Na+ migration paths and barriers. 

The  crystal  structure  of  NVMP  was  characterized  by  high-energy  SXRD  data  which  were 

analyzed by the FullProf Suite software. As shown in Figure 1a, the Rietveld refinement results 

show that the obtained Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 crystallizes in the NASICON structure with a space 

group  of  R-3c.  A  good  agreement  between  the  calculated  pattern  and  the  collected  profile  has 

been  achieved  (Rwp  =  4.57%).  The  cell  parameters  of  NVMP  are  a  =  b  =  8.80246(5)  Å,  c  = 

21.76591(4) Å, and V = 1460.549 Å3, respectively. The detailed structure information of atomic 

site  and  occupancy  is  given  in  Table  S1  (Supporting  Information).  For  comparison, 

Na3V2(PO4)3/C  (NVP/C)  was  synthesized  by  the  same  method  as  NVMP/C.  The  detailed 

information  of  SXRD  and  Rietveld  refinement  for  NVP  is  shown  in  Figure  S1  (Supporting 

Information). It is obvious that the unit cell volume of Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 is larger than that of 

Na3V2(PO4)3, which is due to the larger radius of Mn2+ than that of V3+. As shown by the inset of 

Morphology and microstructure of NVMP/C were observed by scanning electron microscopy 

(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Figure 1b and c, the NVMP/C 

features irregular monodispersed nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 100 to 400 nm. Note that, 

the  morphology  of  NVMP  with  a  proper  carbon  content  of  7.9  wt%  displays  much  less 

agglomeration than those of other carbon contents (Figure S4, Supporting Information), which is 

more  favorable  to  the  rapid  diffusion  of  Na+.  TEM  images  in  Figure  1d  and  e  reveal  that  the 

NVMP nanoparticles are homogeneously embedded in carbon matrix, and the amorphous carbon 

layer with an average thickness of 4 nm is evenly coated on the surface of particles. The high-

resolution  TEM  (HRTEM)  image  indicates  that  the  lattice  fringe  spacing  is  about  0.38  nm, 

consistent with the (113) plane of NVMP. Additionally, the EDS mapping images in Figure 1f 

demonstrate  that  the  elements  of  C,  O,  P,  V,  Mn,  and  Na  are  uniformly  distributed  along  the 

particles framework. The EDS spectrum of NVMP/C is also provided in Figure S5 (Supporting 

Information), revealing that the atomic ratio of Na/Mn/V/P/O is approximately the stoichiometric 

configuration.  X-ray  photoelectron  spectrometry  (XPS)  of  wide-scanning  spectrum  was 

performed  (Figure  S6,  Supporting  Information)  to  gain  further  insight  into  the  chemical 

compositions of NVMP/C, and only the signals of Na, V, Mn, P, O, and C elements are detected 

without  any  other  impurities.  The  porous  characters  of  NVMP/C  were  studied  by  the  N2 

adsorption-desorption isotherms in Figure S7 (Supporting Information), which feature a typical 

type-IV  isotherm  hysteresis  loop.  Accordingly,  the  Brunauer–Emmett–Teller  (BET)  specific 

surface area of NVMP/C is calculated to be 82.6 m2 g-1, and the pore size distribution from the 

Barrette-Joynere-Halenda  (BJH)  model  (inset  of  Figure  S7)  demonstrates  that  the  sample 

contains  a  large  number  of  pores  with  a  main  diameter  of  2.1  nm.  To  better  understand  the 

relationship  between  pore  structure  and  carbon  content, the  N2  adsorption-desorption measurements  for  the  NVMP/C  samples  with  different  carbon  contents  have  been  conducted .  The  BET  surface  areas  for  the  wt  14.3%  and  wt  2.7% 

samples  are  104.1  m2  g-1  and  37.1  m2  g-1,  respectively.  Pore  size  distributions  from  the  BJH 

model indicate that the sample with a  carbon content of 14.3 wt% displays the  most abundant 

pores based on the integral area of pore size distribution curve while the wt 2.7% sample exhibits 

the least, illustrating the advantageous contribution of carbon coating to pore structure. The pore 

structure  could  provide  more  Na+  diffusion  channels  and  a  larger  electrode–electrolyte  contact 

area,  thus  facilitating  the  reaction  kinetics,  which  is  of  great  importance  to  the  outstanding 

electrochemical performance [18,43]. 

The  electrochemical  performance  of  NVMP/C  as  a  cathode  for  SIBs  was  investigated  by 

assembling  coin  cells.  Figure  2a  depicts  the  charge-discharge  profiles  of  NVMP/C  within  a 

voltage window of  2.5-4.1 V vs. Na+/Na at a current density of 1 C (1 C = 110 mA  g-1). The 

electrode  can  deliver  an  initial  charge  capacity  of  129.5  mA  h  g-1,  and  discharge  capacity  of 

109.1  mA  h  g-1,  rendering  a  Coulombic  efficiency  of  84%.  The  irreversible  capacity  could  be 

attributed  to  the  oxidative  electrolyte  decomposition  with  the  formation  of  a  solid-electrolyte 

interface  (SEI)  film,  and  the  lattice  distortion  that  Jahn-Teller  effect  of  Mn3+  brings  about.  Le 

bail  refinement  for  the  discharged  electrode  (1st  discharge)  was  carried  out  (Figure  S9, 

Supporting  Information),  the  calculated  lattice  parameters  are  a  =  b  =  8.79744  (2)  Å,  c  = 

21.82866 (3) Å, and V = 1463.0892 Å3, respectively, which are slightly different from those of 

the  pristine  material,  manifesting  that  the  initial  cycle  is  not  totally  reversible.  Based  on  the 

achieved  specific  capacity,  two  Na+  ions  could  be  reversibly  extracted/inserted  from/into  the 

Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 per molecule, agreeing well with the currently reported Na3V2(PO4)3-based 

cathode materials [28,30]. After 10 cycles, the discharge capacity still maintains 108.9 mA h g-1

and  the  voltage  profiles  are  well  overlapped,  demonstrating  the  excellent  reversibility  of 

NVMP/C. Note that, the average discharge potential is elevated to 3.43 V vs. Na+/Na (compared 

with  3.3-3.4  V  for  NVP)  by  the  voltage  plateau  positioned  at  around  3.9  V,  which  is  an 

indication of V4+/5+ redox couple and is activated by the substitution of manganese. The similar 

phenomenon was also observed in other cation-doped NVP materials [44,45]. The CV curves of 

the  NVMP/C  electrode  in  Figure  2b  elucidate  that  there  are  mainly  two  pairs  of  redox  peaks 

located at around 3.4 V and 3.9 V, respectively. It is worthwhile to note that another reduction 

peak  located  at  3.22  V  signifies  the  insertion  of  Na+  into  two  different  crystallographic  sites, 

which  has  been  reported  in  many  works  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  [44,46].  Figure  2c  presents  the  rate performance of NVMP/C from 1 C to 60 C. The sample with a lower carbon content of 2.7 wt% 

delivers a discharge capacity of 100.2 mA h g-1  at 1 C, at higher rates, discharge capacities of 

80.5 mA h g-1 and 68.7 mA h g-1 are obtained at 40 C and 60 C, respectively.  In contrast, the 

NVMP  with  a  carbon  content  of  7.9  wt%  shows  a  significantly  enhanced  rate  capability  and 

displays 108.6 mA h g-1, 108.3 mA h g-1, 108.3 mA h g-1, 107.0 mA h g-1, 104.5 mA h g-1, and 

100.1 mA h g-1 at 1 C, 2 C, 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 40 C, respectively. Even at a current density of 

60 C, an impressive high discharge capacity of 92.7 mA h g-1 can be achieved. Besides, the rate 

performance  of  the  undoped-Na3V2(PO4)3/C  (NVP/C)  prepared  with  the  same  method  to 

NVMP/C (7.9 wt%) was investigated (Figure  S10, Supporting  Information). This can be 

explained by the lower interface resistance and higher Na+ diffusion coefficient of NVMP/C than 

those  of  NVP/C,  as  evidenced  by  the  electrochemical  impedance  spectra  (EIS)  in  Figure  S11 

(Supporting Information). Furthermore, EIS measurements have been carried out to evaluate the 

conductivity of electrodes with different carbon contents (Figure S12, Supporting Information), 

with  the  increase  of  carbon  content,  the  charge-transfer  resistance  (Rct)  of  electrode  is 

significantly reduced. The rate capability of NVMP with a  higher carbon content of 14.3 wt% 

was  also  examined  (Figure  S13,  Supporting  Information),  though  outstanding  performance  is 

exhibited, its energy density is not comparable to that of NVMP/C (7.9 wt%) when taking active 

mass loading into account. It is noteworthy that pure carbon delivers negligible capacity within 

the  potential  window  of  2.5-4.1  V  (Figure  S14,  Supporting  Information),  thereby  the  specific 

capacity values in this work were calculated based on the active mass of NVMP. To  evaluate  the  long-term  cycling  stability  of  NVMP/C,  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  at  a 

current  density  of  5  C  was  performed  (Figure  2d).  The  electrode  delivers  an  initial  discharge 

capacity of 106.7 mA h g-1, while after 500 cycles a discharge capacity of 96.8 mA h g-1 can be 

maintained,  corresponding  to  a  high  capacity  retention  of  90.7%.  More  impressively,  after 

activation at 1 C for 3 cycles, the NVMP/C (7.9 wt%) affords a discharge capacity of 100.7 mA 

h  g-1  in  the  4th  cycle  and  sustains  87.8  mA  h  g-1  even  after  4000  cycles  at  20  C  (Figure  2e), 

showing an only 12.8% capacity loss upon the prolonged cycling. It is worth mentioning that the 

Coulombic efficiency approaches 100%, which is beneficial for the durable lifetime. The SEM 

image  of  NVMP/C  after  4000  cycles  is  provided  in  Figure  S15  (Supporting  Information),  the 

fundamental morphology of monodispersed nanoparticles can be still maintained without serious 

agglomeration,  further  corroborating  the  stable  structure  of  NVMP/C  during  long-life  cycling. 

For  comparison,  Figure  S16  (Supporting  Information)  presents the long-term  cycling 

performance of the NVMP with a carbon content of 2.7 wt% at 20 C, however, only 54.6 mA h 

g-1  (capacity  retention  of  64.8%)  can  be  obtained  after  4000  cycles.  the  undesirable  rate 

capability  and  cyclic  stability  could  be  attributed  to  the  relatively  low  conductivity.  The 

exceptional rate capability and ultra-long cycling life of NVMP/C are summarized in Table S2, 

its  overall electrochemical performances compare favorably with those previously  reported for 

the metal ion doped or undoped NVP SIB cathode materials. 

For  better  understanding  the  high  rate  performance  of  NVMP/C  in  depth,  diffusion  kinetic 

activities of Na+ were studied by CV curves at different scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 4.0 mV s-1, 

as displayed in Figure 3a. 

The reaction kinetics can be further described using the following relations: 

of which a, b, k1, and k2 are adjustable parameters, which depend on the fitting results between ip 

and v. The value of b determines the type of Na+ (de)insertion, when the b value is close to 0.5, 

the  electrochemical  reaction  is  mainly  controlled  by  Faradaic  intercalation;  when  the  b  value 

approaches 1.0, surface-controlled pseudocapacitive behavior dominates the process [47]. Figure 

3c  shows  the  log(ip)  versus  log(v)  plots  at  the  oxidation  and  reduction  peaks,  the  b  values  of 

Peak1 and Peak2 are 0.74 and 0.77, respectively, manifesting the partial pseudocapacitive effect 

and  thus  enabling  the  fast  reaction  dynamics.  The  pseudocapacitive  contribution  is  calculated 

according to the equation (4), where k1v and k2v1/2 represent the capacitive and diffusion-limited 

currents, respectively [48]. Figure 3d presents the capacitive contribution proportions at various 

scan  rates,  with  the  increase  of  scan  rate,  the  contribution  of  capacitance  increases,  further 

demonstrating  that  the  pseudocapacitive  storage  partially  contribute  to  the  whole  capacity 

especially at the high rates. Figure 3e displays the detailed pseudocapacitive fraction at 0.5 mV s-

1.  The  favorable  heterostructure  of  NVMP/C  incorporating  nanoparticles,  carbon  coating,  and 

porosity  could  build  abundant  active  surfaces/interfaces, leading the  desirable pseudocapacitive effect. 

In  order  to  investigate  the  valence  change  of  Mn  and  V  ions  during  sodium-ion 

extraction/insertion, ex situ XANES and XPS analyses were carried out. For the ex situ XANES 

experiment,  all  electrodes  were  disassembled  without  scraping  from  Al  current  collector  in  a 

glove box and directly sealed in a Kapton film to avoid exposure to air. The XANES spectra at 

the V K-edge are provided in Figure 4a. The energy of the pristine material is very close to that 

of the standard V2O3 sample, indicating that the average valence of V in the pristine sample is 

about trivalent. Upon charged to 4.1 V, the V K-edge absorption spectrum shows obvious shift 

compared with the pristine material. The energy is very close to that of the standard VO2 sample, 

manifesting the average tetravalent state of V in the sample charged to 4.1 V. After discharged to 

2.5 V, the energy recovers to a state approaching the pristine  material, demonstrating the high 

reversibility of V valence evolution during the electrochemical cycling. In addition, XPS spectra 

were given in Figure S17 (Supporting Information) to further probe the valence changes. The V 

2p XPS spectrum of the pristine material displays two peaks at 516.6 eV (V 2p3/2) and 523.5 eV 

(V 2p1/2), suggesting the trivalence of vanadium [34,38]. When the electrode was charged to 4.1 

V, the binding energy of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 shifts to higher values of 517.4 eV and 524.6 eV, 

respectively,  corresponding  to  the  oxidation  of  V3+  to  V4+  during  Na+  extraction  [34,38].  It 

should be mentioned that V5+ is not clearly detected in the present study, which is probably due 

to a small amount of V5+ existing in the charged material. Similar phenomenon was ever reported 

in the Na3V1.6Cr0.4(PO4)3 system [45]. The Mn K-edge absorption spectra are displayed in Figure 

4b. The energy of the pristine material is larger than that of the standard MnO sample, indicating 

that the average valence of Mn is higher than bivalence. The Mn 2p XPS result further reveals 

the co-existence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ valences (Figure S17).  When charged to 4.1 V, the Mn K-

edge absorption spectrum shows a rightward shift to higher energy  compared with the pristine 

material, suggesting the valence change from Mn2+ to Mn3+. XPS result also demonstrates that 

Mn2+ is partially oxided to Mn3+. After discharged to 2.5 V, both Mn K-edge XANES and Mn 2p 

XPS spectra recover to the pristine state, accounting for the prominent reversibility. Based on the 

results discussed above, we can conclude that V3+/4+ and Mn2+/3+ redox couples mainly involve in 

the electrochemical reaction process. 

Although superior cyclic stability and rate capability have been achieved in NVMP/C, it is still 

unclear about the change of crystal structure. It is well known that in situ XRD characterization 

is  an  effective  way  to  elucidate  the  crystal  structure  evolution  [52].  Correspondingly,  the 

operando XRD patterns were collected in the voltage range from 2.5 V to 4.1 V with Al foil as 

both current collector and testing window. As shown in Figure 4c, in general, the (104), (113), 

(024),  (211),  (116),  and  (300)  diffraction  peaks  undergo  evident  shift  and  then  restore  to  the 

initial state in a quite symmetric way, corroborating that the whole charge/discharge process is 

highly reversible. The gradual disappearance of originally existing peaks and the emergence of 

new peaks demonstrate a typical biphasic transition in the reaction process. Particularly, the peak 

of (211) completely disappears upon charging and gradually forms upon discharging; the (104) 

and (300) peaks shift rightward, split into two peaks during the charge process, and subsequently 

merge into one peak, transform back to the initial position during the discharge process (Figure 

4d). Notably, all peaks shift toward higher angles accompanied by the Na+ extraction, indicating 

the contraction of the NVMP unit cell. At the end of desodiation process, all of the characteristic 

peaks can be indexed to a new Na-poor phase of Na1.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3. The Le Bail refinement 

result shows that the generated Na1.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 crystallizes in rhombohedral structure with 

a R-3c space  group (Figure S18, Supporting  Information), which is very similar to the case of 

NaV2(PO4)3  (fully  desodiated  product  of  NVP)  [27].  It  is  worthwhile  to  emphasize  that  the 

electrochemical process at the voltage plateau of 3.9 V undergoes gradual rightward shift without 

the formation or disappearance of any diffraction peaks, validating a single-phase reaction at this 

stage.  This  is  consistent  with  the  report  of  Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3  [44].  In  order  to  obtain  deep 

understanding  of  the  volume  change  upon  Na+  insertion  and  extraction  processes,  the  Le  Bail 

fitting is conducted using the FullProf program. As elucidated in Figure 4e, the unit cell volume 

gradually shrinks during the charge process and expands during the discharge process. The total 

volume change is calculated to be about 8.21% (∆V / Vpristine) and is close to that of Na3V2(PO4)3 

(8.26%) [27], but is smaller than that of Na4MnV(PO4)3 (more than 10%) [39,53]. The relatively 

small volume change is responsible for the decent cycling ability of the carbon-coated NVMP. 

To  deeply  figure  out  the  prominent  rate  capability  of  NVMP,  DFT  computations  were 

performed to explore the Na-ion migration barrier. The structure of convention cell is shown in 

Figure  5a.  To  simplify  the  calculation,  Mn  was  randomly  distributed  into  V  site  based  on  the 

stoichiometric ratio. Figure 5b displays the primitive cell of NVMP, where the blue isosurface 

represents  the  simulated  Na+  migration  paths  by  the  bond  valence  energy  landscape  (BVEL) 

method, and the black arrow points out the optimum migration path following Na1→Na2 along 

the  interstitial  channels  of  M2(PO4)3  (M  =  Mn,  V)  framework.  The  corresponding  migration 

energy barrier was calculated based on the climbing-image nudged elastic band (cNEB) method 

[54].  As  shown  in  Figure  5c  and  Figure  S19  (Supporting  Information),  the  Na-ion  diffusion 

barriers for NVMP and  NVP are 0.309 eV and 0.342 eV, respectively.  More significantly, the 

diffusion  barrier  of  NVMP  is  lower  than  most  reported  Na-storage  cathode  materials  [55-57], 

which is favorable to the desirable reaction kinetics and outstanding rate performance. 

Furthermore,  the  superb  electrochemical  performance  of  NVMP@C  cathode  inspires  us  to 

examine  its  practical  use  in  full  cells.  Figure  6a  schematically  illustrates  the  configuration  of 

NVMP/C//Hard carbon Na-ion full cell. The Na-storage behavior of the hard carbon anode in a 

half  cell  is  provided  in  Figure  S20  (Supporting  Information).  The  cathode  mass  loading  was 

about 3 times of the anode mass. As depicted in Figure 6b, the electrochemical performance was 

tested within the voltage window of 2.0 to 4.0 V at a current density of 0.5 C. The full cell could 

deliver an initial discharge capacity of 95.7 mA h g-1 with the average working voltage at 3.3 V. 

This corresponds to a remarkable energy density of 234.63 Wh kg-1 based on the total mass of 

cathode and anode active materials. After 50 cycles, the discharge capacity still maintains 81.2 

mA h g-1 (Figure 6c), leading to a promising capacity retention of 84.8%. In addition, Figure 6d 

presents  that  the  light-emitting  diode  (LED)  bulbs  can  be  lighted  up  by  a  coin-type  full  cell, 

demonstrating the great practical feasibility of NVMP@C. 

In summary, NASICON-type Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 was designed as a novel cathode material 

for  sodium-ion  batteries.  Its  crystal  structure  with  a  space  group  R-3c  was  determined  by  the 

synchrotron XRD Rietveld refinement. DFT computations elucidated that the intrinsic low Na+ 

migration energy  barrier was responsible for the superb rate capability  of NVMP. The  NVMP 

nanoparticles uniformly embedded in porous carbon matrix enabled rapid ionic diffusion kinetics 

and robust structural stability. Therefore, half-cell measurement demonstrates that the NVMP/C 

electrode  could  deliver  a  decent  average  discharge  potential  of  3.43  V  vs.  Na+/Na  with 

exceptional  rate  performance  of  92.7  mA  h  g-1  at  60  C  and  prominent  capacity  retention  of 

87.2%  after  4000  cycles  at  20  C.  In  situ  XRD  revealed  that  the  electrochemical  process 

experienced  highly  reversible  biphasic  transition  and  single  phase  change  with  8.21%  volume 

change  of  unit  cell.  The  Mn2+/3+  and  V3+/4+  redox  couples  occurring  during  the  Na+ 

extraction/insertion  were  further  verified  by  ex  situ  XANES  and  XPS  spectra.  More 

impressively,  the  full  battery  constructed  by  NVMP/C  cathode  and  hard  carbon  anode  could 

achieve an  average operating voltage of 3.3 V and a reversible capacity  of 94 mA h  g-1. Such 

intriguing  performances  are  very  outstanding  among  all  the  metal  ion–doped  NVP  cathode 

materials  reported  to  date.  We  believe  that  the  substitution  of  vanadium  with  appropriate 

electrochemically  active  element  is  an  applicable  strategy  in  developing  high-performance 

NASICON-type SIB cathode materials.
