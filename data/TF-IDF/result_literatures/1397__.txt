NASICON-type Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 solid state lithium ionic conductors were synthesized by a sol-gel method using citric acid and ethylene glycol.

The electrical conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 was decreased to 1.4×10 −1 at 25 ◦ C by immersion in distilled water, while immersion in the saturated LiCl aqueous solution increased the conductivity to 4.95×10 −3 S cm C. Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 was stable in the saturated LiCl and LiOH aqueous solution.

The lithium-air battery has obtained a wide interest all over the world, because it has the highest theoretical speciﬁc energy density −1 (excluding oxygen) and 3,460 of galvanic cells at 11,140 Wh kg −1 (including oxygen).1 Two types of lithium-air batteries have Wh kg currently been developed; aqueous and non-aqueous types. The nonaqueous type lithium-air battery consists of a lithium metal anode, a non-aqueous lithium conducting electrolyte, such as a gel-type polymer electrolyte2 or a conventional liquid electrolyte similar to that used in lithium-ion batteries.3 This type of lithium-air battery shows a high weight-speciﬁc energy density, but it has some severe problems that must still be addressed, such as lithium corrosion by water and CO2 ingression when operated in air (poor lifetime), precipitation of high resistance reaction products (lithium oxides) on the air electrode (low capacity), and high polarization during the charge and discharge processes (low energy conversion efﬁciency and low power density). The aqueous electrolyte lithium-air system has lower energy −1 (excluddensity than that of the non-aqueous system; 2,371Wh kg −1 (including oxygen). However, these ing oxygen) and 1,910 Wh kg problems observed for the non-aqueous lithium-air system could be removed by using a water stable lithium metal electrode and an aqueous electrolyte. The key material of the water stable lithium electrode is the water stable lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte. The water stable lithium electrode proposed by Imanishi et al.4 consisted of a lithium metal anode, a lithium conducting polymer electrolyte consisting of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with Li(CF3SO2)2N (LiTFSI), and a water stable NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte of Li1+xAlxTi1-x(PO4)3 (LATP). The polymer electrolyte was used to prevent the direct contact of lithium metal and LATP, because LATP is unstable in contact with lithium metal. This concept was preliminary addressed by Visco et al.5 using a lithium nitride interface layer between the lithium metal and LATP. The NASICON-type Li1+xAxM2-x(PO4)3 (A= Al, Sc, Y, M= Ti4+ , Ge4+ , Ta4+ ) lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte was reported by Aono et al.6 A high conductivity of 7×10 C was reported for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. The stability of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, prepared by a sol-gel process in water was examined by Cretin et al.7 and the weight loss after immersion in distilled water for approximately 100 h was ca. 0.9%. Thokchom and Kumar8 observed slight buckling of the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 glass ceramic after 65 days of immersion in tap water. Hasegawa et al.9 reported the stability of

a Li1+x-yAlxTi2-xSiyP3-yO12 glass ceramic plate supplied from Ohara Co. Ltd. in distilled water. The grain boundary resistance of the plate increased from 144 to 242  by immersion in distilled water at room temperature for one month. The increase of the grain boundary re.10 However, no sistance may be due to the exchange of H increase in the grain boundary and grain resistance was observed for the LATP sample immersed in 0.1 M LiCl aqueous solution for 3 weeks. The LATP plate was reported to be unstable in contact with lithium metal.9 NASICON-type Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (LAGP) was also reported to have a high lithium ion conductivity in the range −1 at room temperature, the conductivity of of 10 which was dependent on the preparation method. The highest electrical conductivity of 5.08×10 −3 S cm C was obtained for the Li1,5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP x = 0.5) glass ceramic by crystalliza◦ C for 12 h.11 LAGP was reported to tion of the glass sheet at 850 be stable in contact with lithium metal by Leo et al.12 However, the conductivity of Li1,4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 (LAGP x = 0.4) in contact with lithium metal was reported to be as low as 3.8×10 −1 at 40 ◦ C. Xu et al.13 claimed that LAGP (x = 0.5) was stable in contact with lithium metal, because no change in impedance was observed for a Li/LAGP/Li cell over two months; however, the impedance of the cell on the ﬁrst day was as high as 20 k (7.5×10 −1). Feng et al.14 observed a small reduction current for the Li/LAGP (x = 0.5)/Ag + . It is expected that LAGP is more stable with cell at 0.8 V vs. Li/Li lithium metal than LATP; however, the stability of LAGP in contact with lithium metal is questionable. In this study, we have prepared an impurity phase-free Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 using a precursor prepared by a sol-gel method. The stability of LAGP in contact with lithium metal, In-Li alloy, Li7Ti5O12, and aqueous electrolytes is examined.

The LAGP precursor was prepared by a sol-gel method with citric acid.15 Stoichiometric amounts of Ge(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich), chemical grade LiNO3, Al(NO3)3•9H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were dissolved in a 0.2 M aqueous solution of citric acid and stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous solution. A certain volume of ethylene glycol [citric acid: ethylene glycol molar ratio = 1:1, ) molar ratio = 4:1] (citric acid + ethylene glycol):(Li was added to the mixed solution to prevent the formation of hard agglomerates and promote polyesteriﬁcation and polycondensation. The mixed solution was kept at 80 C during the sol-gel preparation process. After a homogeneous solution was formed, the gel was kept ◦ at 170 C for 1 day to allow the evaporation of water and to promote

◦ esteriﬁcation and polymerization, and the gel was then heated at 500 C for 4 h. The obtained powder was ground uniformly to a ﬁne powder ◦ C for 5 h with an agate mortar and pestle before sintering at 800 to complete the chemical reaction. The LAGP precursor was ground using a high energy mechanical mill (Fritsch, Planetary Micro Mill). The ﬁne powder was isostatically pressed at 150 M Pa into a 12 mm diameter pellet with a thickness of approximately 2 mm, and then sintered at various temperatures on a gold sheet to protect the samples from reaction with the alumina refractory board.

The crystal structure of the synthesized samples was analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RINT 2500) with Cu Kα radiation −1. ◦ in the 2θ range from 10 to 90 Pure silicon powder (4 μm, >99%) was added as an internal standard reference to determine the crystal lattice parameters and precise lattice constants were obtained using the Jade cell reﬁnement program. Impedance measurements of the sintered LAGP pellets in air were conducted using an impedance analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the tem◦ C and the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to perature range from 20 to 80 1 MHz using a cell with sputtered gold electrodes on both surfaces of the LAGP pellet. The impedance proﬁles were analyzed using a nonlinear instant ﬁt program in the ZView software. To test the stability of LAGP in aqueous solutions, sintered LAGP pellets were immersed in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, and saturated LiCl and LiOH aqueous solution at 50 C for one week. The LAGP pellets were then washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum at ◦ 220 C for 20 h before measuring the electrical conductivity. The chlorine contents of these samples were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Hitachi S-486 SEM).

The stability of LAGP in contact with lithium metal,

InLi alloy, and Li7Ti5O12 was examined by the resistance change over time of sandwich cells consisting of Cu/Li/LAGP/Li/Cu, Cu/Li/In/LAGP/In/Li/Cu, and Cu/Al/Li7Ti5O12/LAGP/Li7Ti5O12/Al/ Cu. The lithium metal activity in the Li-In alloy was estimated from the cell voltage of Li/PEO18LiTFSI/Li-In. Li7Ti5O12 was prepared by the electrochemical insertion of Li into Li4Ti5O12 (Ishihara Sango Co., Japan) using the Li/ethylene carbonate-diethylene carbonate-1 M LiPF6/Li4Ti5O12 cell. The lithium conducting polymer electrolyte PEO18LiTFSI was prepared by the method reported previously.4 ◦ PEO18LiTFSI was dried at 110 C for 10 h under vacuum to completely remove water and solvent from the polymer electrolyte. All solid state batteries were prepared using a Li4Ti5O12 anode, a LAGP electrolyte, and a LiCoO2 cathode. The anode and cathode were sputtered (Ulvac, Scott-C3) on the LAGP pellets under an Ar/O2 gas mixture (30% O2). The weights of Li4Ti5O12 and LiCoO2 deposited were ca. 0.4 mg, respectively. Galvanostatic charge and discharge tests were carried out at 1 μ A cm

of (XRD) Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.3–0.7) sintered at 900 ◦ C for 5 h using the sol-gel precursor. All the main diffraction peaks are assigned to the NASCION-type LiGe2(PO4)3 structure. The lattice parameters were calculated to be a = 0.8265 nm and c = 2.0613 nm for LAGP (x = 0.4). Compared to the lattice parameters of LiGe2(PO4) with a = 0.8268 nm and c = 2.0494 nm (PDF #80-1924), the a-axis is slightly decreased and the c-axis increased by the partial substitution of Al3+ . The lattice parameter for the a-axis is in good agreement with that reported previously (a = 0.8250 nm) and that of the c-axis is slightly higher than that (c = 2.056 nm) for LAGP (x = 0.4),7 which was prepared by the sol-gel process. LAGP with a high content of Al (x = 0.6 and 0.7) has a small extra diffraction peak of AlPO4 at around 2θ = 13 ◦ , which was observed by Cretin et al.7 for LAGP (x = 0.7). In addition, an unknown trace peak is observed at around 2θ = 21 for LAGP (x = 0.7). Xu et al.13 and Thokchom et al.11 have ◦ claimed that this peak may be due to the Li2O phase. LAGP (x = 0.7) C showed clear diffraction sintered at a lower temperature of 800 peaks of AlPO4. According to the XRD study, LAGP with less than x = 0.6 had no impurity phases when sintered in the temperature range

The electrical conductivity measurements showed a clear dependence on the sintering temperature and the Al content in Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3. Figure 2 shows the relation between the elec◦ trical conductivity at 25 C and the sintering temperature of LAGP as a function of x in Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3, where the sintering period was ﬁxed for 5 h. The highest conductivity of 8.1×10 −4 S cm −1 at C was observed for LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered at 900 ◦ ◦ C. The low 25 conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered at 850 C may be due to the low relative density of 82.5% compared to that of the LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered at 900 C showed a high relative density of 88%, but lower conductivity than that of the LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered at 900 C. The low conductivity may be due to formation of a high resistive phase at the grain boundary. The high conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.6) sintered at 800 ◦ C may be due to the formation of AlPO4 and/or Li2O at the grain boundary. The formation of AlPO4 was conﬁrmed by XRD analysis for LAGP (x= 0.7) sintered ◦ C. Kumar and coworkers11,16 claimed that the high conductivat 800 ity of the glass ceramic was due to the formation of AlPO4 and Li2O at the grain boundaries. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence

of the electrical conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.4) as a function of the ◦ sintering period at 900 C along with the impedance proﬁles measured −1 at 25 ◦ ◦ C at 25 was observed for the sample sintered at 900 C for 11 h. The conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.4) prepared using the sol-gel precursor is higher than that of the LAGP (x = 0.5) glass ceramic reported by Xu et al.13 (7.25×10 −1), and those of the LAGPs (x = 0.5) prepared using a solid state reaction precusor14 (3.5×10 −1) and using a sol-gel precursor7 (2.8×10 −1). These LAGPs C. The conductivity value is higher than that were sintered at 950 of LATP (x = 0.4) prepared using the sol-gel precursor (7.5×10 −4 S C).17 The total conductivity was signiﬁcantly decreased cm for a longer sintering period of 17 h. The XRD patterns of the samples C for sintered at 900 11 h. The impedance spectra have a semicircle, the diameter of which is dependent on the sintering period, and this semicircle is attributed to the grain boundary resistance. The intercept of the semicircle with the real axis at high frequency represents the grain resistance.18 The grain and grain boundary conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered −3 S ◦ at 900 −1, respectively, using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 3 . The cm grain resistance does not change signiﬁcantly, but the grain boundary resistance shows a signiﬁcant change with the sintering period. The grain boundary resistances for the samples sintered for 3, 11 and 17 h were 423.3, 96.7, and 345.4 , respectively. The relative densities of the LAGP (x = 0.4) pellets sintered for 3, 11 and 17 h were 83.3, 89.3, and 84.0%, respectively. The high grain boundary resistances for LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered for the short period of 3 h could be explained by the low relative density, where there is poor contact between the grains. The low relative density of LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered for a long period of 17 h may be due to the evaporation of Li2O. The activation energy for conduction was calculated from the ◦ C conductivity data measured in the temperature range of 25 to 80 to be 31.1 kJ mol C for 11 h. The activation energy is comparable to that of the LAGP (x = 0.5) −1) and Thokchom glass ceramic reported by Xu et al.13 (29.9 kJ mol −1), and is lower than that of LAGP (x = 0.5) et al.11 (30.9 kJ mol −1) by Mariappan et al.19 sintered using a glassy powder (39.6 kJ mol The activation energies for LAGP (x = 0.4) sintered for 3 and 17 h −1. The slightly high activation energy may be due to were 35.4 kJ mol the contribution of the high grain boundary resistance. The conductiv-

ity hysteresis by a thermal cycle was not observed in the temperature range 25 to 80 C. The conductivity of the LAGP in a dry chamber with silica-gel was slightly lower than that under air (relative humidity of about 50%). These results suggest that the LAGP has no signiﬁcant effect on water in the samples and atmosphere.

The stability of LATP in water has been extensively studied by Imanishi and coworkers.9,20 LATP decomposes in strong acid solution and dissolves in strong alkaline solution. LATP was stable in distilled water and the electrical conductivity was increased. The stability in an aqueous solution of saturated LiOH is necessary for the protection of the water stable lithium electrode for lithium-air batteries, because the cell reaction of the aqueous lithium-air batteries is as follows

and the concentration of LiOH increases with increasing discharge depth. Imanishi and coworkers20 found that LATP is stable in saturated LiCl and LiOH aqueous solution, due to the low dissociation of + ion content. The pH value LiOH to ions in the presence of a high Li of the saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution was approximately 8. The stability of LAGP (x = 0.4) in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, and saturated LiCl and LiOH aqueous solution was also examined. LAGP (x = 0.4) pellets sintered at 900 ◦ C for 10 h were immersed in these solutions at 50 C for one week. The change in the XRD patterns and electrical conductivity after immersion in the solutions was examined. Figure 4 shows XRD patterns of LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in these aqueous solutions. There was no change in the XRD pattern after immersion in these aqueous solutions. However, the impedance proﬁles showed a signiﬁcant change after immersion in these solutions, as shown in Fig. 5. The grain boundary resistance of LAGP (x= 0.4) increased to 2,724 from 219  cm2 after immersion in distilled water, while the bulk resistance remained constant. A similar increase in grain boundary resistance was found for sintered pellets of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 prepared using sol-gel precursor,17 after immersion in distilled water. The increase in grain boundary resistance + observed in a could be explained by the ion exchange of Li lithium ion conducting solid such as Li3xLa2/3-xTiO3.10 A signiﬁcant increase in grain boundary resistance was also observed for LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in the 1 M LiOH aqueous solution. No change in impedance was observed for LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in the saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution. The grain boundary and bulk resistances of LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in saturated LiCl aqueous

are signiﬁcantly increased with storage time immediately after the start of the experiment. The increase in resistance may be due to the formation of a high resistance phase formed by the reduction of Ge4+ by lithium metal. The color of the interface between the lithium metal and LAGP changed to black due to the reduction of Ge4+ . The conductivity of the Li/LAGP (x = 0.4)/Li cell (3.82×10 −1) measured after several hours was decreased to 7.84×10 −1 after 35 days. The bulk conductivity, which was estimated from the intercept of the semicircle with the real axis at a high frequency, showed no change over time. For the Li/In/LAGP/In/Li cell, the semicircle in the impedance plots did not change signiﬁcantly for 4 days and then increased signiﬁcantly with time, as shown in Fig. 6b. The lithium potential of In/Li was measured using the Li/PEO18LiTFSI/In/Li cell and the time dependence of the potential is shown in Fig. 7. The potential of the In electrode decreased with the storage time and a stable + potential of 0.648 V vs. Li/Li was observed at room temperature after 10 days. The In-Li phase diagram shows many intermediate alloys, such as InLi and In2Li,21 the highest lithium content alloy of which is InLi. The stable potential of the In/Li electrode may correspond to the potential of InLi. The initial conductivity of 4.35×10 −1 for Li/In/LAGP (x = 0.4)/In/Li decreased to 8.87×10 −1 after 35 days. The ﬁnal conductivity of Li/In/LAGP (x = 0.4)/In/Li was almost the same as that of Li/LAGP/Li. Thus, LAGP is unstable in contact + . The with the lithium anode with a potential of 0.648 V vs. Li/Li stability of LAGP (x = 0.4) in contact with Li7Ti5O12 was examined. Li7Ti5O12 is well known as a reversible lithium insertion and stripping anode for lithium-ion batteries,22 and the potential of Li7Ti5O12 + was 1.565 V vs. Li/Li at room temperature. Figure 6c shows the change in impedance of the Li7Ti5O12/LAGP (x = 0.4)/Li7Ti5O12 cell at room temperature as a function of the storage time. The total conductivity of the cell (3.7×10 −1) was almost constant for 22 days. Therefore, LAGP (x = 0.4) is stable in contact with an + at room temperature. anode with a potential of 1.565 V vs. Li/Li The stability of LATP (x = 0.4) prepared using the sol-gel precursor in contact with Li7Ti5O12 was examined for comparison with LAGP (x = 0.4). The change in impedance with storage time is shown for the Li7Ti5O12/LATP (x = 0.4)/Li7Ti5O12 cell in Fig. 6d . The bulk resistance was almost constant, but the interface resistance increased signiﬁcantly with the storage time. Therefore, LATP (x= 0.4) is unsta+ . ble in contact with an anode with the potential of 1.565 V vs. Li/Li Figure 7 summarizes the relative changes in conductivity (σ/σo) of LAGP (x = 0.4) and LATP (x = 0.4) with the storage time, as estimated from the total cell resistances for the Li/LAGP (x = 0.4)/Li, Li/In/LAGP (x = 0.4)/In/Li, Li7Ti5O12/LAGP (x = 0.4)/Li7Ti5O12, and Li7Ti5O12/LATP (x = 0.4)/Li7Ti5O12 cells along with the time dependence of the cell voltage for the Li/PEO18LiTFS/In/Li cell at room temperature.

The NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes are unstable in direct contact with lithium metal, so that a protective layer such as a polymer electrolyte and Li3N has been used to avoid direct contact.23–25 Stability studies on lithium electrodes suggest that Li7Ti5O12 can be used as the lithium electrode without a protective layer for an all-solid state lithium battery with the LAGP (x = 0.4) electrolyte. An all-solid-state battery with a high energy density is expected to be applied as a large scale battery, due to safety and reliability advantages.26 Sulﬁde-based high lithium conducting solid electrolytes such as Li7P3S11-z glass ceramics27 and Li10GeP2S12,28 and lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON)29 have been employed for previous all-solid-state lithium batteries. The sulﬁde-based solid electrolytes have extremely high room temperature lithium conductivities of 3.2×10 −1 for Li10GeP2S12; however, they are unstable in direct contact with lithium metal, so that In-Li alloy or In have been used as anodes.28,30 In addition, they are quite hydroscopic and unstable in open air. LiPON is stable in contact with lithium metal, but has room temperature −1. LAGP (x = 0.4) is unstable in conductivity as low as 10 contact with lithium metal and Li-In alloy, but is stable in open air and in contact with L7Ti5O12. Therefore, LAGP is attractive as a solid electrolyte for lithium batteries with the Li7Ti5O12 lithium reversible

solution were signiﬁcantly decreased. The conductivity of LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in saturated LiCl solution was increased to 4.95×10 C for the pristine LAGP (x = 0.4) in open air. The Cl content in LAGP (x = 0.4) immersed in saturated LiCl aqueous solution was estimated to be approximately 0.3 wt% by EDX analysis. A high conductivity value was observed for a long period at room temperature in open air. Similar enhancement of conductivity by immersion in saturated LiCl aqueous solution was observed for LATP (x = 0.4) prepared using a sol-gel precursor, which was explained by the formation of a low resistance phase of LiCl-xH2O at the nanosize grain boundaries.17

Previous reports12,13 on the stability of LAGP in contact with lithium metal are questionable, because the Li/LAGP/Li cell had a high cell resistance. Therefore, the stability of LAGP (x = 0.4) in contact with lithium metal, In-Li alloy, and Li7Ti5O12 was investigated by observing the change in impedance of a symmetric cell of LAGP (x = 0.4) with these lithium electrodes at room temperature. The change in impedance for the Li/LAGP(x = 0.4)/Li cell over time are shown in Fig. 6a. The large semicircles in the impedance proﬁles, which are attributed to interface resistance of Li and LAGP (x = 0.4),

Preliminary performance of an all-solid-state cell with the Li4Ti5O12 anode, LAGP (x = 0.4) electrolyte, and a LiCoO2 cathode was examined, where the anode and the cathode materials were sputtered on a LGAP (x= 0.4) pellet.

(x = 0.4), because the Li/PEO18LiTFSI/LAGP (x = 0.4)/LiCoO2 cell had excellent charge-discharge performance. Therefore, improvement of the electrode performance between the lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte and lithium electrode is an important research subject to develop a high performance all-solid-state lithium battery with the LAGP electrolyte.

A NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte, Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3, was prepared using a precursor synthesized by the sol-gel method with citric acid. Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 sintered ◦ at 900 C for 11 h exhibited the highest electrical conductivity of 1.22×10 −3 S cm C. The conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 was decreased by immersion in distilled water and increased by immersion in saturated LiCl aqueous solution for one week at 50 C. The enhancement of conductivity by immersion in the LiCl solution could be explained by a decrease in the grain boundary resistance by the formation of a LiCl-H2O conducting phase at the grain boundaries. Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 was also stable in saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution.

The interface resistance between Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 and lithium metal, and between Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 and In/Li was increased with the storage time. However, the interface resistance between Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 and Li7Ti5O12 did not change with storage time, which suggests that Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 is stable in contact with a + . lithium electrode having a potential higher than 1.565 V vs. Li/Li Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 is an attractive materials as the protective layer for a water-stable lithium metal electrode and also as an electrolyte for an all-solid-state lithium battery.
