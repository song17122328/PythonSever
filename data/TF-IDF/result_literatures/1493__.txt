The discovery by Hong H.Y. 2)P. of high conductiv 2) ity in the Na1 + xZr2P3 – xSixO12 system has led a great number  of  researchers  to  focus  on  NASICON 2)type polyvalent 2)cation  phosphates  [1].  Conductivity  data have been reported for a variety of AxМ2(РO4)3 com 2) pounds  containing  Zr4+,  Hf4+,  Ti4+,  or  Sn4+  on  the M site [2, 3]. The NASICON structure admits cation substitutions in different sites. In particular, the M site may  accommodate  tri 2)  and  pentavalent  cations: MIV MV  +  MIII.  Compounds  containing  such  a combination of elements on the octahedral site have been  studied  in  much  less  detail  [4,  5].  Varying  the М5+ : M3+ ratio, one can increase the cation vacancy concentration  and  fill  the  interstitial  sites  without introducing any other cations.

The  compound  NaNbAl(PO4)3,  crystallizing  in hexagonal symmetry, was identified in [6, 7]. Its ionic conductivity and the range of Nb : Al ratios it admits have not yet been studied. This led us to synthesize A3 –  2xNbxAl2  –  x(PO4)3  (A  =  Li,  Na)  mixed 2)cation phosphates and measure their ionic conductivity.

The A3 – 2xNbxAl2 – x(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na; х = 0.9, 1, 1.1) compounds were prepared using lithium and sodium car 2) bonates,  ammonium  hydrogen  phosphate,  niobium(V) oxide,  and  aluminum(III)  oxide.  To  ensure  the  highest possible phase purity, we used a two 2)step solid 2)state syn 2) thesis procedure described elsewhere [8]. First, stoichio 2) metric amounts of Li2CO3 or Na2CO3,  (NH4)2HPO4, Nb2O5, and Al2O3 were thoroughly ground and reacted at 870 (A = Li) or 570 K (A = Na) for 2 h in platinum cruci 2) bles.  The  resultant  materials  were  reground  and,  in  the case of the Na3 – 2xNbxAl2 – x(PO4)3 materials, annealed at  1070  and  1170  K.  The  lithium 2)containing  materials were pressed at 510 MPa into disks, which were packed with powder of nearly the same composition (enriched in lithium) and annealed for 12 h at 870, 970, 1020, 1070, 1170, and 1270 K. We used different synthesis tempera 2) tures in order to optimize the process.

The materials were characterized by X 2)ray diffraction (XRD)  on  a  Rigaku  D/MAX  2200  diffractometer (CuKα radiation). Unit 2)cell parameters were determined by least squares refinement using the POWDER program. Electrical  conductivity  was  measured  at  frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz using a 2V 2)1 impedance analyzer. The samples had the form of pellets 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness, with platinum contacts. The tempera 2) ture was varied from 298 to 820 K in 10 2) to 20 2)K steps. The  conductivity  was  determined  by  extrapolating  the semicircle  representing  the  bulk  component  to  the  real axis.

According  to  XRD  data,  the  rhombohedral  NASI 2) CON phase of LiNbAl(PO4)3 begins to form at 870 K. The  process  does  not  reach  completion  at  970  K:  the XRD pattern of the sample showed reflections from reac 2) tion intermediates (Fig. 1). After annealing at 1020 K, the sample contained small amounts of AlPO4 and NbOPO4. Raising the temperature of the second anneal from 970 to 1270 increases the amounts of aluminum phosphate and niobium oxyphosphate. Thus, in the lithium system, rais 2) ing the synthesis temperature does not improve the phase purity of the material. The highest content of the rhombo 2) hedral  phase  LiNbAl(PO4)3  was  reached  by  long 2)term annealing at temperatures from 970 to 1020 K. The unitcell parameters of this phase were а = 8.533(2) Å and c = 21.280(9) Å (Table 1). Varying the cation composition in the lithium system increases the percentage of impurity phases, which may have a crucial effect on the ionic con 2) ductivity  of  the  material.  For  this  reason,  conductivity measurements  to LiNbAl(PO4)3.

The Na3 – 2xNbxAl2 – x(PO4)3 (х = 0.9, 1, 1.1) mate 2) rials  crystallize  in  a  hexagonal  structure.  The  unit 2)cell parameters of NaNbAl(PO4)3 agree well those reported earlier  [6,  7].  With  increasing  aluminum  content,  the а parameter and the unit 2)cell volume decrease, whereas the  с  parameter  increases  (Table  1).  This  can  be accounted  or  by  the  smaller  ionic  radius  of  aluminum (0.53 Å) compared to niobium (0.64 Å) [9].

The Arrhenius plot of conductivity for LiNbAl(PO4)3 has the form of a straight line with an activation energy of 65.3(3) kJ/mol (Fig. 2). Over the entire temperature range studied,  the  conductivity  of  LiNbAl(PO4)3  is  substan 2) tially lower than that of the LiNbM(PO4)3 (M = In, Fe) compounds (Table 2) [10, 11]. It is of interest to note that the conductivity of these materials increases with increas 2) ing  unit 2)cell  volume,  whereas  the  activation  energy  for conduction decreases. Since the coordination polyhe 2) dra of lithium in the NASICON structure share faces with those of the polyvalent cations, it is reasonable to assume that the size of the coordination polyhedra correlates with the unit 2)cell volume. Therefore, the above behavior can be considered indirect evidence that the steric factor has a significant effect on the ionic conduc 2) tivity of such materials.

The  Arrhenius   plots  of  conductivity for  the Na3 – 2xAl2 – xNbx(PO4)3 samples also have the form of a straight lines (Fig. 3). With increasing sodium con 2) tent (3 – 2x), their conductivity increases. The acti 2) vation energy for conduction is 96.6 ± 0.9, 109.3 ± 0.8, and 59.3 ± 0.5 kJ/mol at x = 1, 0.9, and 1.1, respectively. Thus, we are led to conclude that the interstitial conductivity in the Na3 – 2xNbxAl2 – x(PO4)3 materials consider 2) ably exceeds the vacancy conductivity.

The conductivity of the Na3 – 2xNbxAl2 – x(PO4)3 (х = 0.9, 1, 1.1) samples is well below that of LiNbAl(PO4)3. This  is  also  attributable  to  the  steric  factor:  sodium ion transport is hindered because of the large ionic radius of  Na.  For  example,  the  unit 2)cell  parameters  of NaZr2(PO4)3, the parent compound of the NASICON family, are a = 8.81 Å and c = 22.78 Å [12].

A3  –  2xNbxAl2  –  x(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na) mixed 2)cation phosphates  were  characterized  by  impedance  spectros 2) copy  and  X 2)ray  diffraction.  The  highest  content  of  the rhombohedral phase LiNbAl(PO4)3 was reached by long 2) term annealing at temperatures from 970 to 1020 K. The conductivity of LiNbAl(PO4)3 considerably exceeds that of NaNbAl(PO4)3.
