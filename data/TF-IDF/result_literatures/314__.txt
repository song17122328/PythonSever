High cut-off voltage in lithium ion batteries (LIBs), now, is the vital threshold for further development of high  energy density LIBs. In this work, the NASICON type solid electrolyte as high working voltage and unique ionic  transfer rate material is introduced to facilitate the high cut-off performance of Ni-rich cathode material. Herein,  considering the uniformity of coating outer layer, the charge attraction is employed as a coating method to form  a homogeneous coating layer. The coating properties of LiTi2(PO4)3 coated LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 probed via X-ray  diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  Typically, electrochemical tests show that LiTi2(PO4)3 was effectively promoting the electrochemical characters.  The modified material preserves 94% after 100 cycles at 1C in voltage of 2.7–4.3 V. Especially, it maintains  92.3%/83.6%  in  high  cut-off  voltage  of  2.7–4.5 V/2.7–4.8 V  for  100  cycles,  and  keeps  117.4 mA h g 0) 1/  101.2 mA h g 0) 1 after 500 long cycles.   

The  Ni-rich  cathode  material  LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2  (NCM)  attracts  immense attentions for its ultra-high capacity and possesses extraordinary potential to replace the conventional LiCoO2 cathode material on  lithium ion batteries (LIBs) application. Unfortunately, the poor cycling  and high current density performance restrain the further development  of NCM, especially for high cut-off voltage performance [1]. Moreover,  it faces few hurdles, including the residual of lithium [2], the side reaction  and  inevitable  citation  mixing  [3,4].  It  prevents  the  further  development of NCM. Hence, it is imperative to facilitate the high cut-off  voltage  application  on  NCM.  Recently,  numerous  works  had  been  applied in modification of NCM. The typically and effectively method is  surface modification. Variety of materials, such as Al2O3 [5,6], TiO2 [7],  SiO2  [8], ZrO2  [9], La2O3  [10], Y2O3  [11], ZnO [12], were used as  surface  coating  materials  to  improve  its  performance.  However,  the  coating material merely obtains a uniform coting skin, simultaneously,  lacking of well ionic conductivity to accelerate the lithium ion diffusion  in electrochemical reactions. Most coating layers are just adhered or attached insignificantly on the cathode material, which might easily  exfoliate by extra mechanical force and more likely to agglomerate itself  instead of covering on surface of cathode material uniformly.  Therefore, fast lithium ion conductors, as a prominent coating materials,  are  introduced  to  modify  Ni-rich  cathode  materials,  such  as  LiTi2(PO4)3 [13], Li3PO4 [14–16], Li2SiO3 [17,18], NaTi2(PO4)3 [19],  Li2ZrO3 [20,21]. These lithium ion conductors not only behave excellent  ionic conductivity, it also obtains superior stability, enhancing the Liþ diffusion between the electrolyte and cathode materials and preventing  the side reactions in electrolyte.  NASICON-type  LiTi2(PO4)3  (LTP)  [13],  which  is  a  superior  solid  electrolyte,  presents  ultrahigh  Liþ conductivity  in  the  group  of  LixM2(PO4)3.  LTP,  herein,  as  a  coating  material,  is  unprecedently  introduced to facilitate the stability and electrochemical performance in  NCM cathode material. What is worthing to note is that this work is  associated with charge attraction, which attributes to positive charge  and negative charge attract each other, improving the combination of  NCM  and  coating  material.  As  a  result,  we  successfully  obtain  the  NCM@LTP cathode material and facilitate the stability of NCM and 

The  commonly  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)2  was  obtained  by  a  co precipitation  method.  Typically,  as  mentioned  precursor  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)2 was mixed with LiOH in a molar ratio of 1:1.05. Then  the mixture was firstly calcined at 480 �C for 5 h and subsequently sintered to 850 �C for 12 h under oxygen atmosphere with a heating rate for  5 �C min 0) 1 and finally cooled to room temperature automatically.  To prepare NCM@LTP cathode material, NCM powder and 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (KH540) was stirred in ethanol overnight, and  washed by ethanol few times, and dried at 80 �C to obtain KH-NCM.  Then the desirable mole ratio of H3PO4, Lithium Acetate (CH3COOLi)  and Tetrabutyl titanate (TT) were dissolved into the beaker separately  (named as solution A, solution B and solution C). After that, three solutions (solution A, B and C) were mixed together to obtain the ivory sol  precursor by slowly agitation. Next, KH-NCM was introduced into the  ivory sol precursor above with optimum liquid-solid ratio of 10:1. Then  the mixture was agitated at 80 �C for at lest 1.5 h until converted into dry  slurry with evaporation. Then the powder was sintered at 700 �C in  oxygen  atmosphere  for  1 h  at  the  heating  rate  of  5 �C  min 0) 1.  For  compassion, The NCM, NCM@LTP-1%, NCM@LTP-2%, NCM@LTP-3%  were synthesized by adjusting the initial LTP amount to 0 wt%, 1 wt%,  2 wt%, 3 wt% respectively, via the same processing. 

Wildly-used X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with the  diffraction angle range from 10 to 90 with a scanning speed of 10� min 0) 1 by a Rint-2000, Rigaku type X-ray diffractometer. As for lattice  parameters of refinement were taken by 2� min 0) 1  range from 10� to  100�, the results were refined with Rietveld method by the software of  GSAS. Morphological characters were tested by scanning electron microscopy (Czech, Nova Nano SEM230,30 kV) which correspond with an  energy  dispersive  spectrometer  (EDS).  Lattice  finger  features  were  analyzed via Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Japan, JEOL 2100 F, 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was taken by  Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi to probe the valence of elements. 

The  electrochemical  performances  were  measured  in  the  typical  CR2025 coin cells for all below. The cathode material was prepared via  pasting the mixture of active material with carbon black and PVDF in  weight ratio of 8:1:1. After that, the appropriate N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  (NMP) was added into mixture to form a homogeneous slurry by milling.  The slurry was immediately filmed on current collector (aluminum foil)  with the humidity less than 20% followed by drying at 120 �C in vacuum  to remove the NMP. This approach made the active material bond in Al  foil to obtain the current collector. The current collector was then cut  into a circle of 12 mm and settled in positive shell of CR2025 followed by  drying at 60 �C in vacuum to eliminate the water. The electrolyte was  1 M LiPF6 dissolved in EC þ DMC þ EMC (1:1:1 in volume) solution.  Separator is a polypropylene (Celgard 2400). The coin type cells were  assembled in a glovebox with argon atmosphere protected in which
