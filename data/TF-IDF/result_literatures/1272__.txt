The   kinetic   properties   of  Li   insertion   in   NASICON-type   Li3V2(PO4)3 cathodes   were   enhanced   substantially   by   Al3+ and   Cl− multivalent   substitutions   of   various   concentrations.   Pristine   and   carbon   coated, Al-doped   Li3V2(PO4)3 were   also   prepared   by   a  conventional   solid-state   approach   under   optimized   conditions.   Samples   phase   purity   was   investigated   through   X-ray   diffractometry.   Li   insertion   was  studied   in half-cells   at   3-4.8   V   vs.  Li   for   the   removal   of   3  mol   of   Li.   Carbon-coated   Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 showed the   highest   reversible   insertion   of  2.71   mol   of   Li   (178   mAh   g−1)   at   a  current   density   of  0.2   mA   cm−2.   It showed   a  capacity   retention   of   over   80%   after   100   cycles.   Cl− substitution   led   to  improved   performance under   harsh   conditions   of   15   C   rate   and   high   temperature   (50 ◦C).   The   enhancement   of   Li   ion   kinetics was   demonstrated   through   cyclic   voltammetry   in   a  two-electrode   conﬁguration   and   electrochemical impedance   spectroscopy   conﬁrmed   the   enhanced   conductivity.

Since  the  discovery  of  Li  ions  reversible  insertion  and  extraction in  LiFePO4 polyanionic  frameworks  [1]  much  work  has  sought  to 3− based develop  high-performance,  Li-ion  cells  containing  (PO)4 3− can  increase  thermal  stability  because electrodes  [2–4].  (PO)4 strong  P  O  bonds  are  present  in  both  the  lithiated  and  the  delithiated  states  and  inductive  effects  of  such  anion  lead  to  very  ﬂat charge–discharge  proﬁles  [2,5–7].   Several  polyanionic  frameworks, such  as  LiMnPO4,  LiCoPO4,  Li3V2(PO4)3,  and  LiTi2(PO4)3,  have  been explored  as  possible  electrodes  for  Li-ion  batteries  (LIB)  [2,7–11]. 3− based  ﬂuorophosphates  have  also  been  investiSimilarly,  (PO)4 gated  as  prospective  electrodes  for  LIBs  for  example  LiVPO4F  [12], Li5V(PO4)2F2 [13],  LiFePO4F  [14],  LiTiPO4F  [15],  Li2CoPO4F  [16], Li2MnPO4F  [17]  Li2FePO4F  and  Na2FePO4F  [18].

Li3V2(PO4)3 is  a  promising  cathode  material  for  lithium  bat∼197  mAh   g−1 for  the tery.  It  shows  a  high  theoretical  capacity  of  removal  of  3  mol   of  lithium  and  high  thermal  and  electrochemical  stabilities.  It  is  simple  and  inexpensive  to  prepare  and  can operate  at  high  potentials  [7].  However,  distorted  arrangements of  VO6 octahedral  units  in  the  NASICON  structure  provide  inherent conducting  properties.  To  overcome  this  issue  carbon  coating  and

doping  at  vanadium  sites  are  attempted  and  improvement  in  the electrochemical  properties  of  Li3V2(PO4)3 have  resulted  [6].   The removal  of  the  third  Li  ion  in  monoclinic  Li3V2(PO4)3 destroys  the structure,  leading  to  severe  capacity  fading  during  charging  and  discharging.  Therefore,  most  research  has  been  limited  to  the  removal ∼132  mAh  g−1)  from of  only  2  mol   of  lithium  (theoretical  capacity  the  matrix  to  allow  stable  cycling  [13].  Monoclinic  Li3V2(PO4)3 can exhibit  good  electrochemical  properties  through  carbon  coating  or vanadium  site  doping;  though  the  removal  of  2  or  3  mol   of  Li  is kinetically  slow,  which  makes  achieving  the  theoretical  capacity difﬁcult.  Improved  Li-ion  kinetics  is  necessary  to  achieve  highperformance  electrodes  in  practical  cells. 3− based  materials  generally  exhibit  poor  conductivity  and  hence  less  work  has  attempted to  increase  inherent  conductivity  by  modifying  anion  sites.  Kang and  Ceder  [19]  demonstrated  that  oxygen-deﬁcient,  olivine-phase LiFePO4 (LiFe0.9P0.95O4−ı)  showed  ultrafast  charge–discharge  capabilities  and  improved  Li  insertion  kinetics.  Lee  et  al.  [20]  reported sulfur-substituted,  olivine-phase  LiFePO4 (LiFePO3.98S0.03)  with enhanced  performance  at  high  temperatures  of  50  and  60 ◦C.  Pan et  al.  [21]  reported  ﬂuorine-substituted,  carbon-coated,  olivine phosphate  (C-LiFe(PO4)0.85F0.15)  with  improved  high-current  and kinetic  properties.  Goodenough  and  co-workers  [22]  reported  the improved  charge-transfer  kinetics  of  LiFePO4 by  anion  site  modiﬁcations  with  sulfur  and  nitrogen  via  density  functional  theory (DFT)  calculations.  Zhong  et  al.  [23]  demonstrated  that  the  ﬂuorine doping  of  oxygen  sites  in  Li3V2(PO4)3 material  (Li3V2(PO4)2.9F0.1) improved  Li  insertion  properties.

Chlorine  doping  can  also  improve  the  electronic  properties  of LiFePO4 by  perfectly  replacing  oxygen  in  the  tetraheldral  sites [24].  This  has  been  conﬁrmed  through  DFT  calculations  by  Dinh et  al.  [25].  Sun  et  al.  [26]  demonstrated  C-LiFePO4 cathodes  with improved  electrochemical  properties  and  improved  Li  insertion kinetics  under  harsh  conditions  (20  C)  through  chlorine  doping. Yan  et  al.  [24]  produced  chlorine  doping  on  anion  sites  along  with carbon  coating  for  Li3V2(PO4)3 and  found  the  improved  electrochemical  properties  for  the  removal  of  2  mol   of  Li. The  inﬂuence  of  Cl− substitution  in  the  anion  sites  of  NASICONtype  Li3V2(PO4)3 for  the  removal  of  3  mol   of  Li  has  not  yet  been studied.  Hence,  this  work  reports  the  removal  of  3  mol   of  Li  by  the substitution  of  Al3+ and  Cl− in  vanadium  and  anion  sites,  respectively,  along  with  carbon  coating.  Further,  this  work  draws  on previous  work  reporting  the  optimization  of  Al3+ doping  and  carbon coating.  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 was  chosen  for  Cl− substitution  [9]. It  is  well  known  that,  vanadium  site  doping  enhances  ionic  conductivity  whereas  carbon  coating  improves  the  electronic  conductivity of  NASICON-type  Li3V2(PO4)3.  Here,  the  effects  of  Cl− concentration on  the  electrochemical  properties  of  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3−xClx (x  =  0.01,  0.03  and  0.05)  are  reported  for  the  ﬁrst  time.

Al3+ and  Cl− substituted  NASICON-type  Li3V2(PO4)3 materials  were  prepared  by  a  solid-state  approach.  All  chemicals were  of  analytical  grade  and  used  without  further  puriﬁcation. Brieﬂy,  stoichiometric  amounts  of  Li2CO3 (Wako,  Japan),  V2O5 (Sigma–Aldrich,  USA),  Al(OH)3 (Sigma–Aldrich,  USA),  (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma–Aldrich,  USA)  and  adipic  acid  (Sigma–Aldrich,  USA)  were ﬁnely  ground  in  an  agate  mortar  and  calcined  at  300 ◦C  for  4  h  to eliminate  ammonium  and  hydroxyl  moieties.  Then  the  intermediate  product  was  thoroughly  ground  and  formed  into  a  pellet, which  was  sintered  at  900 ◦C  for  8  h  under  an  Ar  ﬂow  to  yield single-phase,  carbon-coated  Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 (hereafter  abbreviated  as  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3).  Chlorine-substituted  samples (C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3−xClx,  x  =  0.01,  0.03  and  0.05)  were  similarly prepared  using  appropriate  amounts  of  NH4Cl  (Sigma–Aldrich, USA).  Structural  properties  were  analyzed  by  X-ray  diffraction measurements  (Rint  1000,  Rigaku,  Japan)  equipped  with  CuK␣   radiation.  Powders  surface  morphologies  were  studied  by  scanning electron  microscopy  (FE-SEM,  S4700,  Hitachi,  Japan)  and  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM,  TECNAI,  Philips,  Netherlands). Standard  CR2032  coin  cells  were  assembled  for  the  evaluation  of the  electrochemical  properties  of  the  materials.  Test  electrodes were  formulated  with  20  mg   active  material,  3  mg   Ketzen  black  and 3  mg   conductive  binder  (Teﬂonized  acetylene  black,  TAB-2).  They were  pressed  on  a  200  mm2 area  stainless  steel  mesh,  which  served as  the  current  collector,  and  dried  at  160 ◦C  for  4  h  in  a  vacuum  oven. Coin-cells  were  assembled  in  an  Ar-ﬁlled  glove  box.  Test  cells  were constructed  with  composite  cathode,  metallic  lithium  anode  and porous  polypropylene  ﬁlm  separator  (Celgard  3401,  USA)  with  an electrolyte  of  1  M  LiPF6 in  ethylene  carbonate  (EC)/dimethyl  carbonate  (DMC,  1:1  by  vol.,  Techno  Semichem  Co.,  Ltd.,  Korea).  Cyclic voltammetry  (CV)  and  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopic (EIS)  studies  were  conducted  by  two-electrode  setup  using  a  BioLogic  electrochemical  work  station  (SP-150,  Biologic,  France),  in which  metallic  lithium  acts  as  both  working  and  counter  electrode. Galvanostatic  charge–discharge  testing  was  conducted  between  3 and  4.8  V  vs.  Li  at  a  current  density  of  0.2  mA   cm−2 at  ambient  and elevated  temperatures.

Fig.  1(a)  shows  the  typical  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD) pattern  of  NASICON  type  Li3V2(PO4)3 powders.  The  observed

XRD  reﬂection  clearly  indicates  the  formation  of  single  phase compounds  without  any  impurity  traces  and  it  belongs  to  monoclinic  structure  with  P21/n  space  group  [7].   The  substitution of  Al3+ and  Cl− in  vanadium  and  oxygen  sites  did  not  affect the  formation  of  a  single  phase  and  this  is  probably  due  to  the concentration  of  both  Al3+ and  Cl− is  found  too  low  to  induce  the structural  change.  The  presence  of  Cl− ions  in  the  compounds  was conﬁrmed  though  EDAX  analysis  (Figure  S1).  Rietveld  analysis also  showed  the  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 structure comprised  three-dimensional  frameworks  of  VO6 octahedral  units and  PO4 tetrahedral  units  sharing  oxygen  vertices  (Fig.  1(b)).  Each VO6 octahedral  unit  was   surrounded  by  six  PO4 tetrahedral  units; each  tetrahedral  unit  was   surrounded  by  four  VO6 octahedral units  [7].   This  conﬁguration  forms  a  three-dimensional  network and  the  alkali  cation,  Li,  is  located  in  the  cavities  within  the framework.  Three  four-fold  crystallographic  positions  exist  for the  lithium  atoms,  leading  to  twelve  lithium  positions  within  the unit-cell  [27].  Such  an  arrangement  gives  inferior  conductivity; hence  carbon  coating  was  employed  along  with  substitutions  at vanadium  and  oxygen  sites.  There  is  no  big  difference  compared with  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 material  in  crystallographic  aspect during  Cl− substitution.  However,  reduction  in  lattice  parameter values  describes  the  Al3+ doping  and  further  increase  in  values corresponds  to  the  substitution  of  Cl− in  O  atom  positions  which is  clearly  evident  from  Table  1  and  Figure  S2  [22,26].

current  density  of  0.2  mA   cm−2 at  room  temperature.  All  the samples  charge  and  discharge  curves  show  evidence  of  multi-step reactions  during  Li  extraction  and  insertion  (Fig.  2),  corresponding to  two-phase  reactions.  During  charging,  the  two-step  extraction ∼3.6  V  (Li2.5V2(PO4)3)  and of  the  ﬁrst  Li  (1  mol   of  Li)  occurred  at  ∼3.7  V  vs.  Li  (Li2V2(PO4)3)  and  led  to  the  formation  of  a  more ordered  phase  of  Li2V2(PO4)3.  Removal  of  the  second  Li  (totally ∼4.1  V  vs.  Li  with  a  long  distinct  plateau; 2  mol   of  Li)  occurred  at  the  resulting  LiV2(PO4)3 preserved  the  monoclinic  symmetry  of the  lattice  [28–30].   The  above  three  distinct  plateau  regions  correspond  to  the  removal  of  ﬁrst  2  mol   of  Li  and  are  associated  with  the V3+/V4+ redox  couple.  Extraction  of  the  ﬁnal  third  Li  (totally  3  mol   of ∼4.55  V  vs.  Li  to  form  de-lithiated  Li0V2(PO4)3,  comLi)  occurred  at  prising  a  mixture  of  valance  states  V4+ and  V5+.  During  discharging, ∼3.55  V  vs.  Li;  a  monotonic reversible  Li  insertion  occurred  at  ∼4  V  vs.  Li curve  followed  by  two  distinct  plateaus  at  resulted,  corresponding  to  the  3  mol   of  Li.  The  long  monotonic curve  indicates  the  reversible  insertion  of  2  mol   of  Li,  such  a  curve is  generally  associated  with  the  formation  of  a  solid  solution.  The two  short  and  ﬂat  discharge  curves  followed  by  a  monotonic  curve correspond  to  the  re-insertion  of  the  third  Li  with  a  bi-phase  mechanism:  Li2V2(PO4)3 →   Li3V2(PO4)3.  Cells  based  on Li3V2(PO4)3,  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3,  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01, C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.97Cl0.03 and  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.95Cl0.05 delivered  reversible  capacities  of  159  (2.42  mol   of  Li),  172  (2.62  mol of  Li),  178  (2.71  mol   of  Li),  176  (2.68  mol   of  Li)  and  173  (2.63  mol of  Li)  mAh   g−1,  respectively.  All  cases  showed  some  irreversible its capacity  inherent  conducting  behavior  and  its  high  operating  potential, which  was  greater  than  the  safe  operation  limit  of  conventional carbonate-based  electrolytes  (>4.6  V  vs.  Li)  [31].  Initial  reversible capacity  loss  was  less  in  the  Cl− substituted  compounds  than  in  the pristine  and  the  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 materials.  0.01  mol   Cl− substitution  resulted  in  the  best  cell  performance.  Its  higher  reversible capacity  was  attributed  mainly  to  better  kinetic  properties  during Li  insertion  and  extraction,  due  to  the  Al3+ and  Cl− substitutions,

which  improved  electronic  conductivity.  At  higher  concentration of  Cl− substitution  (beyond  0.01  mol)  provides  the  formation  of Cl− clusters  over  the  surface  results  poor  performance  than  least concentration.

Galvanostatic  charge  and  discharge  test  was  extended  to  100 cycles  under  the  same  condition  to  study  the  samples  cycling stability  with  respect  to  Cl− concentration  (Fig.  3).  All  the  compounds  showed  capacity  fading  during  cycling.  This  was   attributed to  the  destruction  of  the  crystal  structure  during  the  removal of  the  third  mole  of  Li  – hence  most  reported  work  has  only attempted  the  removal  of  2  mol   of  Li  by  restricting  the  upper  cutoff  potential  to  4.3  V  vs.  Li.  Capacity  fading  was  believed  of  such phases  due  to  the  poor  compatibility  of  vanadium  compounds toward  linear  carbonates  [32],  vanadium  dissolution  [33]  and  the use  of  an  extended  potential  range  (upper  cut-off  potential  4.8  V vs.  Li)  higher  than  the  thermodynamical  stability  of  conventional electrolytes  (∼4.6  V  vs.  Li),  resulting  in  the  decomposition  of  the electrolyte  [31].  In  the  second  cycle,  all  the  cathodes  showed increased  reversible  capacity  except  the  native  compound.  Capacity  retentions,  calculated  from  the  second  cycle  onwards,  were 70,  77,  80,  80  and  81%  for  Li3V2(PO4)3,  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3, C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01,  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.97Cl0.03 and C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.95Cl0.05,  respectively.  This  demonstrates  that anion  site  Cl− doping  in  Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 provided  higher 3− reversible  capacity  with  improved  capacity  retention.  (PO)4 based  polyanions  hinder  Li  ions  kinetics  during  charging  and  discharging,  though  the  substitution  of  a  small  amount  of  Cl− in oxygen  sites  was   shown  here  to  remedy  the  poor  kinetics.

To  understand  the  Li-ion  kinetics  during  electrochemical charge/discharge  process,  a  cyclic  voltammetry  studies  (CV)  were conducted  and  presented  in  Fig.  4.  Only  selective  samples  were subjected  for  CV  analysis.  It  is  obvious  to  notice  the  presence  of ∼4.14  V  vs.  Li  for  all very  sharp  intense  peaks  at  ∼3.64,  the  three  compositions  tested  which  is  associated  for  oxidation of  V3+ to  V4+ for  the  removal  of  2  mol   of  Li.  Another  peak  poten∼4.57  V  vs.  Li  corresponds  to  the  partial  oxidation  of  V4+ to tial  at  V5+ to  form  de-lithiated  phase.  Similarly,  during  discharge  process, ∼4.57  V  vs.  Li  are  merged ∼4.14  and  oxidation  peak  potentials  at  ∼3.99  V  vs.  Li.  This  broad together  and  appeared  as  broad  peak  at  peak  is  the  indication  of  formation  of  the  solid-solution  and  associated  with  the  reversible  insertion  of  2  mol  of  Li  [30].  The  less  intense ∼3.5  V  vs.  Li  related  to  the  insersharp  peak  potentials  at  tion  of  1  mol   of  Li.  The  sharp  peak  potentials  are  ascribed  to  the two-phase  reaction  mechanism  and  broad  peak  potential  is  due  to the  single  phase  reaction/formation  of  solid-solution.  The  observed peaks  are  consistent  with  the  galvanostatic  charge/discharge

Cyclic  voltammetry  traces  of  Li3V2(PO4)3,  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 and  CLi3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 in  two-electrode  half-cell  conﬁgurations  cycled  between 3   and  4.8  V  vs.  Li  at  slow  scan  rate  of  0.1  mV  s−1.  Metallic  lithium  was   used  as  both counter  and  reference  electrodes.

curves.  Variation  in  the  peak  currents  are  noted  for  Li3V2(PO4)3, C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 and  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 cathodes, although  all  three  test  electrodes  are  formulated  with  same  amount of  mass  loadings  (20  mg).  Very  high  peak  current  is  noticed  for  CLi3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 compared  to  rest  of  the  two  electrodes, which  is  mainly  due  to  the  improved  Li-ion  kinetics  by  Cl− substitution  during  oxidation  and  reduction  process.  Previously,  we  had reported  that  the  increase  in  Li-ion  kinetics  is  enabled  by  vanadium site  (Al3+)  substitution  and  carbon  coating  (C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3), which  is  clearly  evident  from  the  increase  in  peak  current  [9].   After the  Cl− substitution  on  oxygen  sites  drastically  improves  the  peak current  and  small  shifting  of  insertion  potential  toward  higher  voltage  are  observed  which  clearly  reveal  the  enhanced  Li-ion  kinetic properties.

For  high-power  Li-ion  cells  to  be  used  in  electric  vehicles,  they must  be  able  to  provide  high  current  performance  at  elevated  temperatures  [34].  Al3+ doped  cathodes  have  previously  shown  suitability  for  such  cells,  particularly  at  elevated  temperatures  of  50 ◦C [9].  Half-cell  conﬁgurations  were  assembled  using  Li3V2(PO4)3, C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 and  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 and  then cycled  (Fig.  5(a)).  Except  during  the  initial  cycles,  the  cell with  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 delivered  better  Li  insertion characteristics  than  C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 at  high  temperature. However,  speciﬁc  capacity  values  are  increased  after  certain cycle  which  is  due  to  the  slower  participation  of  the  active material  in  the  electrochemical  reaction  in  such  high  amount of  mass  loading  (20  mg).  Here,  200  mAh   g−1 is  assumed  as  1  C. Li-ion  cells  for  electric  vehicles  must  show  high  rate  performances,  therefore  two  cells  were  subjected  for  high-current  testing. Reversible  capacity  decreased  during  prolonged  cycling.  After  100 cycles,  Li/Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 half-cell  delivered  excellent reversible  capacities  of  143  and  103  mAh   g−1 at  0.05  and  15  C  rates, respectively. To  validate  the  inﬂuence  of  Cl− substitution  on  the  electronic conductivity  proﬁles  of  NASICON  type  Li3V2(PO4)3 compounds, an  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  was  recorded and  presented  in  Fig.  6.  The  EIS  traces  contains  three  important parts,  among  them  appearance  of  high  frequency  semicircle region  is  attributed  to  the  solid  electrolyte  interface  (SEI)  ﬁlm formation  and/or  contact  resistance,  the  medium  frequency  region is  associated  with  charge-transfer  (CT)  impedance  across  electrode/electrolyte  interface,  and  45◦ inclined  vertical  tails  indicates the  lithium  diffusion  kinetics  toward  the  electrodes  called  as  Warburg  resistance  [35].  Intercept  at  the  Zreal axis  in  high  frequency

region  corresponds  to  the  ohmic  resistance  (Rs),  which  includes  the total  resistance  of  the  electrolyte  solution  (1  M  LiPF6 in  EC/DMC), separator  and  electrical  contacts.  The  direct  measurement  of charge  transfer  (CT)  impedance  is  mainly  due  to  the  electronic conducting  properties  of  the  any  active  material.  It  is  obvious to  notice  that  the  diameter  of  semicircle  in  medium-frequency region  for  NASICON  type  materials  are  decreased  (CT  resistance) after  the  carbon  coating  and  Al3+ doping  on  vanadium  site.  The  Cl− substitution  on  oxygen  sites  leads  to  the  further  reduction  in  CT resistance  value  which  is  evidently  seen  in  Fig.  6.  This  EIS  spectra clearly  indicate  that  anion  site  doping  effectively  contribute  to  the increase  in  electronic  conductivity  of  the  materials  and  thereby improving  Li-ion  kinetics  during  electrochemical  charge–discharge process.  The  observed  increases  in  electronic  conductivity  proﬁles are  consistent  with  the  theoretical  predictions  by  Dinh  et  al.  [25]. C-Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 powder  was  observed  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (Fig.  7).  It  comprised  highly  aggregated, irregular  particles,  which  emerged  during  solid-state  reactions  for

The  kinetics  of  Li-ion  insertion  was  enhanced  in  carbon-coated, NASICON-type  Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)3 materials  by  Cl− substitution  in oxygen  sites.  Phase  purity  and  the  carbon  coating  layer  (∼10  nm thickness)  were  conﬁrmed  through  X-ray  diffractometry  and high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy,  respectively. Galvanostatic  charging  and  discharging  testing  of  Li  insertion showed  that  carbon-coated  Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 delivered  a maximum  reversible  capacity  of  178  mAh   g−1 at  a  current  density  of 0.2  mA   cm−2.  Good  capacity  retention  over  100  cycles  was   observed in  the  Cl− substituted  materials  compared  with  pristine  and  Al3+ doped  samples.  The  carbon-coated  Li3V1.98Al0.02(PO4)2.99Cl0.01 presented  excellent  cell  performances  under  harsh  conditions  and elevated  temperatures.  These  results  demonstrate  that  Cl− substitution  in  polyanionic  frameworks  can  improve  Li-ion  kinetics and  thereby  improve  battery  performance.  This  approach  could  be extended  to  other  polyanionic  framework  materials  and  could  ﬁnd applicability  in  the  fabrication  of  high  performance  Li-ion  power packs.
