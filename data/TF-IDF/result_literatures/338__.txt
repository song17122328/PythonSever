In this work we report a detailed structural study of the K2-xNaxMg2(SO4)3 series in order to evaluate the effect of Na incorporation on the structure. The results show that the cubic langbeinite structure is observed at room temperature for high Na levels; K2-xNaxMg2(SO4)3 (0  x  1.8). Increasing the Na content further, 1.8 < x  1.9, leads to signiﬁcant structural distortions, with the observation of an enlarged orthorhombic cell. These latter systems resemble a highly distorted variant of the langbeinite structure, and this relationship is also illustrated by the fact that they transform to the cubic langbeinite structure at relatively low temperature (200 C). In conjunction with our prior studies on Na2Mg2(SO4)3 (complex monoclinic cell, which also transforms to langbeinite at elevated temperature), this work highlights the ﬂexibility of the langbeinite structure to accommodate high levels of Na ions, thus offering another potential avenue to manipulate the properties of materials with this structure-type.


Materials with the langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3) structure have attracted attention in a wide variety of areas. In geology, interest in them has principally derived from their study to help to understand sulphate planetochemistry and the formation of marine salt deposits on Earth [1]. In addition, there have been attempts to use K2Mg2(SO4)3 mineral for absolute dating via the 40Ar/40K method [2]. Other studies have involved investigations into thermoluminescence properties occurring in doped langbeinites [3,4]. While at room temperature, langbeinite systems show cubic symmetry, there have been reports of lowering of the symmetry to tetragonal or orthorhombic for some langbeinite-type phases at low temperature, leading to polar crystals which show ferroelectric properties [5–8]. More recently, there has been interest in the potential use of these systems as Na ion conducting electrolytes, albeit with low conductivity observed [9]. Further interest has been generated in their potential use as electrodes for Na-ion batteries. In this respect, Tarascon et al. have shown that K2Fe2(SO4)3 can be used in a Na-ion battery via electrochemical exchange of K by Na in a Na-ion conducting electrolyte, albeit the capacity was low due to the low level of exchange [10].

The original structure of langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3) itself was studied by Zemann and Zemann in 1957 [11].

The coordination of the two potassium sites differs; the K1 site is 9-coordinate while the K2 site is 12 coordinate. A close inspection of the structure shows that the larger K1 site cavity could potentially be considered as 15-coordinated if evaluated from the centre of the cavity. However, due to the fact that the K in this site is slightly shifted off-centre, the effective coordination is 9-coordinate. These K ion cavities form a 1-3-3-1 pattern with respect to the metal octahedra that form the general cage containing them (Fig. 1); two types of metal octahedra alternate (Mg1-Mg2-Mg1-Mg2) to form the cage through corner sharing with the SO4 tetrahedra.

Structurally the general framework of corner linked octahedra and tetrahedra shows some similarity with that of the Nasicon structure, widely studied as excellent Li/Na ion conductors [12–14]. However, while the Nasicon structure has four cavity sites within the framework, a key aspect of the langbeinite structure is the presence of only two cavity sites within the structure. The large size of these cavity sites means that the langbeinite structure favours larger alkali ions like potassium, caesium, and rubidium, while the Nasicon structure prefers smaller alkali ions such as Na, Li. Despite this, there have been some reports of Na incorporation in langbeinite-type phase, provided that some larger catto stabilise the framework, e.g. NaBaM2(PO4)3 ions are present


The investigation of the effect of substitution of sodium for potassium in K2Mg2(SO4)3 langbeinite revealed the presence of two structural systems in the studied range. It was shown that the cubic langbeinite structure could accommodate a large amount of Na in place of K. Thus K2xNaxMg2(SO4)3 exhibits the cubic langbeinite structure for 0  x  1.8 at room temperature (Fig. 2). For higher Na levels, 1.8 < x  1.9, a new noncubic phase, with very complex pattern, was observed. Through single crystal studies (see later), this phase was identiﬁed to be orthorhombic with a very large unit cell.

Detailed structural characterisations for selected samples across the series were performed on single crystals. These data suggest that the S–O bond lengths remain essentially unchanged across the series with increasing of Na content. This suggests that the SO4 unit is rigid and does not tolerate signiﬁcant distortions leading to loss of tetrahedral symmetry. However, there was evidence for signiﬁcant rotational disorder of the SO4 tetrahedra, which was ﬁtted by three split sites (Fig. 4). Speer et al. reported a similar behaviour in a range of potassium containing langbeinites, where such disorder increased with increasing ionic radii of divalent cation (Zn-Co-Mn-Cd) [25]. In that previous study, the disorder


Powder XRD data were collected on a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer with copper X-ray source, in reﬂection geometry, equipped with a Pixcel 2D detector. Variable temperature powder XRD data, up to 750 C, were collected on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer with copper X-ray source and LynxEye detector in an Anton Paar HTK1200N furnace. Rietveld reﬁnement using powder XRD data was performed using GSASII software [21].

For the single crystal studies, a suitable crystal was selected, mounted on glass ﬁbre, and diffraction data were collected on an Agilent SuperNova diffractometer using an Atlas detector. The crystals were kept at 100 K during data collection using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream. Using Olex2 [22], the structure was solved with the ShelXT [23]

In view of the structural complexity of these langbeinites and the limitations of diffraction techniques, where a high number of constraints are needed in order to obtain stable reﬁnements, we have performed Raman measurements with the aim of providing further information about the local coordination around the SO4 groups.

The band displays an unstructured aspect, as corresponds to a nondegenerate mode in a compound where all tetrahedra are crystallographically equivalent. However, a closer look highlights that this band is anomalous in several ways. First, and contrary to what would be expected according to lattice parameters, the ν1 frequency increases with K content, suggesting shorter S–O bonds despite the lattice expansion (Fig. 3). This behaviour is not uncommon: lattice expansion may result in weaker SO4 bonding with second neighbours, and thus in a reduction of the S–O bond lengths. While the crystallographic data suggest that the average S–O bond length appears to essentially remain constant


The structure of Na1.9K0.1Mg2(SO4)3 was solved from single crystal data (see tables T1-T3 in the supplementary information for the complete structural information, CSD deposition number CCDC 1899173). It is a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic cell with space group P212121. The structure is very complex, with a very large unit cell. The unit cell consists of the SO4 tetrahedra corner sharing with MgO6 octahedra or MgO5 square pyramid units, with the latter essentially highly distorted sixcoordinated octahedra with one longer bond distance (Fig. 12). The average interatomic distances in the MgO6 and the MgO5 units are 2.031(3)Å and 1.978(2)Å respectively. The presence of MgO5 square pyramids in sulphate crystals is not common, which is most likely due to the lower stability expected for such polar units. Here a very narrow range of bond distances and close to ideal bond valence sum þ2.030(27) might explain the formation of these polar pyramids.

Despite the orthorhombic symmetry and very large unit cell, structurally the system is closely related to that of langbeinite. Indeed, it can be considered as a highly relaxed 1  3  3 superstructure of langbeinite with some distorted MgO6 units. The origin of this complex superstructure lies in the ordering of the MgO5 pyramids (Fig. 13). The MgO5 pyramids are combined in two types of clusters in the crystal lattice. The ﬁrst type is a cluster of two square pyramids with non-parallel basefacing (double pyramid cluster). There are two orientations of this type of cluster in the unit cell forming two almost perpendicular surfaces (0 1 1) and (0–1 1) via symmetry. Both have polarisation along the a axis


The sodium sites form a 3D chiral network with relatively high translational symmetry related to a 1x1/3x1/3 subcell unit. Sites partially occupied with potassium form the same chiral network with opposite rotation. Fig. 15 shows that the distribution of the Na–O bonds for the Na only sites has a sharp peak at 2.471 Å. At the same time the distribution of Na/K–O bonds for mixed sites is more complex. The ﬁgure shows the presence of more than three broad distribution peaks. These can be described as spheres of oxygen surrounding the potassium containing sites, with the ﬁrst peak at 2.488 Å, second at 3.000 Å and third at 3.738 Å. This may indicate that K containing cavities are larger and have lower symmetry.

At higher temperature the structure of Na1.9K0.1Mg2(SO4)3 converts into the simple cubic P213 langbeinite structure (Fig. 16). A similar transition was previously reported for Na2Mg2(SO4)3 [17]. VTXRD showed that the phase transition into the cubic langbeinite structure occurs at a temperature slightly below 200 C (Fig. 17), which is a lower temperature than observed for Na2Mg2(SO4)3. In agreement with this phase transition, the DTA curve of the TGA experiment also showed a peak at 186.2 C (Fig. 17), corresponding to the phase transition. Cell volume data show a clear change at this phase transition (Fig. 18), with an effective discontinuous expansion at this temperature.

Considering strong motions of ions at high temperatures and the previously described signiﬁcant rotational disorder of SO4 units in related cubic langbeinite phases at room temperatures, we assumed that in this case similar rotational disorder might be observed. Rietveld reﬁnement using the high temperature powder diffraction data was, therefore, performed using a rigid body approach for the SO4 unit with splitting into three tetrahedrons with partial occupancy 1/3 in order to


As for the cubic langbeinite structure series, the SO4 tetrahedra are symmetrical, with a narrow distribution of bond lengths (Fig. 14), and an


The transition from the low temperature orthorhombic cell to high temperature cubic langbeinite can be explained by the fact that the structure of the former is similar to a 1  3  3 langbeinite supercell. Thus, the low temperature orthorhombic phase can be classed as a highly disordered variant of the langbeinite structure. While orthorhombic langbeinite phases have been previously reported below room temperature, e.g. K2(Ca/Cd)2(SO4)3 [4,5], the orthorhombic distortion is much lower than observed for the K0.1Na1.9Mg2(SO4)3 system reported here, and there was no evidence for an enlarged supercell in the former studies. The structural evolution of K0.1Na1.9Mg2(SO4)3 was also followed by Raman scattering from 77 K to 775 C (1048 K) (see the whole series of spectra in Figs. F3 and F4 of the supplementary material). Measurements below RT were undertaken in the search for a possible phase transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic symmetry, similar to the one detected in our previous study on Na2Mg2(SO4)3 at around 100 C [17]. As Fig. F3 shows, no clear evidence of new modes or of mode splitting can be ascertained, although some modes display an anomalous intensity increase that might be a hint of a nearby transition occurring perhaps below 77 K. On the contrary, the phase transition to cubic symmetry is clearly observed between 150 and 200 C, in perfect agreement with the XRD results (Fig. F4 supplementary). Above 200 C the cubic phase spectrum varies very little with increasing temperature; the observed broadening is ascribed to conventional thermal effects.


In this work we show that Na can be incorporated into the langbeinite phase, K2Mg2(SO4)3. The cubic langbeinite structure is maintained at room temperature for high Na levels; K2-xNaxMg2(SO4)3 (0  x  1.8). For higher Na levels, 1.8 < x  1.9, an enlarged orthorhombic cell is obtained, with the structure resembling a highly distorted variant of the langbeinite structure. This relationship is also illustrated by the fact that the latter phases transform to the cubic langbeinite structure at relatively low temperature (200 C). The work therefore highlights the ﬂexibility of the langbeinite structure to accommodate high levels of Na ions, thus offering another avenue to manipulate the properties of materials with this structure-type.
