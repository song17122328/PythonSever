Bivalent cations (M = Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+) with different doping contents (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) were incorporated for vanadium in the Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 (NVP), yielded enhanced rate performance and capacity retention. Successful doping of these cations in the NVP structure was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), vibrational FT-IR spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Improved electrochemical performance of substituted NVP cathode has been correlated to effective Na ion migration, which improved kinetics of charging and discharging properties. Mg2+ was possible to dope up to x = 0.5 in the NVP structure, which exhibited the superior electrochemical performance compared to that of Ni2+ and Co2+-doped NVP samples. Mg2+-doped NVP electrode exhibit fast Na ion kinetics with a specific capacity of 70 mAh g-1 at 20 C rate. Moreover, the oxidation state of the vanadium in the Mg2+ substituted NVP was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
During the last three decades, we witnessed a significant development in Li-ion battery technology, which facilitates the electrification of vehicles, grid-scale energy storage, and portable electronic devices.1 Thus, electrochemical energy storage technology has drawn substantial attention among scientists and engineers. We have recently developed novel electrodes and solid electrolytes for next generation robust Li and Na-based batteries.2-8 The scarcity of Li ore, uneven geographic distribution, and high price of Li have elicited an alternative energy storage technology with low price and high energy density.9 The similar electrochemical properties and the low cost of sodium ores make them attractive for the electrochemical energy storage.1, 10 The redox potential of sodium is about 0.3 V vs. Li, which makes it an ideal choice for the replacement of Li-based technology.10 However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ (1.02 √Ö) than Li+ (0.76 √Ö) evident into poor solubility and diffusion in the solid-state (electrodes).10 High electro-positivity and polarizability of Na system manifested into the lower cell voltage than the Li-ion batteries.11 In addition, the higher atomic weight of sodium results in low gravimetric and volumetric energy densities. Electrochemical studies have been carried out on various Na cathodes. NaMO2 (M = transition metals), NaMF3, NaFePO4, and V2O5 deliver a poor performance than its Li-analogues.10, 12-14 The sodium superionic conductor (NASICON-type) structure materials, discovered by J. B. Goodenough in 1968, attracted great attention for their faster Na-ion conduction.11, 15, 16 NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been investigated as a promising cathode for Na-ion battery because of its highly covalent three-dimensional framework having large interstitial space suitable for facile Na-ion diffusion during the charge-discharge reaction. A high specific energy density (~400 Wh kg-1) with the excellent thermal stability of NVP makes it suitable for large-scale energy storage.11,15, 17 Furthermore, NVP delivers a high voltage plateau (3.4 V/Na), which is relatively higher than the other Na cathodes. However, the distorted VO6 octahedra in the NVP structure results in low electronic conductivity, which is the bottleneck of its electrochemical performance.18 Carbonaceous material coating and nanostructured NVP materials were employed to enhance the electronic conductivity.18-20 Li et al.21 have fabricated a hierarchical dual carbon protected NVP hybrid structure (NVP@C‚∏¶C) by thermal annealing of precursor. The embedded structures enhanced the electrochemical performance because of porous and robust nature.21 Carbon-coated NVP cathode embedded in a porous  structure outperforms the lithium cathodes at higher current.22 Also, porous carbon supported NVP cathodes have been utilized to obtain a high energy density.19, 23 Several nanostructured   carbon and graphene coating on electrode surface dramatically improves the C-rate and cycling performance of NVP cathodes.24-28 However, modifying the bulk properties of the material is difficult by these approaches. An effective approach to improve the electrochemical properties of bulk material is the partial substitution of the transition metal ions in the electrode. Previous studies demonstrate the successful doping of Ni2+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Mg2+, Al3+, and Mn2+ at the V-site of NVP and associated electrochemical properties have been studied.29-33 The type of dopant and its amount can ameliorate the intrinsic properties of the cathode without altering the parental structures. Furthermore, aliovalent doping in NVP plays a crucial role in tuning the electrode properties.34 Here-in, we have doped the V3+- ions in NVP by bivalent metal ions and accommodate additional Na+ ions in the structures to maintain the charge balance. A higher capacity could be obtained if the additional Na+ is being utilized during the charge-discharge process.35 However, most of the studies on substitution on NVP cathode carried out with x ‚â§ 0.1 in Na3V2-xMx(PO4)3. Only handful of studies were reported on the highly substituted NVP cathode material.30,35,36 Herein, we have carried out a systematic electrochemical study of highly substituted Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 (M = Ni2+, Mg2+ and Co2+) (x = 0.1 to 0.5) electrodes for energy storage application.
Synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3 and substituted Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and bivalent metal-doped NVP cathode were prepared by a sol-gel method using CH3COONa, NH4VO3, NH4H2PO4, citric acid, Mg(CH3COO)2, Ni(CH3COO)2, and Co(CH3COO)2. All the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.  In a 40 mL 0.25 M aqueous solution of citric acid, 8 millimole of NH4VO3 was added and stirred at 80 ¬∞C. After 5 minutes, the NH4VO3 dissolved into solution and turned to transparent yellow colour. Then the stoichiometric amount of CH3COONa, metal acetate of corresponding dopant element, and NH4H2PO4 were added consecutively and continued for stirring at 80 ¬∞C. After 2 h of stirring, the solution becomes a blue coloured gel, and it was kept inside a vacuum oven for overnight at 80 ¬∞C. After drying in a vacuum oven, a blue coloured powder was obtained, which was then ground and calcined in an inert atmosphere at 350 ¬∞C for 4 h and then 800 ¬∞C for 8 h. The ramp rate of heating was 5 ¬∞C/min. A total of 15 samples were prepared and indexed as NVP-M-x (M = Ni, Co, Mg; x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. For e.g., Na3.1V1.9Ni0.1(PO4)3 and Na3.3V1.7Mg0.3(PO4)3 are assigned as NVP-Ni-1 and NVP-Mg-3, respectively. Material characterization. Powders XRD patterns were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance ECO diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation (40 kV; 25 mA). Le Bail fittings were performed on all patterns, and Rietveld refinements were performed for Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) and the x = 0.3 members of each M-substituted series using the FullProf suite of programs.37 Field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) analysis was carried out with Carl Zeiss supra 40. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyzer (OXFORD ISI 300 EDAX) attached to the Carl Zeiss supra 40 FESEM was employed to understand the elemental composition analysis of the electrode material. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic data was acquired using Thermo-Nicolet Nexus 470 instrument to understand the bond vibration of cathode material. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a METTLER TOLEDO thermal system TGA/DSC1 (HT 1600). The Inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometer data were acquired using Perkin Elmer Elan 6000 quadrupole ICPMS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed by employing Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD Imaging X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer.Electrode modification and cell assembly. As synthesized NVP and metal-doped NVP electrode powder were mixed with super P conductive carbon, PVDF binder with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in NMP solvent and uniformly coated over an Al foil. The electrode material coated Al foil was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 ¬∞C for overnight. The average mass loading of active material was ~1.5 (¬±0.2) mg cm-2. The cathode coated Al foil was then cut into 11.6 mm diameter circular disc electrode having an area of ~1 cm2. Metallic Na was cast on one side of the stainless-steel spacer. A CR2032 coin cell was simply fabricated using the cathode disc, and Na metal anode with a Whatman GF/D (Sigma-Aldrich) separator soaked in 1M NaClO4 in Propylene carbonate (PC) with 5 wt.% fluoro-ethylene carbonate (FEC) electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of all the electrode materials were evaluated by a Neware BTS 4000 battery test station.
Structure of Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+-doped NVP. The phase and crystallinity of all the bivalent metal doped NVP samples were studied employing X-ray diffraction (Figure 1). All the samples were found to be crystalline in nature with NASICON-type structure with R3ùëê space group (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS)  card # 53‚Äì0018).38 One Na+ ion occupies the six-fold coordinated site (M1) while two Na+ occupies an eight-fold coordinated site (M2). The two Na+ at the eight-fold coordinated site (M2) is weakly bound to the surrounded oxygen atoms and can be extracted at a potential range of 3.4 V vs. Na/Na+, whereas another Na+ can be inserted at the six-fold coordinated site (M1), while discharging below 1.6 V vs. Na/Na+. The potential range of 3.4 V vs. Na/Na+ is ideal for Na-ion battery and could deliver a high theoretical energy density of ~ 400 Wh kg-1.38
Figure 1a displays the XRD pattern of NVP and NVP-Ni samples. NVP-Ni-1 and NVP-Ni-2 have similar diffraction patterns as pristine/undoped NVP without having any impurities.  NVP with higher Ni substitution (NVP-Ni-3 and beyond) lead to the formation of impurities, suggested by the additional peaks. The most possible impurities for NVP-Ni at 12.97¬∞ (NaPO3), 26.54¬∞ (Na4P2O7), 32.88¬∞ (Na4P2O7 or NaPO3), 34.70¬∞ (P) and 46.14¬∞ (NaV3O8). XRD profiles of Co-doped NVP samples or NVP-Co (Figure 1b) also exhibit a similar trend as Ni-substituted NVP. A higher Co substitution (NVP-Co-3 and beyond) results in the formation of probable impurities, which are evidenced by the additional peaks at 13¬∞ (NaPO3), 26.43¬∞ (Na4P2O7), 33.2¬∞ (Na4P2O7 or NaPO3), 34.70¬∞ (P) and 38¬∞ (VOPO4). In contrast, Mg substitution on NVP, even with a substitution up to NVP-Mg-5, does not induce any additional peaks, except the peak at 52.65¬∞ associated with 137 planes splits into two for NVP-Mg-3 and above. Gopalakrishnan et al. have found similar splitting in the XRD pattern for the Na2V2(PO4)3.39 Previous studies on highly substituted NVP with Mg also display similar kind of splitting for 137 planes at 52.65¬∞ in the XRD pattern.  Cell parameters were obtained by fitting the powder XRD patterns of Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 (M = Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+; x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) (Table 1 and Figure 2).  As the M content in these series increases, the cell lengths a and c vary until they plateau at x = 0.3 for the Ni- and Co-containing series, implying that the limit of solid solution might be reached, that multiphase samples are obtained beyond this limit.  For the Mg-containing series, the cell lengths continue to change even at x = 0.5, implying that solid solubility can likely be extended further.32, 40, 41  Rietveld refinements were performed on NVP and for representative of the x = 0.3 members, Na3V1.7Ni0.3(PO4)3, Na3V1.7Co0.3(PO4)3, and Na3V1.7Mg0.3(PO4)3, with a structural model based on the parent compound Na3V2(PO4)3 in space group R3ùëê (Table 2 and Figure 3).  Applying a similar approach as Li et al., we assumed disorder of Mg, Ni or Co atoms with V atoms within the unique transition-metal site in fixed proportions corresponding to the nominal compositions, and distributed excess Na atoms within both the original octahedral site (Na1) as well as an additional eightfold coordinate site (Na2).32, 40-42  XRD refinements indicate M doping occurred in the V lattice site, and excess Na sodium goes into Na2-site. Substitution of M results in a nearly negligible change in the (V/M)-O distance for the Ni-substituted member, but a meaningful increase for the Co- and Mg-containing NVP compounds. There is a slight shortening of the P-O bond on progressing from Ni to Co to Mg, consistent with the trend in P-O bond stretching frequency observed in the FTIR spectra (Figure 4).To analyze the structural details of the doped NVP, vibrational spectral profiles were recorded. Figures 4a and 4b show the FTIR spectra of the Ni substituted Na3+xV2-xNix(PO4)3. The strong vibrational bands at 578 and 632 cm-1 are associated with the deformation bending vibration (F2(1)) of the O-P-O bond and V3+-O2- bond vibration in isolated VO6 octahedra, respectively (Figure 4a).43, 44 In Figure 4c, for the NVP-Co samples, the F2(1) type bending vibration has been split up into two components at 540 and 580 cm-1 because of the crystalline field. The splitting of the (F2(1)) band is much significant in the case of NVP-Mg samples (Figure 4e). Mg substitution on the NVP significantly enhances the peak intensity for (F2(1)) type O-P-O bending vibration at 540 and 580 cm-1.45 A gradual shift in the peak position was also noticed from NVP-Mg-1 to NVP-Mg-5. The blue-shift in the band may be attributed to the asymmetric stretching in P-O bond. However, a redshift is observed for the V3+-O2- bond vibration (at 632 cm-1) due to Mg-substitution (Figure 4e).Figure 4b shows the FTIR spectra of NVP-Ni shows the asymmetric stretching vibration of PO43- unit at 1188 and 1054 cm-1. A tiny band at 980 cm-1 for NVP-Ni is attributed to the V3+-O2- bond vibration in VO6 octahedra.43-45 A new band appears at 905 cm-1 for stretching frequency of V=O in Na3+xV2-xNix(PO4)3 when x ‚â• 0.3.46, 47 It suggests the presence of vanadium with an oxidation state higher than +3 for V, caused by Ni2+ substitution.  Formation of some pyrophosphate impurities in Na3+xV2-xNix(PO4)3 for x ‚â• 0.3 were further supported from the FTIR spectral band at 733 cm-1.48 In Figure 4d, the NVP-Co also show the PO43- stretching vibration at 1185 and 1057 cm-1. Moreover, the V3+-O2- bond vibration in VO6 octahedra is also present at 980 cm-1.43-45 Higher Co substitution in NVP-Co with x ‚â•0.4 indicates the presence of V = O  stretching frequency at 904 cm-1 as well as pyrophosphate impurities peak at 735 cm-1.46-48 The vibrational band at 904 cm-1 may also be attributed to the impurities introduced for a higher amount of Co doping (x ‚â• 0.3). The FTIR profile of NVP-Mg shows the PO43- stretching vibration and V3+-O2- vibration, but no other impurities were observed (Figure 4f). Furthermore, the V=O stretching frequency is absent in the case of NVP-Mg.The SEM image shows a porous spherical structure of the doped NVP materials with a diameter of 6-10 ¬µm (Figure S1-S2, see supporting information). SEM images further show that microstructures of all the electrode materials are identical. The parent NVP electrode shows a spherical structure with an average particle size distribution of ~10 to 20 ¬µm. Pristine NVP electrode contains micro and macropores, which enhance the electrolyte accessibilities to the bulk (Figure S2a). All the substituted electrodes have similar particle size, porosity and morphologies to the parent NASICON electrode (Figure S1 and S2). The SEM image of the broken electrode particles also shows the porous structure even inside the bulk of the electrode. The porosity at the bulk facilitate the electrolyte diffusion and fast ion transport through the electrode. To understand the elemental doping in the NVP electrode, EDAX measurements were carried out (Figure S3) and elemental ratio in the substituted electrode corroborates with the dopant amount. Electrochemical behavior of NVP. The electrochemical performance of the NVP was evaluated in a half cell using Na as a reference and counter electrodes (Figure S4). The undoped NVP electrode material shows a specific capacity of 117 mAh g-1 at 1 C with a capacity retention of 91% after 100 cycles (Figure S4a). The NVP electrode shows an inferior specific capacity at a higher discharge current of 10 and 20 C (Figure S4b). The poor rate performance is attributed to the low electronic conductivity of the electrode material. Carbon coating on the NVP and nanostructured NVP electrodes show better electrochemical behavior than the bulk electrode.18 The charge-discharge profile of the NVP electrode at different current density is shown in Figure S4c. The charge and discharge plateau were obtained at 3.49 and 3.29 V, respectively, at 1 C rate. The charge plateau is associated with the oxidation of Na3V2(III)(PO4)3 to NaV2(IV)(PO4)3, i.e.,
The discharge plateau is associated with the reduction of NaV2(IV)(PO4)3. The theoretical specific capacity of NVP electrode for discharge assigned to the intercalation of 2 Na+ at 3.29 V vs. Na/Na+ is 117.6 mAh g-1.26, 49 A shoulder plateau for discharge at 3.24 V is associated with the transfer of (V3+/4+) redox reaction from Na (1) to Na (2) by change in local redox environment.27,50 The differential capacity plot (dQ/dV vs. V) for the NVP was obtained from the second charge-discharge profile at 1C rate (Figure S4d).51, 52 The oxidation and reduction peaks are attributed to the V3+/V4+ redox couple. The potential polarization value (ŒîEp= 200 mV) is high and suggests a poor Na+ migration through the bulk of NVP electrode.51 Several strategies have been employed to increase Na+ diffusion through the electrode and reduce the polarization voltage.18 Herein, we have carried out a systematic aliovalent doping at V‚Äìsite in the NVP and studied the electrochemical performance for Na+ storage. Effect of Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+ doping in NVP on capacity and C- rate. Galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling was carried out to evaluate the effect of bivalent substitutions on the Na+ ion storage behavior of Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 (M = Ni, Co, and Mg) (Figure 5). The specific capacity obtained for NVP-Ni-1 is 109 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate, which decreases to 103 mAh g-1 for NVP-Ni-2, and finally reaches to 78 mAh g-1 for NVP-Ni-5 (Figure 5a). The gradual decrease in specific capacity can be mainly attributed to the decrement in overall vanadium content.36 The capacity for the NVP electrode is associated with the V3+/V4+ redox couple at the potential region of 2-4 V vs. Na/Na+ with a 2 Na+ transfer reaction (equation 1). However,with the substitution of vanadium by other metal, the overall vanadium content is reduced in substituted-NVP. As the number of vanadium atom decreases for each substituted NVP, the total number of extractable Na+ also diminished and becomes less than 2, i.e.:29, 30, 35
The other reason for the decrease in specific capacity can be attributed to the associated impurities due to higher Ni substitution (x ‚â• 0.3 in Na3+xV2-xNix(PO4)3). All the NVP-Ni electrodes exhibit decent capacity retention of over 94% (Figure 5a), which is better than the pristine NVP (Figure S4a). Ni substituted NVP electrodes (except NVP-Ni-5) (Figure 5b) show better rate performance than the parent NVP (Figure S4b), as they can deliver higher specific capacity at 20 C, which is 36-44% of the capacity acquired at 1 C (Figure 5b). Ni substitution on the NVP cathode enhances the cycling performance and rate capability. The Co-doped NVP-Co-1 delivers a specific capacity value of 111 mAh g-1 at 1 C, which gradually decreases to 83 mAh g-1 for NVP-Co-5 as the extent of substitution increases (Figure 5c), and is similar to NVP-Ni electrodes‚Äô behavior. All the NVP-Co electrodes exhibit exceptional capacity retention between 96% and 99%. The rate performances of Co-substituted samples are better than the pristine NVP and Ni-substituted NVP. An outstanding rate capability of 74-78 mAh g-1 at 20 C was obtained for NVP-Co-1, NVP-Co-2, and NVP-Co-3 (Figure 5d). While the rate performances of NVP-Co-4 and NVP-Co-5 at 20 C drop to about 60 mAh g-1. Notably, these two compositions exhibit the most impurity peaks in the XRD profile (Figure 1b); the significant amount of impurities likely impede the battery performance, especially at a high C- rate. A distinct electrochemical behavior was obtained for NVP-Mg samples. As shown in Figure 5e, NVP-Mg-1 delivers an initial specific capacity of 113 mAh g-1, and NVP-Mg-5 delivers a specific capacity of 100 mAh g-1 at 1 C rate. Interestingly, the gradual decay in specific capacity with a greater extent of Mg substitution (Figure 5e) is not as significant as Ni/Co-substituted NVP electrodes (Figures 5a and 5c). This phenomenon can be clearly observed by comparing the specific capacity of the highest doped samples (NVP-Ni-5, NVP-Co-5, and NVP-Mg-5), which are 78, 83, and 100 mAh g-1, respectively. Despite the overall loss in the vanadium content, NVP-Mg electrodes delivered superb specific capacity. The cycling performance of the Mg-substituted samples is also superior to the parent NVP. After 100 consecutive cycles, all the NVP-Mg electrodes retain a specific capacity of more than 94% from the initial cycle. Mg-substitution on NVP dramatically improves the rate performances (Figure 5f). Even at a current rate of 20 C, NVP-Mg-3 electrode delivers a high capacity of 80 mAh g-1, which is 75% of the value obtained at 1 C, and all the NVP-Mg electrodes provide a capacity ‚â• 70 mAh g-1. The rate capability of the NVP-Mg electrodes surpasses NVP-Ni, NVP-Co, and the pristine NVP electrodes.Figure 6 summarizes the specific capacity of the substituted and parent NVP electrodes delivered at the first cycle at 1 C rate. The specific capacity of NVP-Ni and NVP-Co electrodes shows almost the same capacity values up to x = 0.4. The electrochemical performance of NVP-Ni-5 and NVP-Co-5 show a poor value, which could be attributed to the higher percentage of impurities present in it. Surprisingly, NVP-Mg electrodes exhibit an excellent rate performance and better electrochemical performance than its Co and Ni analogues, even at x ‚â• 0.3. This phenomenon is intriguing but not thoroughly understood yet.  Thus, further work is required to understand the improved capacity of Mg-doped NVP cathodes. Mg substituted Li3V2(PO4)3 also showed similar properties. Huang et al. demonstrated that Mg2+-rich Li3V2-2y/3Mgy(PO4)3 (y = 0.15, 0.3 and 0.45) showed superior electrochemical performance over the parent phase Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP). The specific capacity delivered by Li3V1.8Mg0.3(PO4)3 is 128 mAh g-1.53 Differential capacity (dQ/dV) analysis.  For further understanding of the Na+ storage behavior of the substituted NVP electrodes, a differential capacity plot was derived from the 2nd charge-discharge profiles of all the compounds (Figures S5-S7). The differential capacity or dQ/dV vs. V plot provides information about the coexistence of different phases, the kinetics of the intercalation electrode and their reversibility.54, 55 The area under the peak is associated with the capacity of the process. The plateau in the voltage (V) vs. capacity (Q) plot in the charge-discharge profile appears as peaks in the differential capacity (dQ/dV vs. V) plot. A flat plateau in the charge-discharge profile delivers a narrower dQ/dV peak.54 The potential polarization value obtained from the differential capacity plot also informs about the electrode polarization. The charge-discharge profile and the associated differential capacity plots for Ni substituted NVP-Ni electrodes are shown in Figure S5. The charge-discharge profile and corresponding differential capacity of the NVP-Ni-1 display a potential polarization value of 120 mV. The charge-discharge profile of NVP-Ni-2 displays two distinct discharge plateaus at 3.3 and 3.1 V vs. Na/Na+; the plateau at 3.1 V is attributed to the change in the redox environment due to the transfer from Na (1) to Na (2).56 Similar behaviour has also been found in other doped NVP electrodes. Different element and amount of doping may have some effect on the local redox environment changes and the discharge profile would have shown different behaviour. This phase change is also reflected in the differential capacity with a sharp peak at 3.1 V. NVP-Ni-2 shows a potential polarization (ŒîEp) value of 85 mV. The other electrodes with higher Ni content (NVP-Ni-3 to NVP-Ni-5) also have higher ŒîEp values (90 to 170 mV). No significant relationship between the potential polarization and the Ni-content in NVP-Ni was found from the differential capacity. The specific capacity delivered by the Co-substituted NVP has a similar trend with NVP-Ni electrodes (Figure S6).  The NVP-Co-1 and NVP-Co-2 show ŒîEp values of 70 and 50 mV, respectively. As they showed two discharge plateaus, two distinct peaks were observed in the dQ/dV plots. For the NVP-Co-1 to NVP-Co-3 compounds, sharp peaks were obtained, and NVP-Co-4 and NVP-Co-5 exhibit broad symmetric peaks in the differential capacity plot. The broad peak in the differential capacity plot may be attributed to the presence of mixed-phase and impurities.57 ŒîEp value of 80 mV was obtained for both electrodes. The charge-discharge profiles of the NVP-Mg-1 to NVP-Mg-4 electrodes show two distinct plateaus for discharge; hence, NVP-Mg electrodes show two sharp peaks for their differential capacity plots (Figure S7). However, these plateaus gradually disappear with further charge-discharge cycles. The ŒîEp values for the NVP-Mg-1 and NVP-Mg-2 are the same (60 mV), whereas NVP-Mg-3 and NVP-Mg-4 have a same ŒîEp value (55 mV). NVP-Mg-5 shows a higher ŒîEp value of 70 mV. The ŒîEp values for all the substituted electrodes are lower than the undoped NVP, which suggests an enhanced Na+ diffusion and improved kinetics through the bulk of the electrode. The Na+ migration and associated improved kinetics of the substituted electrodes are further established from the rate performance experiments. Ni, Co, and Mg substituted NVP electrodes display better rate performance than the undoped NVP. Only NVP-Ni-5 has poor rate capability at a high current density (20 C) as it has a high ŒîEp value of 170 mV, which is close to the value of undoped NVP (200 mV). To evaluate the trend, ŒîEp of electrode vs dopant amount, x in Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 have been plotted (Figure S8). We have found out a ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped plot for Ni and Mg-substituted NVP electrodes and x = 0.2 or 0.3 shows lower ŒîEp values than other substitutions. NVP-Co-0.2 shows a lower ŒîEp value than the other NVP-Co electrodes. From the ŒîEp values of the doped electrodes and the associated rate performances further established the fast Na+ kinetics of the electrodes.Effects of Mg2+-doping in NVP on electrochemical property. It was found that the NVP-Mg shows better electrochemical performances than NVP-Ni and NVP-Co.  Difference in electronegativity and ionic radii of dopants and the substituted element are the important factors to determine the overall electrochemical performance of cathode.41 The ionic radii of Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ in the crystal are 0.86, 0.83, and 0.79 √Ö, respectively.42 V3+ radius in the crystal is 0.78 √Ö. Electronegativity value of V3+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ are 1.545, 1.234, 1.321 and 1.367, respectively.58 Li et al.50 have calculated the chemical stability (Ehull) with a different divalent dopant and predicted that V3+ substitution in Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3, where x = 0.5, with Ni2+, Mg2+ dopants are promising to produce a stable phase. We have added Na+ to NVP crystal for each V3+ substitution with Mg2+ (Na3+xV2-xMgx(PO4)3 instead of Na3V2-xMgx(PO4)3). To understand whether the additional Na+ has been successfully incorporated in the crystal structure of the substituted NVP, we have carried out ICP-MS studies.  The elemental ratio of the Mg/Na for all the five NVP-Mg samples are in well agreement with the values for the chemical formulae Na3+xV2-xMgx(PO4)3 (Figure S9a). The empirical elemental ratio for Mg/V in NVP-Mg corroborates with the theoretical values, except NVP-Mg-5. To analyze the carbon content in the NVP-Mg electrode, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the NVP-Mg samples were studied (Figure S9b). The TGA plot shows a range of carbon content from 0.5 to 1.5 % in the NVP-Mg samples. It is important to mention that the carbon content in these electrode materials is kept very less to study the bulk properties of the electrodes. To evaluate the internal resistance of the NVP-Mg electrodes, we have carried out the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic study of the NVP and all the NVP-Mg electrodes. Before acquiring the impedance spectra, the cells were subjected to five subsequent full charge-discharge cycles at 1 C rate. The Nyquist plot of the electrodes display an asymmetric semicircle (Figure 7). NVP and NVP-Mg-1 to NVP-Mg-3 show two overlapped semicircles. The equivalent circuits  can to fit the spectra are shown in Figure 7. The high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the resistance associated with the passivating surface layer (Rsl). The low-frequency charge-transfer resistance (Rct) accounts for the associated resistance of the charge transfer processes. The resistance of the electrolyte is recorded as the solution resistance (Rsolution) and was found constant for all the cells (Table 3). The surface passivation layer resistance (Rsl) was found to be less than the charge transfer resistance. The Rsl value for NVP was found to be 8 ohm, which gradually decreases with the Mg content in NVP. The Rct values for the electrodes show a different trend. For NVP, the value for Rct was ~ 45 ohm, which was gradually decreased with Mg-doping and reached the lowest value of ~ 29 ohm for NVP-Mg-3. The capacitance value (~ 10-7-10-6 F) from low-frequency part of the semicircle was found be in the range for electrode contribution.
Upon further Mg-doping in NVP, the Rct value has significantly increased to 94 and 109 ohms for NVP-Mg-4 and NVP-Mg-5, respectively (Table 3). Mg substitution on the NVP electrodes facilitate to form an effective surface passivating layer, which seems to promote the fast charge transfer. A similar result was reported in the literature. 29-31 The optimum amount of Mg-doping on the NVP electrode material reduces the charge-transfer resistance through the bulk of the electrode, which results in superior rate capability. The presence of Mg2+ in the NVP lattice may cause some local defects in the crystal structure that appear to enhance the electrical conductivity and rate performances.53,59  Mg ion in Na3+xV2-xMgx(PO4)3 is electrochemically inactive towards the capacity contribution.  Li et al. has proposed that the Mg2+ in the NVP lattice act as a pillar to prevent the collapse of structural changes during charge-discharge and improve the cycling stability.40 To analyze the oxidation state of V and Mg in the NVP-Mg, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were carried out and results are shown in Figure 8 and Figure S10. The deconvoluted spectra of NVP show two distinct Gaussian-Lorentzian peaks for V2p3/2 and V2p1/2 at the binding energy of 516.68 and 523.82 eV, respectively, which are in good accordance with the +3 oxidation state of vanadium.51, 60 The energy separation value between V2p3/2 and V2p1/2 is ~7 eV which further support the +3 oxidation state of the vanadium in the NVP. The NVP-Mg electrodes show similar binding energies for V2p3/2 (~516 eV) and V2p1/2 (~523 eV).  The deconvoluted V2p spectra of all the NVP-Mg electrodes shows that the vanadium in all the Mg substituted NVP electrode have a +3 oxidation state.61 The +3 oxidation state of V further supports the accommodation of excess Na+ in the NVP to maintain the overall charge balance.It was shown that the Mg-doping on the NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode changes the oxidation state of the V atom into +4. The V4+/V5+ redox couple provides additional capacity to the electrodes.27 Inoishi et al. have successfully synthesized Mg2+ substituted NVP and estimated a specific capacity of 120 mAh g-1. Mg-rich Na3V1.5Mg0.5(PO4)3 shows a clear discharge plateau due to V4+/V5+ redox couple at 3.7 V vs. Na/Na+.35 Lalere et al. shows that the Al3+ substituted Na3V1.5Al0.5(PO4)3 could achieve a high specific capacity of 120.8 mAh g-1 and increment of average potential by accessing the V4+/V5+ redox couple. However, the V4+/V5+ couple was accessible only at a very low current density.36 In our case, we have not observed any redox behavior of V4+/V5+ in the case of NVP-Mg electrodes at the potential range of 2 - 4.5 V vs. Na/Na+ at a discharge rate of 1 C.  In summary, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+ doped Na3+xV2-xMx(PO4)3 electrodes exhibit enhanced the electrochemical behavior towards Na+ storage properties. The difference in electronegativity and the ionic size of the dopants are the main factors to determine the overall electrochemical properties of the NVP materials. The bivalent metal ions doping boosts the kinetics of Na+ migration in NVP electrode materials. Ni and Co-substitution on the NVP do not improve the specific capacity, but it enhances the cycling performances and rate performance. Among the samples studied, Mg2+ doping on the NVP electrode has superior electrochemical activity than Ni2+, Co2+ and showed a dramatic improvement on the rate performances and charge-discharge cycling of the NASICON structured electrode materials.
