We have synthesized materials based on a silver titanium phosphate with partial substitution of tri 2), tetra 2), or pentavalent cations for titanium: Ag1±xTi2–xMx(PO4)3 (M = Nb5+, Ga3+) and AgTi2–xZrx(PO4)3. The materials have been characterized by X 2)ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy and have been shown to have small thermal expansion coefficients. Their ionic conductivity has been determined. Silver ions in these materials are difficult to replace with protons. DOI: 10.1134/S0020168510040163

AM2(PO4)3 (A = Li+, Na+, Ag+, H+; M = Ti4+, Zr4+, Hf 4+) NASICON 2)type double phosphates are potentially attractive  materials  for  a  variety  of  electrochemical devices, such as rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, and sen 2) sors, owing to the high cation mobility in these materials, which is related to the specific features of their structure. In  the  structure  of  the  AM2(PO4)3  compounds,  МO6 octahedra  share  corners  with  PO4  tetrahedra  [1,  2]. Mobile univalent cations (А+) may occupy two inequiva 2) lent sites: M1, at a center of inversion, with sixfold oxygen coordination, and M2, with eightfold oxygen coordina 2) tion [3]. These sites alternate along conductive channels to form a three 2)dimensional network, which enables fast ionic transport. It is remarkable that the protonic forms of these compounds, prepared through Li+/H+ exchange in LiZr2(PO4)3, possess high proton conductivity in the tem 2) perature range 300–550°С [4].

As shown in previous studies of Li1 ± xTi2 – xМx(PO4)3 (M  =  Nb5+,  Ga3+)  NASICON 2)type  phosphates,  the mobility of interstitials in their structure markedly exceeds that of vacancies [5, 6]. At the same time, ion exchange in these  systems  is  rather  slow,  and  complete  proton 2)for 2) lithium exchange cannot be reached in a reasonable time. We think that the most effective approach is to produce protonic  forms  at  an  increased  driving  force,  e.g.,  by replacing silver ions in Ag1 ± xTi2 – xМx(PO4)3 (M = Nb5+, Ga3+) in hydrochloric acid. Because of the considerable affinity of silver for chlorine, this process may be notably faster. The process rate may be further increased via partial substitution of a tri 2) or pentavalent element for titanium, which would be expected to raise the defect density and diffusion rate.

There is very limited information about NASICON 2) type  silver  compounds.  Couturier  et  al.  [7,  8]  studied AgTi2 – xZrx(PO4)3 and Ag1 + xTi2 – xМx(PO4)3 (M = Sc,Fe)  solid  solutions.  According  to  their  results,  Ti–Sc, Ti–Zr,  and  Ti–Fe  solid  solutions  exist  over  the  entire composition  range,  0  ≤  x  ≤  2  [7].  The  conductivity  of AgTi2(PO4)3 at 570 K is 10–6 S/cm. Doping with scan 2) dium and iron increases the conductivity to 3.2 × 10–2 and 6.3 × 10–3 S/cm, respectively. Zirconium doping has little effect  on  the  conductivity  in  the  range  0  ≤  x  <  2,  but, according to Couturier et al. [7], the conductivity of the AgZr2(PO4)3 end 2)member is 10–5 S/cm, exceeding that of AgTi2(PO4)3.

In this context, it is of interest to investigate the prop 2) erties of NASICON 2)type titanium silver phosphates with partial heterovalent substitution of tri 2) or pentavalent cat 2) ions  for  titanium,  Ag1  ±  xTi2  –  xМx(PO4)3(M  =  Nb5+, Ga3+),  and  to  produce  their  protonic  forms  via  ion exchange. In addition, it is worthwhile to study materials isovalently doped with zirconium, AgTi2 5)xZrx(PO4)3.

Ag1 ± xTi2 – xМx(PO4)3 (M = Nb5+, Ga3+) solid solu 2) tions were prepared by solid 2)state reactions. Stoichiomet 2) ric amounts of AgNO3, TiO2  ⋅ H2O, (NH4)2HPO4, and M2Oy were ground in an agate mortar and then reacted at 1070 K for 5 h. The resultant materials were reground and pressed into pellets in order to increase their density and enhance their reactivity. The pellets were fired at 1270 K for 24 h. Nb and Ga were chosen as substituents for tita 2) nium because they are close in ionic radius and have a sta 2) ble oxidation state. AgTi2 – xZrx(PO4)3 samples were also prepared by solid 2)state reactions. The starting chemicals used were AgNO3, TiO2 ⋅ H2O, (NH4)2HPO4, and ZrO2 ⋅ nH2O.  The  synthesis  procedure  was  similar  to  that  for Ag1 ±  xTi2  –  xМx(PO4)3  (M  =  Nb5+,  Ga3+),  but  the  final anneal temperature was 1470 K, for reasons which will be indicated below.

The materials were characterized by X 2)ray diffraction (XRD) on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (CuKα radiation) equipped with a high 2)temperature attachment. XRD patterns were collected at temperatures from 293 to 973  K  at  ⯝100 2)K  intervals,  after  a  2 2)min  hold  at  each temperature.  The  XRD  data  were  analyzed  using  the Rigaku Application Data Processing Software Package.

Ionic conductivity was measured in the temperatures range 298–870 K at dc or in the frequency range 10 Hz to 2 MHz using an IPU 2)62 ac bridge. The samples had the form of pressed cylindrical pellets (R = 2.5 mm, h = 2 mm) with platinum contacts. The conductivity was determined by extrapolating the semicircle representing the bulk com 2) ponent onto the real axis.

According  to  XRD  data,  the  parent  phosphate AgTi2(PO4)3  crystallizes  in  rhombohedral  symmetry. Doping with gallium and niobium had no effect on the phase composition of our samples up to х = 0.3 and х = 0.4, respectively. The gallium 2)doped samples with х > 0.3 contained  rutile  and  gallium  phosphate  as  impurity phases.  The  niobium 2)doped  samples  with  х  >  0.4  con 2) tained  a  compound  identified  as  niobium  phosphate, Nb2(PO4)3 (PDF 2)2, no. 79 2)0705).

The XRD patterns of all the reaction products were indexed  in  a  hexagonal  setting.  The  composition dependences  of  the  unit 2)cell  parameters  for  the  gal 2) lium 2) and niobium 2)doped compounds are presented in Figs. 1 and 2. Gallium doping has little effect on the unitcell parameters (Fig. 1). The octahedral ionic radii of Ti4+ and Ga3+ are 0.75 and 0.76 Å, respectively. The insignifi 2) cant variations in unit 2)cell parameters seems to be due to the fact that gallium and titanium differ very little in octa 2) hedral  ionic  radius.  Similarly,  increasing  the  niobium content of Ag1 – xTi2 – xNbx(PO4)3 has a weak effect on с, which  even  has  a  tendency  to  decrease,  whereas  the  а parameter rises markedly.

An important performance parameter of solid electro 2) lytes for elevated temperatures is thermal expansion. Typ 2) ically, NASICON materials have small thermal expansion coefficients [9]. The XRD patterns of AgTi2(PO4)3 taken during heating to 1070 K show no changes in phase composition.  The  a  parameter  of  AgTi2(PO4)3  decreases steadily  during  heating,  whereas  its  с  parameter  rises (Fig. 3). The thermal expansion coefficients were deter 2) mined to be αa = –2 × 10–6 K–1; αc = 1.2 × 10–5 K–1. Sim 2) ilar results were reported earlier for the lithium titanium phosphate Li0.5Ti1.5Nb0.5(PO4)3.

Note  that  attempts  to  synthesize  AgTi2  –  xZrx(PO4)3 materials with x ≥ 0.2 by firing at 1070 K for 10 h led to phase  separation  and  the  formation  of  two  phosphates, one  enriched  in  titanium,  and  the  other  in  zirconium (Fig. 4). In view of this, such materials were synthesized under modified conditions. The synthesis temperature of a number of AgTi2 – xZrx(PO4)3 solid solutions was raised to 1470 K, and the firing time was 24 h. Under those con 2) ditions, homogeneous AgTi2 – xZrx(PO4)3 solid solutions were obtained up to х = 0.5.

As seen in Fig. 5, the а and с cell parameters increase linearly  with  zirconium  content,  as  would  be  expected given  that  the  octahedral  ionic  radius  of  Zr4+  (0.86  Å) markedly exceeds that of Ti4+ (0.75 Å).

The key performance parameter of solid electrolytes is ionic  conductivity.  Analysis  of  the  complex  impedance plots of our samples and their extremely low electronic conductivity lead us to conclude that the transport prop 2) erties  of  the  materials  studied  are  governed  by  cation mobility. Gallium doping markedly increases the conduc 2) tivity over the entire temperature range examined (Fig. 6). Even though AgTi2(PO4)3 undergoes no phase transitions, the Arrhenius plot of its conductivity has a break at 450 K, with a lower slope at higher temperatures. The activation energy for conduction is 51 ± 1 kJ/mol at low tempera 2) tures  and  20  ±  1  kJ/mol  at  high  temperatures.  Similar results were obtained for the other samples, with a change in activation energy at lower temperatures. The likely rea 2) son for this is that, at low temperatures, some energy goes into defect formation on the Ag site (partial transition to the M2 site) since ion transport is only possible through defect centers. At the same time, the degree of intrinsic (thermally activated) Ag disorder increases at high tem 2) peratures,  and  the  contribution  of  the  above  process decreases markedly.

Gallium doping also increases the concentration of Ag interstitials  (M2  site).  The  defect  formation  processes involved can be represented by the quasi 2)chemical reac 2) tion where symbols • and ' denote a positive and a negative charge of the ion relative to that of the normal lattice site, and the subscript i refers to interstitial ions. As a result of this reaction, gallium occupies the titanium ), and the excess silver occupies interstitial site ( sites  ( ).  As  a  consequence  of  the  associated increase  in  carrier  concentration,  the  low 2)tempera 2) ture conductivity rises, with a change in the tempera 2) ture of the transition to the state in which the conduc 2) tivity is determined by intrinsic disorder.

Niobium doping reduces the conductivity of the par 2) ent  phosphate  (Fig.  7).  The  conductivity  of  the  doped samples  is  so  low  that  the  low 2)temperature  complex impedance plots cannot be adequately extrapolated. For this reason, the conductivity in this system was measured only  above  470  K.  Doping  with  niobium  can  be  repre 2) sented by the scheme , ( ) 4 PO 4 ),  and  its Niobium  occupies  the  titanium  site  ( TiNb i AgV ' charge is compensated by silver vacancies ( ). The cation mobility in the doped materials is due to vacan 2) cies. Comparison of the conductivity data for the systems with increased concentrations of silver vacancies and interstitials leads us to conclude that the intersti 2) tial mobility in the NASICON compound AgTi2(PO4)3 considerably exceeds the vacancy mobility. Note that similar results were obtained in studies of doped lith 2) ium titanium phosphates [5, 6].

Zirconium  doping  also  has  an  adverse  effect  on  the transport properties of AgTi2(PO4)3 (Fig. 8). According to our  results,  the  conductivity  of  the  AgZr2(PO4)3  end 2) member is substantially lower than that of AgTi2(PO4)3.

Zirconium  doping  the  conductivity  of AgTi2(PO4)3 and raises the activation energy for conduc 2) tion in this material. Note that the conductivity of a num 2) ber  of  intermediate  compositions  in  this  system  is  even lower than that of the silver zirconium phosphate. Such changes were referred to in the literature as mixed alkali effect  [10].  When  one  cation  is  gradually  replaced  with another, their transition from their own site to a vacancy that had been previously occupied by a cation of another type is hindered because of the lower bond energy in the atypical coordination polyhedron. Accordingly, structural relaxation requires an extra time [11]. In our case, how 2) ever, the drop in conductivity is due to other factors, the most important among which is probably lattice disorder, which influences silver ion transport conditions in regions with different environments.

To obtain protonic forms of the compounds stud 2) ied, we attempted ion exchange in hydrochloric acid. Unfortunately,  no  Ag+/H+  exchange  can  be  per 2) formed in Ag1 ± xTi2 – xМx(PO4)3 (M = Nb5+, Ga3+) by such a procedure because the compounds dissolve in hydrochloric acid. It seems likely that rapid removal of  silver  ions  leads  to  structure  breakdown.  Li+/H+ exchange in LiZr2(PO4)3 is known to take place in hydro 2) chloric acid [6]. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that zirconium doping will prevent AgTi2(PO4)3 dissolution. In  our  experiments,  however,  attempts  to  perform  ion exchange in AgTi2 5)xZrx(PO4)3 led only to the formation of a mixture of α 5)Zr(HPO4)2 and rutile.

The materials studied have ionic conductivity, which is, however, not very high in comparison with typical sil 2) ver 2)ion 2)conducting  solid  electrolytes.  The  highest  con 2) ductivity  levels  are  offered  by  materials  containing  a highly polarizable anion, e.g., by silver halides [11]. How 2) ever, in oxygen 2)containing compounds the transition of silver to interstitials with a smaller coordination number is less energetically favorable because of the smaller energy compensation by the covalent component of the silver– anion bond [11]. At the same time, even in this case the interstitial silver mobility in the structure in question con 2) siderably exceeds the vacancy mobility. Our results indi 2) cate that Ag+/H+ exchange in the compounds studied is impossible because of their dissolution.
