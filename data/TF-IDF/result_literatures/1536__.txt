The 950 ° C isothermal section of the ScPO 4 – Na 3 PO 4 – Li 3 PO 4 three-component system was plotted and studied; one-, two-, and three-phase fields were bounded. Three solid solution fields exist in the title system: one based on LiNa 5 ( PO 4 ) 2 complex phosphate (olympite structure), another on scandium-stabilized high-temperature Na 3 PO 4 phase Na 3(1 – x ) Sc x /3 ? 2/3 x PO 4 (space group Fm 3 m ), and the third on Na 3 Sc 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 (NASICON structure). All phases found in the title system are derivatives of phases that exist in its subsystems. Lithiumfor-sodium isovalent substitutions in Na 3 Sc 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 considerably increase the NASICON-type solid solution field but negatively influence the conductivity of the phase.

Design of new many-purpose materials is one task of contemporary science. Complex phosphates of triply charged cations have successfully been used to fulfill this task. Materials designed on the basis of these materials have a valuable combination of lasing, luminescent, and piezoelectric properties combined with high mechanical and thermochemical stability. High ionic conductivity has been discovered in some representatives of this class [1–3]. Complex phosphates of scandium and sodium having a complex cationic part on account of doping extra singly charged cations are of undoubted scientific and practical importance. The synthesis and characterization of this type of compounds allow the recognition of trends in the composition, structure, and properties of complex phosphates and structural evolution in the series of complex phosphates of singly and triply charged cations. Here, we report the revision of a subsolidus section ( 950°ë ) of the ScPO 4 – Na 3 PO 4 – Li 3 PO 4 quasi-ternary system and the characterization of phases recovered. The binary subsystems of this ternary system were studied earlier. In the Li 3 PO 4 – Na 3 PO 4 system, there are two complex phosphates: LiNa 5 ( PO 4 ) 2 , which has a homogeneous field, and Li 2 NaPO 4 [4]. In the ScPO 4 – Li 3 PO 4 system, there is Li 3 Sc 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 complex phosphate [5]. In the ScPO 4 – Na 3 PO 4 system, the last studies show two complex phosphates (Na 3 Sc ( PO 4 ) 2 and Na 3 Sc 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 ) and two solid solution fields, one based on the high-temperature sodium phosphate phase (space group Fm 3 m ) and the other based on Na 3 Sc 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 [6]. The earlier published phase diagram for the ScPO 4 – Na 3 PO 4 – Li 3 PO 4 system [7] was mislead ing because of an error in studying the Na 3 PO 4 – ScPO 4 system [1].

The precursors used were sodium, lithium, and scandium monophosphates. Sodium monophosphate was prepared by drying sodium monophosphate dodecahydrate Na 3 PO 4 · 12 H 2 O (pure for analysis grade) at 75–180°ë followed by heating at 500°ë for 6 h. Lithium monophosphate Li 3 PO 4 was prepared by dissolving lithium carbonate Li 2 CO 3 (pure for analysis grade) in 20% phosphoric acid at 50°ë . The reaction completion was monitored by CO 2 evolution and the solution acidity. Then, the solution was cooled and 20% aqueous ammonia was added to neutral pH. The precipitate was washed by decantation and collected on a filter. The resulting lithium monophosphate was dried at 100°ë and calcined at 500°ë for 2.5 h. Scandium monophosphate ScPO4 was prepared by dissolving scandium oxide (high purity grade) in concentrated hydrochloric acid for 1.5 h; then, aqueous ammonia was added until the solution acquired alkaline pH. The scandium hydroxide precipitate Sc(OH)3 was settled, washed, and treated with 30% phosphoric acid to convert it to scandium monophosphate ScPO4. The ScPO4 precipitate was dried at 150°ë and calcined at 950°ë for 6 h. The purity of the precursors was monitored by X-ray diffraction [8]. The investigative tools used were ceramic technology and powder X-ray diffraction. Test samples were prepared in 2–10 mol % steps, compacted into disks 11 mm in diameter and 1.0–0.8 mm high, continuously annealed at 950°ë for 100–200 h, and quenched in liquid nitrogen. The precursors and final products were identified using DRON-3M (CoKα radiation) and Shimadzu XRD-600 (CuKα radiation). Unit cell parameters were calculated using the Powder program package. Ion conductivity was measured within 20–300°ë at frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz using impedance spectroscopy on Agilent 4284A equipped with a Netzsch STA 449C Y upiter thermal analyzer. In the course of experiments, hodographs were plotted to reflect the decomposition of the resistance of the sample to the imaginary and real components. The plot was used to determine the volume resistance for calculating ion conductivity from σ = h/RvS, where h is the sample height in cm, Rv is the volume resistance in ohms, and S is the electrode contact area in cm2 [9]. Test samples were compacted disks 10 mm in diameter and 1.0–1.5 mm high. The complex phosphates used were prepared by ceramic technology: simple phosphates were mixed in stoichiometric amounts and, after triturating with ethanol, compacted into disks (d ~ 10 mm), annealed at 950°ë for 100–200 h, and then quenched in liquid nitrogen.

hase formation in the title ternary system was studied by the sections method. A total of five sections were studied: ScPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2, Li3Sc2(PO4)3– LiNa5(PO4)2, Li3Sc2(PO4)3–Na3Sc2(PO4)3, Li2NaPO4– Na3Sc2(PO4)3, and Li3PO4–Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (Fig. 1).

The ScPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2 section was found to be most informative. This section crosses three homogeneous fields in the triangular diagram. The first (small) homogeneous field based on LiNa5(PO4)2 has an extent from 0 to 8 mol % ScPO4 (the olympite mineral structure). The next (extensive) homogeneous field lies within 12–35 mol % ScPO4 and has the high-temperature sodium phosphate phase structure (space group Fm3m) stabilized by Sc3+ ions, i.e., Na3(1 – x)Scx/3?2/3xPO4, where ? stands for a cation vacancy. The third (quite extensive) homogeneous field based on NASICON-like complex phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (space group R c) has an extent of 55–67 mol % ScPO4. The aforementioned homogeneous fields are separated by the corresponding two-phase fields. The X-ray diffraction patterns for the major phases of the section are shown in Fig. 2. The results obtained for the other sections verified the existence of the extensive homogeneous field based on NASICON-like complex phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 and allowed two- and three-phase fields to be demarcated in the triangular diagrams. Figures 3 and 4 display X-ray diffraction patterns for the major phases of the sections studied. Unit cell parameters were calculated for the Na3(1 − x)Scx/3PO4- and Na3Sc2(PO4)3-base solid solutions 3 (ScPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2 section). Figure 5 displays the parameter a as a function of scandium phosphate percentage for the cubic phase. The linear trend of the parameter a verifies the existence of the solid solutions. The data obtained were used to plot the 950°ë subsolidus section of the Li3PO4–Na3PO4–ScPO4 phase diagram (Fig. 6). The homogeneous, two-phase, and threephase fields were indicated in the diagram. Three homogeneous fields were found to exist in the system: a very insignificant field based on lithium sodium phosphate (olympite structure), an extensive solid solution field based on sodium phosphate (cubic structure), and an extensive field based on sodium scandium phosphate (NASICON structure). No new compounds are formed in the Li3PO4–Na3PO4–ScPO4 system. All phases found in the title system are derivatives of phases that exist in the ScPO4–Na3PO4 and Li3PO4–Na3PO4 subsystems. Lithium considerably increases the extent of the Na3 + ıSc2 – ı(PO4)3 NASICON-like solid solution, which is of practical importance for reducing the consumption of high-cost scandium. Conductivity was measured as a function of temperature for two phases of the system in the LiNa5(PO4)2– ScPO4 section, namely, the cubic phase based on the scandium-stabilized cubic sodium monophosphate phase (Na3(1 – x)Scx/3PO4) and the phase based on NASICON-like complex phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (Figs. 7, 8). Ion conductivities for 300°ë were calculated using conductivity versus temperature plots from the equation σ = σÓe–Ea/kT. Figure 9 shows hodographs for the test phases. Conductivities for 300°ë are 1.0 × 10–3 S/cm for the Na3(1 – x)Scx/3PO4-base phase and 1.6 × 10–3 S/cm for the Na3Sc2(PO4)3-base phase. The decreased conductivity values of both phases are likely due to the negative influence of lithium. In summary, we have plotted the 950°ë isothermal section of the ScPO4–Na3PO4–Li3PO4 three-component system and demonstrated that all phases found in this title system are derivatives of phases that exist in its binary subsystems. Lithium-for-sodium isovalent substitutions in sodium scandium phosphates considerably increase the Na3Sc2(PO4)3-base NASICON-like solid solution field. Lithium negatively influences the conductivity of phases.
