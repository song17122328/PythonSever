A water-stable lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte with high conductivity and excellent mechanical properties has potential application for aqueous lithium-air batteries. In this study, a water-stable NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte with a nominal composition of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 was synthesized with variation of the Al and Nb contents using a conventional solid-state reaction method, and the electrical conductivity and mechanical properties were examined. 

The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 7. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 7.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and the highest three-point bending strength of 110 N mm−2 at room temperature were observed for Li1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C and the highest three-point bending strength of 110 N mm−2 at room temperature were observed for Li1.30Al0.30Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 and Li1.30(PO4)3 and Li1.35Al0.35Al0.55Nb0.55Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.25(PO4)3, respectively. Li1. Li1.30Al0.30Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 was stable in a saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl.

The demand for high speciﬁc energy density batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) has been signiﬁcantly increased recently because the driving range of EVs with conventional lithium-ion batteries is too short compared with vehicles powered by internal combustion engines [1– 3]. 

Lithium-air batteries are attractive candidates for such high speciﬁc energy density batteries because of their theoretical energy densities, which are as high as 3560 Wh kg−1 for the non-aqueous system and 1910 Wh kg−1 for the aqueous system. Although the non-aqueous system has a high theoretical energy density, there are many serious problems to solve for this system, such as decomposition of the electrolyte by the reaction product [4] and high polarization for reduction of the Li2O2 reaction product [5]. In contrast, the aqueous system has no such problems, although the system cannot operate without a water-stable lithium metal electrode, because lithium reacts violently with water. Visco et al. proposed the concept of a water-stable lithium electrode in 2004 [6]. 

The lithium metal anode was separated from an aqueous electrolyte by a water-stable NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3. 

The lithium metal anode was separated from an aqueous electrolyte by a water-stable NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte of Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3.In the last half century, many types of high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes have been reported, such as Li3N [7], B2S3-Li2S-LiI glass [8], NASICON-type Li1 + xAxTi2 − x(PO4)4 (A = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, In, La, Sc, and Y) [9], perovskite-type La2/3 − xLixTiO3 [10], garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [11] and thio-LISICON-type Li10GeP2S12 [12]. 

Among these, Li1 + xAxTi2 − x(PO4)4 and Li7La3Zr2O12 were reported to be stable in a saturated aqueous solution of LiCl [13,14]. The stability of the solid electrolyte in a saturated aqueous solution of LiOH is essential for aqueous lithium-air batteries because the reaction product is LiOH. Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 exhibits a high lithium ion conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C [15] and is stable in contact with lithium metal [11], but it is difﬁcult to prepare as a thin ﬁlm due to the evaporation of lithium during the high temperature sintering. A thin ﬁlm of NASICON-type Li1 + xAxTi2 − x(PO4)4 was prepared by a tape casting method and the ion conductivity of the tape cast ﬁlm was reported to be 7. A thin ﬁlm of NASICON-type Li1 + xAxTi2 − x(PO4)4 was prepared by a tape casting method and the ion conductivity of the tape cast ﬁlm was reported to be 7.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C [16]. The NASICON-type solid lithium-ion conductors are attractive as the protective layer for aqueous lithium-air batteries.

Since the ﬁrst report by Aono et al. [9] in 1989, the NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes have been extensively examined. The highest electrical conductivity of 4. The highest electrical conductivity of 4.62 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C was reported for the Li1.62 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C was reported for the Li1.5Al0.5Al0.5Ge0.5Ge0.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic by Thokchom and Kumar [17]. However, the effect of aging on its ionic conductivity is questionable, because Fu [18] and Xu et al. [19] reported that the ionic conductivities of the Li1. [19] reported that the ionic conductivities of the Li1.5Al0.5Al0.5Ge0.5Ge0.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic were 4.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic were 4.0 × 10−4 and 7.0 × 10−4 and 7.25 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, respectively. The Li1 + x + yAlx(Ge,Ti)2 − xSiyP4 − yO12 glass ceramics have been commercialized by Ohara Ltd.

The glass ceramic is water-permeation free and the ion conductivity is 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Zhang et al. [20] reported that the electrical conductivity of Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 was enhanced by the partial substitution of Ge for Ti. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1at 25 °C was observed for Li1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1at 25 °C was observed for Li1.4Al0.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ge0.2Ti1.2Ti1.4(PO4)3, where Li1.4(PO4)3, where Li1.4Al0.4Al0.4GexTi1.4GexTi1.6 − x(PO4)3 powders were prepared by a sol-gel method using expensive Ti and Ge alkoxides. More recently, Shang et al. [21] used less expensive starting materials of TiO2 and GeO2 to prepare the system and observed the highest conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a high bending strength of 90 N mm−2 for Li1. [21] used less expensive starting materials of TiO2 and GeO2 to prepare the system and observed the highest conductivity of 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a high bending strength of 90 N mm−2 for Li1.45Al0.45Al0.45Ge02Ti1.45Ge02Ti1.35(PO4)3.35(PO4)3.

In this study, we have examined the effect of Nb5+ substitution for Ti4+ in Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 on the lithium-ion conductivity and mechanical properties. Nb2O5 is considerably cheaper than GeO2. Nb2O5 is considerably cheaper than GeO2. Waterstable high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes also have potential for application in advanced aqueous lithium batteries with aqueous cathodes [22,23] as well as lithium-air batteries.

NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes with the nominal composition of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction.Corresponding amounts of chemical reagent grade Li2CO3, TiO2, Nb2O5, Al2O3, and NH4H2PO4 were ball-milled with zirconia balls in a zirconia vessel for 2 h at400 rpm using high-energy mechanical milling (HEMM) with a planetary micro mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 7), and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The products were milled for 4 h using HEMM, pressed into pellets at 150 MPa, and calcined at 900 °C for 5 h. The calcined pellets were reground and again ball-milled using HEMM for 10 h. The obtained powders were isostatically pressed into pellets at 150 MPa and sintered at 900 °C for 7 h.

The crystal structures of the sintered samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RINT 2500) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a scanning step rate of 0.The crystal structures of the sintered samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RINT 2500) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a scanning step rate of 0.02°·s−1.02°·s−1. The relative densities of the sintered samples were estimated from the ratio of the density calculated from the lattice constants and that calculated from the volume and weight of the sintered body. The electrical conductivities of the sintered pellets (ca. 7 mm diameter and ca 0. 7 mm diameter and ca 0.7 mm thick) with gold sputtered electrodes (about 1 μm in thickness) were measured using an impedance phase analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the frequency range of 0.7 mm thick) with gold sputtered electrodes (about 1 μm in thickness) were measured using an impedance phase analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with a bias voltage of 10 mV. 

The Au/sintered pellets/Au cell with copper foil lead were placed into an envelope, which was then evacuated and heat-sealed. 

The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of the sintered pellets were estimated from complex impedance plots using Zview 2 software.

The reaction was not completed at sintering temperatures as low as 850 °C, and an impurity phase of AlPO4 was observed. All diffraction lines of the samples with x ≤ 0. All diffraction lines of the samples with x ≤ 0.3 and y ≤ 0.3 and y ≤ 0.3 in Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4) could be indexed as the NASICON-type structure. An impurity phase of monoclinic NASICON-type Li2AlTi(PO4)3 [24] was observed for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0. An impurity phase of monoclinic NASICON-type Li2AlTi(PO4)3 [24] was observed for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0. 0. 0.1 and 0.1 and 0.3) with x ≥ 0.3) with x ≥ 0.4 and Li0.4 and Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − y(PO4)3 with x ≥ 0.8 − y(PO4)3 with x ≥ 0.45.45. Al(PO4)3 was observed for Li1 + x− yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0, 0. Al(PO4)3 was observed for Li1 + x− yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0, 0.1 and 0.1 and 0.2) with x ≥ 0.2) with x ≥ 0.5 and for Li0.5 and for Li0.7 + xAlxNb0.7 + xAlxNb0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7 − x(PO4)3 with x ≥ 0.7 − x(PO4)3 with x ≥ 0.4.4.

The changes in the lattice parameters with x in Li0.

The changes in the lattice parameters with x in Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 2(A). 

The a lattice parameter of 0. 

The a lattice parameter of 0.8515 nm at x = 0.8515 nm at x = 0.35 decreased to 0.35 decreased to 0.8508 nm at x = 0.8508 nm at x = 0.40 and the c lattice parameter of 2.40 and the c lattice parameter of 2.084 nm at x = 0.084 nm at x = 0.35 decreased to 2.35 decreased to 2.072 nm at x = 0.072 nm at x = 0.4.4. Cretin and Fabry [25] reported that the a parameter decreased and the c parameter increased with increasing x in Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3, while Aono et al. [9] found both the a and c parameters decreased with increasing x. The a and c parameters of the Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 systems prepared in this study decreased with increasing x until 0. The a and c parameters of the Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 systems prepared in this study decreased with increasing x until 0.3, and then the c parameter increased signiﬁcantly with x. The decrease of the a and c parameters can be attributed to the substitution of Al3+ with smaller ionic radius (0. The decrease of the a and c parameters can be attributed to the substitution of Al3+ with smaller ionic radius (0.53 nm) for Ti4+ with a larger ionic radius (0.53 nm) for Ti4+ with a larger ionic radius (0.605 nm) in the octahedral sites. 

Several factors play a determinant role in the inference of the cation substitution on the structure [26]. 

Additional Li+ ions are located in the unoccupied Li sites by the substitution of Al3+ for Ti4+, as observed in Na1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 [27] to maintain charge neutrality. The additional lithium ions in these sites lead to repulsion along the c-axis. It is not clear that the a and c parameters for Li1. It is not clear that the a and c parameters for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3 are larger than those for Li1.3(PO4)3 are larger than those for Li1.25Al0.25Al0.45Nb0.45Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3, but the Li2AlTi(PO4)3 and AlPO4 impurity phases, which were not detected in the XRD patterns, may be related to the increase in the lattice paramours. The solubility limit of Al in Li0. The solubility limit of Al in Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 may be in a range of x = 0.8 − x(PO4)3 may be in a range of x = 0.4–0.4–0.45, which is slightly higher than that in Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3.45, which is slightly higher than that in Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3.The changes of theFig. 4.

Fig. 3 shows the relative density dependence on x in Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 as a function of y. The relative density was increased with x for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0, and 0. The relative density was increased with x for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0, and 0.1) until x = 0.1) until x = 0.5, for Li0.5, for Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 until x = 0.8 − x(PO4)3 until x = 0.55, and for Li0.55, and for Li0.7 + xAlxNb0.7 + xAlxNb0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7 − x(PO4)3 until x = 0.7 − x(PO4)3 until x = 0.60.60. The highest relative density of 97% was observed for Li1. The highest relative density of 97% was observed for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.6Nb0.6Nb0.3Ti1.3Ti1.1(PO4)3, which is higher than that of Li1.1(PO4)3, which is higher than that of Li1.45Al0.45Al0.45Ge0.45Ge0.2Ti1.2Ti1.35(PO4)3 (95.35(PO4)3 (95.8%) [21]. Impurity phases at the grain boundaries, such as AlPO4 and Li2AlTi(PO4)3, could serve as a sintering agent.

The impedance proﬁles showed a large semi-circle followed by a straight line. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance Rb, and the diameter of the semicircle indicates the grain boundary resistance, Rgb [28]. The semi-circle due to the bulk impedance was out of the frequency range for the impedance analyzer used. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities along with the relative density of Li0. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities along with the relative density of Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 at 25 °C are shown in Fig. 5 as a function of x, where the bulk and grain boundary resistances were estimated using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 4. 4.The grain boundaryFig. 2. 2.

The increase of the lattice parameters by the substitution of Nb5+ with a larger ionic radius (0. The increase of the lattice parameters by the substitution of Nb5+ with a larger ionic radius (0.64 nm) for Ti4+ with a smaller ionic radius (0.64 nm) for Ti4+ with a smaller ionic radius (0.605 nm) is expected. The a lattice parameter increased monotonically; however, the change of the c parameter is somewhat complicated.The abnormal change of the c lattice parameter with y may be due to a decrease of the Li+ ion concentration with increasing y to maintain chargeFig. 3. 3.

The low grain boundary conductivity (high grain boundary resistance) for Li1. 

The low grain boundary conductivity (high grain boundary resistance) for Li1.35Al0.35Al0.55Nb0.55Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.25(PO4)3 may be due to the contribution of high resistance impurity phases such as AlPO4 and Li2AlTi(PO4)3, which were observed in the XRD patterns. The dependence of the bulk conductivity on x for Li0. '

The dependence of the bulk conductivity on x for Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 showed a maximum conductivity of 1.8 − x(PO4)3 showed a maximum conductivity of 1.35 × 10−3 S cm−1 at x = 0.35 × 10−3 S cm−1 at x = 0.5.5. The ionic conductivity (σi) in solid electrolytes is generally expressed by the equation σi = enμi, where n is the mobile ion concentration and μi is the ion mobility. The content of mobile Li+ ions in Li0. The content of mobile Li+ ions in Li0.8 + xAlxNb0.8 + xAlxNb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.8 − x(PO4)3 is increased up to the solubility limit of Al, which was estimated to be in a range of 0.8 − x(PO4)3 is increased up to the solubility limit of Al, which was estimated to be in a range of 0.4–0.4–0.45 from the lattice constant change with x. 

However, the highest bulk conductivity was found at x = 0. However, the highest bulk conductivity was found at x = 0.5, even though the XRD pattern for Li1.5, even though the XRD pattern for Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 indicated trace impurity phases. 

The bulk conductivities were calculated using an equivalent circuit with a simple series combination of the bulk and grain boundary impedances. A more complex equivalent circuit that involves the parallel contribution of the grain boundary impedance [29] should be used to calculate the real bulk resistance.The highest total conductivity(bulk and grain boundary) of 7.The highest total conductivity(bulk and grain boundary) of 7.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3, which is lower than that of Li1.30(PO4)3, which is lower than that of Li1.45Al0.45Al0.45Ge0.45Ge0.2Ti1.2Ti1.35(PO4) (1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C) [21] and higher than that of Li1.35(PO4) (1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C) [21] and higher than that of Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (2.7(PO4)3 (2.3 × 10−4 at 25 °C).

Similar conductivity behavior was observed for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0.Similar conductivity behavior was observed for Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (y = 0.1 and 0.1 and 0.3). Fig. 6 shows the Al content dependence of the total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 as a function of Nb content. 

The maximum bulk conductivity of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 with y = 0. The maximum bulk conductivity of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 with y = 0.1, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.2 and 0.3 was observed at x = 0.3 was observed at x = 0.45, 0.45, 0.50 and 0.50 and 0.55, respectively. The content of mobile Li+ ions in Li1 + x− yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 is dependent on both x and y. The highest bulk conductivity of 1. The highest bulk conductivity of 1.52 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.52 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0·2Ti1.5Nb0·2Ti1.30(PO4)3 The bulk conductivity of Li1.30(PO4)3. 

The bulk conductivity of Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3 was comparable to that of Li1.3(PO4)3 was comparable to that of Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (1.7(PO4)3 (1.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C), but considerably lower than that of 5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C), but considerably lower than that of 5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ge0.2Ti1.2Ti1.4(PO4). 

The lower bulk conductivity may be due to the lower mobile Li+ ion concentration. The grain boundary conductivity was signiﬁcantly dependent on y; the highest grain boundary conductivity of 1. The grain boundary conductivity was signiﬁcantly dependent on y; the highest grain boundary conductivity of 1.48 × 10−3 S cm−1 was observed for Li1.48 × 10−3 S cm−1 was observed for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3.3(PO4)3.TheFig. 7. 7.

The stability of the lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte in aqueous solution is an essential requirement for the lithium conducting solid electrolyte in aqueous lithium-air batteries [6] and aqueous lithium batteries [22,23]. 

In particular, the solid electrolyte for the lithium-air batteries should be stable in saturated LiOH aqueous solution because the reaction product is LiOH. Shimonishi et al. reported that the Li1 + x + yAlxTi2 − xP3 − ySiyO12 glass ceramic was stable in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl [14] and Zhang et al. conﬁrmed that Li1. conﬁrmed that Li1.4Al0.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ge0.16Ti1.16Ti1.44(PO4)3 was stable in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl [20]. The impedance change of Li1. The impedance change of Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl was examined as a function of the immersion time at room temperature. The concentrations of LiOH and LiCl in the solution were 6. The concentrations of LiOH and LiCl in the solution were 6.0 M and 11.0 M and 11.8 M, respectively [14]. 

No change in the bulk resistance and a slight decrease of the grain boundary resistance were observed for the sample immersed for one week, as shown in Fig. 8.

The decrease in the grain boundary resistance could be explained by the formation of LiCl·xH2O at the grain boundaries [33]. The XRD pattern of Li1. The XRD pattern of Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl for one week revealed no impurity phases. 

These results suggest that Li1. These results suggest that Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 is acceptable for use as the protective layer in aqueous lithium-air batteries. However, Li1. However, Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 was unstable in aqueous solution without a high content of lithium ions because of an ion exchange reaction between Li+ in Li1.30(PO4)3 was unstable in aqueous solution without a high content of lithium ions because of an ion exchange reaction between Li+ in Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 and H+ in water, as observed for Li3xLa2 / 3− xTiO3 [34].

Fig. 9 shows the dependence of the three-point bending strength at room temperature on the Al content for Li1 + x− yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4) (y = 0, 0. 9 shows the dependence of the three-point bending strength at room temperature on the Al content for Li1 + x− yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4) (y = 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.2 and 0.3) as a function of y. A bending strength of 104 N mm−2 was observed for Li1. 

A bending strength of 104 N mm−2 was observed for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3 with a total conductivity of 7.3(PO4)3 with a total conductivity of 7.5 × 10−4 S cm−1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1. The bending strength is higher than that of 90 N mm−2 for Li1. The bending strength is higher than that of 90 N mm−2 for Li1.4Al0.4Al0.4Ge0.4Ge0.2Ti1.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 prepared by solid-state reaction [21] and lower than that of 140 N mm−2 for the Li1 + x + yAlx(Ti,Ge)SiyP3 − yO12 Ohara glass ceramic. The conductivity of the Ohara glass ceramic is as low as 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Li1. Li1.30Al0.30Al0.50Nb0.50Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.30(PO4)3 prepared by conventional solid-state reaction using less expensive starting materials is thus quite attractive as a separator between lithium and water in aqueous lithium-air [3] and aqueous lithium batteries [22,23] due to its high lithium-ion conductivity and excellent mechanical properties.

Water-stable NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes of Li1 + x − yAlxNbyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction at 900 °C for 7 h. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 7. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 7.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3.3(PO4)3. The relative density of the sintered pellets was as high as 94. The relative density of the sintered pellets was as high as 94.8% and the three-point bending strength was 104 N mm−2 for Li1.8% and the three-point bending strength was 104 N mm−2 for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.5Nb0.5Nb0.2Ti1.2Ti1.3(PO4)3.3(PO4)3. This electrolyte was also stable in saturated LiOH aqueous solution with saturated LiCl. This water-stable high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte has potential application as the protective layer for lithium metal electrodes in aqueous lithium-air batteries and aqueous lithium batteries.
