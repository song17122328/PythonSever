To improve the stability of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ?NASICON?-based potentiometric CO2 sensors fitted with carbonate/Au layers ?sensing electrode?, mixed conducting oxides of Li0.4CoO2 and Na0.6CoO2 were examined for their applicability to solid-reference electrodes in terms of their stability against CO2 and humidity. Compared with the Na0.6CoO2 electrode, the Li0.4CoO2 electrode showed far better stability against CO2. When the Li0.4CoO2 electrode was coated with a layer of glass, the electrode showed no response to CO2 ?200–2000 ppm? and little interference from humidity ?21–86% relative humidity ?RH?? at 450°C. A CO2 sensor device using Li2CO3–BaCO3 and a glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 showed stable electromotive force ?emf? responses to CO2 in humid air ?86% RH? at 450°C. The emf of the device was also stable even after it was exposed to humid air ?86% RH? containing CO2 ?400 ppm? at room temperature for 1–2 days. The present study indicates the promising features of the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 as a stable solid-reference material for NASICON-based CO2 sensors.

There is an increasing need for the continuous monitoring and detection of the concentration of carbon dioxide ?CO2? in the atmosphere because of its negative impacts on earth as a greenhouse gas. Currently, the necessity of controlling and monitoring CO2 has rapidly expanded to other fields such as biorelated processes, medical applications, and autoventilation systems. Thus, compact and reliable CO2 sensors have attracted widespread attention for such applications in recent years. Among the sensors reported so far, the solid electrolyte-based potentiometric CO2 sensors are the most feasible due to their high performance in terms of sensitivity and selectivity.1-19 In particular, we have developed high performance CO2 sensors using Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ?NASICON? and binary carbonate as a solid electrolyte ?Na ion conductor? a n d a C O2-sensitive auxiliary phase.20-28 The sensor device is represented as the following electrochemical cell CO2,O2,Au ?sensing electrode?,binary carbonate ?e.g., Li2CO3–BaCO3??NASICON?Au ?counter electrode?,O2 ?1? The potential of the sensing electrode is determined by the following electrochemical reaction occurring at the interface between carbonate and the Au-sensing electrode 2Li+ + C O2 + 1/2O2 + 2 e− = L i2CO3 ?2? The electromotive force ?emf? is dependent on the partial pressure of CO2 according to the Nernst equation. However, the potential of the counter electrode is dependent on the partial pressure of O2 and the activities of Na2O and Na+ in NASICON according to the following reaction 2Na+ + 1/2O2 + 2 e− = N a2O ?in NASICON? ?3? The potential of the counter electrode is thus fixed when the partial pressure of O2 and the activities of Na2O and Na+ are constant. Accordingly, the emf of the device generated between the sensing and counter electrodes is a function of the partial pressure of CO2under the condition that the partial pressure of O2 and the activities of Na2O and Na+ are constant. The emf is represented on the basis of the following Nernst equation.

emf = RT/2F ln PCO2 + const ?4? where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and PCO2 is the partial pressure of CO2. However, it has been reported that once the sensor device is exposed to a humid atmosphere containing CO2 at room temperature, contaminants such as carbonates and phosphates form on the NASICON surface.29 This makes the potential of the counter electrode, in which NASICON is fitted with a porous Au ?or Pt? layer, unstable probably because of changes in the activities of Na+ or Na2O on the NASICON surface. To overcome this instability problem of NASICON, it is necessary to introduce a solid-reference electrode that is fitted into the NASICON surface. Thus far, some metal and mixed ?ion and electron? conductors, such as Na,30 NaxCoO2,31,32 LiMn2O4,33 La0.9Sr0.1MnO3,34,35 Na2Ti6O13/TiO2,36 Na2SnO3/SnO2,36 LiCoO2/Co3O4,37,38 LiFeO2/LiFe5O8,39 and BiCuVOx/La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3,40,41 have been investigated as reference electrodes for potentiometric CO2 sensors. However, studies on the stability of solid-reference electrodes are very limited. We have recently reported that a mixed ionic–electronic conductor of NaxCoO2 ?x = 1 or 0.6, Na+ conductor?, which was first proposed by Weppner and co-workers as a reference material,31,32 showed good stability against CO2 and water when it was covered with a glass layer.42 The following electrode reaction can be postulated to take place at the interface between NASICON and NaxCoO2 Na+ + yNax−1/yCoO2 + e− = yNaxCoO2 ?5? The preferable feature of NaxCoO2 as an electrode material is its good metallic conductivity. The glass-coated NaxCoO2 electrode also showed far more stable potential values during thermal cycling tests between 450°C and room temperature in a humid atmosphere. However, the potential gradually varied with time via repetition of the thermal cycling tests.42 This is probably due to the generation of cracks and minute pores after repeated thermal cycling, which allows diffusion of moisture and CO2 inside the glass-coated electrode and assists the reaction of NaxCoO2 with water or CO2 at room temperature. It is probable that a more stable solid-reference material, if available, can suppress the potential variation even if the glass coating is degraded to a certain extent.

Previously, we discovered that Li-based carbonates are much more stable against humidity than Na-based carbonates, and the device using a Li-based carbonate as an auxiliary layer suffered far less interference from humidity than that using a Na-based carbonate.21,43 According to these findings, we expected that lithium cobaltites would be more stable against water than sodium cobaltites. In this study, we examined the properties of LixCoO2?x = 0.4? as a reference electrode material for NASICON-based potentiometric CO2 sensors, with a particular focus on its stability against CO2 and humidity.

Gas sensing experiments were carried out in a conventional gas flow apparatus equipped with an electric furnace. A parent gas ?2000 ppm CO2 in dry synthetic air? was diluted with synthetic air to prepare sample gases containing 200– 2000 ppm CO2. Humid sample gases in the range of 21–86% relative humidity ?RH? were prepared by allowing a designated part of the synthetic air to bubble through water. The potentials of both sensing and cobaltite solid-reference electrodes were measured relative to the Au reference electrode with an electrometer. The Au reference side was continuously exposed to synthetic air to fix the potential. The Au reference electrode allowed the measurements of sensing and solid-reference electrode potentials to be made separately. For practical use, sensor devices are sometimes exposed to humid air during storage in room temperature. This may lead to the formation of impurities on the surface of the NASICON and cobaltites. Thus, it is important to examine the emf stability of the fabricated devices after they have been stored under humid conditions at room temperature for long periods of time. To examine such stability, the devices were exposed to humid air ?86% RH? containing CO2 ?400 ppm? at room temperature for about 2 days after their original properties were measured at the operating temperature ?450°C?, and then they were reheated to 450°C. This heating and cooling treatment was repeated three times ?heat-cycle test?. Changes in the electrode potential from the original value after the heat-cycle tests were monitored with time.

Stability of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 against CO2 and humidity.— Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 prepared by the solid-state reaction. The patterns were well matched with those of Na0.6CoO2 ?JCPDS card no. 30-1181? and Li0.4CoO2 ?JCPDS card no. 44-0146?, suggesting the successful formation of crystal phases, although an impurity phase was observed in Na0.6CoO2. The thermal stabilities of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 were also examined. Figure 3 shows the TG curves of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2. N a0.6CoO2 showed a gradual weight change, while Li0.4CoO2 showed no significant weight change ?less than 0.4%?. Although the reason for the weight loss in Na0.6CoO2 is not clear, the results obviously indicate a higher thermal stability in Li0.4CoO2 than in Na0.6CoO2. One of the most important requirements of reference electrodes is that they should not respond to CO2. Therefore, we examined the response properties of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 to CO2. Figure 4 shows the emf of device A as a function of CO2 concentration ?200– 2000 ppm? in dry air at 450°C. When device A, without a glasscoating layer, was exposed to steps of CO2 concentrations, the Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 layers responded to the changes in CO2concentration. This indicates that each of the oxides reacts with CO2to form a carbonate. When Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 were compared, Li0.4CoO2 gave a smaller response of 29 mV to CO2 than Na0.6CoO2 ?85 mV?. It follows that Li0.4CoO2 is more stable against attacks by CO2 than Na0.6CoO2. Nevertheless, the cobaltite electrodes should be protected from such a reaction by covering the surface with a glass layer. Next, the CO2 response properties of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2covered with glass layers were examined. Figure 5 shows the emf stability of device B against changes in CO2 concentrations ?200– 2000 ppm? in dry air at 450°C. The emf of both glass-coated elec trodes did not respond to the changes in the CO2 concentration. This indicates that the reaction of Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 with CO2was effectively suppressed by the glass coating. The stability of the glass-coated Na0.6CoO2 and Li0.4CoO2 electrodes against humidity was also examined. Figure 6 shows the dependence of the emf of device B on RH ?21–86% at 25°C? in air containing a constant CO2 concentration ?400 ppm? at 450°C. The emf was only slightly influenced by humidity. For the device using glass-coated Li0.4CoO2, the maximum emf change ?0.7 mV? in response to humidity was smaller than that for the device using glasscoated Na0.6CoO2 ?1.1 mV?. The slight variation observed in the emf may be caused by the diffusion of water vapor through minute pores in the glass layer. However, the lower reactivity of Li0.4CoO2than Na0.6CoO2 with water resulted in a lower emf variation. According to the results obtained, the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 is a promising reference electrode that is superior to the glass-coated Na0.6CoO2 in terms of thermal stability and chemical stability against CO2 and humidity. CO2 sensing properties and stability of the device fitted with carbonate and glass-coated Li0.4CoO2.— To investigate the feasibility of the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 as a solid-reference electrode in more detail, the CO2 sensing properties and the stability of a device fitted with carbonate/Au as a sensing electrode and the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 as a reference electrode were examined. Figure 7 shows the potentials of the sensing and the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 reference electrodes relative to the Au reference electrode for device C in response to changes in CO2 concentration under humid conditions ?86% RH? at 450°C. The potential of the sensing electrode quickly responded to changes in CO2 concentration while that of the glasscoated Li0.4CoO2 reference electrode was kept constant. The emf between the sensing and glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 reference electrodes was plotted as a function of CO2 concentration, as shown in Fig. 8. The emf was linear to the logarithm of CO2 concentration, exhibiting a typical Nernstian behavior. The reaction electron number ?n? calculated from the slope of the straight line was 2.0, which shows good consistency with the theoretical value predicted from Reaction 2. The results obtained clearly show that the potential of the solidreference electrode is fixed at a constant value even in the presence of both CO2 and humidity, demonstrating the feasibility of this electrode as a reference electrode for CO2 sensors.

It is suspected that during the long-term operation of NASICONbased CO2 sensors, Na+ ions in NASICON may react with CO2 to form a carbonate, which causes the potential of the counter electrode ?conventionally an Au electrode? to be unstable in response to changes in CO2 concentration. The use of solid-reference materials that cover the NASICON surface would prevent such a reaction from proceeding. Thus, from a practical point of view, the long-term stability of the device fitted with the glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 elec trode was examined. Figure 9 shows the stability of the emf ?potential difference between the sensing and solid-reference electrodes? of device C during heat-cycle tests. The temperature of the device was switched from room temperature to the working temperature ?450°C? at intervals of 1.5–2 days using an electric furnace. The concentration of CO2 and the RH were kept constant during the heat-cycle tests. The emf varied with time at the initial period. However, after the second cycle, the emf was kept at a constant value of about ?140 mV . The repetition of heating to 450°C and the exposure to humid air at room temperature gave no serious degradation of the emf stability. The observed behavior is much better than that previously reported for the glass-coated Na0.6CoO2.42 It is suggested that the reaction of NASICON with water or CO2 at room temperature was effectively suppressed, owing to the better stability of Li0.4CoO2 against humidity and CO2 as compared to Na0.6CoO2. This contributed to the observed improvement in the stability of the CO2 sensor device during long-term operation at 450°C. The higher thermal stability of Li0.4CoO2 than Na0.6CoO2, as revealed by the TG analysis, can also account for the improvement.

Three types of sensor devices, in which glass-uncoated/-coated Li0.4CoO2 and Na0.6CoO2 electrodes and a carbonate auxiliary phase were attached on NASICON, were fabricated and tested to study their CO2 response properties. The Li0.4CoO2 electrode showed a smaller response to CO2 than the Na0.6CoO2 electrode in dry air at 450°C, exhibiting its better stability against CO2. Covering the Li0.4CoO2 electrode with a glass layer of the composition SiO2:Li2O:B2O3:Al2O3 = 44:20:31:5 in molar ratio effectively suppressed the reaction of Li0.4CoO2 with CO2 and canceled the response to CO2. The glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 electrode also showed less humidity interference from water than the glass-coated NaxCoO2. A C O2 sensor device fitted with Li2CO3–BaCO3/Au and glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 as a sensing electrode and a solid-reference electrode, respectively, showed a stable and quick emf response to CO2 ?200–2000 ppm? even in the presence of high humidity ?86% RH ?at 25°C?? at 450°C. The device also showed good stability against the repetition of heat cycles between room temperature and 450°C under humid conditions ?86% RH, 400 ppm CO2?. The results obtained demonstrated the practical feasibility of glass-coated Li0.4CoO2 as a solid-reference electrode that is stable against CO2and humidity.
