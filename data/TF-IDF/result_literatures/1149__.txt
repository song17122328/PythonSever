The subsolidus region of the Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 ternary salt system was studied by X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  analysis.  New  compounds  Ag1–xCo1–xAl1  +  x(MoO4)3  (0  ≤  x  ≤  0.4)  and AgCo3Al(MoO4)5 were detected to form. The variable 2)composition phase Ag1–xCo1–xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 is of the NASICON structure type (space group R c). AgCo3Al(MoO4)5 crystallizes in the triclinic symmetry (space  Z = 2) with the unit cell parameters a = 6.9101(6), b = 17.519(1), c = 6.8241(6) Å, α = 87.356(7)°, β = group  101.078(7)°, and γ = 91.985(9)°. The compounds are thermally stable until 770–780 and 760°C, respectively.

The  expansion  of  applications  of  oxide  materials and the increasingly stringent requirements for devices designed on their basis make it necessary to seek and produce  new  phases  with  a  certain  set  of  properties. Currently,  of  special  interest  are  three 2)dimensional superionic  conductors  with  skeletal  structures  of  the rhombohedral type because they can be used for creat 2) ing electrochemical power devices and in other areas of science and technology [1–5].

The purpose of this work was to study the phase for 2) mation  in  a  molybdate  system  containing  silver, cobalt,  and  aluminum  in  the  subsolidus  region, develop  the  conditions  for  producing  the  ternary molybdates  existing  in  this  system,  and  determine their X 2)ray diffraction and thermal characteristics.

The initial substances were neutral molybdates of silver, cobalt, and aluminum, which were preliminar 2) ily  synthesized  by  stepwise  annealing  stoichiometric mixtures of analytically pure AgNO3, chemically pure Co(NO3)2 ⋅ 6H2O, analytically pure Al(NO3)3 ⋅ 9H2O, and  at  350–450°C (Ag2MoO4), 300–750°C (CoMoO4), and 300–700°C (Al2(MoO4)3). The X 2)ray diffraction and thermal char 2) acteristics of the obtained compounds agree satisfac 2) torily with the published data [6–8].

The  reaction  mixtures  were annealed beginning with 350°C to the melting points at a temperature increment of 50°C with intermediate homogenization every 20 h at an annealing duration at each temperature of no less than 50–80 h. The phase state of the annealed mixtures was controlled by X 2)ray powder  diffraction  analysis  with  a  Bruker  AXS  D8 Advance  automatic  diffractometer  (λCuKα,  graphite monochromator, maximal angle 2θmax = 90°, scanning step  0.02076°).  To  determine  the  crystallographic characteristics,  samples  were  studied  with  Guinier G670  HUBER  and  Termo  ARL  autodiffractometers (CuKα, reflection geometry, angle range 2θ = 5°–90°, scanning step 0.0201°). The unit cell parameters were refined by least squares using ICDD software for pre 2) paring experimental standards.

The systems Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4 and Ag2MoO4– Al2(MoO4)3  were  described  in  the  literature  [9,  10] and, therefore, were not additionally studied.

Two  sides,  Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3  and Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4,  of  the  concentrations  triangle Ag2MoO4–Al2(MoO4)3  are  characterized  by  the  for 2) mation  of  binary  molybdates  Ag2Co2(MoO4)3  and AgAl(MoO4)2. The solid 2)phase synthesis of these com 2) pounds  was  carried  out  by  annealing  stoichiometric mixtures of neutral molybdates according to published procedures [9–11].

Binary  molybdate AgAl(MoO4)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic symmetry (NaFe(MoO4)2  structure  type),  has  no  noticeable homogeneity  region,  and  melts  incongruently  [10]. On the side CoMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3, under the chosen experimental conditions, no phases were detected.

The  Ag2MoO4–Al2(MoO4)3  system  is  binary  only within the concentration range 50–0 mol % Ag2MoO4 [13];  therefore,  the  triangulation  of  the  ternary  salt system  was  region  CoMoO4– Ag2Co2(MoO4)3–AgAl(MoO4)2–Al2(MoO4)3.

To  investigate  the  interaction  in  the  system Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3,  mixtures  of  neu 2) tral and binary molybdates were prepared, the compo 2) sitions of which corresponded to the points of interac 2) tions of sections in the system. Analysis of the results of  studying  the  phase  compositions  at  the  points  of intersection of sections and the points in the plane of the triangle Ag2MoO4–CoMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 showed that  ternary  molybdates  Ag1 – xCo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and AgCo3Al(MoO4)5 form in the system. The obtained phases have no noticeable homogeneity regions along the section AgAl(MoO4)2–CoMoO4.

To  determine  the  possible  homogeneity  region  of the  first  phase  along  the  section  AgCoAl(MoO4)3– Al2(MoO4)3,  of  the  preliminarily  synthesized  neutral molybdates,  Ag1 – xCo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3  samples  were chosen at an interval of Δx = 1 within the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7, annealed at 350–550°C, and subjected to X 2)ray pow 2) der diffraction analysis. It was found that, under the experimental conditions, along the section under con 2) sideration, a variable 2)composition phase forms, which is an omission solid solution based on ternary molyb 2) date AgCoAl(MoO4)3. According to the X 2)ray powder diffraction data, this phase begins to form at 420°C.

Annealing of Ag1 – xCo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 for 150–180 h at 500–520°C gives a solid solution extending to x = 0.4. Note that the annealing of the reaction mixtures of  the  variable 2)composition  phase  at  550°C  enables one to reduce the duration of the synthesis of this ter 2) nary  molybdate  to  80–100°C.  At  higher  content  of aluminum  cations,  in  the  X 2)ray  powder  diffraction pattern, weak reflections of  Al2(MoO4)3  emerge.  The figure  shows  the  subsolidus  structure  of  the  system CoMoO4–Ag2MoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 at 500–520°C.

The X 2)ray powder diffraction analysis showed that, according to the positions of reflections and the inten 2) sity  ratios,  Ag1 – xCo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3  is  isostructural to  ternary  sodium  zinc  scandium  molybdate  [14], which has a rhombohedral lattice (space group  R c, Z = 6) and is of the NASICON structure type. Table 1 presents  the  crystallographic  characteristics  of  sam 2) ples  of  some  Ag1 – xCo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3  composi 2) tions.

Ternary  molybdate  AgCo3Al(MoO4)5  is  thermally stable  until  760°C,  and  the  temperature  range  of incongruent melting of the phase with a wide homoge 2) neity  region  is  770–780°C.  By  the  thermal  analysis data, the compounds have no polymorphism.

Ternary  molybdates  AgCo3Al(MoO4)5  and Ag1 – xСo1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) were detected and isolated in the single 2)phase state, their structures were  determined,  and  the  crystallographic  and  ther 2) mal parameters were found.
