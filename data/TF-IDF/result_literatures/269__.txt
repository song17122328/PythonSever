Reversible potassium-ion intercalation in anti-NASICON-type iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 is demonstrated for the first time. Submicron-sized Fe2(MoO4)3 particles are synthesized by solution combustion synthesis route using glycine as fuel. The monoclinic anti-NASICON type Fe2(MoO4)3 positive electrode exhibits an initial discharge capacity of ~94 mAh g−1 involving an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox activity centered around 2.6 V (vs. K/K+). Employing ex situ X-ray diffraction, the K+ (de)intercalation is found to involve an underlying solid-solution redox mechanism. This anti-NASICON Fe2(MoO4)3 molybdate is found to be an efficient polyanionic cathode candidate for potassium-ion batteries.

Sodium and potassium-ion batteries are highly attractive due to their similar working principle to Li-ion batteries, low cost and high elemental abundance [1–3]. In addition, potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) form a significant post Li-ion battery due to (i) abundant and cheaper resources (eg. K2CO3) making them economic, (ii) closer negative redox potential (K/K+: −2.9 V and Na/Na+: −2.7 V vs. SHE) to Li+ ions that maximizes the energy density [4,5], (iii) weaker Lewis acidity of K+ions facilitate higher mobility and fast ionic conductivity in liquid electrolytes [6,7], (iv) reversible (de)intercalation of K+-ions in graphite and (v) use of economic aluminium current collector (without any alloying) reducing the cost and weight of the KIBs [8]. Recent theoretical studies endorse that K+-ions has over three times higher diffusion co-efficient than Li+-ions [9]. Thus, KIBs forms a potential choice for future energy storage. However, the key challenge is to find appropriate electrode materials that can accommodate the larger K+ ions (1.38 Å) in comparison to Li+ ions (0.76 Å) and Na+ ions (1.02 Å). It has led to wide exploration of low cost, non-toxic, high capacity and chemically stable electrode materials for KIBs [10–23]. Identifying suitable positive and negative electrode materials is critical in successful development of low-cost rechargeable KIBs. To date, layered transition metal oxides, Prussian blue (PB) and few polyanionic materials have been evaluated as the positive electrodes for KIBs [13–25]. Even though PB and its analogues showed attractive electrochemical performances, the materials suffer from low density resulting in poor volumetric capacity. On the other hand, most of the Kbased layered metal oxides (KxMO2) showed sloping voltage profile due to multiple phase changes and distortions during the larger ionic size Kions (de)insertion [13,16]. the polyanion-type compounds are the most promising electrode materials due to their stability, safety and suitable operating voltages [18–25]. In polyanionic frameworks, the repulsion can be effectively screened and K+ ions can be well separated by large polyanions [19–27]. One such polyanion-based insertion host is anti-NASICON-type iron molybdate Fe2(MoO4)3 having open three dimensional (3D) framework capable of intercalating both Li and Na-ions. Fe2(MoO4)3 employs electronegative (MoO4)2− species to enhance the operating potential due to the inductive effect. During battery cycling, Fe2(MoO4)3 exhibits discharge voltage plateau at ~3.0 vs. Li/Li+ and ~2.6 vs. Na/Na+ [28–31]. Very recently, Fe2(MoO4)3 has been found to be suitable positive electrode for rechargeable hybrid Mg/Li-ion batteries [32]. Extending the versatility of this compound, in the present work, antiNASICON-type Fe2(MoO4)3 is presented as a potential cathode for KIBs. 2. Experimental section

Fe2(MoO4)3 was synthesized by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) technique. In a typical synthesis of Fe2(MoO4)3, iron nitrate non(4.03 g), ammonium heptamolybdate ahydrate [Fe(NO3)3·9H2O]

Glycine mediated solution combustion synthesis(SCS) of Fe2(MoO4)3 led to the formation of low-temperature monoclinic phase. Rietveld refinement of resulting powder pattern was carried out using GSAS program with the EXPGUI front-end as shown in Fig. 1 [33]. The observed diffraction peaks are well indexed with the monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 (JCPDS card no. 00–31-0642). It confirmed the formation of phase pure anti-NASICON-type Fe2(MoO4)3 assuming a monoclinic structure with P21 symmetry. The lattice parameter values of a = 15.727(0) Å, b = 9.257(5) Å, c = 18.248(8) Å, β = 125.33(1)o and unit cell volume = 2167.558(4) (Å)3 are in sync with the reported values [34]. Crystallographic parameters of the monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 product are provided in supporting information Table S1. The anti-NASICON Fe2(MoO4)3 framework consists of Fe3+ ions in an octahedral oxygen surrounding (FeO6) that are linked with MoO4 tetrahedra by sharing all six corners as illustrated in Fig. 1 (inset). The basic motif of this framework consists of three MoO4 tetrahedra connected with two FeO6 octahedra called the “lantern unit”. The stack of the “lantern unit” is parallel in NASICON framework, whereas it is antiparallel to each other in anti-NASICON framework [35]. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of Fe2(MoO4)3 (Fig. 2a) displays highly agglomerated sub-micron sized particles with nanograin-like secondary particles on the surface. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study further endorses the presence of nanograins on the surface of micrometric particles with high degree of agglomeration. High-resolution TEM image (HRTEM) and selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) confirmed highly crystalline nature of assynthesized Fe2(MoO4)3 product (Fig. 2c). The interplanar spacing was measured to be 0.431 nm that can be indexed corresponding to

To gauge the structural changes during the K+-ion (de)intercalation process, ex situ XRD analysis was carried out for Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode cycled at a current rate of C/20. The ex situ XRD patterns of Fe2(MoO4)3 electrodes at various states of charge and discharge voltage is shown in Fig. 4. During the discharge process, gradual shift in XRD peaks was observed due to the increase in interlayer d-spacing owing to large K+ions intercalation. The highest intensity XRD peak [with (hkl) values of (40-2)] of completely discharged electrode shifted ~0.5° towards lower 2θ angle due to the increase in interlayer d-spacing. In addition, intensity of the peaks was reduced during discharge of anti-NASICON Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode hinting at amorphization during the K+-ion intercalation. No additional peaks were observed in the XRD patterns of (dis)charged electrodes. All the diffraction peaks are indexed with the monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 framework with P21 symmetry. The ex situ XRD results confirm the single-phase solid-solution process during (de)intercalation of K+ ions into the iron molybdate structure. In contrast, Li+ ion intercalation into the monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 framework leads to the formation of orthorhombic Li2Fe2(MoO4)3 (symmetry: Pbcn) involving a two-phase reaction mechanism [29]. In the AxFe2(MoO4)3 structure, alkali ions are placed in the distorted tetrahedral sites formed by the edges of two FeO6 octahedra [35]. In contrast, K+ ions insertion into the monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 framework showed solid-solution (single phase) reaction mechanism very similar to the sodium insertion process [30]. The ex situ results showed the capability of Fe2(MoO4)3 framework to reversibly accommodate larger K+-ions without significant structural changes unlike various reported layered metal oxides [13,36–38]. 4. Conclusions

In summary, nanoscale monoclinic structured anti-NASICON-type Fe2(MoO4)3 was synthesized by solution combustion synthesis technique and was investigated as positive electrode material for potassiumion batteries. The submicron-sized Fe2(MoO4)3 particles delivered reversible capacity approaching 80 Ah g−1 involving an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox activity located at 2.6 V (vs. K/K+). This anti-NASICON molybdate was capable of reversible insertion of ~1.7 K+ ions leading to the formation of K1.7Fe2(MoO4)3 end member. Ex situ structural study implied the occurrence of solid-solution (single-phase) redox activity during (de) potassiation of Fe2(MoO4)3 that works as a versatile host for various alkali ion (Li/Na/K) insertion.
