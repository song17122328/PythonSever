Highly Efficient, Fast and Reversible Multi-electron Reaction of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 Cathode for Sodium-Ion Batteries
Through  structural  optimization  synergizing  with  regulating  charge/discharge windows,  the  interpenetrating  graphene  encapsulated  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  with  in-situ carbon  coating  material  (rGO@NMTP-C  )  presents  enhanced  Coulombic  efficiency and  overcomes  the  drawback  of  inferior  electron/ion  diffusion  dynamics.  
The rGO@NMTP-C  reaches  a  high  energy  density  over  500  Wh  kg-1  and  outstanding power density  capability that better than a vast  majority of other  cathodes. The fast ion  diffusion  coefficient  (10-9~10-12  cm2  s-1),  small  volume  change  (8.13%)  during sodiation/desodiation, and the pseudocapacitance effect, are key to the high rate and long-life capability of the material. 


The  sodium  super  ionic  conductor  (NASICON)  structured  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  is  attractive due  to  the  eco-friendly  and  low-cost  Na-Mn-Ti-P-O  system.  However,  Na3MnTi(PO4)3 suffers  from  low  Coulombic  efficiency,  inferior  electronic  conductivity  and  limited specific capacity basing on two-sodium-exchange. 
To address these multifaceted issues, interpenetrating  graphene  encapsulated  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  particles  with carbon-shell covering material (rGO@NMTP-C) was synthesized. 
By regulating cut-off voltages,  a  three-electron  reaction  was  realized  and  Coulombic  efficiency  of  the rGO@NMTP-C was found to increase from < 96% to 100% due to the fast kinetics that enhanced  by  Ti3+/Ti4+  redox,  which  was  verified  by  EIS  and  GITT.  Sodium  storage mechanism  of  the  multielectron  reaction  was  deeply  studied  by  ex-situ  XRD  and  DFT calculations. It shows that the enhanced reversibility synergizing with multifunctional 3D conductive network and the contribution of pseudocapacitance, makes rGO@NMTP-C a promising cathode candidate, which can exhibit a remarkable discharge capacity of 173 mAh g-1. Additionally, for the first time, the rGO@NMTP-C achieves outstanding high rate  capability  of  92.4  mAh  g-1  at  50  C,  and  cycling  stability  of  74.5%  of  capacity retention  after  3500  cycles  at  20  C.  High  performance  full  cells  were  also  realized  for practical utilization of SIBs.   


The development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) calls for a cathode material with high specific capacity to store energy, long lifespan to reduce maintenance cost, and flexible power  storage  capability  to  adapt  climate  change  [1-4]. Sodium  super-ionic  conductor  their  distinctive (NASICON)  materials  have  attracted  great  attention  due crystallographic structure and properties [5-8]. The formula unit of NASICON-structured material is AxM2(XO4)3, where A represents alkali metal, M represents transition metal, and  X  represents  nonmetal  element.  The  [XO4]  tetrahedra  and  [MO6]  octahedra  are connected  by  corner  sharing,  building  a  three-dimensional  framework  with  large ion-diffusion  channels,  which  can  facilitate  fast  sodium  storage  [9-13].  
To  date,  for cathode materials, considerable attention has been paid to Na3V2(PO3)4, which possesses  a  moderate  potential  (3.4  V),  decent  capacity  (117  mAh  g-1)  [14-16],  and  can  achieve ultra-high  rate  and  ultra-long  life  by  structural  optimizations  [17-20].  


However,  energy density  of  Na3V2(PO3)4  still  needs  to  improve,  and  the  expensive  and  toxic  V  may unsuitable for scale-up application. 
In  this  context,  recently,  researchers  are  devoted  to  reducing  the  content  of  V  by engineering  on  cationic  substitution  with  earth-abundant  elements  (Fe,  Ti,  Mn,  etc.). 

Many  mixed-transition-metal typed  materials,  such  as  Na3TiV(PO4)3  [  21-23], Na3FeV(PO4)3  [24],  have  been  explored.  Although  the  cost  of  these  materials  has significantly reduced, energy density of them hardly catches up with Na3V2(PO3)4 due to  the  low  redox  potential  of  Ti3+/Ti4+  and  Fe2+/Fe3+  (2.1  V  and  2.4  V).  
Manganese substitution can be a solution to this problem because Mn is not only low-cost but also possesses high redox potential. 
This strategy can be supported by the successful synthesis of NASICON-Na4MnV(PO4)3, which presents a promoted plateau at 3.6 V basing on the  redox  of  Mn3+/Mn2+  to  improve  energy  density  of  the  material  [24].  NaTi2(PO4)3,  as another typical NASICON-structured material, has been applied as an anode material for sodium-ion  batteries  [12].  Recently,  Goodenough’s  group  reported  a  promising vanadium-free NA



Subsequently,  Zhou’s  group  synthesized  hollow Na3MnTi(PO4)3 microspheres  by  spray-drying  and  realized  three-electron  reaction  [26],  which is expected to display a theoretical specific capacity around 176 mAh g-1. However, specific  capacity  of  the  Na3MnTi(PO4)3 was  limited  (160  mAh  g-1 )  due  to  its  inferior electronic conductivity, which also leads to poor rate capability [26]. 





Besides, Columbic efficiency  (CE)  for  the  two-electron-reaction  based  Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is  unsatisfactory  (< 80%) [25]. Since CE is key for practical applications, it’s important to uncover the impact of  cut-off  voltage  regulation  on  CE.  Moreover,  electrochemical  behavior  and  sodium storage  mechanism  of  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  with  a  multielectron  reaction  is  unclear  and  still needs to understand for future improvements. 
Here, primarily, to boost electrode kinetics, we designed an interpenetrating graphene encapsulated  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  particles  with  carbon-shell  covering  material  (noted  as rGO@NMTP-C)  by  a  feasible  sol-gel  method.  The  CE  of  rGO@NMTP-C  can  be significantly improved by regulating cut-off voltages. When the charge/discharge cut-off voltages locate at 4.3–1.5 V, the primitive two-sodium de-/intercalation reaction becomes three-sodium de-/intercalation, where CE of this material increases from < 96% to around  100%. Additionally, the  redox of Ti3+/Ti4+ in Na3MnTi(PO4)3 activates the third mobile  Na+,  enabling  an  impressive  energy  density  of  over  500  Wh  kg-1  due  to  the  increased specific  capacity  of  173  mAh  g-1.  The  highly  reversible  multi-sodium  de-/intercalation regulation synergizes with structural optimization, consequently, endows rGO@NMTP-C outstanding cycling performance of 74.5% of capacity retention after 3500 cycles at 20 C, and  ultra-high  rate  capability  of  92.4  mAh  g-1  at  50  C.  The  multi-sodium  storage characters and mechanism were deeply investigated.   
As  illustrated  in  Fig.  1a,  all  the  components  are  initially  dispersed  in  the  citric  acid solution, which acts as the complexing agent and carbon sources. Chelate effect can help uniform distribution of the transition-metal-ions, and thus benefit the high purity of the final material. Molar ratio of transition metal and anhydrous citric acid is 2:3. The mixed solution was kept constant stirring in water bath at 80   1). As the moisture evaporated, a black  gel  was  gradually  formed.  During  the  final  calcination  process,  the  pyrolysis  of organic  species  produces  a  thin  carbon-shell,  which  can  impede  the  growth  of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (NMTP) and keep them small in size, and the interpenetrating graphene sheets  can  also  prevent  theses  NMTP  particles  from  severe  aggregations.  
The  reduced sodium-diffusion-lengths  and  conductive  carbon-skeleton  should  significantly  enhance ion/electron  exchange,  enabling  facile  sodium  storage  kinetics  of  the  rGO@NMTP-C Rietveld  refinement  of  the  XRD  pattern  of  rGO@NMTP-C  (Fig.  1b)  indicates  the successful  formation  of  Na3MnTi(PO4)3,  which  adopts  a  rhombohedral  structure  with  space  group  R-3c  [25,26].  The  crystalline  schematic  (Fig.  1c)  illustrates  a  typical NASICON-structure  of  the  material,  where  the  octahedral  transition-metal  sites  are statistically  equally  occupied  by  Mn  and  Ti.  [Mn/TiO6]  octahedra  are  connected  with [PO4] tetrahedra by corner-sharing, forming [MnTi(PO4)3] “lantern” units, which further construct  a  3D  open-framework  with  large  interstitial  sites  for  sodium  migration.  The immobile  Na1  atoms  locate  in  interstitial  sites  with  sixfold  coordination,  and  the reversible  Na2  atoms  reside  at  interstitial  sites  with  eightfold  coordination.



Morphology of the rGO@NMTP-C was primarily explored through scanning electron microscopy  (SEM).  Fig.  1e  demonstrates  that  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  particles  are  uniformly integrated  with  interpenetrating  rGO  sheets.  Transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM) was further employed to investigate the detailed interconnection between Na3MnTi(PO4)3 particles  and  rGO.  It  shows  that  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  particles  were  encapsulated  by  rGO sheets  (Fig.  1f),  and  the  average  particle  size  of  Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is  around  100-200  nm (Fig. 1g). The HRTEM shows that outside the Na3MnTi(PO4)3 particle, a thin amorphous carbon  layer,  which  is  derived  from  pyrolysis  of  citric  acid,  is  closely  coated  on  its surface, connecting  with rGO to offer  3D pathways  for fast electronic  conduction (Fig. 1h).  Structure  of  the  rGO@NMTP-C  further  confirmed  by  selected  area  electron diffraction  (SAED),  which  demonstrates  a  typical  NASICON  rhombohedral  structure alone the [010] direction (Fig. 1i). Although the surface of NMTP-C is also covered by a carbon layer, the NMTP-C suffers from more server particle aggregations (Fig. S3). 
That is  because  the  uniformly  dispersed  graphene  sheets  can  limit  growth  and  stack  of nanoparticles during high-temperature calcination, and also lead to an extended specific surface  area  for  better  contact  between  the  electrode  and  electrolyte  (Fig.  S4)  [30]. Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) shows high purity of the rGO@NMTP-C since no other elements were detected, and the atomic ratio of Na: Mn: Ti is 3.08:1.14:1 (Fig. 1j). 
The EDS-mapping images also reveal homogeneous distribution of the Na, Mn, Ti, P, O, and C elements throughout the region.   

Electrochemical  performances  of  the  as-synthesized  samples  were  investigated  by assembling  coin-cells  with  sodium  anodes.  The  former  literature  about  Na3MnTi(PO4)3 reported  by  Goodenough’s  group  sets  up  a  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  window  of 4.2–2.5 V (vs. Na/Na+), which corresponds to a two-sodium-reaction [25]. 
However, the initial Coulombic efficiency  (ICE) is extremely low (< 80%) and Coulombic efficiency (CE) in the later cycles still unable to approach 100% under this condition. We set up a charge-discharge  window  of  4.3–1.5  V  and  try  to  disclose  the  impact  of  operating regulation  on  it.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2a,  the  ICE  is  of  over  100%.  That  is  because  the relatively  high  open-circuit  potential  (2.4–2.8  V)  leads  to  a  two-electron  reaction  with low capacity during the charge process, but during the discharge process a three-electron
reaction  is realized so that the capacity is higher. In the second cycle, the CE is nearly 100%, and an impressive reversible specific capacity of 173 mAh g-1 at 0.1C (1C = 135 mA  g-1)  is  also  achieved,  which  should  significantly  elevate  energy  density  of  the material.  
To  compare  the  difference  of  CE  under  different  regulations,  cells  were  also operated within a voltage range of 4.3–2.5 V (Fig. 2b). The ICE is around 85% and the CE gradually increases to 96% after 10 cycles within 4.3–2.5 V.  While after 10 cycles, CE  of  the  4.3–1.5  V  sample  stabilizes  around  100%,  indicating  a  highly  reversible sodium  storage  process,  which  is  vitally  important  for  the  fabrication  of  full  cells. 
Charge/discharge  profiles  under  these  two  conditions  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  S5.  Cyclic voltammetry  (CV)  curves  (Fig. 2c)  demonstrate  three  redox  potentials  at  around 2.20/2.08  V,  3.67/3.45  V,  4.10/3.99  V,  indicating  a  three-steps-process  of  the  Na+ deintercalation/intercalation  basing  on  consecutive  redox  of  Ti3+/Ti4+,  Mn2+/Mn3+  and Mn3+/Mn4+.  Ex-situ  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  was  used  to  probe  the chemical state of transition metals (Fig. 2d). From 1.50 V to 2.75 V, binding energy of the 
Mn 2p3/2 peak unchangeably remains at 641.12 eV, indicating +2 state of the manganese [31].  While  binding  energy  of  the  Ti  2p3/2 peak  shifts  from  457.90  eV  to  459.04  eV,  indicating valence variation of Ti3+ to Ti4+.31 When further charging to 3.85 and 4.30 V, the position of Ti 2p3/2 peak stays the same. In the contrast, the Mn 2p3/2 peak increases to  641.65 eV at 3.85 V and 642.13 eV at 4.30 V respectively, corresponding to Mn3+ and 
Mn4+ respectively [25]. Notably, the bump located in 644.45 eV is satellite, which shows up  in  many  transition-metal  compounds  and  results  from  photoemission  [29.33]. 
Therefore,  the  consecutive  oxidation  and  reduction  of  Ti3+/Ti4+,  Mn2+/Mn3+,  and Mn3+/Mn4+  during  deintercalation/intercalation  of  three  Na+  was  realized  within  the voltage range of 4.3–1.5 V. Obviously, the activation of Ti3+/Ti4+ is key to the enhanced efficiency,  and  ex-situ  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  was  employed  to uncover  the  reason.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2e,  the  charge  transfer  resistances  of rGO@NMTP-C  do  not  change  a  lot  under  different  charge  states  due  to  the  well-constructed conductive carbon framework. While, for the Z’-w-0.5 plots, the sample of  1.5  V  demonstrates  the  smallest  slope  (the  calculation  details  can  be  seen  from  SI), indicating the fastest sodium diffusivity basing on Ti3+/Ti4+ redox, which is beneficial to mitigate overpotentials of the electrode and thus improve its reversibility. 
Rate capability of the rGO@NMTP-C under the voltage range of 4.3–1.5 V was also studied  (Fig.  3a).  It  can  deliver  remarkable  reversible  capacity  of  170.8,  161.2,  153.5, 148.9,  143.1,  134.3,  120.6  mAh  g-1  from  0.1  C  to  10  C,  respectively.  Even  at  the ultra-high rate of 20 C and 50 C, the rGO@NMTP-C is still able to exhibit a discharge capacity of 110.6 and 92.7 mAh g-1. When the current density switch to 0.2 C from 50 C, the  reversible  capacity  recovers  to  161.1mAg-1,  demonstrating  extraordinary  flexibility and reversibility for sodium storage. Compared to rGO@NMTP-C, the NMTP-C shows a much  lower  specific  capacity  under  various  current  density  and  only  75.5  mAh  g-1  is obtained  at  5  C  (Fig.  S6).  Cycling  stability  of  the  samples  was  also  investigated.  


As demonstrated in Fig. S7, the dQ/dV plots of different cycles illustrate negligible changes under different rates and cycles, indicating excellent stability of the electrode, which does exhibit superior capacity retention of 90.57% after 300  cycles  at 1 C and 94.12% after 400  cycles  at  2  C.  Even  after  500  cycles  at  5  C  and  1000  cycles  at  10  C,  93.03%  and 91.42%  of  reversible  capacity  can  be  obtained  (Fig.  3b).  Additionally,  the  CE  of  the sample under different test conditions stabilizes at around 100%, further confirming the high reversibility of the materials. In the contrast, the NMTP-C only maintains 71.5 % of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C (Fig. S8). This is because the NMTP-C has a much  larger  surface  and  charge  transfer  resistances  than  that  of  rGO@NMTP-C,  as shown  in  Fig.  S9.  For  rGO@NMTP-C,  apart  from  the  high  CE  that  enhanced  by regulating charge/discharge cut-off voltage, the excellent sodium storage chemistry of the rGO@NMTP-C should also be ascribed to its elaborately designed structure. Firstly, the smaller  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  particle  size  promotes  facile  sodium  migration  due  to  reduced sodium-diffusion  length.  In  addition,  the  3D  highly  conductive  carbon  skeleton  greatly improves  electronic  conductivity  of  the  material.  Also,  the  rGO  and  amorphous  carbon can mitigate stress released by sodium extraction/insertion, and thus prohibiting structural degradation [28,34]. The long-lifespan of rGO@NMTP-C is also exhibited, with 74.5% of capacity retention after 3500 cycles at 20 C (Fig. 3c). The insets and Fig. S10 uncover that microstructure and crystal phase of the material is well maintained even after long cycling under large current density, which is key to excellent performance. 
To  present  the  superiority  of  the  rGO@NMTP-C  material,  we  compared  a  vast majority of major sodium-ion battery cathode materials that recently reported in respects of  energy  density  and  power  density  [14,20,34-39].  All  data  were  collected  from  the reported data, which were based on cathode electrode materials rather than full cells. Fig. 3d  shows  that,  although  the  rGO@NMTP-C  has  a  relatively  low  average  potential,  it possesses  a  very  high  energy  density  over  500  Wh  kg-1,  which  even  outperforms  the well-documented Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F. In the Ragone plots (Fig. 3e), the rGO@NMTP-C also presents extraordinary power performance, which is better than the majority  of  other  cathodes.  So,  by  virtue  of  lower  cost  and  more  environmental friendliness,  the  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  with  such  excellent  energy/power  density  should  be  a very competitively cathode for large scale energy storage.


To  get  some  insight  into  the  impact  of  multielectron  reaction  on  electrochemical performance, ex-situ X-ray diffraction patterns for the electrode within a voltage range of 4.3-1.5  V  were  collected  to  elucidate  structural  evolution  of  the  rGO@NMTP-C  (Fig. S12).




Specific study can be seen in Fig. 4a, where peaks of the pristine electrode (2.80 V) can be indexed to rhombohedral structure with the space group R-3c. During charging to 3.85 V, apart from right shift of the peaks, the diffraction peaks of (211) disappears at 3.6V, and then show up again in 3.85 V, which indicates that the plateau at 3.6 V corresponds to a biphase reaction from Na3MnTi(PO4)3 to Na2MnTi(PO4)3. When further charging to 4.30  V,  new  diffraction  peaks  appear  in  (104)  and  (300),  which  signifies  another two-phase  reaction  from  Na2MnTi(PO4)3 to  NaMnTi(PO4)3  [25,26].  During the discharging process, all peaks firstly recover to their initial positions at 2.50 V, and then the  (113),  (204),  (211),  (300)  peaks  shift  to  lower  angles  at  1.50  V  obviously  before finally  turning  back  to  primitive  patterns  when  charging  again  to  2.50  V.  No  peaks disappear or new peaks show up within the voltage range of 2.5-1.5 V, which means the platform at around 2.1 V that based on redox of Ti3+/Ti4+ is a single-phase reaction. 




The indicates  a  reversible  Na-ions  extraction/insertion  process,  which accompanies with the variation of lattice parameters (Fig. 4b). With Na+ insertion, lattice parameter a gradually increases, while lattice parameter c decreases. The decrease of c/a ratio  corresponds  to  the  progressive  filling  of  Na2  site  and  full  occupation  of  Na1  site [40]. The volume change of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 with three-electron-exchange is 8.13%, even smaller  that  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  (~8.3%)  with  two-electron-exchange  [41].  Such  small volume variation is key to long-lifespan of the cathode. 
Additionally,  sodium-ions  diffusion  characters  were  studied  by  the  galvanostatic intermittent  titration  technique  (GITT),  as  demonstrated  in  Fig.  4c.  Apparent  Na+ diffusion  coefficients  (DNa+)  of  the  cathode  were  calculated  among  10-9~10-12  cm2  S-1 within the voltage range of 4.3-1.5 V (the detailed calculation information can be found in Fig. S13, which is larger than most of the other cathode materials reported and vital to the outstanding high rate capability of the rGO@NMTP-C material. Note that, the DNa+ in  the  region  of  Ti3+/Ti4+  redox  is  stabilized  at  around  10-9~10-10  cm2  S-1.  While  for  the region  of  Mn2+/Mn4+  redox,  the  DNa+  fluctuates  within  10-10~10-12 cm2  S-1,  indication more sluggish kinetics in this region. This is in accordance with the results of ex-situ EIS. 



Besides, to further verify it, the overpotentials during the whole sodium de-/intercalation process were also calculated. Overpotential equals to the voltage gap between the cutoff voltage  after  the  titration  step  and  the  stabilized  voltage  after  relaxation.  
The overpotentials  basing  on  Ti3+/Ti4+  redox  are  smaller  than  that  of  Mn2+/Mn4+  redox. 
Therefore, the facile kinetics derived from the activation of Ti3+/Ti4+ redox is account for the enhanced electrochemical performance. 
Sodium-ion  diffusion  paths  were  also  calculated  by  the  density  functional  theories (DFT),  and  the  calculation  method  can  be  seen  in.  It  shows  that  sodium-ions  are  more likely  to  follow  the  Na1-Na2-Na1  diffusion  path,  where  the  Na1  firstly  pass  throng  a cavity in the [MnTi(PO4)3] “lantern” units to Na2, and then reach to adjacent Na1 (Fig. 4d). The energy barrier is only 1.02 eV (Fig. 4e). While for the Na1-Na1 path, where Na1 directly migrates to Na1 passing through the voids between Na2 and [PO4] tetrahedron, the  energy  barrier  greatly  increases  to  28.41  eV.  Note  that,  Na2  also  less  possibly  to migrate  to  the  neighboring  Na2  directly,  since  the  energy  barrier  is  4.52  eV,  which  is much higher than the Na2-Na1-Na2 path, where the energy barrier is only 0.98 eV (Fig. 4f  and  4g).  
Therefore,  sodium-ions  diffusion  prefers  to  follow  Na1-Na2-Na1  and Na2-Na1-Na2  patterns,  and  the  low  diffusion  energy  barrier  is  key  for  fast  sodium The  pseudocapacitance  contribution  was  also  calculated  basing  on  the  CV  data collected  at  different  scan  rates  from  0.1  to  0.5  mV  s-1.  Typically,  the  charge  stored  in electrode  materials  derives  from  the  Faradic  contribution  of  diffusion-controlled  alkali metal  ion  intercalation,  redox  reactions  of  pseudocapacitance,  and  the  non-Faradic process arising from the double layer effect [42,43]. For pseudocapacitance, it occurs on the  surface  or  near-surface  of  a  material.  Since  the  rGO@NMTP-C  possesses  an optimized  surface  by  carbon-coating  and  graphene  enwrapping,  the  contribution  of pseudocapacitance cannot be neglected. The CV plots demonstrate 6 peaks (peak 1 and 4, 2  and  5,  3  and  6),  corresponding  to  oxidation/reduction  of  T3+/Ti4+,  Mn2+/Mn3+,  and Mn3+/Mn4+,  respectively  (Fig.  5a).  The  reaction  can  be  further  described  using  the following equations [44]: Where  a,  b are adjustable parameters,  ν represents scan rate,  k1ν and  k2ν1/2 represent the  capacitive  and  diffusion-dominated  currents, respectively.  For  a typical diffusion-controlled  reaction,  b  value  is  0.5.  While  for  a  typical  capacitance-dominated process, b value is 1. The b value for each CV peak was calculated as shown in Fig. 5b. 


All  peaks  have  b  values  larger  than  0.5,  indicating  the  existence  of  pseudocapacitive effect  on  rGO@NMTP-C.  The  overall  contribution  of  pseudocapacitance  for rGO@NMTP-C  is  calculated  to  be  76.6%  at  a  scan  rate  of  0.5  mV  s-1  (Fig.  5c),  much larger than that of NMTP-C (Fig. 5e). This confirms that the reduced particle size and the optimized  surface  can  enhance  pseudocapacitance,  which  is  beneficial  for  high  rate capability of the material. 


Finally, to demonstrate the great competitiveness of this cathode material for practical applications, full cells using hard carbon anodes were further assembled, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Charge/discharge  cut-off  voltage  range  was  changed  to  4.2–1.3  V.  A  working voltage of 3.805 V was detected after the rGO@NMTP-C//hard carbon full cell (noted as rGO@NMTP-C//HC) was fully charged, and a while LED-bulb string can be lighted due to this high voltage (Fig. 6b). Electrochemical performance of the hard carbon anode can be seen in Fig. S15. In Fig. 6c, the rGO@NMTP-C//HC exhibits a reversible capacity of 151 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C. Rate capability of this battery system was also tested. It shows that the rGO@NMTP-C//HC can deliver a discharge capacity of 150.8, 135.3, 112.7, 86.2 and 61.9 mAh g-1 at the C-rate of 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 C. When the current density turns back from  10  C  to  0.5  C,  the  specific  capacity  recovers  to  142.9  mAh  g-1,  which  is  slightly smaller than its primitive discharge capacity. The corresponding charge/discharge profiles were  plotted  as  shown  in  the  inset  (Fig.  6d).  Cycling  stability  of  this  battery  is demonstrated  in  Fig.  6e.  After  100  cycles  at  2  C,  there  is  still  80.9  %  of  its  initial discharge capacity. The decrease of specific capacity can be ascribed to the fluctuation of Coulombic  efficiency  and  the  loss  of  reversible  sodium-ions  in  the  anode.  Comparison between  rGO@NMTP-C//HC  full  cells  with  various  types  of  full  cells  in  terms  of electrochemical  performance  was  listed  in  Table  S2.  We  believe  better  performance should be achieved by  further optimizing the anode materials  and  other  components of the battery systems.   


In summary, through structural optimization and regulating charge/discharge windows at  4.3–1.5  V,  the  interpenetrating  graphene  encapsulated  Na3MnTi(PO4)3  with  in-situ carbon  coating  material  presents  enhanced  Coulombic  efficiency  and  overcomes  the drawback of inferior electron/ion diffusion dynamics. Consequently, the rGO@NMTP-C reaches  a  high  energy  density  of  over  500  Wh  kg-1  and  outstanding  power  density capability  that  better  than  a  vast  majority  of  other  cathodes.  The  fast  ion  diffusion coefficient small volume change during sodiation/desodiation,  and  the  pseudocapacitance  effect  are  key  to  the  high  rate  and long-life  capability  of  the  material.  The  rGO@NMTP-C//HC  full  cell  also  exhibits  a reversible  capacity  of  151  mAh  g-1  at  0.5  C  and  80.9  %  of  capacity  retention  after 100 cycles at 2 C. With the overall merits of excellent sodium storage performance and low cost, the Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is promising for large-scale utilization of sodium-ion batteries.
