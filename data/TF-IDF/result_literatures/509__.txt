Vital need to reduce battery cost inspired intensive research in the field of sodium-storage systems, which required extending the range of perspective electrode materials. Herein, we present a new member of the electrochemically active NASICON material family, rhombohedral NaMo2(PO4)3, which demonstrates both Mo+4/Mo+5 and Mo+4/Mo+3 redox activities towards sodium (de)intercalation. Desodiation of the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 material with subsequent discharge within the 1.2–4.0 V range leads to a multi-electron redox transition with reversible capacity of 130 mAh g−1. However, the single Mo+4/Mo+3 redox transition at 2.45 V (vs. Na/Na+) with capacity of 95 mAh g−1 was found to be more stable during cycling, and operando X-ray diffraction confirmed its two-phase mechanism. Sodiation of the initial phase results in Na2.5Mo2(PO4)3, which maintains the parent NASICON structure (R-3c, a = 8.90532(7) Å, c = 22.2379(3) Å, V = 1527.30(3) Å3), with two Na-positions being almost equal in occupancy and energy.

The structure of NASICON type materials with the AxM2(PO4)3 general composition is comprised of MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra linked through all vertexes to form 3D-framework with A-cations which are placed in continuous channels and capable of fast ion migration [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. The structural stability attributed to the 3D-rigid framework as well as the inductive effect of the phosphate group make NASICON-structured phosphates perspective for exploration of new materials for Li and Na-ion batteries [6].

Indeed, Li3V2(PO4)3 was recognized as the most promising cathode material among all NASICON-structured phosphates [7,8]. Two polymorphs of Li3V2(PO4)3 with rhombohedral (r-LVP) and thermodynamically stable monoclinic (m-LVP) are known [9,10]. They differ by conjugation of the [V2(PO4)3] «lantern» units which leads to variation in electrochemical behavior. While r-LVP demonstrates a reversible extraction of 2Li per f.u. utilizing the V+3/V+4 active redox couple, m-LVP undergoes a step-by-step deintercalation of all 3Li atoms providing a multi-electron V+3/V+4.5 transition [[10], [11], [12]]. NASICON-type LixM2(PO4)3 phases for other transition metals (M = Ti, Cr and Fe) also show electrochemical activity vs. Li [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 operate at low voltages (2.5 V in the case of r-LiTi2(PO4)3 and 2.7–2.85 V for both r- and m-modifications of Li3Fe2(PO4)3). The Cr-based phase demonstrates activity at extremely high potentials ∼4.78 V, though with poor reversibility and cyclability.

The NASICON-framework is also advantageous towards sodium (de)intercalation making Na3V2(PO4)3 an attractive cathode for NIBs [25]. It crystallizes in the rhombohedral syngony with sodium distributed between the unequivalent and partially occupied Na(1)- and Na(2) positions [26]. Only the latter one is involved in reversible desodiation of 2Na per f.u., taking place at 3.4 V [[27], [28], [29]]. Electrochemical activity towards reversible Na-(de)intercalation was also reported for NaTi2(PO4)3 [13,30,31]. While the first one cycles 2Na at potential of 2.2 V, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 reversibly deintercalates only 1Na per f.u. at 2.5 V. The capacity and cyclability of Ti and V-based NASICON materials could be considerably improved by carbon coating, doping and morphology modification [[32], [33], [34], [35], [36]]. The electrochemical activity of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 at the extremely high potential of 4.5 V was recently communicated by Kawai et al. [37]. Among the phosphates of 4d-elements only NaZr2(PO4)3 was found to be active as an anode material in a Na-cell [38].

The high-throughput ab-initio analysis of phosphates performed by Hautier et al. revealed that molybdenum phosphates might be attractive cathode materials for metal-ion batteries due to appropriate potentials and possible multi-electron transformations [39]. Despite rich crystal chemistry of molybdenum phosphates, only few compounds have been investigated as electrode materials for metal-ion batteries. Thus, a layered molybdenum oxypyrophosphate δ-(MoO2)2P2O7 was found to be active towards lithium [[40], [41], [42]] and sodium [43] intercalation, while for Li3Mo4P5O24 reversible Li-insertion (the Mo+5/Mo+4 couple) and Li-extraction (the Mo+5/Mo+6 transition) were observed [44].

NASICON-type LiyMo2(PO4)3 [45] and NaMo2(PO4)3 [46] have been already reported, but no electrochemical data for these phases are available to nowadays. Furthermore in spite of rather high stability of the Mo+3 phosphates (e.g. AMoP2O7), the Mo-analogue of Na3V2(PO4)3 is still unknown. The recent progress in Na-ion batteries encouraged search for new polyanion materials for sodium storage [47,48] and the NASICON-type NaMo2(PO4)3 appeared to be attractive towards reversible sodium intercalation. In this work, we report the synthesis of the NaMo2(PO4)3 material via a freeze-drying technique and investigation of its electrochemical activity and structural transformations upon cycling in Na-cell.

A two-step synthesis route was used to obtain pure NaMo2(PO4)3 samples. Initial reagents (Na2C2O4 (Reachim, >98%), NH4H2PO4 (Labteh, >98%) and (NH4)6Mo7O24 × 4H2O (Sigma, >98%)) were homogenized using ball-milling or freeze drying technique. In the first case stoichiometric amounts of chemicals were mixed in the planetary ball-milling machine (Fritsch Pulverisette 7, WC bowl, 180–200 rpm) for 2–3 h in acetone media. For the freeze-drying method, initial reagents were dissolved in deionized water with an A:Mo:P molar ratio of 1.05:2.0:3.0 and molybdenum concentration of 0.05 M (pH 3.5 of the solution was maintained by an acetic acid). The solution formed was pulverized into liquid nitrogen and sublimated within 48 h in a «Labconco» freeze-drying machine to obtain a cryogranulated powder. The mixtures of reagents (from ball-milling or freeze-drying) were preheated under Ar-flow (380 °C, 15 h) and to liberate gaseous products and initiate Mo+6 reduction. The dark-grey products obtained after preheating were ball-milled, pressed into pellets and subjected to final annealing in Ar flow or sealed quartz tubes. No reflections of the NASICON-type phase were detected in the XRPD patterns for the samples treated in Ar flow, while annealing in sealed quartz tubes resulted in appearance of the NaMo2(PO4)3 phase. Though for the samples prepared through ceramic route the NASICON-type phase was a dominant product some impurities of MoO2 and NaMoP2O7 were also present indicating insufficient homogenization. Only the cryogranulated precursor allowed us to avoid these admixtures. The optimization of annealing temperature indicated the appearance of the NASICON phase above 650 °C, and the treatment at 700 °C was found to be the most suitable for obtaining the pure phase samples. Finally, the NaMo2(PO4)3 material was prepared from the cryogranulated precursor by annealing in sealed quartz tubes at 700 °C for 10 h.

The phase composition of the samples and the electrodes (ex situ) was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) with G670 Huber Guinier cameras (Image Plate detector, Cu Kα1 (λ = 1.54051 Å, curved Ge (111) monochromator) or Co Kα1 (λ = 1.78892 Å, curved quartz (101) monochromator), 10–100° 2θ angular range at a scanning rate of 0.03° s−1). In case of the ex situ experiments the tested electrodes were thoroughly washed by propylene carbonate, after which, the electrode materials were removed by a scotch tape from Al foil and transferred on a sample holder. Operando XRPD studies were performed in a BRUKER D8 Advanced diffractometer (reflection mode, LYNXEYE XE detector, Kα1 = 1.54051 Å, Kα2 = 1.54433 Å, 19–38° 2θ angular range at a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1) using an electrochemical cell with a beryllium window at the cathode side. The data were collected every 15 min under galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation (GCPL) experiment at 0.1C rate and in the potential range 1.0–4.5 V vs. Na/Na+. The X-ray powder diffraction data for the structural refinement were collected by STOE STADI P diffractometer (transmission mode with a linear PSD detector, CoKα1 radiation λ = 1.78896 Å, curved Ge(111) monochromator, 12.9–100° 2θ angular range, scanning rate of 0.01° s−1). The pattern fitting and the refinement of the lattice parameters were performed by the WinXpow program. The crystal structure refinement was carried out with JANA2006 software [49]. The background profile and peak shape were fitted by polynomial and pseudo-Voight functions correspondingly, isotropic ADPs for the oxygen atoms were constrained to be equal. The crystal structures were drawn using the VESTA visualization system [50]. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) was applied to determine the materials morphology and elements ratio by means of an electron microscope Carl Zeiss Nvision 40-38-50 with an Inca EDX spectrometer. To perform EDX for the electrodes after cycling they were thoroughly washed by propylene carbonate (PC).

In recent applications, the bond-valence (BV) based methods are commonly used for calculating ion migration pathways and providing a tentative estimation of the activation energy for ionic conduction. The fundamentals and theory are comprehensively described by Brown [51]. Empirically, the BV for a particular pair of atoms with the interatomic distance R can be calculated by the following equation:

where R0 and b are tabulated bond valence constants that are empirically elucidated by analysing thousands of known crystal structure taking into account that the sum of all bond valences (BVS) for a specific ion with its counter ions should be equal to its formal oxidation state. Thus, the accessible sites in the structure can be assessed by considering the mismatch between the BVS and formal oxidation state (BVSM): the smaller the BVSM, the more favorable is this position for the ion. If positions with low BVSM in the structure turn out to percolate, i.e. form a continuous path, the ionic transport can be considered plausible. Further, the BVSM values can be directly linked to the energy values [52]. The so-called bond valence energy landscapes (BVEL) algorithm implemented in the 3DBVSMAPPER program [53], translates the BVSM values into energies using a Morse-type potential, which is complemented by terms for asymmetric coordination and repulsion between mobile and immobile cations to improve the accuracy of the migration pathway predictions:

where Easym designates an energy penalty due to the asymmetry of the coordination of the considered ion and Erep represents the Coulomb repulsion. The coefficients D0 and g as well as a suitable Easym expression can be derived from the Morse-type interaction potential.

By analyzing the spatial distribution of E(A) and adjusting the activation energy parameter Eact [the difference between the cut-off value of E(A) and minimum E(A), Emin] the most energetically favorable space for Na in the structure can be identified and visualized. The spatial resolution for BVEL calculations was set to 0.2 Å. The BVEL data were subsequently manipulated within the VESTA program [50], which allows illustrating migration paths as isosurfaces of definite Eact values.

Electrochemical measurements were realized in two-electrode cells with the metal sodium as a counter and a reference electrode. To make a working electrode, the NaMo2(PO4)3 material was ball-milled with the conductive carbon black (Timcal Super-C) and then mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride in 6:1:1 mass ratio. N-methyl pyrrolidone was added to the powder to form slurry, which was cast on Al foil using the «doctor blade» technique. The electrodes were dried at 75 °C for 3 h in air, rolled, round-cut and dried again at 120 °C for 3 h under dynamic vacuum. Electrochemical cells were assembled in MBraun glove box under an argon atmosphere. The 0.6M NaPF6 solution in PC:FEC (0.95:0.05 vol) was used as an electrolyte. Galvanostatic measurements were carried out on Elins P20X8 potentiostat-galvanostat (ES8 software) within the potential range of 1.2–4.0 V vs. Na/Na+.

Synthesis of the NaMo2(PO4)3 pure samples occurred to be more complicated comparing to the similar NaM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Zr and Sn) phases. The tendency of molybdenum to form a MoO6 octahedral coordination for the wide range of oxidation states from Mo+5 to Mo+3 supports easy redox transformations between them. The stability of Mo+3 state (t2g3 configuration) promotes the reduction of Mo+6 to Mo+3 state with an appearance of NaMoP2O7 and MoP phases, therefore special efforts are needed to stabilize Mo+4. On the other hand, a readily formed and stable MoO2 with the rutile structure also hinders formation of Mo+4-based phosphates. The effect of oxygen partial pressure on preparation of molybdenum pyrophosphates and phosphates was described in detail in our recent paper [54]. Therefore, the proper choice of homogenization method, annealing temperature and time, and oxygen partial pressure allowed to synthesize successfully the NaMo2(PO4)3 phase.

The XRPD pattern of NaMo2(PO4) was indexed in the hexagonal R-centered cell with the parameters (a = 8.61946(3) Å, c = 22.13495(8) Å, V = 1424.195(8) Å3, S.G. Rc, Z = 6) matching well with the previously reported ones [46]. A careful inspection of the diffraction pattern revealed the weak reflections of WC (<1 wt %) arising from the milling procedure. EDX data validated the Na:Mo ratio to be 1.0:2.0 thus confirming the sodium stoichiometry of the initial phase. As evidenced by SEM images (Fig. A1), the sample consists of well-crystallized particles of 5–10 μm in size.

Rietveld refinement with the structure parameters from Ref. [46] taken as a starting model produced reasonable R-factors (RI = 0.0230, Rp = 0.0335, Rwp = 0.0475) and an acceptable fit of the experimental data (Fig. 1). The details of the structure refinement, atomic coordinates and isotropic ADPs, interatomic distances and angles, are given in Appendix A (Tables A1–A4). The NaMo2(PO4)3 phase adopts a NASICON-like rhombohedral structure built up as a 3D-framework of corner-linked MoO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra with Na+ ions fully occupying the Na(1)-site in a trigonal antiprismatic coordination. The difference Fourier simulation did not reveal any residual electron density near the Na(2) atomic position. BVS calculation exhibited no significant discrepancies between the formal and calculated values. The BVS value of 4.27 for Mo is in a good agreement with the previously reported data [46]. We should notice this extra bonding of M-cations to be a typical feature for all NASICON-type NaM2(PO4)3 phases. BVS calculations based on the published structure data provide the following values: 4.19 for M = Ti [55], 4.24 for M = Zr [56] and 4.28 for M = V [27].

For NaMo2(PO4)3 with fully occupied Na(1) and empty Na(2)-sites electrochemical activity towards both sodium deintercalation and intercalation could be considered. Consequently the electrochemical behavior of NaMo2(PO4)3 vs. Na-anode was investigated in two ways: (a) the initial Mo+4 oxidation (Na extraction) and the subsequent reduction (Na insertion) and (b) the initial Mo+4 reduction (i.e. sodiation) and the subsequent oxidation.

The results of the first charge to 4.0 V followed by discharge to 1.3 V are shown in Fig. 2a. The capacity of ∼25 mAh g−1 upon the first charge corresponds to extraction of about 0.5Na from the structure of NaMo2(PO4)3. The first discharge curve exhibited a very different shape and indicates several processes: at ∼3.6 and ∼3.2 V with the total capacity of about 20 mAh g−1 and below 3 V (a large plateau followed by a sloping region) with the capacity of 90 mAh g−1. The electrochemical activity within the 3.0–4.0 V range with the capacity values corresponding to (de)intercalation of about was reversible and seemed to be related to the Mo+4/Mo+5 redox couple, while below 3 V insertion of additional sodium took place implying the Mo+4/Mo+3 redox transition. Upon further cycling, the discharge capacity related to both redox couples faded: after 10 cycles at C/20 rate it dropped from the initial value of 130 mAh g−1 to 90 mAh g−1 (Fig. 2a).

The sodiation of the initial electrode proceeded via a continuous two-phase plateau at ∼2.45 V followed by a sloping region between 2.45 and 1.3 V vs. sodium (Fig. 2b). The observed capacity value of 95 mAh g−1 corresponded to the insertion of about 1.8Na per formula unit. It should be noted that NaMo2(PO4)3 demonstrated good reversibility and cycling stability when operates in the 1.3–3.6 potential range. The comparison of the electrochemical data reveals that charging to potentials above 3.6 V activates not only the Mo+4/Mo+5 redox transition, but also initiates the interaction with the electrolyte followed by the material degradation.

The similarity in the electrochemical behavior of Na3V2(PO4)3-NaV2(PO4)3 and Na1+xMo2(PO4)3-NaMo2(PO4)3 systems should be pointed out. In both cases the M+4/M+3 redox transition provides stable electrochemical cycling which occurs in two-phase mechanism. Both NaM2(PO4)3 phosphates demonstrate low stability to deep desodiation. However, large Mo+4 and Mo+5 cations provide higher stability of the Na1-xMo2(PO4)3 framework, enabling reversible extraction of sodium cations, at least for several charge-discharge cycles in contrast to Na1-xV2(PO4)3, which becomes unstable for x > 0. Another difference is related to insertion of additional Na+ in the NASICON-framework up to the Na4V2(PO4)3 and Na5V2(PO4)3 compositions [57]. For NaMo2(PO4)3 the maximal discharge capacity did not exceed 1.8 Na per f.u. upon cycling down to 0.5 V vs. Na/Na+.

The crystal structures of the desodiated Na1-xMo2(PO4)3 and sodiated Na1+xMo2(PO4)3 materials were investigated by XRPD. The ex-situ study was performed for the initial, charged (to 4.0 V), discharged (to 1.3 V) and cycled (10 cycles, 3.6 V) NaMo2(PO4)3 electrodes. The XRPD pattern of the initial electrode (Fig. A2) found to be the same as for the pristine NaMo2(PO4)3 phase except the increased intensity of the WC peaks appeared from the milling procedure upon electrode fabrication. A small shift of the reflections to high angles was observed for the charged electrode indicating the decrease of the cell parameters (a = 8.616 Å, c = 22.11 Å and V = 1421 Å3). The XRD pattern of the electrode discharged to 1.3 V was unambiguously indexed in the R-centered cell with the parameters (a = 8.905 Å, c = 22.23 Å and V = 1527 Å3) which exceed the volume of the initial phase by 100 Å3. In both cases neither widening nor splitting of the reflections were detected thus confirming the absence of any distortion of the unit cell. The XRD pattern of the cycled electrode was very similar to that of the initial one (Fig. A2). The Na-content of these electrodes was tested by EDX analysis (Table 1). The Na:Mo ratio was found to decrease upon charging, for the discharged electrode this ratio increased by about three times and it returned to the almost stoichiometric for the cycled electrode (some excess in the sodium content arises probably due to formation of Na-containing SEI).

The obtained XRPD data were used for the Na1±xMo2(PO4)3 structure refinement. Structure refinement of the desodiated phase resulted in acceptable fit of the experimental data with RI = 0.0336, Rp = 0.0099, Rwp = 0.0138 (Fig. A3). It revealed a decrease in the Na(1) occupancy to 0.852(6) and empty the Na(2)-site, providing the Na0.85Mo2(PO4)3 composition. It should be noted that Uiso of Na(1) was fixed at 0.035 Å2, similar to that in the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 phase. The details on the structure refinement of this material, atomic coordinates and interatomic distances and angles are given in Appendix (Tables A5–A8). Some discrepancy in sodium content determined from X-ray data and the electrochemical measurements might be attributed to parasite electrochemical processes which are typical for the compounds which transform to unstable modifications upon (de)intercalation of alkali metal cations [58]. Nevertheless, all these data unambiguously proved the partial Na-deintercalation from the NaMo2(PO4)3 phase.

In case of the sodiated phase both Na(1) and Na(2) positions appeared to be partly occupied. Their Uiso were fixed to 0.035 Å2, and the occupancies refined to be 0.613(7) and 0.637(4) respectively providing the total sodium content of 2.52(1). Finally, the reasonable R-factors (RI = 0.0292, Rp = 0.0185, Rwp = 0.0247) and an acceptable fit of the experimental data (Fig. A4) were achieved. Atomic coordinates and isotropic ADPs, interatomic distances and angles, the details on the structure refinement are given in Appendix (Tables A9–A12).

Thus, the sodium intercalation in the NaMo2(PO4)3 structure results in the appearance of sodium in the eightfold coordinated Na(2)-position (Fig. 3). Moreover, this process implies not only the insertion of sodium into the Na(2)-site but the redistribution of Na+ cations between the Na(1)- and Na(2)-positions with their occupancies becoming almost equal. The same behavior was reported for the Na3V2(PO4)3/NaV2(PO4)3 system [27]. It is interesting to notice that in case of molybdenum we did not reach the Na3Mo2(PO4)3 composition even upon discharging to low potentials, and it might be explained by the NASICON framework geometry. The lower oxidation state of the transition metal M the longer M−O bond thus leading to the enlargement of MO6 octahedron, the expansion of unit cell and, consequently, to increased Na(1)–O interatomic distances. Indeed, the BVS for Na(1) decreased from 1.00 (in NaMo2(PO4)3) to 0.79 (in Na2.5Mo2(PO4)3) confirming the underbonding of sodium atoms and the destabilization of the Na(1) site. The similar feature is observed for Na3V2(PO4)3 with BVS of Na(1) atoms of 0.90, and V−O interatomic distances in the 1.97–2.03 Å range [26]. For Na2.5Mo2(PO4)3 the Mo−O bonds increased to the 2.02–2.10 Å range, and it results in the further expansion of the framework and critical underbonding of sodium atoms preventing thereby further sodium insertion.

The electrochemical data and the structure refinement for the sodiated Na1+xMo2(PO4)3 electrode material show some discrepancy in the value of the inserted sodium, x: 1.8 vs.1.5. It should be noticed that apparently the second value is to be underestimated because Uiso for the Na(1) and Na(2)-sites was fixed at 0.035 Å2, which was obtained from the structure refinement of the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 phase. The increase of this Uiso value to 0.050 Å2 results in the x value of 1.59(1) thus providing a possible x value interval, however the x = 1.8 has not been reached at any reasonable value of Uiso for the Na(1) and Na(2)-sites. It might be assumed that the Na1+xMo2(PO4)3 phase exhibits a significant sodium disorder with some part of Na cations located in interstitial positions with low occupancies, these sodium atoms are hardly detectable by XRPD thus lowering the x value achieved by the Rietveld refinement.

The electrochemical study of NaMo2(PO4)3 revealed the two-phase sodium intercalation mechanism. The operando X-ray powder diffraction study was undertaken to provide a direct illustration of the mechanism and to emphasize the similarity between the Na1+xMo2(PO4)3/NaMo2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3/NaV2(PO4)3 systems. The X-ray diffraction data in operando regime were collected at the current density of 10 mA g−1 within the following voltage profile: the open circuit potential → discharge to 1.0 V → charge to 3.0 V. The 19–38° (2θ Cu Kα) angle range with the most informative peaks of the NASICON phase was chosen to visualize transformations taking place upon cycling. During the discharge the appearance of reflections of the Na1+xMo2(PO4)3 phase was detected (Fig. 4a): the intensities of the new phase were gradually grown up while the peaks of the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 phase were faded out without any pronounced shift of the peak positions indicating a typical first order phase transition. One can see the detailed proof by analyzing the changes in positions and intensities of the (113) and (024) reflections which do not overlap with WC peaks or with the neighboring reflections of the second NASICON phase. The whole recovery of the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 peaks was observed upon charging to 3.0 V thus proving the reversible phase transformation. The unit cell parameters of the initial and Na-rich phases were found to stay invariable on cycling and match well with the ex situ XRD data (Table A13). These results unambiguously confirm the two-phase mechanism of the sodium intercalation in NaMo2(PO4)3.

The two-phase Na1+xMo2(PO4)3-NaMo2(PO4)3 transition implies the rearrangement of Na+ cations between the Na(1) and Na(2) positions in the structure. The BVEL analysis was applied to estimate the energies of sodium positions during (de)intercalation process and to visualize the ion migration pathways. For both initial NaMo2(PO4)3 and discharged Na2.5Mo2(PO4)3 structures a percolating three-dimensional system of pathways suitable for Na migration (Fig. 5) and typical for the rhombohedral NASICON-type conductors was revealed.

Notably, the monoclinic NASICON phases exhibit a one- or rarely two-dimensional migration maps according to the BVEL approach [59]. As compared to broadly studied V-containing NaV2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 counterparts, the BVEL diffusion barriers for Mo-containing NASICON compounds are found to be lower by ∼0.4 eV (Table 2). This decrease can be unambiguously explained by the cell expansion due to a larger radius of Mo than V cations in corresponding oxidation states (0.65 Å vs. 0.58 Å for +4 and 0.69 Å vs. 0.64 Å for +3 respectively) resulted in subsequent increasing of the migration channels diameters, thus facilitating ion migration. The Na(1) site appears to be more energetically favorable for all four NASICON structures. In other words, Na ions in the Na(1) position are to be stronger bonded than those in the Na(2) one, which corroborates well with the DFT studies on the analogous Na3V2(PO4)3 [60]. Interestingly, as soon as the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 structure takes up additional Na, both Na(1) and Na(2) sites almost equalize in energy (Table 2). The energy difference between Na(2) and Na(1) positions reduces from 0.40 eV for NaMo2(PO4)3 to 0.06 eV for the intercalated Na2.5Mo2(PO4)3, which could be the origin for the cations redistribution between Na sites meaning some part of the sodium ions moves from the Na(1) to Na(2) site to even up their occupancies. Such redistribution though to a smaller extent is also characteristic to the Na3V2(PO4)3/NaV2(PO4)3 system [27], being in a good accordance with the current BVEL data. Moreover, upon sodium insertion the overall Eact decreases by 0.5 eV (Table 2) implying faster Na+ migration in the intercalated form.

It is should be pointed out that sodium atoms in the Na(1)-site, which is more energetically favorable, act as an «anchor» for the stability of the «M2(PO4)3» framework [13]. It explains the predominant extraction of sodium from the Na(2)-positions in Na1+xM2(PO4)3 materials, as well as a hampered Na-deintercalation for NaM2(PO4)3 phases, where all sodium atoms occupy the Na(1)-site. Nevertheless, comparing to the r-NaV2(PO4)3 phase which is unable to any sodium extraction, NaMo2(PO4)3 demonstrates some Na-deintercalation activity, thus confirming facilitated ion diffusion predicted by BVEL calculations.

A new member of the electrochemically active NASICON material family, NaMo2(PO4)3, exhibiting both Mo+4/Mo+5 and Mo+4/Mo+3 redox transitions was successfully synthesized via the freeze-drying homogenization method followed by annealing in sealed silica ampoules. Desodiation of the initial NaMo2(PO4)3 phase at potentials above 3.6 V (∼0.3–0.5 Na per f.u.) is partially reversible however degradation of the electrochemical capacity by ∼30% after 10 cycles within the 1.2–4.0 V potential range might reflect chemical instability of the desodiated Na1-xMo2(PO4)3 phase. Stable electrochemical cycling of about 1.8 Na per f.u. was observed at 2.45 V vs. Na/Na+, and the XRD data collected in operando regime confirmed the two-phase mechanism of reversible sodium intercalation taking place. Both NaMo2(PO4)3 and Na-rich Na1+xMo2(PO4)3 phases adopt the rhombohedral structure being different in sodium distribution between the trigonal antiprismatic Na(1) and eightfold Na(2) positions. In NaMo2(PO4)3 all sodium occupy the Na(1)-site only while in the Na-rich phase both positions are partly filled with almost equal occupancies. BVEL calculations explain this sodium redistribution by decrease of the │Na(1) – Na(2)│ site energy difference changing from 0.40 eV for the initial phase to 0.06 eV for the Na-rich one. This study opens up new prospects in discovering NASICON-type multi-electron cathode materials for Na-ion batteries.
