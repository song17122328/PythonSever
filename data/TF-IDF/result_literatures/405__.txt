Na3V2(PO4)3 with a 3D open NASICON framework can accommodate a wide range of Na contents, which makes it capable of working as both a cathode and anode material. However, severe capacity degradation and inferior rate capability resulting from low electronic/ionic conductivities and poor structural stability have hindered its practical implementation. Herein, excellent sodium storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 is realized by delicate lattice modulation. Aliovalent Ca2+ substitution for V3+ increases both the electronic and ionic conductivities by producing electronic defects and enlarging the sodium ion migration channels. DFT calculations reveal that the fifth Na ion intercalation/deintercalation produces a large lattice volume change, which is possibly the origin of the poor redox reaction reversibility of Na3V2(PO4)3 at low potential (∼0.3 V vs. Na+/Na). The Ca2+ doping enhances significantly the structural stability to suppress the large crystal lattice distortion during the anode reaction process. The multiple effects enable superior rate-capability and ultralong cycle-life of Ca-doped Na3V2(PO4)3 as both a cathode and anode material. The symmetric full cell constructed with the optimized Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode delivers a very high energy density of 166 W h kg−1 and an exceptional cycling stability (0.02% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10C rate). This study provides a feasible strategy for obtaining high-rate and long cycle-life electrode materials for high-efficiency energy storage.

Developing sustainable energy is critical in addressing the global challenge of environmental protection.1 The wide-scale implementation of clean and renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, calls for the growth of cost- and performance-effective energy storage systems (EESs).2,3 Lithium ion batteries (LIBs), as a state-of-the-art electrical energy storage technology, have gained huge commercial success in portable electronic devices and the electric vehicle market due to their high energy and power densities.4,5 However, limited lithium reserves and the sustained rising price of Li chemicals have restricted their further applications for large-scale energy storage. To address this issue, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have been drawing increasing attention in recent years due to the wide availability and low cost of Na resources. SIBs have been regarded as an ideal alternative to LIBs for grid-scale energy storage applications.6,7 In addition, SIBs share a potentially identical ‘rocking-chair’ electrochemical mechanism with LIBs, and sodium has similar physicochemical properties to lithium, which will accelerate the practical development of SIB technologies. However, due to the difference in electronic structure of Na and Li ions, the mature electrode materials for LIBs cannot be adopted directly for SIBs. Therefore, it is a significant challenge to explore advanced electrode compounds with fast and reversible Na+ intercalation/deintercalation features for high-performance SIBs.

Recently, a tremendous amount of attention has been paid to the open framework NASICON-type (Na super ionic conductor) compounds, in which numerous vacant interstitial sites are available for Na+ ion migration.8,9 Particularly, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been regarded as one of the most promising host materials for SIBs, owing to its high Na-ion conductivity, flat sodiation/desodiation potential plateau and excellent structural and thermal stability.10–12 More interestingly, NVP can work as both anode and cathode materials, due to the structural advantage of being capable of accommodating a very wide range of Na contents in the NVP lattice. When used as a cathode for SIBs, NVP exhibits a stable and flat sodiation/desodiation potential plateau of ∼3.4 V vs. Na+/Na, which is related to the V3+/4+ redox reaction accompanying the two sodium ion extraction/insertion between Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 phases, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 117.6 mA h g−1 and energy density of ∼400 W h kg−1.13,14 As an anode, two more sodium ions can insert into the Na3V2(PO4)3 lattice, generating voltage plateaus at ∼1.6 V and ∼0.3 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, based on the V3+/2+ redox reaction.15,16

However, the intrinsic low electronic conductivity of the phosphate framework severely hinders the electrochemical reaction kinetics of NVP electrodes, and therefore the rate performance and cycling behavior are limited. In addition, regarding the anode reaction process, intercalation of the fourth Na+ is highly reversible while further sodiation/desodiation easily causes fast capacity degradation, which imposes a severe restriction on the capacity utilization of the anode and the working voltage window of a symmetric cell with NVP as both the cathode and anode.17–20 To tackle these bottlenecks, effective strategies are urgently required to enhance both the electronic conductivity and the structural stability of NVP with the aim of achieving high sodium storage performance.

To improve the electron transport in the NVP electrode, two main approaches have been developed, targeted at the particle surface and bulk, respectively. Carbon coating is the most conventional method to promote electron transfer in the surface medium of the active material by providing a highly conductive network between electroactive particles.21,22 Lattice doping is another effective way to modify the electronic conductivity of the particle bulk by producing chemical defects.23–27 Such doping is usually adopted at V sites with aliovalent ions to produce a donor/acceptor doping effect, such as Co2+, Mg2+, Ti4+, and Mo6+ at the V3+-site. On the other hand, lattice substitution with large ions at the Na+-site can promote Na ion diffusion by enlarging the lattice space.28,29 Lattice modified NVP exhibits improved electrochemical performance owing to the accelerated electrode kinetics. With respect to the improvement of structure stability at low redox potential (∼0.3 V) for the intercalation of Na ions beyond the fourth, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no relevant research work reported so far. In this regard, there remains a pressing need to rationally design NVP chemistry to significantly improve its electrochemical performance and cycling stability.

In this work, we demonstrate a highly effective strategy of Ca2+ doping at V sites to remarkably boost the rate performance and to enhance the structural stability of Na3V2(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode materials. The delicate selection of the dopant Ca was based on the following three considerations. Firstly, the acceptor doping of Ca2+ for V3+ will produce mixed valence V3+/4+ as charge compensation, which can increase the electronic conductivity. Secondly, doping large size Ca2+ can enlarge the lattice space and therefore promote Na+ ion diffusion (Ca2+ and V3+ ions have an ionic radius of 1.0 Å and 0.64 Å, respectively, in 6-fold coordination). Thirdly, the strong Ca–O bond compared to the V–O bond can endow the Ca-doped NVP with high structural stability, which should be helpful in addressing the cycling issue at low potential. Meanwhile, the roles of Ca2+ doping are unveiled by DFT calculations in terms of electronic conductivity, sodium ion migration and structural stability. Owing to the abovementioned advantages, the Ca-doped NVP exhibits unprecedented electrochemical performance with outstanding rate capability and excellent cycling stability as both cathode and anode materials. Especially, the enhanced structure stability endows the Ca-doped NVP with highly reversible intercalation at low potential (∼0.3 V), which makes the symmetric NVP sodium ion full cell capable of delivering high voltages and large capacity, and therefore high energy density. The assembled symmetric NVP sodium ion full cell exhibits excellent rate performance (102.2 mA h g−1 at 50C), an ultra-long lifespan (0.02% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10C rate) and a high energy density of ∼166 W h kg−1, outperforming all of the previously reported electrochemical symmetric SIBs.

The XRD patterns of the synthesized Na3V2−xCax(PO4)3@C (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.10) materials are shown in Fig. 1a and S1 (ESI†). All XRD peaks can be well-indexed to the NASICON structure with the R[3 with combining macron]c space group (JCPDS no. 53-0018) without any impurities present, indicating that partial substitution of Ca (x ≤ 0.1) for V does not change the crystal structure of NVP. A shift of the diffraction peaks towards lower 2θ angles was observed for the Ca-doped samples, suggesting the expansion of unit cell volume upon Ca2+ doping. Rietveld refinements on these XRD data show that the unit cell volume increases significantly with Ca2+ incorporation (Fig. S2 and Table S1†), which is due to the larger ionic radius of Ca2+ (1.00 Å) vs. V3+ (0.64 Å) in oxygen octahedral coordination.30 The enlarged unit cell space can offer broader channels for Na ion diffusion, decreasing the Na ion migration energy and therefore facilitating electrode reaction kinetics.

To observe the effects of Ca2+ doping on the oxidation states of the V element, the Na3V1.90Ca0.10(PO4)3@C sample was selected for analysis using X-ray photo-emission spectroscopy (XPS), considering its relatively high Ca content. The results are shown in Fig. 1b and S3.† The V 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 peaks can be deconvoluted into two pairs of components, located at the binding energies of 523.9/516.9 eV and 525.2/517.6 eV, respectively. The former pair corresponds to V3+, while the latter is assignable to V4+ ions.31–35 The partial oxidation of V3+ to V4+ is attributed to the aliovalent acceptor doping of Ca2+ for V3+, in order to keep the charge neutrality. The resulting chemical formula of NVP can be written as Na3V2−2x3+Vx4+Cax2+(PO4)3. Accordingly, the concentration of [V4+] equals the Ca2+ doping content x. The atomic ratio of V3+ to V4+ was calculated to be 18.02, based on the fitting area ratio of V3+ 2p3/2 to V4+ 2p3/2 peaks (Table S2†), which is approximately the stoichiometric composition of Na3V1.83+V0.14+Ca0.12+(PO4)3. ICP-OES analysis was employed to obtain more precise chemical compositions of the prepared samples. Table S3† lists the molar ratios of Na, V, P and Ca for the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 samples. It clearly shows that the molar ratios are very close to the theoretical values, which is consistent with the XPS fitting results. For the bare NVP sample, the V 2p spectrum with two characteristic peaks at 523.9 eV (V3+ 2p1/2) and 516.9 eV (V3+ 2p3/2) demonstrates the trivalence of V3+ (Fig. S4†). From the defect chemistry and semiconductor points of view, the presence of mixed valence V3+/4+ can enhance the electronic conductivity of NVP and promote the electrode reaction kinetics.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations revealed that the prepared Na3V2−xCax(PO4)3@C materials have a similar powder morphology with a uniform particle size distribution in the range of 30–50 nm (Fig. 1c and S5†), suggesting that Ca2+ doping does not affect the particle growth and the morphology of the NVP material. The detailed microstructure of the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C sample was further investigated by using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). A uniform carbon layer with a thickness of around 3 nm was coated on the NVP particle, forming a NVP@C core–shell structure, as shown in Fig. 1d. Distinct lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.372 nm, corresponding to the (113) planes of NVP crystal, were observed. For the well crystallized Ca-doped NVP nanoparticle with a thin carbon coating, excellent electrochemical performances can be expected, considering the fast electronic conduction network and short ion diffusion distance.

Raman spectra were recorded to identify the surface-related features of the doped and undoped samples Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C and Na3V2(PO4)3@C (Fig. S6†). Both the positions and the intensities of the characteristic carbon-related peaks are almost the same for the two samples, implying the similar nature of the carbon shell, irrespective of the Ca2+ doping. The carbon content in both samples was estimated as ca. 10 wt% via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements (Fig. S7†). These results demonstrate that Ca2+ doping does not affect the turbostratic character and content of the surface carbon layer, and therefore any difference in the electrochemical performance between the investigated samples should come from the doping effects of Ca2+ on NVP.

To gain fundamental insight into the Ca2+ doping influence on the electronic properties of NVP, spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The electronic structure, sodium ion migration energy and lattice energy were calculated. The Ca2+ doping level was set as x = 0.25 to simplify the calculation structure model (Fig. S8†). The band gap of pure Na3V2(PO4)3 was calculated to be 1.867 eV (Fig. 2a), displaying typical semiconducting characteristics with the anticipation of low electronic conductivity. In the case of the Ca-doped sample, the Fermi level (EF) is shifted down into the valence band, where the band gap disappears. A certain number of electronic hole energy bands were generated at the top of the valence band. The electron–hole pairs can be associated with the V4+ cations, approximately as [h˙] = [VV˙], from the viewpoint of defect chemistry. The absence of a band gap and the increased charge carrier (electron–hole) concentration are beneficial to enhance the electronic conductivity of an electrode material. Therefore, an improved electrode reaction kinetics can be expected for Ca-doped NVP.

Sodium ion migration energy in the NVP lattice was calculated, meanwhile, using first principles calculation. Two Na+ diffusion paths were examined, Na(2)–Na(1) and Na(2)–Na(2), which have been recognized as two typical Na ion transport pathways in NASICON structures.36 The migration energy and corresponding diffusion trajectories along the two pathways are shown in Fig. 2b–d. The Na ions diffuse through a triangular bottleneck composed of three vertex oxygen atoms from two VO6 octahedra and one PO4 tetrahedra in every elementary process, and move along a parabolic-like trajectory in the lattice.37,38 The Na ion migration energy of Ca-doped NVP along pathway Na(2)–Na(1) (0.421 eV) and Na(2)–Na(2) (0.326 eV) is considerably lower than those of the undoped structure, indicating that the Ca2+ doping promotes Na ion diffusion in the NVP lattice, which is closely associated with the enlarged lattice parameters.

The lattice energy was calculated to understand the effects of Ca2+ doping on the structural stability of the NVP material. The calculated results show that the Ca-doped material has a higher lattice energy of 1.236 eV (per unit cell) than that of the undoped one, demonstrating that Ca2+ substitution enhances the structural stability. A more stable structure is helpful to suppress large crystal lattice distortion during the reversible insertion/extraction of two Na ions into/from the NVP lattice for both cathodic and anodic processes.

The electrochemical behavior of the Na3V2−xCax(PO4)3@C samples (x = 0.03, 0.05 and 0.1) used as cathode materials was evaluated in half cells with metallic sodium as the counter electrode in the voltage window of 2.0–4.3 V vs. Na+/Na. Meanwhile, the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3@C without doping were included for comparison. The CV curves of the representative Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode are shown in Fig. 3a, where a pair of well-defined redox peaks at ∼3.4 V corresponds to the redox reaction of V3+/V4+.13,14 The redox peaks of the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode shift slightly with increasing scan rate compared with the undoped NVP (Fig. S9†), indicating that the Ca2+ doping ensures a fast redox reaction kinetics. The Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 116 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 1C, with an initial coulombic efficiency of 98%. It exhibits excellent cycling stability with a specific capacity as high as 108 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1C, ∼93% retention of its initial discharge capacity (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the undoped NVP electrode displays quite severe capacity degradation during cycling, and only a capacity of 75.2 mA h g−1 remained after 1000 cycles. These results indicate that Ca2+ substitution can enhance effectively the structural stability of NVP electrode materials on cycling, which can be ascribed to the stronger Ca–O bond strength than that of the V–O bond (the formation enthalpies are −634.92 kJ mol−1 and −609.4 kJ mol−1 for CaO and 1/2 V2O3, respectively).39 It is also related to the higher lattice energy of Ca-doped NVP, as demonstrated by the DFT calculations in Section 2.2. Enhanced structural stability provides electrode materials with strong resistance against high current attack.

As expected, the Ca-doped NVP electrodes show greatly enhanced rate capabilities compared with that of the bare NVP (Fig. 3c and S10†). The Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C electrode exhibits an especially outstanding rate performance. The reversible capacities remain almost unchanged when the charge/discharge rate increases from 1C to 50C. As the current rate increases from 100 to 200, 300 and then 400C, reversible capacities of 111, 105, 102 and 93 mA h g−1 are obtained, respectively. Even at the ultra-fast rate of 500C (charge/discharge within 7.2 s), the material is still capable of delivering a high specific capacity of 84 mA h g−1, which is around 72% of its initial capacity at 1C. When the rate is gradually decreased back to 1C, the reversible capacity can be completely recovered, indicating an unprecedented rate performance. For the pristine NVP electrode, almost no capacity can be observed at 100C, due to the sluggish electrode reaction kinetics.

Inspired by the outstanding rate capability of the Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C electrode, the high-rate long-term cycle stability was examined at 50C, 100C and 200C, respectively. At a high rate of 50C, it delivers a reversible capacity of 113 mA h g−1 and maintains almost 100% of its initial capacity after 12 000 cycles (Fig. S11†). Even at 100C and 200C, as shown in Fig. 3d, the electrode exhibits a very stable cycling performance for 10 000 cycles with a very negligible degradation of 0.0027% and 0.0083% capacity decay per cycle, respectively, indicating an extraordinary rate capability and cycling stability.

To the best of our knowledge, the developed Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C cathode presents the best electrochemical performance among all the reported NVP-based composites so far, in terms of the rate capability and the cycling stability. It also exhibits the top performance among all currently considered cathode material candidates for SIBs (Fig. S12†).19,29,40–43

Meanwhile, as anode materials, the Na ion storage performance of the Ca-doped NVP materials as well as undoped NVP as a reference was characterized systematically. The CV curves of the Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C anodes recorded at various scan rates in the 0.1–3 mV s−1 range within 0.01–2.5 V are displayed in Fig. 4a, and they feature three obvious redox pairs, corresponding to the plateaus shown in the charge/discharge profiles (Fig. S13†). The primary two redox couples, 1.57/1.70 and 0.20/0.37 V, are related to the stepwise sodiation/desodiation processes of two Na ions into/from the NVP lattice, while the lowest pair at 0.02/0.09 V refers to sodium storage in the carbonaceous material. Similar redox couples can be observed in the CV curves of the bare NVP material (Fig. S14†), indicating the same electrochemical reactions. However, compared to the Ca-doped sample, the undoped NVP material shows a much larger electrode polarization with a bigger voltage difference between the anodic and cathodic peaks at high scanning rates. Especially, the cathodic peak at ∼0.3 V gradually disappears with increasing scan rate, implying sluggish Na+ insertion/extraction kinetics and inferior structure stability of the bare NVP when used as an anode material. These results demonstrate that Ca2+ doping can efficiently promote the electrode reaction kinetics.

The Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C anode demonstrates a stable cycling performance with a large reversible capacity of ∼167 mA h g−1 and high capacity retention of 89% for 1000 cycles at a charge/discharge rate of 1C (Fig. 4b). In contrast, for the undoped NVP, not only a lower specific capacity but also severe capacity fading were observed during 1000 cycles. Similar to the cathode behavior, Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C as an anode material also shows outstanding rate capability with high specific capacities of 160.5, 153.9, 141.4, 132.5, 123.8, 115.4, 100.1, 86.8 and 71.0 mA h g−1 at charge/discharge rates of 5, 10, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500C, respectively (Fig. 4c and S15†). When the charge/discharge rate is switched back gradually, the capacity is recovered completely, demonstrating the excellent rate capability and the structural durability of the Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C material. On the contrary, the undoped NVP displays a very fast capacity degradation upon the increase of charge/discharge current densities.

The long-term cycling behaviors of the Ca-doped NVP anode at high rates of 50 and 100C are demonstrated in Fig. 4d. The Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C electrode delivers a superior rate capability and cycling stability with 87% and 67% capacity retention, respectively, of its initial capacity at 50 and 100C after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles, corresponding to 0.0016% and 0.0046% capacity degradation per cycle. To the best of our knowledge, such unprecedented rate capability and long-term cyclability of NVP with the reversible two additional sodium ion insertion/removal (to Na5V2(PO4)3) are superior to any previously reported NVP-based materials. Most of the NVPs that were reported as anode materials were examined in the voltage range of 1.0–2.5 V vs. Na+/Na, corresponding to only one additional sodium ion insertion/removal (to Na4V2(PO4)3).17–20 This charge/discharge voltage window averts the redox couple at 0.20/0.37 V, leading to a lower specific capacity and better cycling performance. The disuse of the lower redox couple will decrease the working voltage of the full cell when NVP is used as an anode and coupled with cathode materials. Apparently, the lower potential couple at 0.20/0.37 V, corresponding to the fifth Na ion intercalation/deintercalation, is not stable.

To understand the reason for the irreversibility of the fifth Na ion intercalation in NVP, the crystal structure models of Na3V2(PO4)3, Na4V2(PO4)3 and Na5V2(PO4)3 were constructed and the unit volume of each structure was derived with first principles calculations (Fig. S16†). As listed in Table 1, the volume change upon the fourth Na ion intercalation is 0.1%, while that for the fifth Na ion insertion is 13.1%. The big volume change is probably the cause of the poor reversibility of the redox couple at low potentials (0.20/0.37 V). Apparently, the Ca-doping at the V-site can enhance the structure stability and improve the electrochemical reaction reversibility of the NVP electrode for the fifth Na ion intercalation, as supported by the experimental results (Fig. 4 and S14†). For an anode material, the availability of the low potential redox couple can enlarge the working voltage and therefore increase the energy density of the full cell.

Although it was examined in a wide voltage range of 0.01–2.5 V, the prepared Ca-doped Na3Ca0.05V1.95(PO4)3@C still delivers an excellent rate performance that outperforms that of all the reported NVP-based anode materials and also exhibits the top performance among various reported anode materials for SIBs (Fig. S17†).15,19,20,44–46

For nanosized materials, the electrochemical energy storage process sometimes involves the diffusion-controlled faradaic process and capacitive charge storage process. In order to understand the features of the charge storage mechanism of the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode, the data of the CV results in Fig. 3a and 4a were used to correlate the peak current with the scanning rate using the power law i = avb.47 The value of parameter b can be used to indicate the contribution of each process: b ≈ 0.5 refers to a diffusion-controlled electrochemical reaction, whereas b = 1.0 represents an ideal capacitive behavior.48 The calculated b values for the anodic and cathodic peaks were 0.61 and 0.60 for the cathode (Fig. S18a†), and 0.50 and 0.56 for the anode (Fig. S19a†), respectively, suggesting a diffusion-controlled faradaic process of the prepared Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode. These results also indicate the limited influence of pseudo-capacitive effects.

The CV results (Fig. 3a and 4a) were further analyzed to gain detailed insight into the sodium ion storage kinetics of Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C and Na3V2(PO4)3@C serving as both cathode and anode materials. Firstly, a linear fitting between the peak current and the square root of the scan rate was conducted to calculate the Na+ diffusion coefficient (DNa) according to the Randles–Sevcik equation.49 For both test voltage regimes as the cathode and anode, the Ca-doped Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C electrode shows a Na ion diffusivity several times higher than that of the undoped NVP electrode (Fig. S18b, c and S19b, c†), suggesting that the introduction of Ca2+ facilitates the transport of sodium ions in the lattice, which is related to the enlarged lattice parameters caused by large ion Ca2+ substitution (Table S1†). Meanwhile, the electrical conductivity measurement showed that the Ca-doped Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C sample has a remarkably enhanced conductivity by more than 20 times compared with the undoped sample (Fig. S20†). These results indicate that Ca2+ substitution enhances significantly both sodium ionic and electronic conductivity of the NVP material, which is consistent with the DFT results that showed that Ca-doping decreases the Na ion migration energy and reduces the band gap (Fig. 2). Naturally, this is beneficial for the improvement of electrochemical reaction kinetics.

Overall, both the experimental results and theoretical DFT calculations provide clear evidence that Ca2+ doping leads to significant enhancements in NVP electrode reaction kinetics and dynamic electrochemical stability for sodium storage, which is fully supported by the electrochemical results.

Motivated by the outstanding electrochemical performance of the Ca-doped NVP as both cathode and anode materials, we assembled NVP symmetric full SIBs to reveal the potential commercial application of the designed Ca-doped NVP@C material. Fig. 5a schematically illustrates the operation principle and internal structure of the symmetric full cell, where Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C is used as both a cathode and anode material. Fig. 5b shows the representative charge/discharge curves of the symmetric full cell at 0.5C for the third cycle recorded under galvanostatic cycling conditions at 1.0–4.0 V. In this wide voltage window, the low potential sodiation plateau for adoption of the fifth Na is fully utilized and therefore a high output voltage of about 3 V is achieved. The full cell delivers a reversible capacity of 116.9 mA h g−1, which is consistent with that of the NVP half cells (the capacity was calculated based on the mass of the cathode).

The constructed symmetric full cell shows a remarkable rate capability with high average reversible capacities of 117.1, 114.8, 114.1, 111, 109.4, 107, and 103.7 mA h g−1 at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 20 and 30C, respectively (Fig. 5c). Even at the ultra-high rate of 50C, the average discharge capacity remains at 102.2 mA h g−1, approximately 89% of the reversible capacity at 1C, demonstrating the excellent rate capability and superior sodium storage features. In addition, the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C symmetric full cell displays outstanding cycling behavior. At a high rate of 10C, the NVP full cell manifests very high cycling stability and still delivers 75.5 mA h g−1 even after 2000 cycles, corresponding to 0.02% capacity decay per cycle (Fig. 5d).

To further evaluate the practical applicability, the energy density of the symmetric Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C full cell was calculated on the basis of the mass of the cathode and anode. The result is presented in Fig. 6 together with that of other advanced sodium ion full cells reported in the literature. Note that the designed symmetric cell delivers a high gravimetric energy of ∼166 W h kg−1 (0.5C) and maintains 73% of the energy density when the power is increased by two orders of magnitude. This energy density is significantly higher than any of the state-of-the-art symmetric full SIBs. The presented results clearly indicate the promising commercial applicability of the designed NVP symmetric full SIBs for large-scale energy storage, considering its high energy density, outstanding rate capability, superior cycling stability and price advantages.

In summary, we demonstrated an effective strategy of low-cost Ca2+ doping to dramatically boost the electrochemical properties of NVP electrode materials. Outstanding rate capability and cycling stability are achieved for the Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C nanocomposite as both an anode and cathode material, which are attributed to the multiple effects of Ca2+ doping: (1) increasing the bulk electronic conductivity of NVP; (2) promoting sodium ion diffusion in the lattice; (3) enhancing the structure stability. These benefits from Ca-doping facilitate greatly the electrode reaction kinetics and improve significantly the cycling performance. The reversibility of the fifth Na ion intercalation/deintercalation at low potential (∼0.3 V) is enhanced remarkably by the Ca-doping, making NVP capable of working at a much lower potential and delivering more specific capacity and a higher energy density.

The prepared Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C material exhibits extraordinary electrochemical performance with two Na ions reversibly exchanging in both the cathodic and anodic regimes. Superior rate capability with C100C/1C being 95.7% and 75.4% and negligible capacity degradation of 0.0027% and 0.0046% per cycle at 100C for 10 000 cycles are achieved when using the material as a cathode and anode material, respectively. The constructed symmetric full cell with Na3V1.95Ca0.05(PO4)3@C as both the cathode and anode delivers a very high energy density of ∼166 W h kg−1 and excellent cycling stability over 2000 cycles at 10C rate. These performances outperform all of the recently reported NVP-based electrodes and symmetric cells. Our rational design provides insights and guidelines for novel electrode material design for the construction of high power and long life energy storage devices.
