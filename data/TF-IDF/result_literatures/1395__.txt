The  wet  chemical  synthesis  and  characterization  of  the  NASICON  family  series,  based  on  sodium  dysprosium  (phopho)silicates  namely Na5DySi4O12,  P  doped  Na5DySi4O12 (Na5DyPSi4O12),  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na4.05Dy0.55P0.3Si2.7O9,  were  carried  out.  Thermal  events  of  the as-dried  mixture  were  analysed  by  thermogravimetry/differential  scanning  calorimetry  (TG-DSC).  Compacted  disks  of  as-dried  powder  were subjected  to  conventional  heat  treatment  from  400  to  1000  8C  as  well  as  to  non-conventional  heat  treatments  like  microwave  irradiation  and  spark plasma  sintering  at  various  temperatures.  The  phase  evolution  was  studied  as  a  function  of  heat  treatment  temperature  by  X-ray  diffraction.  It  was found  that  the  Na5DySi4O12 type  (N5)  crystal  structure  that  was  reported  to  exhibit  high  Na+-conductivity  could  not  be  achieved  using  either  the conventional  or  even  non-conventional  heat-treatment  techniques  like  microwave  irradiation  and  spark  plasma  sintering,  but  could  be  obtained  by doping  the  sodium  dysprosium  silicate  with  phosphorous.  However,  even  after  doping,  the  desired  N5 phase  was  always  found  to  co-exist  along with  N9 type  (Na9DySi6O18)  phase  for  Na5DySi4O12 and  with  N3 type  (Na3DySi2O7)  phase  for  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na4.05Dy0.55P0.3Si2.7O9 compositions  up  to  a  heat  treatment  temperature  of  1000  8C. #

Solid  electrolytes  are  fast  ionic  conducting  ceramics  that promote  the  transfer  of  a  speciﬁc  ion  through  its  membrane  and are  the  major  subject  of  research  today,  since  they  have  a  wide range  of  applications  in  batteries,  fuel  cells,  supercapacitors,  thermoelectric  generators  and  chemical  sensors [1,2].  Of  the  existing  Na+ conducting  solid  electrolytes,  the well-known  is  sodium-beta-alumina  and  was  chosen  to  be  the best  candidate  for  use  in  sodium–sulphur  batteries  because  of its  high  Na+-conductivity  of  0.1  S  cm  1 at  the  temperature  of 300  8C  [1,2].  But  the  major  disadvantage  is  that,  it  has  a  twodimensional  it exhibits  anisotropic  behaviour  with  respect  to  ionic  conductivity  and  mechanical  properties  [3].  In  addition,  a  temperature  of

300  8C  is  required  to  achieve  a  high  Na+ ion  conductivity. When  such  a  high  temperature  is  reached,  the  corrosive  nature of  molten  sodium  which  is  used  as  one  of  the  electrodes predominates.  In  order  these  disadvantages, Goodenough  et  al.  [4]  introduced  NASICON  (Natrium  Super Ionic  Conductor),  a  series  of  fast  Na+ ion  conductor  with  the general  formula  Na1  +  xZr2SixP3     xO12 (0  <  x  <  3),  which  was found  to  exhibit  a  Na+ ion  conductivity  of  s300   0.2  S  cm  1 for  x    2,  competitive  to  sodium-b-alumina.  The  advantage  of this  NASICON  over  the  conventional  b-alumina  is  that  it  has  a three-dimensional  framework  structure  and  exhibits  comparable  Na+-conductivity  at  lower  temperatures.  However,  the disadvantage  is  that  NASICON  type  materials  are  unstable  in acidic  and  caustic  environments  due  to  some  species  of  the NASICON  being  particularly  attacked  by  acids.  From thermodynamic  point  of  view,  that NASICON-type  materials  without  the  phosphorous  may  exhibit increased  stability  in  corrosive  (acidic  or  caustic)  environments.  Due  to  this  possibility,  investigations  were  carried  out  on materials  having  the  formula  Na5RESi4O12,  RE  =  Yttrium  or any  rare  earth  metal,  for  use  as  electrolyte  materials  with  high

sodium  ion  conductivity  and  Na+-selectivity  at  low  temperatures.  The  high  Na+-conductivity  in  Rare  earth  doped NASICON  (RE,  Rare Earth  =  Gd)  structure  was  reported  by  Shannon  et  al.  [5].  This is  due  to  the  existence  of  large  channels  in  the  structure,  which facilitate  ionic  transport.  Banks  and  Kim  [6]  had  reported  the preparation  of  Na3.2M0.7Si2.9P0.1O8.7 (M  =  Er,  Y,  Ho,  Dy,  Gd, Eu  and  Sm)  and  Na5MSi4O12 (M  =  Fe,  In,  Er,  Y,  Gd,  Sm) glasses  and  glass-ceramics  and  compared  ionic  conductivity  values.  The  reported  values  were  in  the  range  of 10 the  poor resistance  of  NASICON  under  acidic/caustic  conditions, Balagopal  et  al.  [7]  reported  the  use  of  sodium  rare  earth silicates  with  the  general  formula  Na5RESi4O12 (RE  =  Y,  Dy, Nd,  Gd,  La,  Sm)  as  electrolytes  for  caustic  recycling.  Among  all the  sodium  rare  earth  silicates,  Na5DySi4O12 was  found  to exhibit  the  maximum  Na+-conductivity  of  0.01  S  cm  1 at 70  8C  and  highest  current  efﬁciency  when  used  in  electrolytic cells.  This  NASICON  structured  membrane  with  dysprosium  as rare  earth  element  was  also  reported  as  an  electrolyte  for  caustic recycling  from  Hanford  tank  waste  by  Fountain  et  al.  [8],  which was  found  to  have  highest  sodium  transport  efﬁciency  >90% with  high  sodium  ion  selectivity.  Yamashita  et  al.  [9]  had  also identiﬁed  a  new  family  of  Na+ super  ionic  conductors  with  the composition  formula  Na3  +  3x     y RE1     xPySi3     yO9 (RE  =  Y, Gd,  Sm)  and  carried  out  extensive  investigations  on  the  phase stabilities  of  different  silicates  namely NaYSiO4,  Na3YSi2O7,  Na5YSi4O12, and  Na9YSi6O18.  They had  synthesized  Na5YSi4O12 with  stable  N5-type  (Na5RESi4O12)  crystal  structure  that  exhibited  very  high  Na+ ion conductivity  of  0.1  S  cm  1 at  300  8C  with  an  activation  1.  They  had  also  studied  the  effects  of energy  Ea =  20  kJ  mol different  rare  earth  elements  such  as  Sc,  Y,  Gd,  Sm,  and  La  on the  crystallization  of  sodium  rare  earth  phosphosilicates  with the  general  formula  Na3  +  3x     yRE1     xPySi3     yO9 and  their conduction  properties  were  also  discussed  [10].  Since,  there  is no  such  detailed  investigation  on  the  phase  evolution  and stability  of  phases  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  system,  the  aim  of  the present  work  was  to  study  this  system  in  order  to  obtain  high Na+ ion  conducting  sodium  dysprosium  silicates  with  stable  N5type  structure.  The  present  investigation  reports  for  the  ﬁrst time,  the  synthesis  of  sodium  dysprosium  silicates  with  and without  phosphorous  doping,  by  wet-chemical  route  and  a systematic  study  of  the  phase  evolution  as  well  as  phase  stability was  carried  out  as  a  function  of  heat-treatment  temperature.

Minimum  assay  97%)  were  used  as  starting  materials. Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Dy(NO3)35H2O,  Na2Si3O7 and NaOH  were  dissolved  in  water  and  added  to  appropriate  amounts of  C2H5OH,  TEOS  and  NH4H2PO4 (for  phosphorous  doping),  to synthesize  Na5DySi4O12,  Na5DyPSi4O12,  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na4.05Dy0.55P0.3Si2.7O9.  The  precursors  were  stirred  at  room temperature  for  5  h  till  a  homogeneous  mixture  was  obtained. The  mixture  was  dried  at  150  8C  for  3  h  to  remove  solvent,  water and  then  ground  into  ﬁne  powder  and  compacted  into  15  mm diameter  disks.  The  disks  were  subjected  to  heat  treatment  at various  temperatures  from  400  8C  to  1000  8C  for  time  periods varying  from  1.5  h  to  10  h.  In  some  cases  non-conventional  heat treatments  like  microwave  irradiation  and  spark  plasma  sintering (SPS)  were  also  employed.  Heat  treatment  using  microwaves was  carried  out  by  placing  the  sample  inside  a  casket  containing SiC  susceptor  pieces.  The  process  was  carried  out  using  a  6  kW microwave  sintering  furnace  (supplied  by  Linn  Hightherm GmbH,  Germany)  at  a  temperature  of  1130  8C  for  varying  time period  of  0.5  h,  1  h,  and  2  h.  Further  experimental  details  about microwave  irradiation  are  given  in  [11].  SPS  was  carried  out using  a  Dr  Sinter  1050,  Japan,  by  placing  required  amounts  of powder  (as-dried  powder  heat  treated  at  800  8C)  between  the graphite  punches  and  applying  a  DC  source  of  600–800  A  for 5  min  simultaneously  with  applied  pressure  of  50  MPa.  Further experimental  details  regarding  spark  plasma  sintering  are  given in  [12].  The  SPS  experiments  were  carried  out  for  different temperatures  of  700  8C,  750  8C  and  950  8C.

Thermal  events  like  water  loss,  decomposition  of  nitrate, reaction  temperature  and  phase  transitions  were  analyzed  by subjecting  the  as-dried  powders  to  TG-DSC  measurements (Netzsch  STA  449  analyzer).  It  was  carried  out  from  room temperature  to  1250  8C  with  a  heating  rate  of  5  8C/min.  Xray  diffraction  was  carried  out  (Bruker  D8  Axs  Advance  Xray  diffractometer),  l  =  1.5406  A˚ ,  using  Cu  Ka radiation  in the  2u  range  of  58–808  the  phase  formation. The  heat  treated  samples  were  subjected  to  SEM  (Hitachi S3400  N)  analysis  for  studying  the  microstructure.  Ionic conductivity  of  the  sintered  samples  was  measured  using  a Solartron  impedance  analyzer.  Silver  paste  was  applied  on the  parallel  surfaces  of  the  densiﬁed  compact  as  blocking electrodes.  The  measurements  were  carried  out  the samples  from  room  temperature  to  350  8C,  over  a  frequency range  of  10  MHz–1  Hz.

trisilicate  (Na2Si3O7,  Sigma–Aldrich;  Assay (NaOH)    10%,  assay  (SiO2)    27%),  dysprosium  nitrate pentahydrate  (Dy  (NO3)35H2O,  Alfa  Aesar;  purity  –  99.9%.), sodium  hydroxide  (NaOH,  Qualigens;  Minimum  assay  97%), tetra  ethoxy  silane  (TEOS,  ABCR,  GmbH;  Minimum  assay 97%),  ethanol  (C2H5OH,  Minimum  assay  99.9%)  and  ammonium  dihydrogen  orthophosphate  (NH4H2PO4,  Qualigens;

The  TG–DSC  analysis  of  the  as-dried  Na5DySi4O12 powder, as  shown  in  Fig.  1,  indicates  that  there  was  a  mass  loss  starting from  a  temperature  of  100  8C  corresponding  to  an  endotherm, which  could  be  attributed  to  evaporation  of  ethanol  and  water. These  are  part  of  reactants  and  also  get  formed  as  a  by-product of  the  hydrolysis  and  condensation  of  TEOS.  The  sharp

Fig.  3  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  conventional  heat  treated Na5DySi4O12.  The  as-dried  powder  and  samples  heat  treated  at 400  8C  and  500  8C  revealed  a  similar  pattern.  The  observed peaks  correspond  to  that  of  sodium  silicate  (Na2SiO3,  PDF#  00082-0604)  and  no  required  N5 (Na5DySi4O12)  phase  was obtained  by  heat  treating  the  sample  up  to  600  8C.  Above 600  8C,  the  reaction  was  found  to  have  taken  place  as  seen  from the  XRD  and  TG–DSC,  leading  to  the  formation  of  sodium dysprosium  silicate  phase.  It  must  be  mentioned  here  that  there is  very  limited  information  on  phases  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  system. No  pattern  could  be  found  in  the  JCPDS  database  that  could  be matched  with  the  present investigation.  Since  the  ionic  radius  of  Y+3 (0.89  A˚ )  closely matches  with  that  of  Dy+3 (0.90  A˚ ),  an  analogous  system  Na– Y–Si–O  was  analyzed  which  was  well  studied  and  so  a similarity  in  crystal  structures  for  phases  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  and Na–Y–Si–O  could  be  expected.  Accordingly,  the  phase  formed at  600  8C  was  found  to  be  corresponding  to  NaDySiO4 (similar to  NaYSiO4,  PDF  #  00-020-1180  and  will  be  henceforth abbreviated  as  N1)  and  at  700  8C  there  was  a  phase  formation  of Na3DySi2O7 (similar  to  Na3YSi2O7,  PDF#  00-035-0405  and will  be  henceforth  abbreviated  as  N3).  It  was  also  seen  that  over the  temperature  range  from  800  8C  to  1000  8C,  the  phases present  were  N1and  N3 with  no  N5 phase  formation  even  at 1000  8C.  Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  conventional  heat treatment  of  the  Na5DySi4O12 samples  could  not  yield  the required  N5 phase  and  so  efforts  were  made  to  see  if  the  phase formation  could  be  achieved  with  the  help  of  non-conventional heat  treatments,  e.g.  microwaves  and  spark  plasma  sintering. Na+-conducting  sodium  beta  alumina  has  been  reported  to be  a  good  absorber  of  microwaves  and  capable  of  getting  heated and  sintered  in  a  microwave  ﬁeld  [13].  Hence,  it  could  be expected  that  Na+-conducting  sodium  dysprosium  silicate  will also  absorb  and  get  heated  when  irradiated  with  microwaves. Fig.  4  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  samples  heat  treated  using

endotherm  around  300  8C  could  be  due  loss  of  any chemically  bound  water  molecules  and  the  endotherm  with  a Tonset   600  8C  accompanied  by  loss  can  be attributed  to  the  decomposition  of  dysprosium  nitrate  which in  turn  leads  to  reaction  with  other  reactants  to  form  sodium dysprosium  silicate.  Above  700  8C,  there  was  no  appreciable mass  loss  as  well  as  no  sign  of  phase  change  as  seen  from  the DSC  curve.

The  TG–DSC  curves  of  as-dried  phosphorous  doped sodium  dysprosium  to compositions  Na5DyPSi4O12 and  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 were similar  to  each  other  and  almost  similar  to  that  of  the  as-dried Na5DySi4O12 powder,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2  (TG–DSC  of Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9).  In  addition  to  the  peaks  present  in Fig.  1,  a  large  mass  change  in  the  range  of  200  8C  was observed  in  Fig.  2  and  can  be  attributed  to  the  decomposition of  ammonium  dihydrogen  phosphate.  The  sharp  endotherm with  Tonset   580  8C  accompanied  by  a  large  mass  loss  can be  attributed  to  the  decomposition  of  dysprosium  nitrate leading  sodium dysprosium  silicate.

microwaves.  The  samples  were  heated  to  a  temperature  of 1130  8C  with  varying  soaking  times  of  0.5  h,  1  h  and  2  h.  From all  the  XRD  patterns,  it  was  seen  that,  phase  formation  of  only single  phase  N3 takes  place.  Thus,  heat  treatment  with microwaves  though  helped  in  achieving  a  single  phase  N3, irrespective  of  soaking  times,  the  formed  phase  was  not  the required  N5 phase.  Therefore,  another  non-conventional heating  method,  namely,  spark  plasma  sintering  was  carried out  as  an  attempt  to  stabilize  the  required  N5-type  crystal structure.  Samples  were  sintered  using  spark  plasma  sintering and  the  XRD  patterns  obtained  on  samples  subjected  to  spark plasma  sintering  using  3  different  conditions  are  shown  in Fig.  5.  The  patterns  revealed  the  presence  of  an  amorphous background  for  the  samples  sintered  at  700  8C  and  750  8C.  This can  be  attributed  to  the  formation  of  glassy  phase  along  with  a crystalline  phase.  In  the  case  of  samples  sintered  at  950  8C, there  was  no  such  amorphous  background.  This  can  be  because

to temperature  used  the  completely  crystallize  there  always existed  a  mixture  of  N1 and  N3 phases  along  with  an  unknown phase.  Thus  the  required  N5 phase  could  not  be  obtained  even with  the  help  of  spark  plasma  sintering.  It  should  be  mentioned here  the  series  of compositions  Na3  +  3x     yY1     xPySi3     yO9 belonging  to  the Na–Y–(P)–Si–O  system,  the  N5 structure  could  not  be stabilized  without  addition  of  phosphorous  due  to  the  high free  energy  of  the  N5 phase  with  [P]  =  0  [14].  Since  in  the present  investigation  also,  the  N5 phase  could  not  be  obtained with  the similarities  in  ionic  radii  of  Dy3+ and  Y3+,  it  was  expected that  phases  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  and  Na–Y–Si–O  had  similar thermodynamic  stabilities.  Since  Si4+ and  P5+ have  similar ionic  radii  (42  pm  and  35  pm  respectively),  P5+ is  generally used  for  aliovalent  doping  of  silicates.  Hence,  further  studies were  carried  out  on  phosphorous  doped  Na-dysprosium  silicate system.  Fig.  6  shows  the  XRD  of  conventional  heat  treated Na5DyPSi4O12.  Similar  to  Na5DySi4O12,  heat  treatment  at 400  8C  and  500  8C  revealed  the  presence  of  peaks  of  Na2SiO3 and  also  peaks  corresponding  to  silica  (SiO2 PDF#  00-0130026).  When  samples  were  heated  to  a  temperature  of  600  8C, as  sodium dysprosium  silicate  takes  place.  But,  in  this  case,  it  was  seen that  addition  of  phosphorous  favoured  the  formation  of  the required  N5 phase,  though  however  a  single  N5 phase  (PDF# 00-085-0536)  was  not  formed.  The  XRD  patterns  revealed  the presence  of  another  sodium  dysprosium  silicate  phase Na9DySi6O18 (similar  to  Na9YSi6O18,  PDF#  00-035-0406 and  will  henceforth  be  abbreviated  as  N9)  as  well  as  an unknown  phase  at  2u  =  10.328  with  the  major  phase  being  N5. The  unknown  phase  at  2u  =  10.328  was  observed  to  disappear when  the  sample  was  heat  treated  at  a  temperature  of  1000  8C. The  XRD  patterns  of  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na4.05Dy0.55P0.3Si2.7O9 obtained  at  various  heat  treatment  temperatures  were

Though  a  single  phase  N5 could  not  be  obtained  in  the present  study,  it  was  of  immense  interest  to  ﬁnd  out  the  ionic conductivities  of  the  phases  obtained  by  different  heat treatment  techniques.  Hence,  impedance  measurements  were carried  out  for  conventionally  heat-treated,  microwave  irradiated  and  spark  plasma  sintered  Na5DySi4O12 samples.  The room  temperature  (25  8C)  conductivities  of  microwave  heat to  be  8.7e 6  S  cm  1,  15.8 treated  samples  were  e 6  S  cm  1 for  soaking  times  of  0.5  h, 1  h  and  2  h  respectively.  The  room  temperature  conductivity  of conventionally  heat  treated  sample  at  1130  8C  for  8  h  was found  to  be  2.4e 6  S  cm  1.  In  case  of  spark  plasma  sintered samples,  conductivities  measured  at  a  slightly  higher  temperature  of  150  8C  for  samples  sintered  at  750  8C  and  950  8C  were found  to  be  1.3e 7  S  cm  1 respectively.  It can  be  seen  that  the  pure  N3 phase  obtained  by  microwave  heat treatment  is  more  conducting  than  a  mixture  of  N1 and  N3

seen  to  be  similar.  The  XRD  of  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 as  shown  in Fig.  7  revealed  that  the  samples  heat  treated  from  600  8C  to 1000  8C  exhibited  a  similar  pattern  with  each  other.  It  was observed  that,  here  also,  N5 phase  was  achieved  by  preparation  of samples  with  the  above  mentioned  composition.  But  again  the material  obtained  was  not  a  single  phase  but  always  a  mixture  of phases  corresponding  to  N5 and  N3 with  N3 phase  being  the  major phase,  irrespective  of  heat  treatment  temperatures.

From  the  obtained  XRD  patterns,  it  was  seen  that  sodium dysprosium  silicate  samples  with  phosphorous  doping  were found  to  exhibit  the  required  N5 phase.  Although  the  required phase  was  obtained,  it  was  always  a  mixture  of  phases,  i.e.  N5 phase  co-existing  along  with  either  N1/N3/N9 phase.  Fig.  8 shows  a  schematic  representation  of  the  phases  of  sodium dysprosium  silicate  system  when  different  compositions  were conventionally  heat  treated  at  different  temperatures.  The results  of  the  present  investigation  were  highly  reproducible and  provided  insight  into  the  phase  stabilities  of  phases  in

phases  obtained  by  conventional  heat  treatment  and  spark plasma  sintering.  The  difference  in  conductivity  values  of 750  8C  and  950  8C  spark  plasma  sintered  samples  is  nearly  of one  order  and  such  a  large  difference  can  be  attributed  to  the presence  of  glassy  sodium  silicate  as  seen  from  Fig.  9a  which  is the  SEM  image  for  sample  sintered  at  750  8C  that  reveals needle-like  structures.  This  can  also  be  conﬁrmed  by  the presence  of  broad  amorphous  background  in  XRD  (Fig.  5).  The surface  morphology  of  samples  sintered  at  950  8C  (Fig.  9b) reveals  considerably  higher  amount  of  sintering  though  there still  exists  some  porosity.

Sodium  dysprosium  silicate  samples  with/without  phosphorous  doping  were  synthesized  using  sodium  silicate, dysprosium  nitrate  and  TEOS  precursors  along  with  ammonium  dihydrogen  phosphate.  Four  different  compositions  of sodium  dysprosium  (phospho)silicates  such  as  Na5DySi4O12, Na5DyPSi4O12,  Na3.9Dy0.6P0.3Si2.7O9 and  Na4.05Dy0.55P0.3Si2.7O9 were  prepared.  It  was  found  that  the  highly  Na+conducting  N5-type  crystal  structured  phase  could  be  stabilized by  phosphorous  doping  of  the  sodium  dysprosium  silicate.  This study  showed  for  the  ﬁrst  time  in  literature,  stabilization  of  the required  N5 structure  in  Na–Dy–Si–O  system  by  doping phosphorous  into  the  sodium  dysprosium  silicate.  From  the results  of  conductivity  measurements,  it  was  realized  that  the conductivity  values  of  compositions  measured  over  the temperature  range  from  25  8C  to  150  8C  were  of  the  order 10  1 for  conventional,  microwave  heat  treated  and spark  plasma  sintered  samples.  Further  studies  are  in  progress in  order  to  probe  deep  into  the  sodium  dysprosium  silicate system  to  achieve  a  stabilized  single  phase  with  N5 crystal structure.
