The  cathode  materials  for  sodium-ion  batteries  have  always been one of the key issues for the ultimate success of largescale energy storage systems. Here, we introduce a 4.0 V class highvoltage cathode material with a newly recognized sodium superionic  conductor  (NASICON)-type  structure  with  cubic  symmetry  (space  group  P213),  Na3V(PO3)3N.  We  synthesize  an  N-doped  graphene  oxide wrapped Na3V(PO3)3N composite with a uniform carbon coating  layer, and it shows both excellent rate performance and outstanding  cycling stability. Its air/water stability and all-climate performance are  carefully investigated in detail. Near-zero volume change (~0.40 %) is  clearly observed for the first time based on in-situ synchrotron X-ray  diffraction,  and  the  in-situ  X-ray  absorption  spectra  reveal  the  V3.2+/V4.2+ redox reaction with high reversibility. Its three-dimensional  sodium diffusion pathways are explicitly demonstrated with distinctive  low energy barriers. Higher reversible capacity and a higher working  platform can surely be achieved if the electrolyte possesses a wider  voltage  tolerance  window  above  4.8  V.  Our  comprehensive  results  indicate  that  this  high-voltage  new  NASICON-type  Na3V(PO3)3N  composite  can  be  considered  as  a  competitive  candidate  cathode  material  for  sodium-ion  batteries  and  will  receive  more  extensive  attention and studies in the future.
