K1– xMg1– xSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) solid solutions have been prepared by solid-state reactions. The synthesized phases of variable composition have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis, and their luminescence excitation and luminescence spectra have been obtained. We have measured their spectroscopic and luminescent characteristics (luminescence excitation spectra, short- and long-lived photoluminescence spectra, and long-lived emission lifetime).

Molybdates of monovalent, divalent, and rareearth metals are of interest as sources of materials with various ion-conducting, ferroelectric, electrical, and optical characteristics. They include solid electrolytes, laser materials, and phosphors, which have found application in electronics, optics, and the fabrication of white light emitting diodes owing to the possibility of varying their composition and physicochemical properties [1–7]. There is great interest in oxide phases crystallizing with NASICON-related structures owing to their unique properties: high chemical and thermal stability, low thermal expansion, and high ionic conductivity. A distinctive feature of their crystal structure is the presence of stable frameworks made up of octahedra and tetrahedra, with the general formula , where R is an octahedral cation in phosphate, arsenate, molybdate, tungstate, and sulfate systems and the alkali metal atoms occupy vacant framework sites [2, 3, 8]. The possibility of varying the cation composition without changing the structure type allows for the targeted synthesis of M1– xA1– xR1 + x(MoO4)3 phases of variable composition isostructural with NASICON materials. Such a structure of the M1– xA1– xR1 + x(MoO4)3 phases is topologically identical to the rhombohedral structure of corundum: the A (R) atoms are located on the threefold rotation axes and the MoO4 groups reside on the twofold rotation axes. The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral sites form a three-dimensional network of channels, which are filled with alkali metal cations. Necessary conditions for a compound to have a NASICON-related structure is that the size of the doubly and triply charged cations in it lie in the range 0.6–0.9 Å, which is met by the Mg2+ and Sc3+ cations, and that the additional cations (K+), which reside in framework voids, have an appropriate size (1.38 Å) [2, 5, 7]. As shown in previous studies [3, 7], where Na1– xMg1– xSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) phases of variable composition were synthesized, the luminescence excitation spectra of europium ions have a broad, strong absorption band in the range 200–350 nm, which characterizes charge transfer from the O2– in the groups through Mo–O bonds to luminescence centers. Strong emission lines of compounds can be caused by the use of not only the energy necessary for the direct excitation of Eu3+ luminescence centers (λex ~ 396 nm) but also shorter wavelength radiation (260–280 nm) [6, 7, 9–18]. Accordingly, the possibility of employing an additional contribution to the luminescence excitation mechanism in order to raise the luminescence intensity allows the M1– xMg1– xSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (M = Na, K; 0≤ x≤ 0.5) phases to be thought of as potentially attractive structures for doping with other rare earths. The objectives of this work were to examine the feasibility of incorporating Lu3+ cations into the structure of the K1– xMg1– xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) phase of variable composition, find appropriate synthesis conditions, and investigate the spectroscopic and luminescent characteristics of the phase of variable composition doped with Eu3+ ions.

The KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 molybdates with a NASICON-related structure were prepared via partial lutetium substitution for scandium in the K1– xMg1– xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) phase of variable composition by solid-state reactions using neutral potassium, magnesium, scandium, and lutetium molybdates. The neutral molybdates were synthesized by a standard ceramic processing technique: reagent-grade K2CO3, MgO, and MoO3 and 99.99%-pure Sc2O3 and Lu2O3 were reacted in the temperature range from 450 to 750°C for 120–250 h. To avoid molybdenum oxide losses through sublimation, stoichiometric oxide mixtures were heat-treated starting at 450°C and then the temperature was raised stepwise to 650–750°C, depending on particular characteristics of the molybdates to be synthesized. Nonequilibrium samples were annealed further. Equilibrium was thought to be reached if two sequential anneals did not change the phase composition of the material. To obtain various activator ion concentrations, scandium and lutetium oxides were replaced by an equimolar amount of europium oxide in the NASICON molybdates. In this way, we obtained crystalline phases containing 1–6 mol % rare-earth oxide (Eu2O3). Whether the samples were at equilibrium was checked by X-ray diffraction on a Bruker D8 Advance automatic diffractometer (CuKα radiation, graphite monochromator). Their lattice parameters were refined using Rentgen software. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was carried out using an MOM OD-103 thermoanalytical system (heating rate, 10°C/min; sample weight, 0.3–0.4 g). Spectroscopic and luminescent characteristics of the samples were assessed from their photoluminescence (PL) excitation and PL spectra measured on an SM 2203 spectrofluorometer (Solar, Belarus). The measurement accuracy was ±2 nm. Powder samples to be studied were placed between optically transparent (quartz) glasses. Their luminescence excitation spectra were measured at the peak PL wavelength (616 nm). Long-lived luminescence and its lifetime in the millisecond range were measured on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer under excitation with blue light (466 nm), because one potential application of the synthesized compounds is the use as red phosphors in light emitting diode engineering.

The synthesized K1– xMg1– xSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) phases of variable composition are cationdeficient solid solutions based on the ternary molybdate KMgSc(MoO4)3. According to X-ray diffraction data, the synthesized samples—KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 phases of variable composition—are single-phase, have a NASICON-related structure (sp. gr. R c, Z = 6), and crystallize in trigonal symmetry (Fig. 1). The phases obtained by us are isostructural with the ternary molybdate KMgIn(MoO4)3. The X-ray diffraction patterns of KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 could be indexed in trigonal symmetry using the unitcell parameters of a KMgIn(MoO4)3 single crystal [3]. The large extent of the primary crystallization field of the NASICON solid solutions is due to the possibility of isomorphous substitutions on the octahedral site. The octahedral site (M), occupied by the Mg, Sc, and Lu atoms at random, contains an excess of Sc and Lu and is magnesium-deficient. Residing in framework voids, the potassium does not distort the lattice symmetry and is also deficient. The distinctive structural features of KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 and the cation distribution in these materials lead to an increase in the contribution of the Sc–O and Lu–O bonds to the overall electrostatic balance of the structure. To maintain the balance, weakening of the K–O bonds is required, which is ensured by the potassium deficiency in the framework voids and an increase in framework size. This leads to an increase in unit-cell volume (Table 1). The phases of variable composition synthesized in this study, KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3, melt incongruently at 1085°C (Table 1).

We measured PL excitation and PL spectra of crystalline phases with the compositions K0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+, KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+, and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (Figs. 2–4). The luminescence excitation spectra of the K0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+, KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+, and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ samples measured at λem = 616 nm (Figs. 2a, 3a, 4a) contain strong, broad absorption bands in the range 220–350 nm and a number of peaks corresponding to the 7F0–5D4, 7F0–5G2, 7F0–5L6, 7F0–5D3, 7F0–5D2, and 7F0–5D1 4f–4f intraconfigurational transitions of the europium ion at wavelengths of 362, 382, 396, 412, 466, and 534 nm, respectively [6, 7, 9–18]. As seen in Fig. 3a, the KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ sample has the highest luminescence excitation intensity on the 7F0→ 5L6 transition (λmax ~ 396 nm), whereas the K0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (Fig. 2a) and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (Fig. 4a) samples have the highest luminescence intensity in a broad band centered aroundλmax ~ 294 and 300 nm, respectively. The absorption band under consideration comprises two components, peaking aroundλmax ~ 260 and ~294 nm. According to Raskina et al. [6] and Guo et al. [19], the former component (λmax ~ 260 nm) corresponds to absorption bands characterizing charge transfer through the O2––Eu3+ bonds, whereas the latter component (λmax ~ 294 nm) characterizes charge transfer from the O2– in the groups to luminescence centers through the Mo–O bonds. Thus, comparison of the luminescence excitation spectra leads us to conclude that there are two distinct luminescence excitation mechanisms: (1) direct excitation of the luminescence centers (Eu3+ cations) and (2) excitation through charge transfer from the O2– in the groups to luminescence centers through the Mo–O bonds. Analysis of the luminescence spectra of K0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+, KMgSc0.5Lu0.5- (MoO4)3:Eu3+, and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ measured under excitation at a wavelengthλex = 396 nm indicates that the luminescence of the synthesized samples is due to the Eu3+ 5D0→ 7Fj (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions. Note that the highest luminescence intensity is offered by the 5D0→ 7F2 electric dipole transition, which is responsible for the characteristic red emission from the samples (λmax = 616 nm) (Figs. 2b, 3b, 4b). The weaker band at 594 nm arises from the 5D0→ 7F1 magnetic dipole transition. The relative intensities of the 5D0→ 7F1 and 5D0→ 7F2 transitions are known to strongly depend on the local environment of the europium ions [3, 7, 9]. If the europium ions occupy centrosymmetric sites, the 5D0→ 7F1 magnetic dipole transition is expected to be relatively strong, whereas the 5D0→ 7F2 electric dipole transition is parity-forbidden and should be weak. The luminescence spectra of the Eu3+ ions in all of our samples show a strong red luminescence band at 616 nm, due to the 5D0→ 7F2 transition, indicating that the europium ions reside on lowsymmetry sites. The luminescence spectra measured at other excitation energies (λex = 294 (300) and 466 nm) are similar to those obtained under excitation atλex = 394 nm. As seen in Figs. 2b, 3b, and 4b, the highest intensity in the range of the 5D0→ 7F2 transition is observed in the spectra of the KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ samples; that is, it is reasonable to conclude that the addition of lutetium increases the luminescence intensity in the K1– xMg1– x-Sc1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤ x≤ 0.5) phase of variable composition. Note that the luminescence intensity in KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ is 4.5 times that in K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+. The spectroscopic and kinetic characteristics of the pulsed photoluminescence in our samples at T = 300 K are presented in Fig. 5. The PL decay kinetics in the samples under investigation can be described by an exponential function (Fig. 6). The PL decay timesτPL are listed in Table 2.

K1– xMg1– xSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (0≤ x≤ 0.5) solid solutions with a NASICON-related structure (sp. gr. R c, Z = 6) have been prepared by solid-state reactions. Analysis of their luminescence characteristics indicates that, in all of the synthesized samples, the highest intensity is observed at 616 nm, due to the Eu3+ 5D0→ 7F2 transition, which is responsible for the characteristic red emission from the samples. Two distinct luminescence excitation mechanisms have been identified: (1) direct excitation of luminescence centers (Eu3+ cations) and (2) excitation through charge transfer from the O2– in the groups to luminescence centers through the Mo–O bonds. We have measured the PL decay kinetics in the samples under investigation and determined the PL decay timeτ:τ = 0.36 ms in KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ and 0.29 ms in K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+. The spectroscopic and luminescence characteristics obtained for KMgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ and K0.5Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3:Eu3+ suggest that these materials are potentially attractive for use as materials of narrowband red phosphors.
