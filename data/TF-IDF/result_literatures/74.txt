Glass-ceramics of the Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 series (0≤x≤0.65) was obtained by glass crystallization under the same conditions of heat treatment. The influence of the heating rate (1, 3 and 8 °C min-1) and the different heat treatment times (2, 8 and 12 h) on the lithium-ion conductivity of glass-ceramics were studied. The impact of Al2O3 addition on the phase composition, microstructure, transport properties and molecular structure of lithium germanophosphate was investigated by XRD, SEM, impedance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The obtained electrolytes have the NASICON-type structure with space group R-3c. Glass-ceramics is single-phase when 0.3≤x≤0.5, but impurity phases Li4P2O7, AlPO4, and GeO2 appear at x=0.65. An increase in Al2O3 content leads to the formation of larger crystallites. A significant improvement in ionic conductivity was observed in Al-doped samples. The conductivity of undoped LiGe2(PO4)3 was found to be 4 orders of magnitude lower compared to the Al-doped solid electrolytes. Among the Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 glass-ceramics, the composition of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (x=0.5) has the highest lithium-ion conductivity, which is 5.03 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C. The electron conductivity of solid electrolyte at x=0.5 is 4 × 10-9 S cm-1 at 25 °C. Ionic transference number was found to be close to 0.99. 
Lithium power sources exhibit the highest energy efficiency among other chemical power sources due to the use of such anode material as metallic lithium, which has the highest theoretical specific capacity – 3860 mA·h·g-1 [1-2]. The liquid electrolytes currently used in lithium-ion batteries are not stable in contact with aggressive lithium [3], therefore, there is an intensive search for solid electrolytes suitable for lithium batteries. Moreover, the commercial use of lithium-ion batteries in large-scale applications (for instance, electric vehicles) creates safety concerns and may lead to accidents caused by thermal issues [4-5]. All-solid-state lithium batteries can address these concerns due to the use of non-combustible solid electrolytes. “Ideal” solid electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium batteries should have high lithium-ion conductivity at ambient temperatures, stability in air, negligibly small electronic conductivity and a satisfactory chemical stability in contact with lithium anode and with cathode materials [1, 6]. Among numerous types of solid Li+ conductors, such as garnets, perovskites, LISICONs, sulfide glasses, NASICON-type materials, the latter ones are the most promising and intensively researched in recent years, which is confirmed by a large number of review articles on this subject [1, 6, 7-9]. For instance, lithium analogs of a NASICON (Na Super Ion CONductors)-type conductor share the formula LiM2IV(PO4)3 (MIV = Ge, Ti, Sn, Zr or Hf). They form a covalent M2(PO4)3 skeleton with corner-sharing MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra which form a three-dimensional (3D) network [1, 10]. Lithium ions can occupy different crystallographic sites in this skeleton, i.e., octahedral (M1) and 10-fold coordinated (M2). A partial substitution of M4+ ions for Al3+ ions (or by any other trivalent cation) and Li+ to compensate the charge imbalance is known to increase conductivity by several orders of magnitude [6]. In particular, the conductivity of undoped LiGe2(PO4)3 at room temperature is ~10-6 S cm-1 [6], and the conductivity of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 is 3.5·10-5 S cm-1 [11]. It is noteworthy that Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 7·10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C in the NASICON-based family [12], however, Ti4+ ions in Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 electrolytes are reduced by lithium, therefore, conductors of Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 family (LAGP for short) are more attractive because of their excellent stability [5, 12].The transport properties of solid electrolytes, in particular, of the conductors belonging to Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 system, can be modified not only by doping, but also by choosing the most appropriate synthesis route and by optimizing its conditions. Traditional methods of producing solid electrolytes are solid state and sol-gel syntheses. Thus, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 ceramics obtained by solid state method has the conductivity of 3.5·10-5 S·cm-1 at room temperature [11], while the same ceramics obtained through sol-gel synthesis exhibits the conductivity of 1.8·10-4 S·cm-1 [13]. More and more recently published papers focus on the synthesis of LAGP glass-ceramics by glass crystallization. LAGP glass-ceramics exhibits enhanced lithium-ion conductivity of >10-4 S·cm-1 at 25 °C [14-16], and, in addition, lower porosity and a more compact microstructure compared to sintered polycrystalline materials [17], which is significant for its practical application in all-solid-state batteries with a lithium anode. Crystallization parameters greatly affect the mobility of lithium ions, the content of the residual amorphous phase and the number of cracks and holes, all of which has a considerable influence on the ionic conductivity of materials. Earlier we showed that the crystallization temperature of 820 °C is optimal for obtaining high-conductivity LAGP glass-ceramics from the glass of 19.75Li2O–6.17Al2O3–37.04GeO2–37.04P2O5 nominal composition, in which case the conductivity of the glass-ceramics was 3.9·10-4 S·cm-1 at 25 °C [18]. Another advantage of synthesizing LAGP via glass crystallization is a lower cost of this method compared to the sol-gel technique, since, instead of expensive organic germanium-containing materials, it uses germanium oxide to produce glass. Despite a large number of publications exploring LAGP [6, 7, 10-17], the data about the phase composition of these conductors and their conductivity values are contradictory. So far, the conditions under which one can obtain single-phase glass-ceramics based on lithium germanium phosphate doped by aluminum have not been determined. The data about the stability of glass-ceramics against lithium are also dissimilar [17, 19-21], which may be related to the presence of impurity phases in the electrolyte. Germanium oxide can be an example – it is often found as an impurity phase in electrolytes, and Ge4+ ions in GeO2 are reduced to Gen+ [22], when exposed to lithium. Therefore, the aim of the present work is a thorough synthesis of glass-ceramics of Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (0≤х≤0.65) composition combined with determining its single-phase region and investigating the influence of Al2O3 on the microstructure, molecular structure and conductivity of LiGe2(PO4)3 glass-ceramics. At the final stage, the transport numbers of the highest-conducting composition are determined for practical application in all-solid-state lithium and lithium-ion batteries. 
Glass-ceramics of Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (0≤х≤0.65) composition were obtained by glass crystallization. Starting glasses of nominal composition (Table 1) for obtaining glass-ceramics were synthesized by melt quenching. Li2CO3 (>99.4%), Al2O3 (>99.9%), GeO2 (>99.9%) and NH4H2PO4 (≥98.0%) served as precursors for obtaining glasses. Al2O3 and GeO2 were previously heated at 1000 °C for 1 h, and Li2CO3 was dried at 300 °C for 3 h. The starting components were thoroughly mixed together, and the mix was heated stepwise up to 500 °C to remove volatile components. Then the resulting mixture was melted in a Pt crucible at 1250–1450 °C for 1 h depending on the composition. The melt was quenched between preheated steel plates. The procedure yielded transparent colorless parallel-sided plates without any impurities. The samples were annealed at 500 °C during 0.5 h to relieve thermal stresses, then polished on both sides and crystallized at different heating rates (1, 3 and 8 °C min-1) and different heat treatment times (2, 8 and 12 h) in an electric furnace. After crystallization the samples were slowly cooled down to room temperature in the furnace. The amorphous structure of the original glass and the phase composition of the obtained glass-ceramics were determined by X-ray diffraction method (XRD) with a Rigaku D/MAX-2200VL/PC diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) over a 2θ range of 10–70° with steps of 0.02° at room temperature. The collection time was 3 h for each XRD-pattern. The collected data were processed with the FULLPROF program. Microstructure of the glass-ceramic electrolytes was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a TESCAN MIRA 3 LMU (TESCAN, Czech Republic) with the Oxford Instruments INCA Energy350 X-Ray energy-dispersive microanalysis system (EDX) with an X-max 80 detector. SEM images in SE (secondary electrons) and BSE (back-scattered electrons) modes were obtained at a high voltage of 10 kV and beam intensity of 10. The high voltage of 20 kV and the beam intensity of 15 were used for the EDX analysis. The sputtering of thin conducting carbon coats was made using the Quorum Technologies Q150T ES system. The thickness of conducting layer did not exceed 10 nm for each of the studied samples. The density of the samples was estimated by the pycnometer method at 25 °C with isopropyl alcohol (ρ = 0.781 ± 0.005 g cm-3) as the immersion medium. The electrical resistance of the samples was measured by the electrochemical impedance method in a two-probe cell with silver metal electrodes over the frequency range of 0.025–1000 kHz in air using potentiostats/galvanostats AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Netherlands) and Р-5Х (Ellins, Russia). The results collected with the help of AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N were processed using Nova program. The impedance spectra were obtained over a 20–250 °C temperature range. The samples were coated with gallium-silver paste to form electrodes. Ionic transport number was determined by the DC polarization method under an applied field of 1 V using the potentiostats/galvanostat Р-5Х. For DC measurements, polished surfaces of pellets were coated with gold-sputtered to form ion-blocking electrodes. The molecular structure of the electrolytes was studied using a Raman spectrometer U 1000 (Renishaw, England). The Raman spectra were collected by an Ar-ion laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a power of 40 mW at a scanning angle of 90°. The Raman spectra were recorded in the static and extended modes in the range of 4000−50 cm-1 with spectral resolution of 1 cm-1. 
An ideal glass-ceramic conductor should have not only the high lithium-ion conductivity, but also a compact microstructure, which depends on the conditions of glass crystallization. On the basis of our previously reported DSC data and the data about the influence of crystallization temperature on the conductivity of the glass with 19.75Li2O–6.17Al2O3–37.04GeO2–37.04P2O5 composition, which corresponds to the nominal composition of Li1.6Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramics [18], it was established that LAGP electrolyte exhibits the highest conductivity when the crystallization temperature is 820 °C. In the present paper, we have optimized the technique of producing high-density LAGP glass-ceramics by determining how the heating rate and crystallization time affect the transport properties of the samples. For this purpose, 18.75Li2O–6.25Al2O3–37.50GeO2–37.50P2O5 glass (corresponds to the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 composition of glass-ceramics) was crystallized at various heating rates (1, 3 and 8 °C·min-1) at 820 °C for equal periods of time – 8 h. XRD data evidences the formation of a single-phase NASICON-type material with R-3c space group at all the heating rates. Fig. 1 contains SEM images of cross-sectional profiles of the samples depending on the heating rate. According to SEM data, increasing the heating rate from 1 to 8 °C·min-1 leads to the increase in the size of the crystallites (Fig. 1) and to the appearance of microcracks at a high heating rate. The density of the samples at 1 and 3 °C·min-1 is 3.12 ± 0.05 g·cm-3, and at 8 °C·min-1 it decreases to 2.98 g·cm-3. 
Arrhenius plots of the conductivity for glass-ceramics crystallized at various heating rates are in Fig. 2а. One can see that a low heating rate (1 and 3 °C·min-1) leads to the formation of an electrolyte with the highest conductivity. Crystallization of the glass at the rate of 8 °C·min-1 yields glass-ceramics with a lower conductivity, which is apparently related to the appearance of microcracks (Fig. 1) and the decreasing density of the samples. 
It was established that with the growth of the heat treatment time from 2 to 12 h the conductivity decreases. This correlates with the change in the density of the electrolyte, which expectedly goes down from 3.17 (at 2 h) to 2.97 g·cm-3 (12 h). The work [23] studied the influence of the heat treatment time (8, 16 and 24 h) at constant temperature (825 °C) and reported that crystallization at 8 h results in the highest conductivity. Despite a high lithium-ion conductivity that was achieved for the LAGP glass-ceramics, i.e., 4.22·10-3 S·cm-1, the solid electrolyte contained AlPO4 impurity at grain boundaries [23]. We have demonstrated that a single-phase electrolyte can be produced after a shorter heat treatment (2 h).  
Thus, the optimal condition for synthesizing single-phase LAGP glass-ceramics with the highest conductivity and density is glass crystallization at 820 °C with the heating rate of 3 °C min-1 during 2 h, therefore, all the glass-ceramic electrolytes of the Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 (0≤х≤0.65) system were obtained under these conditions.  
Structural changes taking place when Ge4+ ions are substituted for Al3+ and Li+ ions in LAGP were studied using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. X-ray powder diffraction patterns of all the precursor glasses contain no peaks corresponding to crystal phases, as is shown in Fig. 3. XRD patterns of Li1+xAlxGe2–x(PO4)3 glass-ceramics with different dopant content under the same conditions of crystallization are given in Fig. 4. The most intense peaks in all the XRD patterns correspond to the main LAGP phase with a hexagonal structure, space group R-3c (LiGe2(PO4)3, JCPDS 80-1924). When х=0 and х=0.15, the sample contains GeO2 impurity phase alongside the main phase LiGe2(PO4)3, Fig. 4. In the case of 0.3≤х≤0.5, the compositions are single-phase, and when х=0.65, trace amounts of impurity phases AlPO4 (2θ = 26°, JCPDS 87-0289), Li4P2O7 (2θ = 21° and 27.5°, JCPDS 13-0440) and GeO2 (2θ = 26°, JCPDS 80-2474) begin to appear. Thus, when Ge4+ ions (ri = 0.53 Å) are partially substituted for practically identical in size Al3+ ions (ri = 0,535 Å) [14, 24-27] substitutional solid solutions are formed in the case of 0.15≤х≤0.5, which agrees with literature data [14, 15, 28] and confirms the fact that all the Al is incorporated into the structure. When х=0.65, the saturation point for Al is reached, and aluminum-containing impurity phases start to form. Further information about the impurity phases was collected using Raman spectroscopy. GeO2 and AlPO4 are dielectric phases, and even low concentrations of these impurities are expected to have a negative effect on the conductivity of glass-ceramics (see Section 3.4). 
The parameters and volume of the NASICON-type unit cell have been calculated for Li1+xAlxGe2–x(PO4)3 of various compositions using the least squares method (hkl) and 2θ, which are given in Fig. 5. They are in good agreement with literature data for LiGe2(PO4)3 [26, 28] and confirm the NASICON-type structure of the obtained crystal phase. When Ge4+ ions are substituted for Al3+ and Li+ ions, the a parameter of the cell remains almost constant within the resolution (Fig. 5), because the ionic radii of Al3+ (0.535 Å) and Ge4+ (0.530 Å) are rather similar in octahedral coordination. However, the c parameter and the cell volume undergo a more considerable increase. One can notice a similar behavior comparing the evolution of the parameter c and the cell volume V (Fig. 5) with the evolution of lithium content (Table 1). Thus, Li+ ions are directly responsible for the expansion of the unit cell. These results correlate with the earlier works studying LAGP [26, 28, 29]. The paper [27] reports that the unit cell of LAGP glass-ceramics expands when lithium ions start occupying not only M1, but also M2 positions, which can be observed with the growth of x. Thus, the growth of x content from 0 to 0.65 is accompanied with an increase in the size of the “bottleneck”. 
Raman spectroscopy is a useful method for refining the phase composition of solid electrolytes and exploring their molecular structure. Fig. 6 contains Raman spectra for glass-ceramics of Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 series with 0≤х≤0.65, and also the spectrum for pure GeO2. The frequency distribution of the bands on the spectra for Al-doped and LiGe2(PO4)3 samples confirms that solid electrolytes with NASICON-type structure have been synthesized [30, 31]. The Raman spectroscopy data indicate that LiGe2(PO4)3 undoped by aluminum (х=0) is a two-phase system and consists of the main phase with the NASICON-type structure and the GeO2 impurity, because the spectra for various regions differ in the presence and/or intensity of the bands at 972, 958, 880, 857 and 516 cm-1, corresponding to GeO2 vibrations [32, 33]. The obtained results are in good agreement with the XRD data, Fig. 4. 
As a rule, the bands on the spectra for complex germanium phosphates (for compounds of this kind) with the NASICON-type structure in the high-frequency region (900–1200 cm-1) are ascribed to the valence vibrations of PO4 tetrahedra, the bands in the medium-frequency region (500–800 cm-1) are attributed to asymmetric deformation vibrations, and the ones in the low-frequency region (300–500 cm-1) – to the symmetric deformation vibrations of the phosphate structural units [30, 34]. However, as one can see from Fig. 6, the bands on the Raman spectra in the region of 1000–150 cm-1 mostly correspond to the vibrations of germanate units, not of the phosphate ones, as was previously reported [30, 34]. Thus, the most intense GeO2 band in 440 cm-1 region is induced by the symmetrical vibrations of the Ge–O–Ge bond [32, 33]. In complex lithium germanium phosphates there is a shift of the band at 443 cm-1 (GeO2) into the high-frequency region to 454 cm-1 (LiGe2(PO4)3), which is related to the increase of Ge interatomic distances accompanying the formation of new Ge–O–P bonds. The bands at 972, 958, 880, 857 and 516 cm-1 may be induced by Ge–O vibrations in the GeO4 tetrahedra. The absence of such bands on the spectra for single-phase NASICON-based materials can be explained by the fact that Ge4+ ions are only in octahedral coordination. The appearance of new bands at 662, 547 and 490 cm-1 may be induced by the Ge–O–P bonds. The vibration bands in 1200–1000 cm-1 region in the NASICON structure are related to symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of PO4 tetrahedra [35, 36], which provide the bond between MO6 octahedra. As one can see from Fig. 6, the peaks on the LiGe2(PO4)3 spectrum are narrow and intense. With the addition of Al3+ ions, the intensity and the quantity of the bands decrease, and they become broader. The broadening of the peaks with the increase of the x content indicates an increased disordering of the NASICON structure. This may be related either to the influence of Al3+ or to the additional Li+ when Ge4+ ions are replaced in the structure, and also to the “bottleneck” size. The growth of the dopant content is accompanied by the proportional increase in the number of Al–O bonds compared to Ge–O bonds. Since Al3+ and Ge4+ ions have a different degree of polarization, Ge–O–P and Al–O–P bonds have a considerable influence on the vibrations of P–O bond in the phosphate tetrahedra, whose dependence we can see on the Raman spectra. The broadening of the Raman peaks may also be connected with the origin of new Li–O bonds. It is known that when х=0, all Li+ ions occupy M1 positions, but when х>0, part of Li+ ions occupy М2 positions, which leads to the appearance of new Li–O bonds. In their turn, the Li–O bonds influence the P–O bonds, which are reflected in the broadening of these bands on the Raman spectra. Thus, when the content of x increases, the “bottleneck” widens. These patterns correlate with the increase of the c parameter in the unit cell, Fig. 5. Additional peaks at 1050 and 736 cm-1, corresponding to the valence vibrations of P–O- and P–O–P, respectively, in pyrophosphate groups (P2O74-) [37-39] were found for х=0.65. Such bands indicate the presence of the Li4P2O7 impurity phase, trace amounts of which have also been detected by XRD. 
The solid electrolyte for lithium batteries should have not only high lithium-ion conductivity, but also a dense and homogenous microstructure in order to avoid a short circuit due to lithium leakage when the battery is in use. In comparison with polycrystalline ceramics, glass-ceramics demonstrates a denser microstructure [6]. 
As can be seen from the micrographs, Fig. 7, the microstructure of the glass-ceramics is compact and depends a lot on the content of Al2O3. Besides, the grains are rather densely packed. An increase in the content of the dopant x in the glass-ceramic samples leads to a change in the size and shape of the crystallites. When x=0, the sample is composed of two phases, i.e., regular cubic crystallites of the main phase of NASICON-type structured LiGe2(PO4)3 and small flake-like particles which supposedly are GeO2. With the addition of Al3+ ions, the shape of the crystallites becomes more spherical. The composition is single-phase when x=0.5, and when x=0.65, one starts noticing regions with particles of varying morphology, different in their chemical composition, Fig. 8. The differences in chemical compositions of the precipitated crystalline phases are associated with the formation of aluminum-containing impurity phases at х=0.65, when the saturation point of Al is reached (see Section 3.2). 
Table 1 contains density values for glass-ceramics of Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 series. The density of the glass-ceramic samples decreases with the increase in the content of the dopant (x). The relative densities of the samples (ρrel) calculated only for the single-phase compositions with 0.3≤х≤0.5 were ~90%, Table 1. Earlier we obtained a glass-ceramic electrolyte Li1.6Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 with a higher density – 3.38 g·cm-3 [18], which may have been related to excess Li or to the fact that the sample was not single-phase. Furthermore, in the works [17, 40] it was shown that adding a small amount of excess Li2O leads to an increase in the density of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic electrolyte, but, at the same time, one observes the appearance of trace amounts of GeO2 impurity. 
The electrical properties of the samples were measured at different temperatures, and the impedance spectra for the glass-ceramics with different content of the dopant x at 21 °C are shown in Fig. 9. The impedance spectra of such materials consist of two semicircles and a tail at low frequencies. The first semicircle, originating at the central point of coordinates, corresponds to the bulk resistance (Rb), the second semicircle corresponds to the grain boundary resistance (Rgb) [41-43], and the low-frequency tail is due to electrode polarization, i.e., blocking of Li+ ions at the metal electrodes, which is confirmed in [44]. The impedance spectra were fitted to an equivalent circuit consisting of Rb-Rgb(CPEgb)-CPEel chains in ZView software (version 2.70), where CPEgb and CPEel are constant phase elements of the grain boundaries and the electrode, respectively. A similar equivalent circuit was applied in the works [30, 45]. Grain boundary capacitance (Cgb) and electrode capacitance (Cel) were calculated via the corresponding CPE. For all the investigated conductors Cgb is ~10-9 F, which correlates with the grain boundary capacitance of other solid electrolytes and corresponds to the processes at grain boundaries [17, 30, 46, 47], and Cel is 10-7 F, which corresponds to electrode/sample contacts and is characteristic of blocking electrodes [30]. Since metal Ga-Ag electrodes are not a source of lithium, the polarization tail is clearly visible on the impedance spectra, Fig. 9. The obtained values confirm the correctness of the equivalent circuit choice. The relaxation frequency on the impedance plot corresponds to 2·105 Hz when x=0.3 (Fig. 9), which is characteristic of the NASICON-type phase at room temperature [29]. Since it is impossible to properly determine the bulk resistance (Rb) for all the compositions at temperatures above RT, it was decided to determine total resistance (Rtot) of the samples and, taking into account their geometry, the specific total conductivity (σtot), Table 1. 
Fig. 10 contains Arrhenius plots of total conductivity for Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 glass-ceramics. All the plots for 0≤х≤0.65 obey the Arrhenius equation, which does not presuppose any change in the structure or any phase transitions over the investigated temperature range. The activation energy for conduction (Ea) of solid electrolytes was calculated from the temperature dependences of total conductivity according to the Arrhenius equation: 
The total conductivity of glass-ceramic electrolytes at 25 °C grows from 2.25·10-8 S·cm-1 to 5.03·10-4 S·cm-1 with the growth of x content from 0 to 0.5, respectively. At the same time, Ea expectedly decreases from 0.59 eV (x=0) to 0.36 eV (x=0.5). This may be connected with the increase of Li+ migration channels due to structural disordering (see Section 3.2), and also with an increase in the concentration of mobile lithium ions when Ge4+ is substituted for Al3+ and Li+, Table. 1. With the further growth of x to 0.65, the conductivity goes down to 3.99·10-4 S·cm-1, and Ea rises to 0.37 eV due to the appearance of impurity phases detected by XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM analysis (Figs. 4, 6, 8) and also due to the increased porosity of the samples, Table. 1. The majority of works report synthesizing non-single-phase LAGP glass-ceramics owing to: 1) varying nominal chemical composition (excess of Li2O due to volatility) [18, 23], 2) material of the crucible during synthesis (Pt in our case and Al2O3 in [48]), 3) high crystallization temperatures (>820 °C) leading to the decomposition of Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 phase [49]. We compared the obtained conductivity values with single-phase glass-ceramics synthesized in the works [41, 25]. Thus, the total lithium ion conductivity for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramics at room temperature achieved in the present work, 5.03·10-4 S·cm-1, exceeds the earlier reported values for single-phase glass-ceramics of a similar composition: 4·10-4 S·cm-1 [14], 2.4·10-4 S·cm-1 [41], 7.6·10-5 S·cm-1 [25], which is due to the optimized conditions of synthesis, and it is also higher than 1.3 10-4 S·cm-1 conductivity reported for single-phase ceramics of Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 composition [50]. 
The DC polarization study at 25 °C with Au acting as blocking electrodes was carried out to estimate the contribution of the electronic conductivity to the total ionic conductivity of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolyte, Fig. 11. The initial value of the current (I0) is around 2.4 μA, which shows a typical exponential decay with the measurement time. As lithium ions are blocked by Au electrode, only the electronic charge carriers contribute to the steady-state current (ISS ~ 0.016 μA). Ionic transference number, defined as tionic = 1 - (ISS/I0), is found to be close to 0.99. It is close to 1, which indicates that the investigated material is an ionic conductor and can potentially be used as the solid electrolyte for all-solid state lithium and lithium-ion batteries. The calculated value of electron conductivity of the sample at x=0.5 is 4 × 10-9 S cm-1 at 25 °C, which is negligible with respect to the total conductivity – 5.03 × 10-4 S cm-1, proving the ion-conductive nature of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid electrolyte. 
In summary, fast conducting NASICON-type electrolytes of the Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 family with different dopant contents were successfully obtained via glass–ceramic route from monolithic glass by optimizing the synthesis design. The chemical substitution of Ge4+ by Al3+ and Li+ led to the increase in the parameters and unit cell volume, which is associated with an increase in the channel for Li+ migration due to structural disorder. It was found that glass-ceramics are single-phase when 0.3≤x≤0.5, and impurity phases such as Li4P2O7, AlPO4, and GeO2 appear when x=0.65, which have the negative effect on Li+ conductivity. It was shown that the highest lithium-ion conductivity is achieved for glass-ceramics of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 composition crystallized at 820 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min-1, which is 5.03·10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C, while the conductivity of undoped LiGe2(PO4)3 is 2.25·10-8 S cm-1 under similar conditions. Activation energy was found to decrease from 0.59 eV for LiGe2(PO4)3 to 0.36 eV for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. Transference number close to 1 confirmed the ionic nature of the conductivity for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. The results presented here signify the importance of the crystallization parameters in improving the room temperature ionic conductivity of the solid electrolytes based on Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3.
