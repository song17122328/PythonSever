Li1.Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4P3O12 solid electrolyte materials are prepared by mechanochemical milling method followed by  heat treatment at five temperatures that are 550 oC, 650 oC, 750 oC, 850 oC and 950 oC  for 8 h. X-ray diffraction is used  to determine the  crystallographic phases while scanning electron  microscope and energy dispersive X-ray are used to  study morphological properties and elemental compositions respectively. The conductivities of the pellets are determined  using  AC  impedance  spectroscopy.  Substitution  of  Aluminium  in  LiSn2P3O12  system  results in  enhancement  of  room  temperature  ionic  conductivity  up  to  one  orders  of  magnitude  compared  to  the  unsubstituted  LiSn2P3O12  system.  Furthermore, the sample with x= 0.  Furthermore, the sample with x= 0.4 shows higher ionic conductivity. This sample exhibits bulk conductivity of 10-6 S  cm-1. This sample exhibits bulk conductivity of 10-6 S  cm-1. This is attributed to increase in the number of conducting pathways due to an increase in crystallite homogeneity.  

This  sample  is  also  structurally  stable  toward  temperature  and  thus  suitable  for  thermal  electrochemical  device  application.

Recently,  scientists  and  engineers  have  invested      huge  amount  of  money  and  effort  into  searching  and  developing  methods  in  reducing  worlds’  energy  consumption.  The  research  on  finding  the  alternative  energy  resources are still on-going around the world. Batteries are other alternative devices to restore these energies.  In this  instant,  rechargeable  batteries  are  preferred  as  it  is  capable  of  charging  and  discharging  multiple  times,  thus  eliminated  the  need  of  purchasing  new  batteries,  [1].  This  new  invention  of  lithium  ion  cells  comprises  of  two  electrodes   a  positive  anode  and  a  negative  cathode.    These  electrolytes  facilitate  the  transfer  of  lithium  ions  between electrodes, [2]. There are two types of electrolytes use in lithium ion batteries that are liquid electrolyte and  solid electrolyte. In this work, solid electrolyte is more preferred due to advantage of spillage free of electrolyte.

Due to the stability issue of this compound which can cause this compound are easilyLiSn2(PO4)3  is  one  of  the  lithium  ion  conducting  glass  ceramics  system  that  is  widely  being  studied  as  solid  electrolyte.  Martinez-Juarez  et  al.  [3]  and  Lazarraga  et  al.[4]  have  reported  that  LiSn2(PO4)3  has  a  low  ionicbroken due to phase change phenomena. Modified LiSn2P3O12 will be synthesized in order to improve its structure  stability  and  also  its  conductivity  performance.  These  will  be  done  by  substituting  of  Sn  with  Al  to  form  Li1.  These  will  be  done  by  substituting  of  Sn  with  Al  to  form  Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4P3O12.4P3O12.

X-ray  diffraction  from  PANalytical  Xpert  Pro  with  Cu  Kα  radiation  is  used  to  determine  the  crystallographic  phases  while  scanning  electron  microscope,  JEOL  JSM-7600F  integarated  with  energy  dispersive  X-ray,  Oxford  INCA X-Max 51-XMX 0021  are used to study morphological properties and elemental compositions respectively.  The conductivities of the pellets are determined using AC impedance spectroscopy from Solartron.

Figure 1 shows the XRD results, when the Li1.Figure 1 shows the XRD results, when the Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3.4(PO4)3. Pure and single phase Li1. Pure and single phase Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3 are  successfully  obtained  at  650  oC,  850  oC  and  950  oC  except  for  sintering  temperature  of  750  oC.  This  trend  and  phenomena is still cannot be explained why this samples pure for other sintering temperatures but not at 750  oC.  Further  studies  on  the  crystal  structure  such  as  the  cell  parameter  and  cell  volume  were  done  by  using  Rietveld  Refinement  method.  Rietveld  refinements  are  done  using  the  structural  ICSD  reference  83831.  Rietveld  refinements  are  done  using  the  structural  ICSD  reference  83831.  Crystallographic  parameters listed in Table 1 are obtained from Rietveld refinements of the XRD datasets (shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c)).

This may due to the ionic radius of Al3+ (0. This may due to the ionic radius of Al3+ (0.57 Å) is smaller than Sn4+ (0.57 Å) is smaller than Sn4+ (0.65 Å). When  the ionic radius of the substituent element is smaller than existing element, this cause the cell parameter and the cell  volume decrease.  As referring to the  trend of the cell parameter  with sintering temperature, it  is  found  when  the  sintering temperatures increase the cell parameter decrease. This is maybe because when the samples are sintered at  higher temperature, the air trapped in the cell or particles are released out and allow the cell to be more closed to  each other and this will make the inter-atom force become stronger to attract each other and make the cell parameter  and the cell volume to decrease.

Next characterization used to study these compounds is a morphological study. For this purpose, SEM are used  to identify the morphology of Li1. For this purpose, SEM are used  to identify the morphology of Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3 compound at different sintering time and different stoichiometry.   Figure 5.   Figure 5.3 shows the micrograph of samples at different sintering temperature.

There  are  no  trends  in  the  particle  size  with  sintering  temperature  if  comparing  for  all  samples.  However,  for  each  stoichiometry, it seems like the crystallite size was increased with increasing temperature. It can be seen that the  particles is quite homogeneous with more or less the crystallite is build up from almost single particle while for the  other samples or other aluminium ratios, it can be seen that there are a small particles that bounded together to form  large crystal.

In order to confirm the stoichiometric ratio for each elements in the Li1+xAlxSn2-x(PO4)3 compound, EDX analysis  was  done.  The  analysis  was  done  at  a  few  spots  and  the  average  of  atomic  percentage  was  calculated.  Since  Li1.  Since  Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3 shows the most pure compound compare to other stoichiometry, so the EDX analysis was done  on this samples. The average value of atomic percentage for each element is listed in Table 2. The average value of atomic percentage for each element is listed in Table 2. All of the sintered  samples have a quite similar atomic percentage values with those calculated atomic percentage (theory).The ratio ofSn+Al:P  is  equivalent  with  the  stoichiometric  ratio,  2:3.The ratio ofSn+Al:P  is  equivalent  with  the  stoichiometric  ratio,  2:3.  This  confirms  the  formation  of  Li1.  This  confirms  the  formation  of  Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3   compound in the right ratios for charge neutrality.

From the EDX results, it shows that all pure  Li1.From the EDX results, it shows that all pure  Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3 contain the right ratio of Sn:P:Al. However,  base on XRD results Li1. However,  base on XRD results Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3 that sintered at 750 oC are not pure. The EDX results indicated and prove  that  the  Li1. The EDX results indicated and prove  that  the  Li1.6Al0.6Al0.6Sn1.6Sn1.4(PO4)3  with  impurity  has  more  Sn  which  can  implies  the  impurity  is  the  SnO2  that  is  not  reacted. The EDX analysis also was done on the other samples with other stoichiometry. The results also shows the  quite similar behaviour as Li1.

This  value  is  found  higher  than  pure  LiSn2(PO4)3  by  magnitude  order  of  4.  This  value  is  found  higher  than  pure  LiSn2(PO4)3  by  magnitude  order  of  4.  This  is  attributed to increase in the number of conducting pathways due to an increase in crystallite homogeneity. There is  sigmoidal  trend  of  conductivity  with  temperatures.  Higher  sintering  temperature  does  not  give  better  electrical  performance.
