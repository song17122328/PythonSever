Chlorine gas is used in large quantities for industrial processes. Its emission has become a serious problem, causing air pollution and acid rain in recent years. The detection and regulation of Cl2 gas are urgent concerns.

Potentiometric  gas  sensors  using  solid  electrolytes  have  been shown  to  be  well  suited  to  the  continuous  and  rapid  detection  of gases. Furthermore, their structures can be more compact and less expensive than that of other detection methods. A sensor using an O22 ion conductor (stabilized zirconia) has already been commercialized for the determination of the O2 content in automobile exhausts  for  controlling  the  air/fuel  ratio.1 It  has  been  demonstrated that  the  use  of  alkali  ion  conductors  allows  the  detection  of  SOx, NOx, and  CO2.2-7 The  development  of  solid-state  sensors  able  to measure the Cl2 exhaust gas concentration is extremely appealing. Up to now, Ag1-b-alumina,8 MgO-stabilized zirconia,9 and chloride Cl2 ionic  conductors  (such  as  the  0.97PbCl2-0.03KCl  and  the 0.97BaCl2-0.03KCl  systems)10-15 have  been  reported  as  materials for Cl2 gas sensors. However, the response of a sensor using Ag1-balumina  is  very  slow  even  for  high  Cl2 gas  concentrations.  In  the case  of  the  stabilized  zirconia, the  electromotive  force  (EMF)  is influenced  by  the  concentration  of  O2 gas.  The  gas  sensors  using chlorides cannot detect Cl2 at concentrations lower than 10 ppm due to  their  poor  sinterability  and  poor  stability  at  high  temperatures. Stable alkaline chlorides such as NaCl and KCl show poor ionic conductivity  that  hinders  their  use  as  solid  electrolytes.  We  briefly reported that gas sensors using a highly dense Na1 ionic conducting ceramic with a stable NaCl-containing electrode are suitable for the detection of low Cl2 concentrations.16

In  this  study, a  composite  Na1 conductor  of  polycrystalline NASICON and glassy Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2 (40 wt %) with a RuO2NaCl measuring electrode was used for a potentiometric Cl2 gas sensor and the reaction at the measuring electrode was investigated.

alcohol (PVA) solution was added to the dried powders as a binder for pressing. The mixture was pressed into a pellet at 1000 kg/cm2 and then sintered at 10508C for 2 h.

Characterization  of  solid  electrolyte.—The  surfaces  of  the  sintered pellet were polished with an 800 grade emery paper and then Au was sputtered on both surfaces to form electrodes using an ion coater. The electrical conductivity was measured by the complex impedance method  (100-10  M  Hz)  using  a  model  4194A  impedance  analyzer from the Hewlett-Packard Co. The pellet was heated to 673 K in dried flowing N2 gas to eliminate the adsorbed water and then the conductivity  measurements  were  carried  out  in  the  same  atmosphere. The surface chemical analysis of the samples was done using X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS, model  XPS1600E, Perkin-Elmer, using a Mg Ka excitation source) measurements. The binding energy was referenced to the C1s photoemission line at 284.5 eV.

EMF measurement.—RuO2 powder (99.9%) as a reference electrode was painted on one surface using methanol. The dried mixture (1:1) of RuO2 and NaCl was painted on the opposite side as a measuring electrode using butyl acetate. This painted disk was fixed at the end of an alumina tube with an inorganic adhesive (Fig. 1). The prepared element was set in a quartz chamber (chamber volume 20 mL). To obtain several concentrations of air balanced Cl2 gas, a mixture (80:20) of 11.0 ppm Cl2 gas (diluted with N2) and pure O2 gas was diluted with artificial air (CO <1 ppm, CO2 <2 ppm, HCl <1 ppm,

Preparation  of  composite  solid  electrolyte.—Stoichiometric materials of Na2CO3 (99.98%), ZrO2 (99.9%), SiO2 (99.99%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (>99%) were mixed in an agate mortar and then heated  at  9008C  for  2  h  in  a  platinum  crucible  for  the  preparation  of NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12). The heated material was ground into a fine powder using a ballmill for 2 h in a wet process with methanol. The  dried  powder  was  reheated  at  9008C  for  2  h  and  then  ground again using the ballmill method for 4 h. On the other hand, sodium aluminosilicate  glass, Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2, was  prepared  from reagent grade Na2CO3, Al2O3, and SiO2 powders. The mixtures were ballmilled with ethanol, then the dried powder was calcined in air for 4 h at 9008C. The 100:40 ratio of NASICON and Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2 was mixed by ballmilling for 2 h. A proper amount of 3% polyvinyl

and H2O <10 ppm), which was then introduced to the sensing electrode  side.  For  the  reference  electrode, dry  air  was  introduced  at  a flow rate of 100 mL/min. The EMF of the sensor was measured with a digital electrometer having an internal resistance >1013 V.

Composite solid electrolyte.—In the case of pure NASICON, we could not obtain highly dense disks even at high sintering temperatures. The mechanical strength and the densification were improved by the addition (40%) of the Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2 glass. An X-ray diffraction analysis for the composite samples showed the presence of the  NASICON  phase  with  ZrO2 peaks  of  small  intensity.  Figure  2 shows the surface microstructure for the composite sample. The surface  of  the  sample  with  the  glass  is  continuously  smooth  and  nonporous. The added glassy phase would melt at elevated temperature and the liquid phase acts to improve sinterability. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the sT value for the solid electrolytes. The conductivity at 4008C decreased about one order of magnitude by the

glass  addition, because  the  Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2 glass  has  poor  Na1 ionic  conductivity.  However, the  activation  energy  for  the  Na1 ion migration is almost the same value for both samples. The Na1 ions would  mainly  migrate  through  the  NASICON  phases.  This  dense composite  sample  had  a  conductivity  large  enough  to  be  used  as  a solid electrolyte for gas sensors.

Figure 4 shows the typical sensing characteristics at 450 and 5508C (flow rate is 100 mL/min) for the sensor probe. Upon changing the Cl2 gas concentration, the EMF quickly changed and a steady state value was observed at 450 and 5508C. The hysteresis of the EMF value for increasing and decreasing Cl2 gas concentrations was within 10 mV. The sensor EMF had a large difference between ambient air and 1.1 ppm Cl2 gas. Although we have not tried below a 1.0 ppm Cl2 gas concentration, this sensor will detect sub-ppm levels of Cl2 gas. The response time, i.e., the raise and recovery times, are very fast for high Cl2 gas concentrations, but it is prolonged for low Cl2 gas concentrations.

Figure 7 shows the relationship between the 70% response time and operating temperature when gas flow rate is infinity. The EMF was  determined  by  extrapolated  1/F 5 0  values  in  Fig.  6.  The response time at 1/F 5 0 showed high values for the measurement at 4008C and decreased at higher temperatures. Table I shows the elemental contents on the surface of the solid electrolyte disks before and after the 100 ppm Cl2 gas flow for 1 h at elevated temperature. For this measurement, the fresh disk samples obtained by the sintering were heated to selected temperatures in N2, and held in a 100 ppm Cl2 gas flow for 1 h, then cooled in a N2 atmosphere. The elemental content on the surface for the heated samples was determined by XPS whose detectable depth is three to four layers from the top of the surface. The Cl element on the disk surface existed after the 100 ppm Cl2 gas  flow  for  all  the  examined  samples.  The  high  Cl  content  was detected  for  the  samples  heated  at  low  temperature.  The  binding energy for Cl2p3/2 obtained by XPS was around 198.5 eV which was very  close  to  that  for  the  Cl2 ion.  In  addition, the  Na  content  was increased  with  the  increasing  Cl  content  in  Table I.  These  results mean  that  NaCl  was  formed  by  the  reaction  between  Cl2 gas  and Na2O on the solid electrolyte at low temperature

which is the same as the total Reaction 3 of this sensor. The Gibbs free energy for Reaction 6 is 2371 kJ/mol at 4008C.17 In the case of a low operating temperature of 4008C, the response time hardly depended on the gas flow rate (Fig. 6a) and the electron number n 5 1.1 is lower than the theoretical n 5 2.0 (Fig. 5). For high temperatures, the response time strongly deviated from zero at 1/F 5 0 in the low  Cl2 gas  concentration  region  (Fig.  6b  and  c)  and  the  electron number was less than 2.0 (Fig. 5). These results might be attributed to the NaCl formation as a side reaction. This suggestion means that Reaction 1 on the measuring electrode was influenced by the side reaction as a ratio of the side/normal Reaction. However, the EMF showed a constant value with the change in Cl2 gas concentration at 3508C. This behavior is difficult to explain only by the side reaction. The Cl2 reduction step in Reaction 1 on the RuO2 electrode as below

where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday constant, n is the electron number for the reaction, and PCl2 is the concentration of Cl2. The O2 partial pressure on the reference electrode and the activity of Na2O and NaCl seems to be constant. Equation 4 can be modified to

EMF 5 Eo 1 (RT/nF) ln [PCl2]

Figure 5 shows the Cl2 concentration dependence of the EMF at 350-5508C in air. For the measurement at 3508C, we could not obtain an  EMF  change.  The  electron  number  n is  1.1  at  4008C  and  increased to 1.4-1.6 at higher temperatures. However, these n values are lower than the theoretical two-electron reaction.

Effect  of  gas  flow  rate.—The  relationship  between  the  70%  response  time  (R)  and  reciprocal  of  the  flow  rate  (1/F)  is  plotted  in Fig. 6. This R to 1/F relation is very useful for discussing the reaction on the measuring electrode.15 When the response time is only limited by the gas exchange in the test chamber, the response time is proportional to the reciprocal flow rate and is negligible for 1/F 5 0 (i.e., F 5 ‘). In addition, the response time should be independent of the gas  concentration.  In  the  case  of  the  measurement  at  4008C, the

Chlorine-containing exhaust gases have become a serious problem, because they cause air pollution and acid rains. A dense composite  Na1 conducting  ceramic  using  polycrystalline  NASICON mixed with a glassy Na2O-Al2O3-4SiO2 (40 wt %) was used in the Cl2 gas sensor. The sensor probe using the composite electrolyte and a RuO2 1 NaCl (1:1) measuring electrode gave rapid EMF changes even for a sub-ppm level of Cl2 gas (below 10 ppm). This type of sensor will detect Cl2 gas concentrations below 1.0 ppm. In addition, the sensor EMF response was on slightly influenced by the O2 and CO2 gas concentration changes. However, a side reaction between the Cl2 gas and Na2O occurs on the surface of the solid electrolyte. For this composite electrolyte, large amount of elemental Na is contained and it would accelerate the side reaction. One of the methods to depress the side reaction might be the utilization of the solid electrolyte containing a small amount of elemental Na.
