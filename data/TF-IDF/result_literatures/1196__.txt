A  conventional  solid-state  synthetic  route  was  used  to  prepare  a  mixed conducting double perovskite-type Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6-δ  (BCNF66).  FTIR  study  was  performed  to  confirm  the  chemical  stability  under  1%  CO2,  whereas  the  cross-sectional  SEM  image  was  employed  to  investigate  the  morphology  of  the  sensor.  A  comparative  study  on  BCNF66  with  and  without  CO2  in  dry  synthetic air along with O2 effect was carried out. The significant  effect  of  O2  was  observed  when  CO2  was  passed  through  the  sensor in N2. The O2 in dry synthetic air was found to stabilize the  CO2  sensor  response  (current).  Furthermore,  the  addition  of  ppm  level of CO2 in dry synthetic air increased the response.   

Sensors based on solid-state electrolytes are favorably utilized for the detection of various  gaseous species because of their high selectivity characteristics. So far,  only few solidstate  electrolyte  based  sensors  have  been  practically  employed.  For  example,  stabilized  zirconia has been successfully used in the fields  of steel industries, combustion control  and automobiles as a reliable O2 sensor. In case of CO2, measuring its concentration in  atmosphere  and  several  industrial  processes  is  highly  desirable  because  of  its  direct  impact on climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), a major solution to cope  with  these  global  warming  issues,  also  requires  online  gas  detecting  devices  that  could  sustain in presence of various gases at high temperatures (1-3). Furthermore, the real-time  online  monitoring  of  the  gaseous  composition  in  the  industrial  processes  has  become  essential  for  reducing  the  emissions  and  improving  its  efficiency  (4).  Solid-state  electrochemical sensors are well suited in harsh and aggressive conditions  such as high  temperatures  and  high  pressures  (5,  6).  Fast  alkali  ion-conducting  materials  and  semiconducting materials have been developed to measure the CO2 (1, 7-11). However,  several  critical  issues  such  as  low  chemical  stability  at  high  temperature,  poor  performance  in  humid  conditions  and  low  selectivity  due  to  influences  by  other  gases  have remained (12, 13).

Recently,  we  reported  double  perovskite-based  mixed  ion  and  electron  conductor  (MIEC),  Ba2Ca0.66Nb1.34-xFexO6-δ  (BCNF),  to  overcome  the  existing  problems  in  solidstate electrochemical CO2 sensors (14). The mixed conducting Fe-doped BCNF exhibited  good  CO2  sensing  performance,  for  example,  Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6-δ  (BCNF66)  showed high sensitivity and fast response with good selectivity in presence of SO2 (15).  For the preparation of  gas mixture, however, CO2 was diluted with dry synthetic  air at  different  ratios.  In  general,  researchers  have  carried  out  numerous  experiments  in  presence  of  O2  because  of  its  significant  role  in  chemical  reactions  during  sensing  measurements (2, 16). In our earlier work, the exact role of O2 in CO2 sensors was not  studied. Therefore, in this study, we have tested role of O2 on CO2 sensing properties of  BCNF66.  

BCNF66  was  prepared  by  a  conventional  ceramic  method  using  stoichiometric  amounts  of  Ba(NO3)2  (99+%,  Alfa  Aesar),  CaCO3,  (99%  Fisher  Scientific  Company),   Nb2O5 (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and  Fe2O3 (99+%, Alfa Aesar). The reactant powders were  mixed and ball-milled (Pulverisette Fritsch, Germany) with 2-propanol for 6 h at 200 rpm  using zirconia balls with reversed rotation every  30 mins.  The mixture was dried in an  oven (~80  oC) and ground into fine powder using agate mortar and pestle. The powder  was then calcined at 1000 oC in air for 12 h and mixed again for 6 h using ball-mill. Thus,  the obtained fine powder was isotactically pressed into pellets (10 mm in diameter, 1 mm  in thickness) followed by sintering at 1350 oC for 24 h. The sintered pellets were used for  the sensor studies. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Bruker D8 Advance, CuKa; 40 kV;  40 mA) was used to confirm the phase formation (14).    

A Varian 7000 FTIR spectrometer was employed for the chemical stability test under  the CO2 atmosphere.  1% CO2 balanced in dry synthetic air was purged into the powdered  sample kept in an alumina boat, which was later inserted inside a  gas-tight quartz tube  followed by heating the furnace at 700 oC for 72 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)  (Philips XL30 SEM) was used to study the microstructure of the BCNF66 pellet.    Sensing Cell Fabrication              For the fabrication of the sensing cell, a porous Au-layer was coated on both sides of  BCNF66 pellet as current-collectors by a paint-brushing method and dried at 600  oC for  an  hour  to  remove  the  organic  binders  present  in  Au-paste.  The  Au-coated  BCNF66  pellet  was  kept  between  alumina  pellets  with  Au  wire  connected  on  each  side  of  the  BCNF66 pellet with the help of spring-loaded contact cell. The cell was heated up to 700  oC and left for at least 6 h before measuring the sensing properties.         DC measurement (Solartron, model SI 1287) was carried out by applying a constant  dc voltage of 0.1 V on BCNF66 pellet at different ppm level of CO2 gas. The gases used  for the sensing measurements were N2, O2, 3000 ppm CO2 in dry synthetic air (21% O2 in  N2) and pure CO2 (99.99%) (Praxair Inc., Canada). The amount of gas inside the cell was  handled by using the computer-controlled mass flow controllers (MCS-100 SCCM-D/5M,  5IN).  The  total  flow  rate  of  the  gas  was  maintained  at  100  sccm.  Table  I  lists  the  investigated  gas  compositions.  The  fabricated  sensor  was  kept  at  the  middle  of  tubular  furnace  inside  an  air-tight  quartz  tube.  The  measurements  were  typically  carried  out  at  700 oC.  

We have shown that BCNF66 is chemically stable under CO2 environment by employing  an  in-situ  high-temperature  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (HT-PXRD).  Cubic  single-phase  double  perovskite-type  structure  with  Fm-3m  space  group  was  further  confirmed  using  high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy  (HRTEM)  coupled  with  selected  area  electron diffraction (SAED)  (14). FTIR measurement on 1% CO2 treated BCNF66 was carried out to understand the carbonate formation in BCNF66. No absorption bands were  seen at 1750 and 2452 cm-1 for BCNF66 after CO2 treatment at 700 oC for 72 h as shown  in  Figure  1a.  In  general,  1750  cm-1  and  2452  cm-1  bands,  as  shown  for  commercial  BaCO3  in  Figure  1a,  are  specifically  assigned  to  the  ν1+  ν4  combination  mode  of  carbonate  anion,  and  hydroxyl  mode  of  hydrogen  carbonate  that  usually  forms  on  the  surface  when  exposed  to  air,  respectively  (17).  The  results  from  FTIR  suggest  that  the  BCNF66 is highly stable in 1 % CO2 at the investigated condition.   
   
A cross-sectional SEM image of BCNF66 with Au current collector layer is shown in  Figure 1b. The SEM image showed the existing pores inside BCNF66, where the closed  pore size varied from 1-6 µm in average. In addition, the formation of grains can also be  observed inside the pores with its size in the range of 1-3 µm.    

Table I shows the gas mixture employed in the sensor study. According to Table I, O2  was varied from 0.70  % (at 100 ppm CO2 level) to 10.47 % (at 1500 ppm CO2 level).  Therefore, two major sensing tests were carried out to separate the CO2 effect out from  O2  effect  in  BCNF66.  Test  1:  Mixing  N2  and  O2  without  CO2  (gas  mixture  using  first  three columns in Table I) and Test 2: Mixing N2, O2 with CO2 in ppm level. Test 2 with  CO2 showed the higher current densities comparing to Test 1 (without CO2) keeping the  flow rate constant (100 sccm) (18). This phenomenon could be due to the higher amount  of O2 present when CO2 is purged with dry synthetic air followed by conversion of O2 to  O2-. The dissociation of CO2 into CO and O2 can be expressed as:         

It seems that Fe in BCNF66 is involved in catalytic reaction, and hence, reducing the  electrical  impedance  as  it  acts  as  p-type  semiconducting  MIEC  described  by  following  expression (Eq. 2), where  Ox OV correspond  to  the  lattice  O2,    holes  and  oxide  ion  vacancies,  respectively. Further details on sensing mechanism are discussed in our previous studies  (15, 19). In Figure 2a, the response current densities for Test 1 and Test 2 are shown as  open  and  closed  symbols,  respectively.    The  observed  result  in  Figure  2a  displays  the  CO2  effect.  Both  sensing  tests  i.e.,  with  and  without  CO2  exhibit  linear  response  as  a  function  of  logarithmic  rise  in  O2  content.  Further,  the  difference  in  current  densities  between Tests 1 and 2 for each mixing ratio also increased with the increase in ppm level  of CO2 in dry synthetic air. Therefore, the difference of current densities (ΔiCO2) in Test1  (iTest1) and Test 2 (iTest2) is given by.

Interestingly, we found a linear relation between ΔiCO2 and log CO2.  

For further understanding of the role of O2 Test 3 and Test 4 were performed in the  similar environment (700 oC, 0.1V), where pure N2 was used as our base gas for dilution.  Test 3: Mixing pure N2 and 1500 ppm CO2 balanced in N2 without O2 and Test 4: Mixing  pure N2 and pure CO2 without O2 (1% CO2 in N2). For Test 3, significant changes in the  current densities were not observed. The signal to noise ratio was very low and we could  not  see  the  difference  under  the  investigated  condition.  However,  in  case  of  Test  4, significant  change  was  observed  after  purging  1%  CO2  in  N2  as  shown in  Figure  3.  In  addition, a steady-state current was not obtained in Test 4. The response quickly dropped  into  its  original  current  density  value.  Comparing  the  Test  4  result  with  Test  1  and  2,  where O2 is mixed, it can be concluded that O2 seems to stabilize the response current.  However, further research is required to understand the BCNF’s CO2 sensing behavior in  presence as well as absence of O2.    

Double  perovskite-type  Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.68Fe0.66O6-δ  (BCNF66)  has  been  prepared  by  conventional  solid-state  method  at  elevated  temperature  in  air.  FTIR  measurement  was  performed  to  confirm  BCNF66's  stability  under  CO2.  Further,  a  cross-sectional  SEM  image was taken to see the morphology after the sensor fabrication. A comparative study on the effect of O2 and CO2 was carried out on BCNF66 by purging dry synthetic air with  and without CO2 (in ppm level), where the addition of CO2 in dry synthetic air tends to  increase the response current. The presence of O2 in CO2 shows the steady state current,  while CO2 only in N2 could not achieve the equilibrium current. Future work on sensing  measurements  with  different  CO2  concentrations  and  fixed  O2  are  required  to  further  understand BNCF66’s sensing behavior with and without O2.
