Composition and lithium mobility have been analyzed in Li1+xTi2-x3+ (PO4)3 compounds (x ) 0.2 and R3+ ) Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, and In3+) by NMR and impedance spectroscopy. All of the compounds display the rhombohedral symmetry, and in all cases the trivalent cations are incorporated into the NASICON framework. From the analysis of the quadrupole constant (CQ) and spin-spin relaxation rate (T2 -1) deduced from 7Li NMR spectra of Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3, two regimes associated with local and long-range motions of lithium have been -1) as a function of identified. From the analysis of the spin-lattice relaxation rate (T1 reciprocal temperature, the residence times of lithium at structural sites have been estimated and their dependence on temperature have been analyzed. Differences in activation energy deduced from NMR (0.22 eV) and conductivity (0.28 eV) measurements are discussed in terms of correlations in lithium motion that seem to decrease at increasing temperature.
NASICON-type materials with formula LM2(PO4)3 (L ) Li, Na and M ) Ge, Ti, Sn, Hf, and Zr) are of increasing interest because of their possible application as solid electrolytes in lithium batteries, sensors, and others electrochemical devices.1-3 The usual structure of these compounds is rhombohedral, space group R3hc, but in some particular cases they also show a lowtemperature phase of lower symmetry.4-10 In both phases the framework is built up by M2(PO4)3 units in which two MO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra share oxygen atoms (Figure 1). In the rhombohedral sodium phases, Na+ cations are placed at two structural sites: (i) M1 sites surrounded by six oxygen atoms and located at inversion centers, and (ii) M2 sites with an irregular 10-fold oxygen coordination and disposed symmetrically around ternary axes. Both sites are arranged in an alternating way along the conducting channels. 
In rhombohedral lithium phases, such as LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3, the preferential occupancy of M1 sites by lithium has been pointed out from neutron diffraction (ND) experiments.11-12 When the size of the tetravalent cation increases (e.g., M ) Sn, Hf, Zr), a low-temperature triclinic phase has also been detected. In this phase, Li+ ions are placed at the midway M1/2 positions between M1 and M2 sites in a 4-fold oxygen coordination8-10 (Figure 1).
In titanium-based NASICON-type materials of Li1+xTi2-xRx(PO4)3 composition, the Li+ ion conductivity of the rhombohedral phase is greatly enhanced as Ti4+ is partially replaced by trivalent cations such as Al, Ga, Sc, and In.13 In these samples, the charge deficit is compensated by the incorporation of additional lithium in the structure. The maximum conductivity (10-2-10-3 ¿-1 cm-1) was found for the composition x  25) 0.3. In the Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 series, a decrease in the overall conductivity was observed for x > 0.3, this decrease was attributed to the formation of nonconducting phases at the grain boundaries.14 In the Li1+xTi2-xInx(PO4)3 series, the samples with x > 0.3 showed phases with structure different from the NASICON structure; these phases exhibited Li+ conductivity considerably lower than that of the NASICON-type compounds.15-18
In this work, rhombohedral Li1+xTi2-xRx(PO4)3 samples (x ) 0.2 and R3+ ) Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, In3+, and Y3+) have been prepared, and the unit-cell dimensions have been deduced from X-ray diffraction data. Distribution of octahedral R3+ cations has been followed by 31P MAS NMR technique, and occupancy of lithium sites has been studied by 7Li MAS NMR technique. The NMR and impedance techniques have been used to analyze the local and long-range motion of Li+ ions, respectively. From the results obtained with both techniques, lithium hopping mechanisms have been analyzed.
Samples were prepared by heating stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3 (g99%), TiO2 (99%), Al2O3 (99.99%), Ga2O3 (99.99%), Sc2O3 (99.999%), In2O3 (99.99%), Y2O3 (99.98%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (g99%). The reagents were previously heated at 120 °C for 10 h to remove the adsorbed water. Then they were mixed and heated in a platinum crucible at 180, 300, 500, 700, 800, 900, and 950 °C. After each treatment, the mixture was ground in an agate mortar and checked by X-ray diffraction. The samples were considered as single phases when typical X-ray peaks of the reagents and/or intermediate compounds such as pyrophosphates were not detected.
X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature with Cu KR1 radiation ( 236) ) 1.5405981 Å) in a PW-1710 Phillips diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator. Data were taken in the 10 e 2ı e 70° range with 0.02° per step, counting for 0.5 s at each step. A small amount of Si (NIST, a ) 5.430940 Å) was mixed with prepared samples to get an accurate determination of the peak positions in XRD patterns.
Impedance measurements were carried out in the temperature range 150-300 K in an Oxford Cryostat. All measurements were done under a dried nitrogen atmosphere. 7Li and 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature in a MSL-400 Bruker spectrometer (9.4 T). The frequencies used for 7Li and 31P were 155.50 and 161.97 MHz, respectively. Samples were spun at 4 and 10 kHz during 7Li and 31P signal recording. Spectra were obtained after  240)/2 pulse irradiation ( 24)4  237)s) with a recycling time of 10 s for lithium and 5 s for phosphorus. The number of scans was in the range of 40-800. 7Li and 31P chemical shift values were given relative to 1 M LiCl and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solutions. The fitting of the NMR spectra was undertaken with the Bruker WINFIT software package.19 This program allows determination of the position, line width, and intensity of the NMR components with a nonlinear least-squares iterative method; 
However, quadrupole (CQ) and asymmetry (Ł) parameters had to be deduced with a trial and error procedure. For quantitative purposes, the sum of integrated intensities of the spinning sidebands associated with each component was determined. 7Li spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) of the Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample were measured at 11 MHz in a SXP 4/100 spectrom-1 values were obtained with the  240)  244)  240)/2 eter. The T1 sequence in the range 100-450 K. Reciprocal spin-spin -1) were calculated from the full relaxation times values (T2 width at half-height (fwhh) of NMR lines. In the case of -1 was calculated as 0.6 240) times the fwhh; in Gaussian lines T2 -1 was calculated as  240) times the the case of Lorenzian lines, T2 fwhh.
For the random distribution of R3+ and Ti4+ cations, five environments for phosphorus can be formed: P(OTi)4, P(OTi)3(OR)1, P(OTi)2(OR)2, P(OTi)1(OR)3, and P(OR)4. Taking into account that the chemical shift becomes more positive when Ti4+ is replaced by R3+ cations, the four detected components have been ascribed to P(OTi)4, P(OTi)3(OR)1, P(OTi)2(OR)2, and P(OTi)1(OR)3.
From the integrated intensities of 31P NMR components, the chemical composition of the samples has been estimated. In particular, Ti4+/R3+ ratios have been calculated according to the expression.
7Li NMR (I ) 3/2) spectra of Li1.2Ti1.8R0.2(PO4)3 samples are formed by a central line (-1/2,1/2 transition) and two satellite lines (-3/2,-1/2 and 1/2,3/2 transitions). In 7Li MAS NMR spectra, the satellite transitions are modulated by the sample rotation and it gives rise to equally spaced bands separated by the spinning rate (Figure 4). The spectra were fitted with the Bruker WINFIT program, which takes into account first-order quadrupolar interactions. From this analysis, the quadrupolar constant CQ and the asymmetry parameter Ł were determined (Table 3). CQ increases as the ionic radii of trivalent cations increases. In all cases Ł is equal to zero (axial symmetry).

The angular frequency dependence of the conductivity for the Ga sample is shown in Figure 7 (top). These plots are typical for all the other samples. At 280 K, three features are observed: (i) an ill-defined dispersive regime below 102 s-1; (ii) a plateau in the frequency range 102-104 s-1, followed by a dispersive regime at around 106 s-1; and (iii) an ill-defined plateau at about 107 s-1, followed again by a dispersive regime. At lower temperatures, 150 and 200 K, the three features are shifted toward lower frequencies. The features (i), (ii), and (iii) correspond to the spike, the low-frequency arc, and the high-frequency arc, respectively, that are observed in the impedance plots (not shown). 
The capacitance associated with the high-frequency arc, and hence with the high-frequency plateau, is of 8 pF. The capacitance associated with the low-frequency arc, and hence with the low-frequency plateau, is of 1 nF. The approximate capacitance of the used cell is of 2 pF. In accordance with the capacitances found, the features (ii) and (iii) are associated with the grain boundary response and the grain interior one, respectively,22,23 i.e., with the motion of Li+ through boundary of adjacent grains and within the grains, respectively.
The three responses mentioned are also observed in the -Z¢ ¢ ( 246)) plots (Figure 7, bottom). In the former (open triangles) the ill-defined peak at low frequencies and the peak at intermediate frequencies correspond to the electrode and grain-boundary responses, respectively. The peak due to the grain interior response is not observed because of the low intensity of this peak compared to the two others. However, the grain interior response gives rise to the peak developed at high frequencies in the M¢ ¢ ( 246)) plot (open circles). In this case the grain boundary and electrode responses cannot be observed because their capacitances are much higher than that of the grain interior response.
The overall conductivity of the pellets, measured at 250 K (Table 4), is in general much lower (at least 2 orders of magnitude) than the grain interior conductivity. Only in the In-pellet, the overall conductivity similar to that of the grain interior, pointing out that the pellet has been well-sintered. These results provide evidence that the overall conductivity is, in general, dominated by the grain boundary contribution. The same effect was reported by Aono et al. in samples with similar compositions.13
The activation energy for the grain interior conductivity of most samples is similar (0.33 eV) and lower than that of the undoped sample. The lowest activation energy was found for the Al sample (0.28 eV); this result is in agreement with that reported by Aono et al.25 No correlation between activation energy and ionic radii of the trivalent cations has been found. The Al sample displays the highest conductivity at 250 K (5.5  2) 10-4 Scm-1) and the lowest activation energy (0.28 eV). In the Ga, Sc, and In samples, in which the cation size increases, the conductivity decreases from 2  2) 10-4 to 8  2) 10-6 Scm-1 and the activation energy remains constant.
Deconvolution of 31P NMR spectra has allowed the determination of the octahedral cation content for the Li1.2Ti1.8R0.2(PO4)3 compounds (see Table 2). It is observed that the amount of trivalent cations incorporated into the NASICON structure increases in the sense Ga < Sc < Al < In. With the exception of the In sample, this trend is parallel to the increase in grain interior conductivity measured. For the In sample, in which the concentration of mobile species is the highest but the conductivity is the lowest, other structures with lower conductivity could be formed;15-16 however, in our case no extra peaks have been detected in XRD patterns. The above observations suggest that compositional rather than geometrical factors are controlling the lithium mobility of these compounds. Indeed, the highest grain 4+interior conductivity is obtained in the Li1.2Ti1.8 3+(PO4)3 sample, where R3+ is the smallest cation. R0.2 Lithium Structural Sites. 
Structural sites occupied by lithium can be deduced from the analysis of the experimental second moment (¢$2) of the 7Li NMR signal recorded in static conditions at low temperature (absence of lithium motion). For that, experimental ¢$2 values have been compared with those calculated with the expression26
Below 160 K, the line width of the 7Li NMR central line ( 181) T2 -1) remains constant (Figure 6) indicating the absence of lithium motion. In the Al sample analyzed, ¢$2 has been calculated for Li placed at the M2 site ( 24)0.33 G2), at the midway M1/2 site ( 24)0.24 G2), and at the M1 site ( 24)0.13 G2). The latter is close to the experimental value ( 24)0.14 G2) measured at 160 K, confirming the preferential occupancy of M1 sites by lithium. In these sites, the contribution to ¢$2 of Li-P interaction ( 24)0.09 G2) is higher than that of the Li-Li interaction ( 24)0.04 G2) and the contribution of Li-Ti interaction is negligible. In agreement with this analysis, the quadrupole CQ constant calculated for M1 sites is similar to that deduced from NMR spectra, and the asymmetry parameter deduced (Ł ) 0) is characteristic of sites with the axial symmetry.27
In this section, lithium motion mechanisms have been analyzed in the Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample because it displays the highest grain interior conductivity and the lowest activation energy. When the sample is heated above 160 K (Figure 6), the -1) decreases, indicating that 7Li NMR line width (T2 mobility of lithium increases (spectral line narrowing). The increase in Li mobility is also responsible for the -1 observed above 160 K and the maximum increase of T1 -1 plot. In general, the detected at 260 K in the T1 -1 and T2 -1 can be detemperature dependence of T1 scribed with the modified BPP expressions.
The CQ deduced ( 24)40 kHz) is close to the value deduced from 7Li NMR spectrum at 200 K, confirming that quadrupolar interactions are responsible for Li relaxation. If dipolar interactions were the dominant contributions, the expected C constant (C  25) ¢$2) should be 2 orders of magnitude lower. -1 maximum, the residence time of lithium At the T1 ions at the occupied sites is  244)c  25)  246)0 -1  25) 1.5  2) 10-8 s ( 246)0 244) ) 1), indicating that Li mobility is very high at 260 K. In the 160-260 K range, the activation energy -1 is Em ) 0.19 eV. deduced from the linear fitting of T1 This value is considerably lower than that deduced in the undoped LiTi2(PO4)3 sample (Em ) 0.45 eV). This fact has been interpreted by assuming that the additional Li incorporated in Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 increases electrostatic Li-Li interactions and destabilizes the occupancy of M1 sites, decreasing the activation energy. 
On the other hand, these interactions increase the amount of vacant M1 sites and favor long-range Li motion along the conduction pathways. Because the activation energy deduced from conductivity (EM ) 0.28 eV) is considerably higher than that deduced from NMR (Em ) 0.19 eV), the motion of Li ions must be correlated in In Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3. Taking into account Ngai’s equation30 Em )  226)EM, which relates the activation energy of short(Em) and long-range (EM) motions, deduced from NMR and conductivity respectively, the calculated correlation factor is  226) ) Em/EM  25) 0.7.
If we assume that lithium exchanges between M1 and M1/2 sites, the observed CQ evolution could be calculated with the expression.
If we compare the activation energy corresponding to long-range motions deduced from impedance spectroscopy at low temperature (T < 260 K) and that deduced -1 NMR curve from the high-temperature branch of T1 (T > 300 K), it can be concluded that the activation energy EM decreases from 0.29 to 0.22 eV as temperature increases. The observed decrease of EM could be ascribed to a decrease of the activation energy Em or to an increase of the  226) factor. Taking into account that structural modifications are not produced at increasing temperature in the rhombohedral phase, the observed decrease on EM probably corresponds to the decrease in Li-motion correlations ( 226) increment).To ascertain this point the grain interior conductivity should be measured at higher frequencies and temperatures.
Composition and lithium mobility of Li1+xTi2-x3+ 4+ Rx (PO4)3 compounds (x ) 0.2 and R3+ ) Al3+, Ga3+, Sc3+, and In3+) have been analyzed with XRD, NMR, and impedance spectroscopy. In the analyzed samples, most of the trivalent cations are incorporated into the NASICON structure, increasing the amount of mobile lithium ions. The preferential occupancy of M1 sites by lithium was deduced from the analysis of 7Li MAS NMR spectra.
From the frequency dependence of the conductivity, the grain interior and grain boundary contributions were determined. In the case of Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3, which displays the highest grain interior conductivity, the hopping mechanism of lithium has been analyzed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy. Two different regimes, associated with local and extended motions of Li ions, were -1 and deduced from the temperature dependence of T1 -1. From the dependence of CQ versus temperature, T2 the partial occupancy of midway M1/2 sites at the expense of those of M1 was deduced at increasing temperatures. An exchange process between M1 and M1/2 sites appears when residence times at structural sites decrease below 10-8 s. A considerable decrease in the activation energy is observed as extended motions are established; this decrease has been ascribed to the increment of the correlation factor  226). The observed increment indicates a decrease of correlated motions at increasing temperatures.
