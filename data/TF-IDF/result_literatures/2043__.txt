High pressure, high temperature ac impedance measurements of a recently identiﬁed tetravalent cation (Hf4þ) conductor, HfNb(PO4)3, have been carried out at 400 8C up to 4.5 GPa and at 1.5 GPa up to 800 8C. The results show a pressure-enhanced ion conduction. At 400 8C, the conductivity increases with pressure from 1 atm value of 1.13 £ 1025 (V cm)21 effect on Hf4þ to a maximum value of 1.76 £ 1024 (V cm)21 at , 1.5 GPa. At 1.5 GPa, the ionic conductivity increases with the increasing temperature, showing two regions with different activation energies, i.e. 0.67 eV for T , 500 8C and 1.34 eV for T . 500 8C. In comparison with the 1 atm data, the application of high pressure clearly enhances the ionic conductivity by a factor of , 10 times at 300 8C, , 40 times at 600 8C and , 160 times at 700 8C. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ionic conduction in solids depends on many factors including the valence state of the migrating ions. Since the mobile ions must overcome the interaction with the framework forming the ions to produce ionic conduction, generally the higher the valence of the mobile species, the lower the ionic conductivity. For the last decade, there have been many reports on multivalent ion conduction, such as divalent cation or anion [1 – 4], as well as trivalent [5 – 7] and tetravalent cations [8]. However, ions with valence higher than 2 þ exhibit low conductivity and consequently are far from a practical application region. Therefore, searching for new candidate materials with high multivalent ion conduction, or new routes to high conductivity in highly charged ions, has become a topic of increasing interest in solid state ionics.

The framework of NASICON-type materials is rhombohedral with space group R3c and built up by M2(PO4)3 units, which consists of corner-shared MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra [9]. The NASICON structure is well known for its

tetravalent cation conducting solids [13]. In the simple model of ionic conduction, where conductivity is expected to scale with lattice volume, we expect the effects of high pressure to reduce ionic conductivity. But our earlier studies have shown that it is possible to enhance conductivity in ionically conducting materials by secondary and concomitant effects of pressure, such as structural change, including amorphization [14 – 17], and by increasing the electronic component by inducing valence changes [18]. Here we report a high pressure study of ionic conduction in HfNb(PO4)3, which shows a signiﬁcant effect of pressureenhanced tetravalent cation conductivity.

The HfNb(PO4)3 sample was synthesized using a solid state reaction from a stoichiometric mixture of Nb2O5, Hf(SO4)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 in air at high temperature. The mixture was ﬁrst preheated at 1200 8C for 12 h. The obtained powder was made into pellets and sintered at 1300 8C for 12 h. An X-ray powder diffraction pattern was taken on the product using a rotating anode Rigaku powder diffractometer with Co Ka radiation and shown to be a single phase [13].

High pressure impedance measurements of HfNb(PO4)3 in the frequency range of 10 Hz – 1 MHz at a constant temperature of 400 8C and pressure up to 4.5 GPa, and at a constant pressure of 1.5 GPa and temperature up to 800 8C, respectively, were carried out in a previously calibrated 1000 t cubic press [19], using a Solartron SI 1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer. The sample powder was compacted into a disk shape between two platinum electrodes and contained in a boron nitride capsule. High temperature was generated by Joulean heating of a cylindrical niobium foil furnace, monitored with a Pt – PtRh10% thermocouple, which was corrected for pressure, and controlled by a computerized heating system. Details of the pressure cell conﬁguration can be found elsewhere [20]. DC polarization measurements were carried out using a Keithley 197A Autoranging Microvolt DMM at a constant temperature of 400 8C and different constant pressure settings. A constant dc current was passed through the sample inside the high pressure chamber and the sample voltage was recorded as a function of time. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were taken on the samples recovered from the high pressure-temperature experiments.

The conductivity at a constant temperature of 400 8C as a function of pressure is plotted in Fig. 1. The conductivity increases with increasing pressure up to , 1.5 GPa where it reaches a maximum value of 1.76 £ 1024 (V cm)21 in

the ac conductivity at comparison with the 1 atm value of 1.13 £ 1025 (V cm)21 [13]. Conductivity then decreases with further increase of pressure to a maximum pressure of 4.5 GPa in this study. The conductivity at high pressure remains higher than the 1 atm value over the range of pressure investigated. Following-up on the maximum in conductivity at , 1.5 GPa, this pressure was measured on increasing temperature and is shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with the 1 atm data [13], the application of high pressure clearly enhances the ionic conductivity by , 10 times at 300 8C, , 40 times at 600 8C, and , 160 times at 700 8C. For the region of temperatures below 500 8C, the two data sets are, to each other. Activation energy of conduction was obtained by linear ﬁtting and yielded 0.67 eV for the high pressure and 0.63 eV for 1 atm data, respectively. The conductivity increases with increasing temperature above 500 8C, but the activation energy is doubled to 1.34 eV.

to the eye, parallel In the NASICON-type structure compounds, there are two different interstitial sites, M1 and M2. The mobile cations occupy M1 sites and the M2 sites are almost unoccupied at room temperature. The mechanism of ionic conduction in the NASICON-type structure is from jumping of mobile ions between M1 and M2 sites through the threedimensional channels [2,9]. Doping with different valent ions or increasing temperature may induce more occupied M2 sites in this system [9,21]. The ionic conductivity is strongly affected by the content of partially occupied M2 and the size of the bottleneck through which the conducting ions migrate. Since there are some vacant Hf4þ octahedral sites created by doping higher valence ions, pentavalent Nb5þ , in the framework [13], part of the Hf4þ ions thus occupy interstitial sites. This fraction of Hf4þ ions occupy the M1 sites at room temperature and will contribute to the Hf4þ ion conduction in this system if M2 sites are partially occupie

activation energy assumption in this pressure – temperature region, lattice parameters should only have a minor change, thus the changes in the lattice-related parameters, z, d, n0, and S in the expression of s0 in Eq. (2) are negligible. The change in conductivity is therefore mainly as a result of change in factor c(1 2 c ) in Eq. (2). The factor c(1 2 c ) deﬁnes the requirement for partial site occupancy [9], in which c is proportional to the content of Hf4þ (M2) partially occupied M2 sites. At room temperature all the Hf(M) ions occupy the M1 sites (Hf(M1)). Since the M1 and M2 sites are not energetically equivalent, the concentration of the available sets of interconnected sites, or equivalently, the factor c(1 2 c ) approaches zero and the conductivity is very low at this condition [9]. The conductivity plot at 400 8C with increasing pressure in Fig. 1 suggests an increase of c at a pressure below 1.5 GPa, i.e. pressure results in the M1 and M2 sites becoming energetically equivalent even though the changes in the lattice parameters are minor. With increasing pressure, more Hf4þ (M) ions occupy the M2 interstitial sites, increasing the numbers of Hf4þ (M) ion jumps between (M1) and Hf4þ Hf4þ (M2), and therefore increasing the conductivity (P , 1.5 GPa in Fig. 1). As pressure increases, the factor c(1 2 c ) may reach its maximum value where the conductivity will have a maximum value (, 1.5 GPa in Fig. 1), as shown in the inset ﬁgure of Fig. 1. The conductivity decreases on further compression due to a combination of several factors. In addition to the potential decrease of c(1 2 c ) value, the enhanced effect of pressure on decreasing the lattice parameters and the decreasing size of the bottleneck will become the main factor for the change of ionic conductivity as pressure increases (P . 1.5 GPa in Fig. 1). The ionic conductivity for the entire pressure range is higher than the 1 atm value because of the greater occupancy and availability of M2 sites at high pressure.

In Fig. 2, the conductivity with increasing temperature below 500 8C at a constant pressure of 1.5 GPa then can been explained as a temperature effect on an increased c system. That is, more Hf4þ are thermally activated to jump between Hf4þ (M2). With increasing temperature above 500 8C in Fig. 2, the activation energy is double that at the low temperature region, which suggests the changes in the bottleneck size or the pathway induced by either a lattice contrast or a structural change at high pressure and temperature. The M1-site in HfNb(PO4)3 is located in a distorted octahedron of oxygen atoms between two MO6-octahedra and the M2-site is coordinated in a large cage of eight oxygen atoms [21]. These interstitial sites, and therefore the bottleneck size of the mobile ion pathway, are correlated with the distortion of surrounding oxygen atoms. In the NASICON-type structure, the ﬂexibility of the M2(PO4)3 framework allows a rotation of the oxygen atoms around the interstitial sites, involving a rotation of the PO4 octahedra [22]. As temperature increases, the thermal energy will further drive these rotations, resulting in signiﬁcant changes of bottleneck size and consequently activation energy, and furthermore the change of structure.

Therefore the formula HfNb(PO4)3 can be written as Hf(M)x(Hf12x Nb)(PO4)3, where Hf(M) refers to the interstitial Hf4þ ions. According to the expression of ionic conductivity in alkali NASICON type solids [9], the ionic conductivity in HfNb(PO4)3 may be written as: s¼ zNcð1 2 cÞe2d2v=kT ; with n¼ n0 expðS=kÞexpð2Ea

where z is the number of nearest-neighbor Hf(M) ion sites of density N, c the concentration of Hf(M) ions on the available set of interconnected sites, d the distance between M1 and M2 sites, n the jump frequency, S the entropy, Ea the activation energy of ionic conduction, and e and k are the usual constants. For convenience, Eq. (1) can be written in Arrhenius form as

sT ¼ s0 expð2Ea with s0 ¼ ðzNcð1 2 cÞe2d2n0 expðS=kÞÞ=k The activation energy Ea gives some indication of the size of bottleneck through which cations transfer between M1 and M2 sites. The similar activation energies for both high pressure and 1 atm below 500 8C in Fig. 2 indicate that the ion pathway does not signiﬁcantly differ between 1 atm and 1.5 GPa in HfNb(PO4)3 at temperatures below 500 8C. This suggests that the changes in the bottleneck size as well as the lattice parameters are minor in this pressure-temperature region (P , 1.5 GPa, T , 500 8C). Therefore we assume that the activation energy remains constant at a constant temperature of 400 8C with increasing pressure below 1.5 GPa. Consequently, the increase in conductivity with increasing pressure at a constant temperature (T ¼ 400 8C, P , 1.5 GPa in Fig. 1) is mainly attributed to the preexponential factor, s0, in Eq. (2). From the constant

700 8C, indicating the ionic contribution to the total conductivity is dominant and the system is essentially an ionic conductor at temperature higher than 700 8C. The ionic transference numbers calculated from the equilibrium values are , 0.70, , 0.83 and , 0.93 for 500, 600 and 700 8C, respectively. If we assume there is no additional contribution to the total electronic conduction at these the content of conducting experimental conditions, i.e. electrons remains constant in the whole process, the decrease in sdc/s with increasing temperature is attributed to the signiﬁcant increase of ionic contributions to the total conductivity.

High pressure ac impedance and dc polarization measurements show a strong pressure-enhanced effect on the tetravalent ion, Hf4þ , conduction in NASICON-type (HfNb)-phosphate. The increase in activation energy of conduction, by a factor of 2, above 500 8C at 1.5 GPa suggests the possibility of a new reversible structural phase transition at high pressure.
