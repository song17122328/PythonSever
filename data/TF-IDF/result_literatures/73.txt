The lyonsite structure, characterized by the formula A4M3O12, is a relatively understudied tunneled crystal structure. This host structure is known to be compositionally flexible, able to incor-porate a number of cations in various oxidation states into the A site. In the parent compound Co3.75V1.5Mo1.5O12, it is apparent that a stoichiometric vacancy of 0.25 is unavoidable as a result of Coulombic repulsion. This work focuses on the systematic elimination of vacancies by chemically introducing guest Li ions while maintaining host integrity. A full solid solution was found to exist with the formula 0.25–1/8xLixCo3.75–7/8xV1.5–3/4xMo1.5+3/4x O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2), terminating at the known end member Li2Co2 Mo3O12. Lattice refinements on PXRD data confirmed the iso-structural nature of the whole series, and detailed structural analysis revealed that competition between Li and Co in the same crystallographic site is unequal, with Li exhibiting a stronger site preference for larger interstitial sites. Diffuse reflectance analysis revealed that the optical band gap is directly tunable with x, and supporting structure-property rela-tionships were also explored via magnetometry and dielectric measurements.
Adaptable crystal structures with tunable physical properties have proven highly useful in a variety of applications, evident from ubiquitous families like the perovskites,[1] spinels,[2] pyrochlores,[3–6] and alkali metal polyanionic frameworks. For example, among the defect KB2O6 (B = Al, Ti, Ta) type pyrochlores, KAl0.33W1.67O6 exhibits high ionic conductivity values due to polarization of the extended B2X6 network.[7] Fast ion transport has also been demonstrated in Ag-exchanged α-Zr(AgPO4)2, in which the greater polariz-ability of Ag+ leads to higher conductivity than that of Na+ and K+ in their exchanged forms.[8]Among the polyanionic frameworks, one structure family clearly stands out in the field of ion conductors and ion exchange materials: Na super ionic conductors, or NASICONs. These structures, generalized as AxM2(XO4)3 (A+ = Li, Na, M = Ti, Fe, V, and X = P, As, Mo, W, S), are exemplified in Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3), which is a solid solution between NaZr2P3O12 and Na4Zr2Si3O12 (Figure 1).For decades, researchers like Clearfield have found great potential in these open framework structures.[9] In particular, Clearfield’s crystallography-heavy approach to materials discovery has laid the foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which ions diffuse through host structures. For example, in LiB2 (PO4)3 (B = Ti, Zr, Hf), crystallographic investigations determined that conduc-tivity could be increased not only by changing the Li stoichiometry, but also by understanding and adjusting the cavity/bottleneck size to allow for free ion movement. This was demonstrated via substitutions on the Li site, e.g., Li1+xScx Ti2-x(PO4)3 and Li1+xInxHf2-x(PO4)3 .[10] Another example can be found in Sc- substituted NASICONs, in which the Sc for Zr substitution correlates with a corresponding Si for P adjustment to maintain the Na concentration. The host’s flexibility allows for changes in symmetry as a function of Sc content or temperature while preserving, or even increasing, the conductivity.[11] While NASICONs can be prepared by conventional solid state reaction methods, others, such as Na2.88(Na0.32Zr1.68)Si1.84P1.16O11.54, can be prepared via sol-gel or hydro-thermal synthesis with greater ease.[12,13] During these studies, it was noted that the stoichiometry and subsequent conductivity are highly dependent on the chosen synthetic route.[14]In 2006, one of the lesser known framework families, the lyonsites, was given a thorough treatment in a seminal review,[15] and what follows here is a brief recapitulation of that work. The lyonsite found its beginnings in the laboratory, being first synthesized in 1960,[16] and a general structure determination was carried out in 1964.[17] This compound, Na2.31(MoO4)3 (Pmcn), was recognized as a new structure type. By 1970, two other compounds, Li3Fe(MoO4)3 and Li2Fe2 (MoO4)3 were discovered, and the structural similarity was noted, but no further elaboration was given.[18] Contrary to the typical trend of mineralogy inspiring chemistry, a natural lyonsite was not discovered until 1987, in which the iron- copper vanadate α-Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 (Pmcn) was a fumarolic sublimate at Izalco volcano in El Salvador; it was then named for mineralogist John B. Lyons.[19]
The lyonsites can be described by a handful of general formulae, the broadest being A16M12O48 (or A16(MO4)12). The latter stoichiometry is shared in several other unrelated structures (e.g., fluorite derivatives[20] and cation- deficient perovskites [21,22]). In many cases, the stoichiometry is scaled down by a factor of 4 to yield A4M3O12 (or A4(MO4)3). Other common formula expressions also involve simple multipliers to clarify stoichiometric features or to facilitate ease of reading, for example, scaling by 1.5 and introducing vacancies yields 1/6A2.5M2O8.This framework can be described by its structural motifs; a hexagonal tunnel comprised of zigzag sheets of edge-sharing AO6 trigonal prisms and columns of edge-sharing AO6 octahedra gives the overall appearance of a “bracelet”, while the inner wall of this tunnel is lined with isolated MO4 tetrahedra in a “pinwheel” fashion, and passing through the center of the tunnel is an infinite chain of face-sharing AO6 octahedra (Figure 2). Via symmetry, this tunnel can then be tessellated orthogonal to the primary viewing axis; in most cases, this is the a axis. While there are lyonsite-related minerals, these specific features are similar to only one other crystal system, even less studied than the lyonsite: the dumortierite structure (Figure 3).[23,24]Typically, two cations occupy the A sites, the ionic radius range of which are empirically generalized to 0.46 to 1.02 Å.[15] The oxidation states of these cations can range between +1 and +5.[15] The M site is limited to smaller, highly charged cations that prefer four-fold coordination.[25,26] To date, this only includes V5+, Mo6+, and W6+.[15] The A sites are further distinguished by their polyhedral sharing schemes: A1 (face-shared octahedra), A2 (edge- shared octahedra), and A3 (edge-shared trigonal prisms) (Figure 2). The M sites are also crystallographically distinct: M1 and M2. Each oxygen is bonded to two A atoms and one M atom.
The majority of these oxides crystallize in the Pnma space group; however, the structural flexibility has led to the observation of several lyonsites crystal-lizing in subgroups of Pnma. This structural flexibility is also reflected in the ability to incorporate vacancies, ; these vacancies tend to localize in the face- sharing octahedral chain. Consequently, the bonded oxygens will displace towards the higher oxidation state M cation. Substitutions can therefore be made into any site exclusively or across all sites with vacancy compensation.The trigonal prism environment is an atypical one, even in this structure; in most of the molybdate lyonsites, the A3 site is fairly uniform; however, in Zn- and Cu-containing lyonsites, this site is highly distorted, with the cations pushed towards one of the square windows. They can be treated as distorted square pyramids (e.g., Cu3.85(MoO4)3,[27] (Cu,Fe)3.63(MoO4)3[28]) or square planes, in which one pair of A–O bonds is significantly longer than the others, as in the case of (Cu,Mn)3.66(MoO4)3,[29] (Cu,Co)3.75(MoO4)3,[30] and Cu3Fe4V6 O24.[19]
The molybdate members of this structure family exhibit the most diversity in A site substitutions.[31] After the discovery of Li3Fe(MoO4)3 and Li2Fe2 (MoO4)3, structural similarities were noted in an increasing number of com-pounds over the 1971–1987 period.[15] An empirical trend was observed: one A cation was an alkali metal ion (Li+, Na+) and the other was of a flexible oxidation state. To maintain stoichiometry and charge neutrality, the possible A site combinations were found to be: A+3A’3+ and A+2A’2+2. Some examples of such compounds include Li3(Al,Sc)Mo3O12,[32,33] Li2(Co,Cu,Ni,Zn)2Mo3 O12.[34–38] Introducing higher oxidation state cations or breaking this pattern necessitated the creation of vacancies (e.g., 6.25% of the A site in Li3Ti0.75Mo3 O12[39] is vacant), and/or a change in oxidation states, as in Cu3.85Mo3O12 (in which Cu+ is present, and 3.75% of the A site is vacant).[27] One of the few lyonsites to exhibit cation and vacancy ordering in the A1 site is Li2 Zr(MoO4)3, in which the symmetry is reduced to Pmn21.[15]
The mineral α-Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 (A site vacancy: 12.5%) was the first discovered vanadate variety. Attempts to replicate this in a laboratory setting had been unsuccessful, and resulted in a β-Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 phase. It was surmised that synthesis of the α form was only possible at high pressures, mimicking that of the geological conditions for the mineral formation.[40] However, the ability of the structure type to incorporate vacancies allowed for off-stoichiometries, resulting in compounds like (Co,Cu)4Fe3.33(VO4)6 (A site vacancy: 8.375%), Co3.6Fe3.6(VO4)6 (A site vacancy: 10%), Cu4.05Cr3.3(VO4)6 (A site vacancy: 8.125%), and Co5Cr2.667(VO4)6 (A site vacancy: 4.1625%).[15] It was deter-mined that all these samples fall on the A3+1.5xA’4-x(VO4)6 phase line. It is clear at this point that a fully occupied model for vanadates cannot be charge balanced, and must inherently have vacancies. For example, a more formal expression of α-Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 would be 2Cu6Fe8V12O48.
The vanadomolybdates (in which past studies have often scaled down the stoichiometry by 1.5x for clarity [25,41,42]) are less studied than their molybdate and vanadate counterparts. One such example is Mg2.5VMoO8, which was found to be catalytically active for hydrocarbon oxidation. Like the vanadate varieties, these lyonsites contain unavoidable vacancies, e.g., Mg2.5VMoO8 is rewritten as Mg15V6Mo6O48. Of note are two particular compounds, Zn2.5 VMoO8,[43] white in color, crystallizing as P212121, and Co2.5VMoO8,[42] which appears almost black, crystallizing as Pnma. They are two of the few known lyonsites in which only one cation (and corresponding vacancies) occupy the A site.[25,26,41,43] Until recently, the site preference for Zn2+ in this structure was unknown. In addition, the other end member, Co2.5VMoO8, had been reported, but no physical properties had been explored.[42] A recent investigation examined the structural and physical properties of a solid solu-tion between these two species. Among the properties of the series was its color, exhibiting varying shades of green, tunable with x.[44]Following the conclusions of that work, with this behavior in mind, it was worth experimentation to coax and tune other colors from this system of compounds. Another investigation presented novel compositions and some physical properties of cationic substitutions into the white Zn-rich end mem-ber, namely with Mn, Ni, and Cu ions.[45] A structural treatment of the end member Mn2.5VMoO8 had been given in the literature,[41] but no physical properties had been measured, so the possible color range was unknown. In addition, a fully substituted Ni lyonsite is not known to exist, and a fully subsituted Cu lyonsite is demonstrated with Mo6+ as the only M cation.[27] Substitutions with these two elements were therefore worthy of exploration, considering NiO/CuO are lower-cost precursors relative to CoO. In addition, Cu2+ is a Jahn-Teller active ion,[46] which can create structural oddities.
Prior to 2006, only two compounds of this variety were known, Li2Mg2 (WO4)3 and Mg2.5VWO8.[48,49] Attempts to form Li2A’2(WO4)3 with any-thing other than Mg2+ have failed. Further investigation is therefore needed to understand the disparity in phase stability between Mo6+- and W6+- substituted lyonsites.
Since their discovery, various lyonsite compounds have been proposed for direct functional applications, since recent studies have demonstrated that tunability was possible in the cation sites as well as vacancy concentrations.[15] For example, the tungstate Li2Mg2W3O12 doped with Eu3+ was recently found to be a promising red phosphor for white light-emitting diodes.[48] Other com-pounds, like the mentioned Li3FeMo3O12, Li2Mg2Mo3O12, and Li2A’2Mo3O12 (A’ = Zn, Ca), exhibit favorable microwave dielectric quality factors.[50–52] Further still, compounds such as Zn2.5VMoO8 and Li3FeMo3O12 are also noted for their photocatalytic activity.[53,54]The location and variability in vacancies have also been used to explain ionic conduction in this family, though detailed mechanistic studies are still inconclusive. Li2Co2(MoO4)3 can be considered to be a part of the NASICON (Na super ionic conductor) family, as it is constructed of a polyanionic frame-work with Li-occupied channels. This particular compound exhibits Li inser-tion/de-insertion at 4.9 V via oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+, and at 1.5 V, de- insertion results in the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo5+.[55] Similarly, Li2Ni2 (MoO4)3 exhibits a reversible discharge capacity of ≈115 mAh/g.[56]Other examples include Li2-xMg2+x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) and Li3A’3+ (MoO4)3 (A’3+ = Cr, Fe).[31] While the framework is 3-dimensional, the conduction pathway is suggested to be along the trigonal prismatic A3 site, which is exclusively occupied by Li. It is possible that vacancies exist there in addition to the A1 site, though the A3 site would be preferable for ion migration due to the connectivity and window size (≈ 3.95 × 4.00 Å). AC impedance spectroscopy indicates that the conduction is 1-dimensional, with σ300 values of ∼10−7 S/cm for Li2-xMg2+x(MoO4)3 and ∼10−6 S/cm for Li3A’3+ (MoO4)3. For the former series, the low conductivity (as x increases) was attributed to the presence of +2 cations in the A3 site, which impedes the Li- ion mobility. For the latter series, the observed conductivity is superior to that of other 1D ionic conductors like LiAlSiO4 and LiSbO3.[31] A similar example of this behavior exists in Li3+xFe(MoO4)3, in which electrochemical insertion and de-insertion of Li is reversible via the reduction of Fe3+.[57]In one particular work, a complete solid solution was found between Li2Mg2 Mo3O12 and the isostructural Mg2.5VMoO8, and was expressed as 0.25–1/6xLi 4/3xMg3.75–7/6xV1.5-xMo1.5+xO12 (in which the vacancy concentration varies as a function of charge neutrality, as well as stoichiometric preservation of each site).[58] This behaviour has also been demonstrated to be useful in catalysis and ionic conduction applications, e.g., the creation of cationic vacancies in the NASICON-like related compound (Li,Na)2Fe2(MoO4)3 facilitates Li-ion mobility.[59] To further explore this flexibility and to examine the conclusions made in prior literature, a solid solution between the Li2Co2(MoO4)3 ( = 0) and Co2.5VMoO8 (0.25Co3.75V1.5Mo1.5O12) is detailed in this work; the Co- containing lyonsites were chosen as an extension of a previous study,[44] but this substitution scheme could easily be adapted and attempted for other A cations.
Stoichiometric quantities of Li2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), CoCO3 (Sigma- Aldrich, 46–48% as Co), V2O5 (Cerac, 99.9%), and MoO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) were ground in an agate mortar, pressed into cylindrical pellets, and annealed between 600 and 975°C in air.X-ray diffraction data were collected using a benchtop Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator. Le Bail refinements were performed with KCl as an internal standard. Select ≈10 g samples were loaded in vanadium sample cans (15.6 mm diameter, 50 mm length), and room temperature neutron powder diffraction data were collected on the BT-1 beamline at the Center for Neutron Research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Measurement was conducted over a 2θ range of 3–167°, and a Cu (311) monochromator was employed, yielding an incident wavelength of 1.5403(2) Å.[60] Collimation of 15ʹ of arc was used before the monochromator, 20ʹ before the sample, and 7ʹ before the detectors. Small portions of each sample were also used to collect high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction data on the 11-BM beamline at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Samples were ground with amorphous silica gel to account for absorption. The resulting mixtures were packed into Kapton capillary tubes (0.8 mm diameter), mounted, and data were collected at room temperature over a 2θ range of 34°, with data points collected every 0.001 °2θ and a scan speed of 0.01°/s.[61] Subsequent Rietveld analysis was performed via the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software equipped with EXPGUI.[62,63]Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) DC magnetization experiments were performed using a Quantum Design PPMS, from 5–300 K. Oxidation states were confirmed by fitting the inverse magnetic susceptibility curves to the reciprocal of the Curie-Weiss Law (1/χmol = (T-θ)/C) and extracting effective magnetic moments (in Bohr magnetons, µB) via µeff = 2.84C1/2. Diamagnetic corrections were applied during calculations of experimental µB. Vis-NIR diffuse reflec-tance data were obtained (out to 2500 nm) using a Jasco V-670 spectro-photometer fitted with an integrating sphere. The data were then converted to pseudo-absorbance units via the Kubelka-Munk relationship, F(R) = (1-R)2/ (2 R),[64] to generate corresponding Tauc plots.Dielectric constant measurements were performed on an in-house parallel plate capacitor setup. Sintered pastilles of 75% density or greater were painted with Ag paint, cured at ≈120°C for 2 h, placed between Pt electrodes, and a differential voltage was applied. Capacitance data were then collected as a function of temperature and frequency on an HP 4284 LCR meter at fixed frequencies of 1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 kHz over a temperature range of 30–200°C.
A full solid solution was found to exist in the 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 range (Figure 4). The similarity in Shannon ionic radii between Li+ (0.74 Å) and Co2+ (0.745 Å) should result in little (if any) change in cell parameters.[65] The difference between V5+ (0.355 Å) and Mo6+ (0.41 Å), though, is significant, and causes a unit cell expansion (Figure 5) commensurate with Vegard’s law.A related molybdate, Li2-2xZn2+x(MoO4)3, which also exhibits vacancy flexibil-ity, follows a similar substitution scheme to this work: 2Li+ → Zn2+ + .[66] As Zn content increased, the vacancy concentration increased in the A1 site, alleviating the electrostatic repulsion between the ions in that face-sharing site. The aniso-tropic atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) also reflected that scenario, as the thermal ellipsoids elongate along the axis of the AO6 chain. The overall result is an expansion in the (100) and contraction along the [100] due to vacancy-induced steric strain relief. This behavior is also observed in this work, but the contraction along [100] is obfuscated by the difference in the M site radii.A combined refinement obtained from constant-wavelength (CW) neutron diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction was performed for a member of this series (x = 1.25). The pattern indexes well to Pnma, and lattice constants were consistent with that obtained from a benchtop diffractometer (Figure 6). The initial refinement strategy involved an equal distribution of atoms across their respective sites (Li, Co across the A sites, and V, Mo across the M sites). The vacancy concentration was localized to the A1 site, as per precedent. Chemical constraints were added for the A2, A3, M1, and M2 sites to a total occupancy of 1 for each site. Furthermore, chemical restraints were added to incorporate charge neutrality into the model, e.g., all Li occupancies adding up to the expected stoichiometry. All O sites were determined to be fully occu-pied, and were fixed at a value of 1. Anisotropic ADP values for all sites were reasonable and did not significantly affect the reliability statistics; this para-meter was therefore refined under the assumption of isotropic displacement.Overall, the most significant finding from this combined refinement is the site preference of Li over Co in the A3 (trigonal prismatic) site, compared to the A1 (face-sharing octahedra) and A2 (edge-sharing octahedra) (Table 1). Against a nominal formula of 0.09Li1.25Co2.66V0.56Mo2.4O12, the refined for-mula agrees well: 0.04Li1.56Co2.4V0.6Mo2.4O12.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that all samples are largely paramagnetic, and exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior in the high temperature region (≈150–300 K) (Figure 7). However, the Weiss constants θW are negative enough (Table 2) to warrant closer inspection of the susceptibility plots for signs of ordering. Evidence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange between the Co2+ magnetic moments can be found in dχ/dT curves, in which the peaks below 15 K are indicators of the ordering temperature TN (Figure 8).In most 3d transition metal ions, the total magnetic moment is derived solely from the spin moment (e.g., the spin-only effective moment (µS) for a high-spin d7 ion (S = 3/2) is 3.87 µB). Clearly, the observed values do not correlate well to the spin-only moment. In such cases, the net contribution from the orbital angular moment is nonzero, leading to a higher effective moment. The magnetic moment is therefore expressed as a function of both S and L, i.e., µS+L. For Co2+, this corresponds to an expected moment of 5.21 µB via via µS+L = [(4 S(S + 1) + L(L + 1)]1/2 µB.[67,68] In short, these results can only occur if the only magnetically active ion is Co in the +2 oxidation state; this also implies that there are no O vacancies, and that V and Mo are in their highest oxidation states to preserve charge neutrality.
The vacancy-rich end member was reported to be very dark green in color,[44] while the Li-rich end member is blue (Figure 9). Visually, the transition from dark green to blue is difficult to grasp, with the first hint of blue occurring at the x = 1.5 member. The diffuse reflectance spectra also show a dramatic drop in absorbance in the 500–650 nm range between x = 2 and x = 1.5, after which point, changes are not as marked (Figure 10). These set of peaks correspond to the spin-allowed d-d excitations from the Co2+ environments, but curiously, the absorbance drops as Co2+ content increases, which could signify a change in local geometry as the preferential occupation of Li+ in the trigonal prismatic site becomes a less significant factor.
The higher energy peak is attributed to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer band (LMCT) from the O 2p to the M cation’s empty d orbitals. In addition, these LMCT bands in the 350–500 nm range shift gradually with x toward lower energies, corresponding with the increase in V5+ content and decreasing Mo6+ content. The non-absorbing trough region corresponds to the observed green color. The complexity of the cation distributions over the various structurally similar coordination environments renders specific transition assignments impractical. The NIR reflectance of the solid solution resembles that of other common Co2+ compounds, such as CoAl2O4 spinel,[69] with moderately high reflectance, but with a dip around 1500 nm (Figure 11).While direct assignment of electronic transitions is impractical in this series, it is possible to glean some information about the optical band gap Eg. While it is common to extrapolate a band gap from a direct Kubelka-Munk pseudo-absorbance conversion, the graphical representations of the plots during fitting may skew the results. This is often the case, as particle size and/or synthetic conditions directly influence the absorbance data.[70] Without corrective measures, the dispersion of extrapolated band gap values can be significant, e.g., the band gaps given for the standard Degussa P25 TiO2 have been shown to vary even up to 0.24 eV.[71]It is therefore more accurate, however marginal, to use the Tauc method.[72] A McLean analysis is first applied to the pseudo-absorbance data to determine whether the optical band gap is direct or indirect, and whether the transitions are allowed or forbidden.[71] Not performing this analysis may give a larger spread of values for the estimated band gaps. As mentioned, the Kubelka- Munk relation is given by in which α is the absorption coefficient, R is the reflectance, and s is the scattering factor. It is clear from this relationship that s is wavelength- independent, and thus F(R) is directly proportional to α. The McLean analysis incorporates this as in which h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency, k is a proportional constant, Eg is the optical band gap, and n signifies the type of transition. A plot of (F(R)hν)n vs. hν can reveal the transition type (Table 3):Direct transitions do not involve the absorption nor emission of a phonon, while indirect transitions do; any and all of these transitions can occur in a semiconducting material. The plot that exhibits the most linear drop-off at the absorption edge corresponds to the transition type, and is therefore the most appropriate model to use in Eg calculations. From Figure 12, it is apparent that the n = 2 model satisfies this condition and is a direct allowed band-to-band transition.The substitution of n yields F(R)hν = k(hν – Eg)1/2, and a Tauc plot of (F(R) hν)2 vs. hν can be generated. Subsequent determination of the inflection point at the absorbance onset is done via the first derivative of the Tauc plots. A tangent line can then be plotted and extrapolated to the x-axis (Figure 13). The x–intercepts are then taken to be the estimated optical band gaps (Table 4).
It is apparent that Eg is tunable, and increases with x, which corresponds to: decreasing  concentrations, increasing Li+ content, decreasing Co2+ content, decreasing V5+ content, and increasing Mo6+ content. The M site is likely the primary cause of this trend, as the energies at the absorption edges align with that of the O-to-M charge transfer excitations.
Dielectric constants were measured for the x = 0 and x = 2 members, as they have not been reported. The relative permittivity for the x = 0 compound exhibits both temperature and frequency dependence, increasing with both parameters as expected (Figure 14). This compound is also very lossy, with high loss tangent values. At room temperature, κ is frequency-independent, and the experimental data correlate well to the polarizability values obtained from the Clausius- Mossotti relation,[73,74] with κth = 9.47 at 1 MHz, and κexp = 10.04. It must be noted that there is no established literature value for the atomic polarizability of Mo, and as such, it had to be approximated as 4.00, neighboring the Nb value of 3.97. The x = 2 compound exhibited little temperature and frequency depen-dence, and displayed high loss values, which hints at a conduction mechanism (Figure 15). This sample also corresponds to a Li-rich compound, and the high loss could be due to ionic conduction along the A3 site as mentioned.[31,55–57] However, the lack of vacancies would prevent this pathway; it is more likely that the conduction pathway is three-dimensional, reversibly changing the entire host structure as the Li ions move through interstitial spaces. The room temperature experimental permittivity (6.24 at 1 MHz) also agrees well with the polarizability obtained from the Clausius-Mossotti relation (9.25 at 1 MHz).
The vacancy concentrations of 0.25–1/8xLixCo3.75–7/8xV1.5–3/4xMo1.5+3/4xO12 were systematically varied as a function of Li content, and all cation sites were adjusted to preserve charge neutrality. A full solid solution was found to exist, a testament to the host structural integrity in light of the high variation in composition. Lattice refinements correlate well to the expected trends based on ionic radii, and detailed structural refinements revealed a strong site preference of Li for the trigonal prismatic site. All samples exhibit Curie- Weiss behavior in the high temperature region, and the peaks below 15 K in the dχ/dT plots indicate AFM ordering, correlating well to the implications of the Weiss constants. All members exhibited varying shades of green/blue colors, which are tied to the coexistence of LMCT bands and d-d transitions in the optical spectra. The tunable optical band gap (leaning towards the lower wavelength visible region) is notable, and is correlated to the complex sub-stitution scheme. The dielectric constants are low, and the measured com-pounds exhibit high loss. The temperature and frequency dependence are composition-dependent, and the high loss in the x = 2 end member is possibly due to thermally activated three-dimensional conduction.This study focused on the structure-property relationships of these com-pounds under non-wetted conditions. The demonstrated structural and com-positional flexibility opens questions about the ability of this family to act as cation-exchanging resins in aqueous environments. At the structural level, the dielectric and optical properties of these compounds have implications on the selectivity and strength of the interfacial van der Waals interactions in a three- body system (adsorbent, intervening medium, and adsorbate), expressed as an effective Hamaker constant within the Lifshitz theory. In extension, the inter-play between atomic structure and macroscopic powder processing can influ-ence the performance of the resin due to changes in microstructure, porosity, and surface area. Future work should therefore seek to explore and benchmark the ion exchanging properties of this family of materials with respect to inorganic ions, and possibly organics and biomolecules.
