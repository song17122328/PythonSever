The Na+ super-ionic conductor Na3Zr2(SiO4)2(PO4), known as the original NASICON material, is a promisingsolid-state electrolyte that can be used for sodium batteries.
A solution-assisted solid state reaction (SA-SSR)method has been developed for its synthesis.
The method is convenient, low-cost, and has potential for largescale production.
The total conductivity of the sample synthesized by SA-SSR is 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C,which is one of the highest reported data of this composition after conventional processing of the ceramic powder.
To rationalize the advantages of themethod, a comparison of powders and ceramics prepared by the Pechiniand SA-SSR methods was carried out.
Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopywereused to investigate the products of both synthesis routes and the possible reasons of the high quality ofSA-SSR samples are discussed.
The impact of the storage condition of NASICON-type samples ontheir conductivitywas studied.
23Na, 29Si, 31P, and 45ScMAS NMRresultsreveal that the bulk of the material is not affected by the storage conditions.
The reactionwithmoisture and CO2 fromambient airwas verifiedvia TG/DSC and 1H MAS NMR.
Obviously only the sample surface is affectedleading to a significant conductivity loss caused by a deteriorationof the electrode/sample interface already around 300 °C.
After heattreatments in air, NASICON samples should be stored in an Ar-filledglove box to prevent the uptake of moisture and CO2 from the air.
In the case ofwater and/or CO2 uptake, the material can be restoredwith aheat treatment above 600 °C.
These recommendations should also befollowed for other NASICON-type solid electrolytes.
