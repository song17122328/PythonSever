The simulation of the electron con 222)gurations of the rare earths has received considerable attention for 30 years. A great number of transitions are usually recorded by both absorption and emission techniques. The transitions are narrow and well de 222)ned, permitting the construction of an energy level scheme of more than 100 crystal  222)eld levels. The spectrum provides an experimental basis for an accurate simulation of the electron con 222)gurations, in which various interactions are recognized and parameterized. In addition to the classical electrostatic repulsion, spin—orbit coupling, and crystal  222)eld interaction, others of smaller impact, like twoand three-body interactions, together with magnetic ones, can be introduced. It is general practice to conduct the simulation of the 4f N con 222)gurations with about 20 phenomenological parameters (1). Nevertheless, attention was ini-

tially focused on the 3dN electron con 222)gurations, since most of the theories were based on the optical results of these con 222)gurations. The low number of observed energy levels, as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling, together with the lack of powerful computers forced the scientists of that time to simplify the theory and to apply the perturbaT basis was used instead of the tion theory. The DSMSLML DSLJMT one for the rare earths; i.e., the spin-orbit interaction was neglected even though the spin-orbit coupling constant could be estimated later. The Dq cubic crystal  222)eld parameter was also introduced instead of the individual Bk q 213)s. As time progressed practical approaches to the treatment of the 3dN and 4f N con 222)gurations evolved. The aim of the work is to apply the simulation process for the 4fN con 222)guration to the 3d7 con 222)guration of the divalent cobalt in Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3, for which the optical as well as some of the magnetic properties were reported in Part 1 (2). The calculation of Bk q will be discussed with respect to the oxygen environment of the cobalt (SOM model). The diversity of the experimental data for this compound, in which the cobalt occupies a pseudo-octahedral site, permits testing the reliability of the theories which are employed and establishing a correlation between crystallography and crystal  222)eld. The process of simulation di⁄ers from the rare earth case, because the optical data cannot be considered by themselves but the EPR data and paramagnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature must be included as well. In the case of EPR, and for a best determination of the crystal  222)eld parameters, a knowledge of the g factors 213) anisotropy is necessary. It is determined by a study of Mg0.49Co0.01Ti2(PO4)3 since the undoped compound yields only the g average value. If

The description of an electron con 222)guration is based on the one center model. The electrons are supposed to move independently from each other and are subject to various independent interactions. Their e⁄ects are represented by nonzero matrix elements between the DSLJMT states of the con 222)guration. The quantitative e⁄ect of the interaction is usually described according to Racah algebra techniques. This method, comprehensively described in (3), has been extensively used for the simulation of the nfN con 222)gurations of the rare earth and of the actinide ions (4). The hamiltonian including the di⁄erent interactions may be written as:
represent the real and imaginary part of the cfps. The number of the nonzero parameters depends on the crystallographic point site symmetry. For the C37 or S6 point symmetries considered in Part I (2), the even terms of the crystal  222)eld hamiltonian are the same

whereas the imaginary parameters are present in the C3 symmetry:

The B2 "!1.195) characterize the axial distorsion. 3/B4 0 The main di⁄erences between 3dN and 4f N (or 5f N) con 222)gurations lie in: (i) the number of parameters introduced by HCR and HCF interactions and (ii) the order or magnitude of these interactions. For the crystal  222)eld strength can be tens of times greater than for the 4f elements, whereas HCR is of the same order of magnitude, and HSO smaller, which explains why the DSMSLML Tbasis can often replace the DSLJMTone to facilitate the calculations.

According to the work of van Vleck (5), the paramagnetic susceptibility s as a function of temperature is written as with

The principle for calculation the g value is quite similar to that of the paramagnetic susceptibility. The same (L#geS) tensorial operator is applied to the unperturbed wavefunction. The g values are nonzero only for Kramers doublets. For axial symmetry, only g// (parallel to the symmetry axis) and gM are used: g//"gz

Such expressions could be replaced by direct calculation if the magnetic interaction is introduced in the secular determinant before diagonalization (6).

The simulation proceeds as follows: — in the  222)rst step, only one free ion parameter (B) and one crystal  222)eld parameter (B4 0 or Dq) are considered. An approximate value is directly determined from the selected spin allowed transitions (7): 4„ 2g(4F), 4A2g(4F), 4„ 1g(4P). The spin—orbit coupling constant is  222)xed at 450 cm~1, corresponding to the reduced value of that of the free ion. The other free ion parameter C is related to B by the hydrogenic ratio C:4B (8, 9).

— in the second step of the simulation one assumes that B4 3 varies independent of B4 0 but is close to the cubic ratio, as :!1); also indicated by semi-empirical calculations (B4 3/B4 0 B and C vary around their hydrogenic ratio, although the C value can be determined from the spin forbidden transitions.

— in the last step all parameters vary freely. In such simulation we move in a six-dimensional space where each set of parameters determines the eigenvalues and eigenvectors which diagonalize the total hamiltonian without magnetic  222)eld (10—12). Because the free ion and the crystal  222)eld interactions have the same order of magnitude, the procedure is more complicated than for the rare earth ions. The simulation also has to agree with the external conditions (here semi-empirical calculations) in order to maximize our con 222)dence in it. Within this frame work and by using the process indicated above, a set of parameters was found which reproduce all the data reasonably well (Table 1).

The aim of the present simulation is to consider simultaneously the optical and magnetic data and to reproduce these data by using a reduced number of phenomenological parameters. The 3d7 con 222)guration of Co2‘ involves 120 DSLJM’kets. Due to the odd number of electrons the number of levels is reduced to 60 Kramers doublets in the absence of a magnetic  222)eld. The number of involved parameters consists of three free ion (F2, F4, and f) and three crystal  222)eld parameters (B2 3). Contrary to the rare earth electron con 222)gurations, for which the number of experimental levels largely exceeds the number of parameters, the number of levels observed here is relatively low and frequently the positions are not accurate, due to the electron—phonon coupling and to the relatively small spin—orbit coupling. Consquently, the energy level sequence is used as a guiding principle for the simulation, whereas the most important data come from the paramagnetic susceptibility and its behavior as a function of temperature, as well as from the magnetic splitting g factors. A knowledge of the anisotropy of g values is essential. For a polycrystalline compound, only the EPR measurements yield this type of information.

The crystal  222)eld parameters can be theoretically calculated from the atomic positions in the structure. If the simple point charge electrostatic model (PCEM) (13) is unable to represent reasonably the experimental values, some more sophisticated models can be used, such as the angular overlap model AOM (14) and the e⁄ective charge model ECM (15). The former only considers the  222)rst coordination sphere and some intrinsic parameters related to the nature of the ligand. The latter model sums the contributions of all atoms in the crystallographic network. The number of atoms to be taken into account depends on the rank of the parameter to be calculated. For the B4 q parameters the radius of the sphere is circa 30 A , whereas a radius of ca 100 A q before converging values could be obtained. The more recent simple overlap model (SOM) developed by Malta (16, 17) has been successfully applied to reproduce the phenomenological cfps for a great number of lanthanides, as well as for some 
proportional to overlap integrals and situated at the midpoint of the metal—ligand distance. One calculates the Bk q parameters using the relation 1$oBk‘1

where Ak q is the lattice sum of neighbors belonging to the  222)rst coordination sphere associated with an e⁄ective charge, SrkT are the radial integrals (for the cobalt, Sr2T and Sr4T are equal to 1.2587 (a.u.)2 and 3.706 (a.u.)4, respectively (21)), o is the overlap between the 3d orbitals of the central ion, and the s and p orbitals of the ligand, the value of which varies as a function of the metal—ligand distance R, according to an exponential law o"o 0(R0/R)n, R0 being the shortest metal—ligand distance and 2.54n45. The $ sign indicates the relative covalency when di⁄erent ligands exist and characterizes the displacement of the charge barycenter from the metal—ligand mid-distance (22). If we consider that the 3d orbitals are expanded due to penetrating ligand orbitals and that the 3d—4s mixing may be very important, it is not unrealistic to consider o values between 0.10 and 0.30. The overlap integrals are larger for

the 3dN elements than for the lanthanide compounds, for which o is in the range 0.05 to 0.08 (19, 23). The simple overlap model may be regarded as a starting point to carry out practical crystal  222)eld calculations.

In order to calculate the cfps in the trigonal symmetry of cobalt in Co0.5Ti2(PO4)3, a systematic assessment of the three-dimensional space involving the Bk q, the oxygen e⁄ective charge g0, and the overlap was done for the two possible crystallographic groups R31 and R32 (Part I) (2). In the beginning, the calculation was performed in the large overlap (0.10(o(0.20) and e⁄ective charge (!2(g0 ( !0.6) domain, which are the ranges in which the best agreement with the phenomenological value is expected. From a chemical point of view, the cobalt—oxygen bonding is supposed to be relatively ionic, because the [Ti2(PO4)3] skeleton is covalent. This is the reason why the oxygen e⁄ective charge range can be restricted to !1.2(g0 ( !0.8. These values are very close to the e⁄ective charges found for oxygen ligands of lanthanide compounds (15). Figure 1 presents the results of calculations concerning the 0 for both possible space groups R31 and main parameter B4

Each curve in Fig. 2 also reproduces the approximate experimental spectrum, which permits us to select a relatively well-de 222)ned e⁄ective charge, even if the phonon coupling does not permit us to determine unambiguously the position of the zero-phonon line. Finally, this calculation alone does not lead to an unambigous decision between the two point groups.

When the magnetic properties are considered, the variation of the e⁄ective moment k %&& as a function of temperature is di⁄erent for the two point groups. The best agreement between the calculated and experimental curves "!0.8, as well as for is obtained for o"0.16 and g0 o"0.14 and g0 "!1.1 for the R32 space group (Fig. 3). At this point, it should be assumed that the ambiguity concerning the space group is lifted. However, the calculated g// and gM values are in disagreement with the experiment; hence, a systematic analysis of the g values as a function of the wavefunction composition has been performed.

R32. To keep B4 0 within the experimental value range, o must be close to 0.15 (o"0.14 and o"0.16 in Table 1), which also reproduces well the relative ionicity of the bonding.

The energy level scheme of Co2‘ was derived from the diagonalization after introducing the calculated Bk q 213)s, together with standard values for the free ion parameters (9) in the secular determinant. The curves in Fig. 2 reproduce the variation of the energy levels 213) positions as a function of e⁄ective charge of the oxygen, through the Bk q 213)s values. A high mixing between the nominal states is obtained, and it is practically impossible to characterize an energy level only with a single DSLJMT set. The wavefunctions associated with each energy level are in fact linear combinations of all the states in the con 222)guration basis, the only selections conforming to the group theory rules. This divides the secular determinant into smaller ones according to the crystal quantum number (24), also separating the point group irreducible representations. For example, the main contributions in the D 212) 212)4P 213) 213)T level wavefunction (&20000 cm~1)

It has been shown elsewhere that g// and gM values of the ground state are very sensitive to the wavefunction composition, i.e., to the values of the crystal  222)eld parameters (25, 26). Therefore, a systematic analysis of the variation of the g values was carried out. Figure 4a presents the variation of the g values when the B4 0 ratio is distorted from the cubic value. In that case, it is assumed that the value of B4 0 is close to the  212) 212)experimental 213) 213) one and also corresponds to the one calculated by SOM with an overlap of 0.14 (Table 1). At that point, B2 0 is  222)xed to zero. The intersection of the two curves is obtained when the B4 0 ratio assumes the cubic value (!1.195). The best region of agreement is found &!1.0, which is also close to the ratio calculated for B4 by SOM (!0.90) for the R32 point group. The second step (Fig. 4b) studies the e⁄ect of B2 0 is  222)xed to !0.90. Position 1 corresponds to the SOM calculated B2 0. For this set of calculated parameters, the energy level scheme and the magnetic e⁄ective moment k %&& as a function of temperature (Fig. 3, curve R32), as well as the average g value (measured on the  212) 212)pure 213) 213) Co compound) were well reproduced. The only mismatch concerns the g anisotropy for the doped Co compound. To reproduce the anisotropy requires a negative value for B2 0, far from the one calculated by SOM (position 2 in Fig. 4b). An intermediate position &5000 cm~1 should reproduce well the anisotropy, with B2 0
