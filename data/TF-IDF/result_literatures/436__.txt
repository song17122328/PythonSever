Porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 has been synthesized via a sol-gel method using citric acid as a metal ion complexing agent and polyvinyl alcohol as a structure-guiding agent. The obtained porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 with particle size distribution of 40–60 nm has a typical NASICON structure in a space group of C2/c and the specific surface area is 40.2 m2 g−1. Electrochemical measurement results indicate that the initial discharge-specific capacity of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is up to 92.5 mAh g−1 and maintains at 86 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 20 mA g−1 (92% of theoretical capacity) and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is up to 100% as well as high rate capability performance (71.5 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles under 500 mA g−1). The excellent electrochemical properties are attributed to its particular [Fe2(PO4)3] “lantern units” stacked crystal structure and porous morphology, which significantly improves intercalation/de-intercalation kinetic of sodium ions.

With constant emphasis on protecting the environment and reducing consumption of fossil fuels, rechargeable batteries are attracting considerable interest in order to prop up the development of our renewable energy system [1]. One main application area of rechargeable batteries is applied as the substituted power sources for internal combustion engines with fuel tank, such as electrical vehicles (EV) or plug-in hybrid electrical vehicles (PHEV), which usually need to have high energy density and powder density [2]. Another is the application in renewable energy storage system, such as wind/solar energy and smart grid, which require batteries with long cycle life and low cost. In the past years, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) were the best choice for its excellent electrochemical performance. However, the high demand of large-scale energy storage system has accelerated lithium resource consumption. According to a US Geological Survey report, the relative abundance of lithium resources is limited to only 20 ppm in the Earth’s crust, which would hardly meet the requirement for large-scale applications for its applications [3]. Alternatively, sodium resources are considered to be abundant in the Earth’s total elemental reserves and chemical properties are similar to that of lithium. Therefore, the study of sodium-ion batteries has aroused great interest in recent years [4,5,6,7].

Since Padhi et al [8] first reported the application of the olivine LiFePO4 as cathode material for LIBs, polyanionic compounds as “host” structure cathode materials in LIBs have been intensely investigated over the past decades [9,10,11,12,13]. However, few polyanionic compounds were applied as high electrochemical performance cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) owing to the reason that the Na+ (1.02 Å) ionic radius is much larger than that of Li+ (0.76 Å), which causes serious change in the structure and brings the unstable phase [14,15,16,17,18]. NASICON-type polyanionic compound cathode materials, such as Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3V2(PO4)2F3, and NaFe2PO4(SO4)2, have shown an excellent electrochemical performance, high thermal stability, and ionic conductivity [19,20,21,22,23]. Masquelier and Kabbour et al. [24, 25] reported the NASICON-type crystal structure of Na3Fe2(PO4)3, which had a larger radius of ion channel (about 6.487 Å) and higher diffusion coefficient of sodium ions. Also, the ion channel is larger enough for Na-insertion/extraction, but the new material could not receive enough attention. Recently, we are interested in the NASICON-type iron-based phosphate phase, monoclinic Na3Fe2(PO4)3, which has been reported in our recent work [26]. The measurement results in terms of rate capability and cyclic stability of NASICON-type Na3Fe2(PO4)3 indicate a satisfactory electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, the bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 still exhibits a relatively low discharge capacity which caused by lower specific surface area value (oversized particles). In most of the oxidation state composition cathode materials, the common method of carbon coating to improve the electronic conductivity performance may cause some serious reduction reaction during high temperature heating process which will change the particular sodium-ion intercalation-deintercalation structure. Rajagopalan et al. reported the article of using the oleic acid as carbon source to high temperature (700 °C) carbon coating of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and reported the reversibility of Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple in Na3Fe2(PO4)3 for sodium-ion batteries which had shown higher discharge plateau (above 3.0 V). But they neglected the process of carbothermal reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) and the phosphate will be translated into pyrophosphate in high temperature nitrogen atmosphere [27,28,29]. So the Fe3+/Fe4+ redox couple in Na3Fe2(PO4)3 still needs to be proved.

In this work, we used a simple sol-gel method by increasing the specific surface of a cathode material to promote the electrochemical performance of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and avoid the influence of carbothermal reduction process. The porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3, with a larger specific surface area, can promote an interface reaction of electrolyte/active material and accelerate the reaction speed of sodiation and desodiation, which is the main reason for is excellent rate capability [30, 31]. The porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was applied as high performance cathode material for SIBs. Compared with bulk Na3Fe2(PO4), the as-prepared porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 shows better comprehensive electrochemical properties, especially the prominently discharge-specific capacity obviously has been improved.

All chemicals were analytical grade and can be directly used without any purification. Porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was synthesized using so-gel method. The formation synthesis process and mechanism of the porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 nanospheres are shown in Fig. 1. Citric acid was employed as a chelating agent, and polyvinyl alcohol (10 mL, PVA) was used as a structure-directing agent. Stoichiometric amounts of Fe (NO3)3•9H2O (8.08 g), NH4H2PO4 (3.4506 g), and CH3COONa (2.4609 g) were dissolved into 50 mL deionized water (DI), respectively, and then transferred to a glass beaker reaction. Citric acid solution (10.5 g dissolve into 50 mL DI water) and PAV (10 mL, 5wt%) were added drop wise with continuous stirring, respectively. The solution continued to react for 12 h under a water bath with continuous stirring. The temperature was kept at 60 °C. The obtained gel precursors were dried overnight in a circulating oven at 80 °C. And the precursors were calcined in a alumina crucible at 550 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere with a flow rate at 20 mL min−1. The heating rate of furnace was 5 °C min−1. Then, the white porous-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was obtained.

The bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples were synthesized via a simple solid-state reaction method. Firstly, the amorphous FePO4 (0.2 mol) and Na3PO4▪12H2O (0.1 mol) were mixed with ethanol by high energy ball milling for 4 h. Then, the mixed precursor was sintered at 600 °C for 3 h in air atmosphere. Finally, the white bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 powders were obtained. The synthesis process of amorphous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples was shown in the support information experimental part. The XRD pattern of bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. S1a.

The crystallographic information of the as-prepared samples was studied through Bruker D8 Advance powder X-ray diffraction (made in Germany), using a Cu Kα radiation X-ray diffractometer (λ = 0.1546 nm), and the scanning speed 2θ ranged from 5° to 90° was 1° min−1. The measurements of specific surface area and the analysis of the porosity of as-synthesized Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples were carried out by using nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K, measuring a Autosorb-iQ system (Quantachrome Instruments US Co. America). Thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA) was employed using a SDT Q600 (America TA, America). The temperature was rose from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1, and the samples were carried out under an air atmosphere (using a sustained flow rate at 20 mL min−1). The morphology of powders was characterized using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-7800F, HITACH, Japan). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM JEM-2100F, Japan) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) was used to investigate the morphological properties and the microstructure of as-prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)3.

All the electrochemical measurements were evaluated in a standard CR2016 type coin cell. The composite cathode composed of 8:1:1 weight ratio Na3Fe2(PO4)3, carbon black (Alfa Aesar), and PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene, Sigma-Aldrich) were milled using high energy ball with ethanol as a solvent for 2 h. The electrode composite loading average quality is 10 mg and the area of the stainless steel electrodes was about 1 cm2. The cathode electrodes were prepared in a vacuum oven drying at 120 °C for 12 h. After flattening the electrodes under the pressure of 0.2 MPa (the SEM images of electrodes after flatting are shown in Fig. S2), the CR2016 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box by using pure sodium foil as the counter electrode and glass fiber (Whatman, GF/D) as the separator. Galvanostatic cycling was measured at different current densities in the potential range of 1.5–3.5 V using a Wuhan Land CT2001A battery test system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured on the electrochemical work station (Chenghua CHI660C, Shanghai, China). The scan rate of CV was 0.02 mV s−1 in the potential window of 1.5–3.5 V. The frequency ranges from 0.01 to 100 KHz and the value of amplitude is 5 mV for the Warburg impedances. All electrochemical measurements were tested at room temperature (25 °C).

The porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is synthesized by sol-gel method using citric acid as a metal ion complexing agent and PVA as a dispersant. In order to understand the formation of porous morphology, the possible formation process is illustrated in Fig. 1. First of all, Fe(NO3)3•9H2O and CH3COONa are mixed and citric acid is added dropwise. The added citric acid helps stabilize the metal species by decreasing hydrolysis and condensation rates via the formation of metal citrate complexes, allowing their sufficient interaction and then formation of intermediate phase during water bath process. After that, the precursors were sintered in a tube furnace at 550 °C for 2 h under an air atmosphere.

Figure 2a displays the TG-DTA curves of precursor. The weight loses of precursor takes place in a multistage process. The first stage of TG-DTA curves below 150 °C is related to the process of losing absorbed water (about 3 wt%). The stage of weight lost ranging from 150 to 297 °C corresponded to the decomposition of the citric acid complexes (approximately 40wt%) [32, 33]. The weight loss ranging from 297 to 412 °C is related to the thermal decomposition of PVA and citric acid complexes [33,34,35,36]. Also, the decomposition of NH4NO3, CH3COONa, FeC6H5O7, and NH4H2PO4 is attributed to each weight loss stage (the decomposition temperatures of NH4NO3, NH4H2PO4, FeC6H5O7, and CH3COONa are 180 °C, 300 °C, 175 °C, and 324 °C) [32, 34, 35]. The obvious peak at 503 °C is caused by the process of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 formation. And the subsequent weight loss stages under 550 °C is ascribed to the in situ carbon oxidation [37]. The weight remains stable after 550 °C. So, in order to retain the particular morphology and avoid the overgrowth of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 particles, the optimized calcination temperature is 550 °C.

Figure 2b shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the as-synthesized porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples. According to the IUPAC classification, the mesoporous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 by sol-gel shows a typical IV isotherms with obvious H3 hysteresis loop [38], which indicates the characteristics of macroporous materials. On the basis of BET analysis, the specific surface area of mesoporous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is 40.2 m2 g−1. Besides, the calculation of pore size distribution uses the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method, which indicates that the majority of porous size distribute in a relatively narrow range of about 40–60 nm (Fig. 1b inset). On the other hand, the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 synthesized by solid-state reaction is shown in Fig. S3. The BET analysis of bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is 20.3 m2 g−1 (the FE-SEM and TEM images of bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 prepared by solid-state reaction are shown in Fig. S4.), which indicates that the as-synthesized mesoporous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples have obviously increased the specific surface area in comparison with bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples.

The XRD pattern of as-synthesized porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 samples (Fig. 2c) indicates that the samples are well-crystalline phases. All of the diffraction peaks correspond to the space group C2/c of monoclinic phase Na3Fe2(PO4)3. And the results demonstrate that the structure of as-synthesized samples through sol-gel method is monoclinic Na3Fe2(PO4)3 without any crystalline impurity phases. The refinements are carried out using the GSAS software [39]. The reasonable small values of Rwp (1.8%) and Rp (1.5%) demonstrate our refinements are reasonable and the results indicate as-synthesized sample is pure phase. The original parameters are adopted from the previous report [24,25,26]. The detailed crystallographic information of as-synthesized Na3Fe2(PO4)3 are summarized in Table S1. The crystal structure of monoclinic Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is illustrated in Fig. 2d. It is a typical NASICON skeleton with the so-called lantern units, which is formed by sharing PO4 tetrahedra and FeO6 octahedra that form the so-called lantern units.

The morphology and microstructure of as-prepared porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 are investigated by FE-SEM and HR-TEM. From the FE-SEM images (in Fig. 3a), we can see that the surface morphology of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 displays an open porous structure with average diameters ranging from 40 to 60 nm on the agglomerate surfaces. The TEM images (Fig. 3b) reveal the plenty porous structures having similar sizes. The results are consistent with the aforementioned BJH results (inset in Fig. 2b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image suggests that as-prepared porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 has higher degree of crystallinity (inset in Fig. 3b), which agrees well with the XRD analysis results (Fig. 2c). Moreover, the HR-TEM image (Fig. 3c) shows evident lattice widths with the size of 2.7 Å, which corresponds to the lattice facet of (022). The EDX mapping images of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 shown in Fig. 3d indicate homogenous distribution of each constituent element in porous structure.

The porous structure with large specific surface area may endow its superior capability of sodium storage. The electrochemical properties of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode are displayed in Fig. 4. The CV curve (Fig. 4a) exhibits a pair of obvious redox current peaks located at 2.67 V and 2.45 V, respectively, corresponding to the redox of Fe3+/Fe2+. It can be also observed that the porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 exhibits a relatively small voltage difference (△E = 0.22 V) between the anodic and cathodic peaks, which suggests the high kinetics of sodiation/desodiation process. Figure 4b exhibits the charge/discharge voltage profiles of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 at a rate of 20 mA g−1. As seen in the curves, a very flat discharge plateau is located at approximately 2.51 V, which corresponds to the phase change process of Na3Fe2(PO4)3/Na4Fe2(PO4)3 [22]. At the first cycle, the electrode provides the discharge/charge-specific capacities of 92.5 and 98.9 mAh g−1, and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is 93.3%. The initial discharge-specific capacity is up to 89.9% of the theoretical capacity (through calculating by two electron transfer process), which is much higher than that of our recently reported bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The comparison of energy and power density with recent literature reported with other cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (see Table S3 in the support information) exhibits that the mesoporous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is an ideal type of energy storage material. The performance of long cycle stability and the corresponding coulombic efficiency are shown in Fig. 4c. After 200th cycles, the discharge-specific capacity of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 still maintains at 86 mAh g−1, and the capacity retention ratio is up to 93% and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is up to100%. Such a result indicates the excellent cycle stability of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The rate capability performance (shown in Fig. 4d) shows that the reversible capacities of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode is 71.5 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1. Respectively, when the charge/discharge current density returns to 100 mA g−1, the discharge-specific capacities of 90.2 mAh g−1 are still recovered. The sodium ion (DNa+) diffusion coefficients of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode is 1.65 × 10−11 cm2 s−1 as calculated according to the range of low frequency results of the EIS spectra (see Fig. S5, and the comparison of Na+ diffusion coefficient with similar materials is shown in Table S2). In general, the high diffusion coefficients of sodium ions indicate the excellent rate capacity. The comparison of specific capacity at 100 mA g−1 between porous and bulk Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 4e. We can see the obvious increase in specific capacity (from 61 to 92.5 mA g−1). The 1000 cycles at 500 mA g−1 charge/discharge and coulombic efficiency curves are shown in Fig. 4f. After 1000 cycles of charge/discharge, the reversible specific capacity still maintains at 71.5 mAh g−1 without obvious fading of the specific capacity and the corresponding coulombic efficiency is up to 99% during all of cycles.

The porous structure with average diameters ranging from 40 to 60 nm is conductive to full of infiltration of the electrolyte. The porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3, with a larger specific surface area, can promote an interface reaction of electrolyte/active material and accelerate the reaction speed of sodiation and desodiation, which is the main reason for its excellent rate capability. In addition, the porous structure can endure the larger volume change of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrodes during relatively large size of sodium-ion insertion/extraction process [37], which greatly enhances the structural stability. The sodium-ion storage capability of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is prominently enhanced, resulting in high surface sodium storage. The comprehensive capacity of electrode material substantially depends on the accessible location of the “host material” for the “guest ion” [40, 41]. Compared with the bulk site, electrochemical activities of sodium ions in the surface sites or near-surface sites are higher and undoubtedly easier to be accessed. This means that the large specific surface is beneficial to high sodium-ion storage capability.

In conclusion, porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is synthesized via a simple sol-gel method. The as-prepared porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is applied as a cathode material of SIBs. The sodium-ion storage capability of the porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is prominently enhanced comparing with the bulk structure. The first discharge-specific capacity is up to 92.5 mAh g−1 and maintains 86 mAh g−1 after 200th cycles at 20 mA g−1, and specific capacity retention ratio is up to 93%. In particular, it still keeps a reversible specific discharge capacity of 71.5 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 after 1000 cycles which are satisfied with requirements in energy storage. The excellent electrochemical performance of porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode is due to its unique porous morphology with larger specific surface, which significantly promotes an interface reaction of electrolyte/active material and accelerates the reaction speed of sodiation and desodiation. The results indicate that porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 might be a potential cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. This work also sheds insight into a simple method to large-scale synthesis of lower cost and higher electrochemical performance porous electrolyte materials for sodium-ion batteries in scale energy storage.
