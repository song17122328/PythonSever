Being considered as a high Li-ion mobility material, Nasicon structured Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 phosphate material  was synthesized via sol-gel route and electrochemically tested as electrode material for lithium-ion batteries. The  material was tested in half-lithium electrochemical cells, within two voltage windows, 1.5–3.0 V and 0.5–3.0 V,  and delivered first discharge capacities of 129 mAh/g and 567 mAh/g, respectively. Raman spectroscopy was  used to confirm the material’s structure before and during cycling. In addition, a comparative study of the  electrochemical performance by the use of two different binders (PVDF and CMC), was conducted and showed a  significant  change  in  the  electrochemical  performance  due  to  the  change  of  the  binder.  Electrochemical  impedance spectroscopy was used to evidence the electrodes’ interface changes during cycling.   

Renewable energy power sources are considered worldwide as alternatives to provide a clean energy and to find new pathways to address  the growing demands in energy [1–3]. Therefore, there are increasingly  high  demands  for  energy  storage  materials  with  high  performance,  dominated mainly by Li-ion batteries (LIBs) exhibiting great potential  due to their high volume and gravimetric energy density [4–9].  In order to develop more powerful Li-ion batteries, a great number of  electrode  materials  have  been  investigated  during  last  few  decades.  Regarding  the  anode,  carbon-based  materials  are  the  most  used  in  commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs) [10]. However, together with their  advantages, carbonaceous materials, including graphite, suffer from a few  disadvantages  such  as  low  charge–discharge  plateau  (�0.1 V),  which may lead to the deposition of metallic Li on the electrode causing  serious safety issues [10–13]. For this reason, alternative anode materials such as NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor)-structured  materials have been investigated [13,14].  NASICON-structured  materials  with  the  general  formula  AxMM0 (PO4)3 are very attractive materials for the use as electrodes in Li-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  as  well  as  Na-ion  batteries  (NaBs).  Thanks  to  their  great structural stability, as well as their fast ionic conductivity [15].  They also have a very rich and various compositions, where “A” can be  either monovalent (Liþ, Naþ) or divalent (Mg2þ, Ca2þ, Mn2þ, etc.) ions,  and M and M0 are transitional metals (Ti, Fe, V, Zr, Sc, etc.) [16]. Most of  the studied AxMM’(PO4)3 phosphates are alkaline metal-based. Of these 

Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3  was prepared by a sol-gel reaction from stoichiometric  amounts  of  CH3COOLi,2H2O  solution  (97%;  Fluka),  FeN3O9,9H2O  (98%;  Sigma-Aldrich),  H3PO4  (85,8%;  Sigma-Aldrich)  and TiCl4  solution (99%; Aldrich) diluted in ethanol. A homogenous  solution was obtained and kept under magnetic stirring for 1 h, then a  few drops of water were added slowly until reaching the appropriate  gelation pH (pH~0). The obtained gel was dried at 100 �C overnight then heat-treated up to 950 �C under air atmosphere, with intermediate  grinding.  In  order  to  prepare  the  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C  composite,  the  resulting powder was grinded with 15 wt% of sucrose in acetone. The  mixture was dried and annealed at 600 �C for 6 h under an Argon flow.  The final obtained carbon-coated Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C composite was  black.  2.2. Characterizations 

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 were  determined  using  a  Bruker  D8  diffractometer  with  Cu-Kα  radiation  (λ ¼ 1.5406 Å). The XRD patterns were collected between 10� and 60� (2θ), with a step of 0.011�. The structural parameters were obtained by  refining the diffraction data with the Rietveld method [21], using the  FULLPROF  program  [22],  with  a  pseudo-Voigt  profile  function  to  describe the shape of the diffraction lines.  Tescan Mira3 LM FE Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used  to analyze the morphology of the material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by a Tecnai Spirit instrument.  The residual carbon content in the composite was determined by  Thermogravimetric-Differential  thermal  analysis  (TG-DTA),  with  a  heating rate of 10 �C min 0) 1 using a thermal analyzer Labsys under air  atmosphere.  The  specific  surface  area  was  measured  from  the  adsorption–desorption isotherms of N2 at 77 K using an ASAP 2020 adsorption  analyzer from Micromeritics. Prior to N2  adsorption–desorption measurements, a sample (weighting 500 mg) was outgassed at 200 �C for  24 h.  Then,  the  specific  surface  area  was  determined  by  the  Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method [23].  The Raman spectra were recorded with a Witec alpha300RA confocal  Raman system at room temperature, the electrodes were illuminated  with a 532 nm beam in ambient air.  2.3. Electrochemical measurements 

In  order  to  perform  the  electrochemical  characterizations  of  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C, two different slurries were prepared using two  different binders, PolyVinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) and Carboxymethyl 

The XRD pattern of the studied Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 Nasicon structured material confirms that it is crystallized in the rhombohedral R-3c  space group. Less than 8% TiP2O7 impurity was also detected by XRD  analysis.  A  Rietveld  refinement  of  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3  was  performed  as  proposed by Catti et al. [20].  Like all Nasicon-type structure materials, Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 can be  viewed as a 3D framework of MM0(PO4)3 units (M ¼ Ti1.5, M’ ¼ Fe0.5)  consisting of two M(M’)O6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra sharing  O atoms. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 1-(a) inset.  In this rhombohedral structure (R-3c), Li ions are placed in three  main cavities M1, M10 and M2. The M1 (Li1) sites are surrounded by six  O atoms located at the inversion symmetric Wyckoff position 6b with  site symmetry 3‾ . The M1’ (Li10) sites are located at the 36f Wyckoff  position, with each M1 (Li1) site is surrounded by six M1’ (Li1’) cavities  as shown in Fig. 1-(a) inset. The third structural site for Li atoms is called  M2 (Li2), and is located at the 36f symmetric Wyckoff position. The  lattice  parameters  were  calculated  to  be  a(b) ¼ 8.5206(6)  Å  and  c ¼ 20.8573(3)  Å.  The  extensive  lithium  disorder  of  the  studied  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 phase is shown by the random lithium distribution  on the different three cavities as illustrated in Table 1.  Table 2 shows the different calculated inter-atomic distances and the  average (M  0) O) bond lengths.  It should be noted that no trace of carbon was detected in the XRD  spectra of the Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C composite.  Most of the phosphate-based materials that are used as electrodes in  Li-ion and Na-ion  batteries including olivine,  and Nasicon materials  suffer  from  the  low  electronic  conductivity,  due  to  the  presence  of  Phosphorus (P) in the middle of the M-M bonds. To improve the electronic conductivity of these materials, and therefor improve their electrochemical performance as electrodes, carbon coating is used [7,16,  24]. Raman spectroscopy was used to evidence the presence of carbon  and to confirm the obtained structure for both bare and carbon coated  materials. The recorded Raman spectra are compared in Fig. 1-(b).  The recorded spectra (Fig. 1-(b)) show the presence of all characteristic modes related to the Nasicon structure with small differences  between both materials (small shifts or merge of peaks), with the carbon  peaks (D and G) well resolved for the carbon-coated material.  Table 3 highlights the different existing modes and  their related  wavelengths [25,26].  The Raman spectrum of the Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C composite material shows the presence of the characteristic D and G bands of the  carbon coating at 1339 cm 0) 1 and 1591 cm 0) 1. Furthermore, the intensity  ratio between the D and G bands (ID/IG) in this system is determined as 

The  electrochemical  performance  of  the  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C  active material was studied within two potential windows, 1.5–3.0 V  and 0.5–3.0 V. We assumed that the material has 2.5 vacant sites (M1  and M2 voids) for lithium-ion insertion, giving a total theoretical capacity of 169.6 mAh/g.  First, a comparative electrochemical study of the two already prepared slurries of Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C using PVDF and CMC was performed in order to select the binder that presents better electrochemical  performance. As illustrated in Fig. 3, a galvanostatic cycling at current  rate of C/10 in both potential windows (1.5V-3.0 V and 0.5V-3.0 V) was 

The improved electrochemical  performance  obtained conducted. The electrodes prepared via CMC delivered noticeable better  electrochemical results: better first cycle discharge capacity, and better  discharge capacity retention during cycling.  for  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 while using CMC, can be directly related to the  improved electrochemical kinetics, as it was demonstrated for other  materials such as Si, hard carbon, and Li4Ti5O12 [29–31]. Compared to  PVDF, CMC provides a lower charge transfer resistance, lower activation  energy,  and  lower  apparent  diffusion  activation  energy  [29,30].  In  addition, the good reversibility and long-term cycling stability obtained  using CMC compared to the one obtained while using PVDF, can be  related to the presence of –OH and –COO– functional groups while using  CMC to prepare the slurry, which leads to better adhesion between the  electrode particles, and therefor improving the mechanical stability of  the electrode upon cycling. It is also important to note that using CMC as  binder for Si anode material allowed obtaining the best dispersion homogeneity of the slurry compared to other binders, which means an  optimized contact between the active material particles as well [30].  Based on the obtained preliminary results, only electrodes prepared  with CMC as a binder were considered for the following electrochemical  tests.  Fig. 4 shows the charge-discharge profile of Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C  electrode  at  a  current  rate  of  C/10  within  the  potential  window  of  1.5V–3.0 V. The composite material delivered a first discharge capacity  of ~129 mAh/g that dropped to 117 mAh/g after 5 cycles. This first  discharge capacity is about 96% of the theoretical one (corresponding to  the insertion of two Li þ ions/f.u), which is calculated to be 135 mAh/g.  The presence of the TiP2O7, impurity in our material seems to have no  noticeable contribution on the obtained electrochemical performance of the Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 material, or at least its contribution is a minor  one, and it is overlapped through the iron contribution (Ti redox plateaus vs Li in TiP2O7 occur around 2.7 V) [32,33].  It  is  to  note  that  the  electrochemical  behavior  of  the  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3  material without carbon coating was also tested (Fig. 1 supporting information) at a current rate of C/10 within the voltage  range  1.5–3.0 V.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  the  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 material was very low compared to the carbon coated one.  After the first discharge, a very quick capacity fading was observed. This  behavior of the Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 material looks similar to the one  obtained for other Titanium based Nasicon material [34].  Fig. 4 inset reveals the CV curves of Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C in the  potential range of 1.5–3 V vs. Li at a slow scan rate of 0.02 mV/s up to  the fifth cycle. The (de-)insertion mechanisms can be considered analogous to the one obtained by Difi et al. [35] for Na1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C.  During the first discharge, Li-ions were inserted into the crystal lattice by  reducing the valency of Fe3þ to Fe2þ and Ti4þ to Ti3þ. At the chosen  potential window, two lithium ions can be inserted and extracted from  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C following the global reaction mechanism:  Li1:5Fe3þ

The  CV  clearly  shows  sharp  reversible  reduction  and  oxidation  peaks, respectively at 2.46 V and 2.57 V (Vs. Li) corresponding to the  reduction and oxidation of Ti (Ti4þ/Ti3þ) during (de)intercalation of Li  ions, which is in agreement with the obtained voltage-capacity curves.  During the first cycle, we can notice a small shift of the Ti4þ/Ti3þ reduction peak (2.39 V), which is in very good agreement with the first  obtained galvanostatic profile where we can see a small noticeable level  change  of  the  Ti4þ/Ti3þ reduction  related  plateau  voltage.  This difference of the reduction potential during the first discharge can be  attributed to the different empty voids that exist in the structure (empty  M1 and M2 voids) [36], and the changes that take place after lithium  insertion into the structure during the first cycle.  A small feature is noticed in the discharge curves at 2.6 V, which  corresponds  to  the  reduction  of  Fe3þ to  Fe2þ.  During  charge,  iron oxidation peak was not clearly separated from that of Ti (Ti3þ) oxidation one, and could not be identified. It is obvious to note that during  cycling, the peaks intensity and area under the peaks tends to decrease in  both oxidation, and reduction processes with cycling indicating a capacity fading after the first cycle, and confirming the obtained galvanostatic cycling results.  Rate capabilities of the material at different current rate ranging  from C/5 to 5C were measured. The Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C composite  material  delivered  its  highest  specific  capacity  of  99  mAh/g  at  C/5  current rate that drops to 42 mAh/g at 5C current rate. Once the current  rate gets back to C/5, the specific capacity recovers to 93 mAh/g (Fig. 5 (a)).  In  addition,  the  long  term  electrochemical  performance  of  the  material were tested for 100 cycles, at a current rate of C/2 and the  material showed a capacity retention of about 73% (Fig. 5-(b)).  The reversibility of the cycling profile of the composite material at  the 1.5V-3.0 V voltage window can be directly related to its structural  stability. Ex-situ Raman spectroscopy at different states of charge and discharge (Fig. 5-(c)) shows that all the Nasicon structure characteristic  bands are preserved during cycling confirming the stability of the pristine structure.  In order to evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the material at  low  voltages,  we  have  tested  the  electrochemical  performances  of  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C composite material within the potential window  0.5V-3.0 V (Fig. 6).  During  the  first  cycle,  the  electrode  material  delivered  a  first  discharge capacity of 567 mAh/g that dropped to 385 mAh/g afterwards. The first discharge profile was very different from the subsequent  ones due to the massive insertion of lithium ions (more than 2.5 Liþ)  leading  to  the  destruction  of  the  pristine  structure.  Ex-situ  Raman  spectroscopy (Fig. 7-(c)) and ex-situ XRD (Fig. 2-supporting information) at different states of charge, confirms the non-reversible structural  changes that took place during the first discharge down to 0.5 V. After  the first cycle, all the charge-discharge profiles are almost analogous  with a small capacity decay.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  the  Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C  composite was also tested at different current rates between C/5 and 5C  within  the  potential  window  0.5V-3.0 V.  The  material  delivered  its  highest capacity of 308 mAh/g at the current rate of C/5. This capacity  dropped to 230 mAh/g at the current rate of 5C. Once the current rate  gets back to C/5, the material recovers a capacity of 270 mAh/g (Fig. 7 (a)).  After 100 cycles at the current rate of C/2 (Fig. 7-(b)), the material  showed  a  capacity  retention  of  about  48%  considering  the  first  discharge,  but  more  than  68%  if  the  second  discharge  capacity  is  considered.  Fig. 6 inset shows the initial five CV curves of Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C  in Lithium-ion electrochemical half-cell in the potential range of 0.5–3 V  vs. Li at a slow scan rate of 0.02 mV/s. During the first discharge, three  current  peaks  can  be  identified  with  an  additional  small  feature  at  2.59 V. The first intense peak located at 2.39 V can be attributed to the
