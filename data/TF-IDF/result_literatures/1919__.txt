The compound CaTiFeP3O12 has been converted to HxCaTiFe1   x2 +P3O12 by reduction using hydrogen. The reduced product is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy and its unit cell parameters are deduced. Mo¨ssbauer spectral results suggest that CaTiFeP3O12 could not be reduced completely. The effect of heat treatment on the reduced product has been studied.
Goodenough et al. [1] have showed first that the skeleton type NASICON (acronym for Sodium (Na) Super Ionic CONductor) can be exploited for making fast ion conductors. Others have looked into putting this structure to use for radioactive waste disposal [2], as heat exchangers and mirror blanks for space technology [3]. Such applications become possible for the following reasons. In principle this type of structure accommodates metal ions with valence states ranging from monovalent to pentavalent ions. NASICON has the general formula AMMVP3O12 where A can be alkali, alkaline earth, silver and copper; M, MV can be tri-, tetraand pentavalent ions. The A sites can be of two types. In type I, A sites are sandwiched between two MO6 (or MVO6) octahedra along the c axis giving rise to distorted octahedral coordination. In type II, the A sites are perpendicular to the c axis with trigonal prismatic coordination [4]. 
The structure is characterized by a network of PO4 tetrahedra and MO6 (or MVO6) octahedra forming interconnecting tunnels which may be vacant [5,6], partially occupied [4,7] or fully occupied by the A ions [8]. Such a structure permits incorporation of metal atoms into the vacant channels of the host lattice [9 – 11]. In addition to the skeletal structure, NASICON type materials show low thermal expansion [12 – 14] and high temperature stability. These features suggest the possibility of using these materials for storage of hydrogen. Our earlier studies suggested that in principle the presence of polyvalent ions in the A sites, M sites or MVsites would be a desirable prerequisite [7,15]. In this paper, we report the preparation, characterization 2+ P3O12 and Mo¨ssbauer studies of HxCaTiFe1   x and Mo¨ssbauer studies of CaTiFeP3O12. The preparation, infrared and X-ray studies of CaTiFeP3O12 were reported earlier [16].
CaTiFeP3O12: stoichiometric amounts of Ca(NO3)2, TiO2, Fe2O3 and NH4H2PO4 (all are analytical reagents obtained from SD chemicals) were thoroughly mixed in a mortar with spectral grade acetone (SD chemicals). The resultant powder was sequentially heated at 500 jC (4 h), 750 jC (4 h) and 1000 jC (6 h). This process gave a light gray-coloured compound.
Powder X-ray diffractograms were recorded on Siemens D-4000 using Cu Ka radiation (k = 1.5406 A˚ ). The unit cell parameters are derived by using a computer programme by giving the d and hkl values as input parameters.
Mo¨ssbauer spectra with good statistics were recorded in transmission geometry using a 5 mCi 57Co in Rh source. The Mo¨ ssbauer drive (Nucleonics, Hyderabad, India) was used in constant acceleration mode. The g-ray detector was a gas filled (97% Xe + 3% CO2 at 2 atm pressure) proportional counter from LND, India. The spectra were fitted using 2 or 4 lorentzians.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) of CaTiFeP3 2+ P3O12 were found to be O12 and HxCaTiFe1   x single phase and free from detectable impurities. Both the compounds are isomorphous with NbTiP3O12 [5]. The observed and calculated d-values of HxCaTi 2+P3O12 were given in Table 1. The unit cell Fe1   x parameters derived from the least squares fit of observed d-values are given in Table 2 along with the unit cell parameters of related isomorphous 3 + systems. The unit cell parameters of HxCaTiFe1   x 2 +P3O12 were found to be very close to the unit Fex cell parameters of CaTiFeP3O12. This is expected as the insertion of hydrogen into the lattice of CaTiFeP3O12 does not alter the skeleton of the parent compound. The hydrogen ions occupy the partially empty channels.
The room temperature Mo¨ssbauer spectra of CaTi FeP3O12 and its reduced product are shown in Fig. 1. CaTiFeP3O12 gave a simple quadrupole split spectrum characteristic of paramagnetic nature of ferric ion. The quadrupole splitting and isomer shift values of CaTi FeP3O12 are characteristic of Fe3 + ion in high spin octahedral coordination (Table 3). The Mo¨ ssbauer spectrum of CaTiFeP3O12 reduced at 550 jC for 6 h gave an asymmetric spectrum, which could be easily fitted into two quadrupole split spectra corresponding to Fe2 + and Fe3 + components (Fig. 1b). The large quadrupole split and isomer shift values correspond to Fe2 + in high-spin octahedral configuration (Table 3) while the lower quadrupole splitting and isomer shift values correspond to Fe3 + component. This indicates the incomplete reduction of Fe3 + to Fe2 +. The sample was heated at 550 jC for another 16 h and the Mo¨ssbauer spectrum of the resultant product was found to be identical to that of the sample reduced for 6 h. 
This result is in contrast to that of Ca0.5Nb FeP3O12 which was reduced to about 95% [15]. The number of Ca2 + ions that occupy the channels in CaTiFeP3O12 is twice the number compared to those in Ca0.5NbFeP3O12. These calcium ions prevent the entry of hydrogens into the lattice for reduction of Fe3 + ions. 
The effect of heat treatment on the reduced product 2 +P3O12) is also studied. This prod(HxCaTiFe1   x uct is heated in air at about 500 jC for 4 h and its room temperature Mo¨ssbauer spectrum was recorded. This spectrum was found to be identical with that of parent CaTiFeP3O12. The compound HxCaTi 2 +P3O12 on heating in air liberate hydroFe1   x gen and is oxidized to CaTiFeP3O12. Thus, the parent compound CaTiFeP3O12 can be partially 2 +P3O12, which in turn reduced to HxCaTiFe1   x can be oxidized back to CaTiFeP3O12.
