Nasicons (sodium super ion conductors) are a class of solid electrolytes. Their structure, compositional diversity, evolution, and applications are reviewed. A wide range of materials is considered based on crystalline and glassy Nasicon compositions.

Human endeavors to search for new materials with potential applications have been the signature of present day scientiﬁc and technological advancement. The needs of the society drive the scientists to expand new areas of research and the work on ‘‘energy front’’ is no exception. The inexpensive oil is going to last after few more years and hence the search for alternate energy sources. Since the tapping of energy from non-conventional sources such as wind, solar, or nuclear sources has certain limitation, the focus has been shifted to batteries and fuel cells for ready storage and use of energy. At present, liquid electrolytes such as LiClO4 dissolved in propylene carbonate are used in lithium batteries. This electrolyte suffers from a number of major shortcomings such as limited temperature range of operation, device failure due to electrode corrosion by electrolyte solution and unsuitable shapes. A suitable solid electrolyte is required to overcome these disadvantages. Two different approaches are pursued for this purpose. In the ﬁrst, a plasticizer, for example, TiO2 or Al2O3 can be added to make the electrolyte from liquid to solid composite. The second approach is to synthesize solids having desired ionic conductivity and other properties [1].

In the middle of twentieth century (before 1960s), ionic conductors such as a-AgI, Ca2?, or Y3? substituted ZrO2 were investigated [2]. The O2ion conductivity in Ca2? or Y3? stabilized zirconia was less and silver halides are not stable in air and easily decompose [2]. In 1960s, an excellent Na? conductor, b-alumina (Na2O11Al2O3), was prepared [3, 4]. b-Alumina has a layer structure and Na? ions migrate between two-dimensional conductive planes only. To overcome this restriction, Hong and Goodenough et al. [5, 6] proposed a framework structure with suitable tunnel size for Na? migration in three dimensions of Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 B x B 3), named as NASICON (Sodium (Na) Super (S) Ionic (I) Conductor (CON)). These compounds (Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12) are a class of structurally isomorphous 3D framework compounds possessing high conductivity, often comparable to that of liquid electrolytes at higher temperatures. The high ionic conductivity of these materials is used in making devices such as membranes, fuel cells, and gas sensors [7–10]. In addition, their low thermal expansion behavior, host for radio active waste, fairly large surface area (hence used as catalyst supports), and ability to accommodate ions in the lattice make them worthy of investigation [11–17]. Though a few related review articles are published [1, 18], to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive review on this important family, viz., Nasicon. This review covers the comprehensive information related to crystalline and glassy Nasicon compositions.

The special attraction of the Nasicon lies in its structure. The general formula of Nasicon composition can be written as AMM0P3O12 (or AM1M2P3O12/AM1M2(PO4)3) where the site ‘‘A’’ can be occupied by alkali ions (Li?, Na?, K?, Rb?, and Cs?), alkaline earth ions (Mg2?, Ca2?, Sr2?, and Ba2?), H?, H3O?, NH4 ?, Cu?, Cu2?, Ag?, Pb2?, Cd2?, Mn2?, Co2?, Ni2?, Zn2?, Al3?, Ln3? (Ln = rare earth), Ge4?, Zr4?, Hf4? and it can also be vacant. The M and M0 sites are occupied by di (Zn2?, Cd2?, Ni2?, Mn2?, Co2?), tri (Fe3?, Sc3?, Ti3?, V3?, Cr3?, Al3?, In3?, Ga3?, Y3?, Lu3?), tetra (Ti4?, Zr4?, Hf4?, Sn4?, Si4?, Ge4?), and penta (V5?, Nb5?, Ta5?, Sb5?, As5?) valent transition metal ions to balance the charge suitably. Phosphorous can be partially substituted by Si or As. Depending on the composition, the crystal structure can be rhombohedral (for many Nasicon systems), monoclinic, triclinic, orthorhombic, Langbeinite, Garnet, SW type (orthorhombic scandium wolframate Sc2(WO4)3), and corundum-like. The rhombohedral structure (Fig. 1) consists of a three-dimensional rigid framework with M(M0)O6 octahedra and PO4(SiO4) tetrahedra sharing common corners [5]. This 3D framework contains interconnected channels in which the mobile conducting ions are encapsulated at ‘‘A’’ sites. The interstitial space of the tunnels provides the conduction pathway for the mobile ion as shown in Fig. 1. The ions present in ‘‘A’’ position can have two different sites: type I sites (6b) situated between two M(M0)O6 octahedra along the c-axis (ribbons of O3MO3AO3M0O3) with a distorted octahedral coordination and type II sites (18e) located between the ribbons perpendicular to c-axis with a trigonal prismatic coordination. The ribbons are connected by PO4 tetrahedra along the a-axis. All these compounds sharing the same topology in their framework are called Nasicons irrespective of its magnitude of conductivity or the presence of Na? in the compound. Structures of orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and corundum-like Nasicon polymorphs are given in Fig. 2.

IV(PO4)3 (AIV = Ge, Ti, and The crystal structure of NaA2 Zr) was investigated by X-ray data in 1968 and it is the ﬁrst report related to Nasicon family [19]. However, Hong and Goodenough et al. [5, 6] reported synthesis and characterization of Na1?xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 B x B 3) in 1976 are popularly known as Nasicon. It is a solid solution of NaZr2P3O12 (abbreviated as NZP) and Na4Zr2Si3O12 (abbreviated as NZS). Its composition is derived from NaZr2P3O12 by partial replacement of P by Si with Na excess to balance the negatively charged framework to formula Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 B x yield the general B 3). The crystal structure remained rhombohedral with space group R3c for all compositions except in the range 1.8 B x B 2.2 where a monoclinic transition occurred with space group C2/c. The conductivity was found to be high  for a phase with monoclinic crystal lattice (x = 2.0).However, the exact composition of Nasicon prepared by high temperature solid-state reaction was contested in view of the reports of ZrO2 impurity or other phases that appeared in the grain boundaries [20–23]. This led von Alpen et al. [24] to propose a second formula for the Nasicon solid solution namely Na1?xZr2-x/3SixP3-xO12-2x/3. Although compositions of this type are known to exhibit an X-ray pattern of single Nasicon phase, it was also found to contain a glassy phase of low zirconium content [23]. Single crystals of rhombohedral Nasicon obtained by ﬂux growth gave a non-stoichiometric composition Na3.1Zr1.78Si1.24P1.76O12 upon reﬁnement of occupation factors. In addition, the end member x = 3 was found to be deﬁcient in zirconium and the charge being compensated by the presence of protons. A new general formula Na1?x?4yZr2-ySixP3-xO12 was suggested in view of the above results [25]. Meanwhile, Clearﬁeld et al. prepared monoclinic Nasicon by hydrothermal route and found a single phase of total composition given by X-ray ﬂuorescence analysis as Na3.3Zr1.65Si1.9P1.1O11.5 [26]. Similar result was obtained by powder neutron diffraction and was attributed to partial occupation of Zr4? sites by Na? ions. All these results suggest that both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric compounds are possible and it all depends on the method of preparation [26, 27]. Along this compositional controversy, many other Nasicons were prepared and studied. Some compositions were found to crystallize in other lattice depending on the preparation method and the composition itself. Alamo has reviewed the crystal chemistry and properties of materials with NZP skeleton [28]. Properties such as ion transport, anisotropic thermal expansion, ion exchange, isomorphism, polymorphism, phase transitions, exchange and reactivities at low temperatures are presented [28]. Some discussion on the reduction of copper Nasicons is also given in this paper. Though there is a lot of literature on Nasicons, for brevity, they can be mainly categorized based on (i) mobile ion (mono valent ions Li?, Na?, H?, Cu?, Ag? and di, tri and tetra valent ions) and (ii) their applications like (a) low thermal expansion materials (Ca, Sr, Ba at the site A), (b) insertion/extraction materials (presence of reducible ions like Cu2?, Fe3?, V5?, Ti4?, Nb5? and a vacancy), (c) immobilization of radio active waste, (d) catalyst supports (Cu and Ag Nasicons), and (e) sensors and ion selective electrodes. For our convenience, Nasicons are classiﬁed into the following types.

After the discovery of Nasicon by Hong and Goodenough, Tran Qui et al. [29] have investigated the main diffusion pathway of Na? in solid solution Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (x = 0–3) between Na(1) and Na(2) from electron density maps and difference Fourier analysis. The exchange between the Na(1) and Na(2) sites remains moderate even at 620 °C. A direct relationship between the value of the conductivity and the size of the hexagonal unit cell parameter c is also established in the solid solution Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (x = 0–3) [29]. Bogusz et al. investigated the admittance spectra of Na1?xZr2SixP3-xO12 for compositions 1.2 \ x \ 2.2 in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 150 kHz. The spectra consist of three regions of dispersion, independent of the composition of the sample and attributed to electrode double layer, grain boundaries, and the glassy phase of Nasicon [30]. Schmid et al. have investigated the chemical stability of Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (x C 2) by immersion in molten sodium at 300 °C. It was conﬁrmed that Nasicons with x = 2 and 2.2 were chemically attacked leading to cracking and makes the material unsuitable for use in solid electrolyte batteries in which one of the storage electrode is sodium metal [23]. Slade et al. [31] have investigated the conductivity of (x = 2), hydronium (H3O?), and Na1?xZr2SixP3-xO12 ammonium Nasicons. They have noted that the conductivities of hydronium and ammonium exchanged Nasicons are dependent on pellet preparation, pretreatment, and relative humidity [31]. Bulk and grain boundary conductivities of Nasicon system, Na3Zr2PSi2O12, by complex admittance method revealed three activation energies for both the bulk and grain boundary conductivities [32].

The conductivity of Na3Zr2Si3PO12 ceramic membrane in aqueous sodium nitrate solution is measured and is found to be in accordance with the extrapolated data for Nasicon at high temperature. This proves the non-degradation of Nasicon by moisture [33]. Phase transition of Na3Zr2 Si2PO12 at 450 K was investigated by longitudinal ultrasonic wave velocity and attenuation measurements [34]. A macroscopic model of temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity (e) in the phase transition region has been proposed for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [35].

Reports on the conductivity of single crystals of Nasicon type compounds are rare [36, 37]. The conductivity of single crystals of NaZr2P3O12 is higher compared to its pellet form and found to exhibit a discontinuity at 200 °C presumably due to the transition of Na(1) to vacant Na(2) positions leading to some disorder [36]. Hydrothermal synthesis of NaZr2(PO4)3 was carried out by Clearﬁeld et al. from Zr(HPO4)2 H2O [38]. Later they have prepared the same compound from Zr(HPO4)2 H2O and Na4SiO4 in excess NaOH at 300 °C [39]. They concluded that the tri phosphate, NaZr2(PO4)3, is part of a solid solution system, Na1?4xZr2-x(PO4)3 with 1 [ x [ 0.12 and sodium zirconium silicophosphates may also exist in zirconium deﬁcient form.

Thin ﬁlms of NaTi2P3O12 and NaZr2P3O12 are grown by laser ablation method. The surface morphology, composition, and crystal structure are investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry [40]. Nasicon thin ﬁlm precursors are prepared by appropriate control of various processing parameters of sol–gel process [41]. Nasicon thin ﬁlms are also prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and its utility as an ion selective membrane is reported [42]. Depositions of Nasicon thin ﬁlms by wet as well as chemical processes with sol–gel route are also reported [41, 43–45]. Perthius et al. have prepared Nasicon thin ﬁlm by screen print method [46]. A novel sol–gel processed Nasicon (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) thin ﬁlm using complex precursor derived from hydroxy acid-added aqueous solutions of all inorganic materials is published [47]. Single crystal growth, relation with structure of Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 were reported by Boilot et al. [48]. The inﬂuence of water on the electrochemical response of a bonded Nasicon proton conductor, i.e., Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12, x = 1.5, Na? fully exchanged with H3O? was studied by Gulens et al. [49]. The ac impedance studies of this proton conductor show that the conductivity is due to (1) electrode effects (2) grain boundary, and (3) grains [49, 50]. They have also demonstrated that bonded Nasicon of composition, Na2.5Zr2P1.5Si1.5O12 exchanged with H3O?, functions effectively as a proton conductor both for hydrogen electrolysis and as a hydrogen sensor. Degradation of Nasicon at the electrode surface was observed [9].

The conductivity of silicate limits Nasicon (Na4Zr2 (SiO4)3) in the form of thin ﬁlm and its mechanical properties are reported [51]. The reaction of Na4Zr2Si3O12 (NZS) with molten sodium was reported by Gordon et al. [21]. NZS is found to be inert with molten sodium. Boilot et al. grew single crystals of Na5ZrP3O12 from Na4P2O7 ﬂux at 1150 °C and studied its crystal structure. This zirconium deﬁcient compound crystallizes in the Nasicon structure with space group R3c [52]. Krimi et al. reported the structure of sodium titanium phosphate, Na5Ti(PO4)3 which crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice with space group R32. In this titanium deﬁcient Nasicon type compounds, one of the sodium ions occupy the site M [53].

A Nasicon-related Na5GdSi4O12(NGS) and Eu3? or Ce3? doped (NGS) were prepared by spray freeze/freezedrying technique to get highly dense ceramics. The bulk, grain boundary and electrode/electrolyte interface effects of NGS, Ce3?/NGS and Eu3?/NGS have been measured by complex plane technique. The bulk Na? conductivities of NGS, Ce3?/NGS and Eu3?/NGS were 0.21, 0.18, 0.30 S cm-1 at 300 °C, respectively, which are considerably higher in Nasicon family [54]. Nasicon type composition, AM2(PO4)3 and solid solutions of AM2-xNx(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na; M, N = Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr and Hf) are prepared and studied by X-ray powder diffraction and ionic conductivity measurements [55]. The variation in conductivity with ‘‘x’’ is regular except in the series NaSn2-xZrx(PO4)3, reaches a maximum near x = 1 (r = 7 9 where it 10-3 S cm-1 at 600 K) [55].

The substitution of Zr4? in Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with metal ions such as Mg2?, Zn2?, Y3? Ti4?, Sn4?, V5?, Nb5?, and Ta5? and the concomitant balance of charge with excess Na? ions have resulted in well sintered ceramics having higher conductivities than the conductivity of Nasicon [56]. The Ti4? substitution ranges for Zr4? in Na1?xZr2P3-x SixO12 were studied by Nakamura et al. They concluded that Ti4? substitution rate was greater in phosphate-rich region than in silicate-rich region [57]. They have also investigated the characterization and electrical conductivity of Na1?xZr2-yTiyP3-xSixO12 (0 B x B 2), (y = 0–1.5) [58].

Nasicon type composition, Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12 (x = 2.2), was doped with Cu2?, Co2?, and Zn2? to obtain Na3.36Zr1.92M0.08Si2.2P0.8O12 and Zn). The inﬂuence of doping Cu2?, Co2?, and Zn2? on the electrical and mechanical properties was studied. The micro hardness of the doped samples increased considerably while the variation in the bulk conductivity was found to be small [59]. Krok et al. [60] have investigated the inﬂuence of MgO and CoO doped in Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12. Both Mg2? and Co2? were mainly located in the inter grain glassy phase. A series of Sc3? substituted (in place of Zr4?) sodium zirconium silico phosphates were prepared by Subramanian et al. Most of them crystallized in the rhombohedral lattice except Na3Sc0.5Zr1.5Si1.5P1.5O12, which adopted monoclinic lattice. It is suggested that when Sc3? substitution for Zr4? takes place, it prevents the Na? ions occupying the M sites [61]. Attempts to synthesize NZP compositions, Na1?2xZr2-x Mx(PO4)3 (x = 1; M = Mg, Mn, Zn), met with mixed results. Na3MnZr(PO4)3 and Na3MgZr(PO4)3 were obtained in single phase while Na3ZnZr(PO4)3 could not be prepared [62]. The conductivity and DTA studies were carried out on these two compounds. The conductivity of Na3MnZr(PO4)3 is smaller by two orders of magnitude compared to Na3Zr2Si(PO4)3 while the conductivity of Na3MgZr(PO4)3 is half of the value of Mn compound [63]. Thermal behavior of Na3M2(PO4)3 (M = Sc, Cr, and Fe) was examined by Rochere et al. [63]. All these compounds crystallize in three phases: (i) a high temperature rhombohedral (R3c) c-phase, (ii) an intermediate phase is either rhombohedral with superstructure for M = Sc and Fe (b-phase) or monoclinic for M = Cr (a0-phase), and (iii) a low temperature a-phase for M = Cr or Fe corresponding to an ordering of Na(1) ions. For M = Sc, powder form tend to a-Cr type. The Na?–Na? correlations and phase transitions are discussed [63]. They have also investigated the synthesis, phase transitions, and ionic conductivity of A3M2(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na, Ag, and K; M = Cr and Fe) [64]. Na3Fe2P3O12 undergoes two reversible phase transitions: a $ b at 368 K and b $ c at 418 K related to order/disorder rearrangements on the sodium sites within the [Fe2P3O12]a framework [64, 65]. The crystal structure of all the three forms has been reported [63, 66, 67]. a-form of Na3Fe2P3O12 can be synthesized by microwave method using NaH2PO4 2H2O [68]. Na3Cr2P3O12 undergoes three reversible phase transitions: a $ a0 at 348 K and a0 $ b at 411 K and b $ c at 439 K related to their crystal structure [64].

Brunet et al. [69] have investigated high-pressure synthesis and in situ impedance spectroscopy of Na3Al2P3O12 in detail. This crystalline aluminum phosphate could be prepared only at high pressures. It exists in three polymorphic forms, viz., Na3Al2P3O12—I, II, III. The synthetic experiments carried out at atmospheric pressure always resulted in the formation of AlPO4, Al2O3, and amorphous material of unknown composition [70]. This is in contrast to earlier reports on the preparation of Na3Al2P3O12 at atmospheric pressure. The phase I (Na3Al2P3O12—I) crystallizes in the pseudo tetragonal unit cell with a = 9.313 A˚ , though the splitting in the d-lines indicate symmetry based phase transitions. The phase II (Na3Al2P3O12—II, a form) prepared at pressures of 0.85–2.1 Gpa shows monoclinic deformation of the rhombohedral Nasicon cell. The third polymorph (Na3Al2P3O12—III) prepared at 1073 K, 3.9 and 6.0 Gpa crystallizes in the rhombohedral lattice and is isostructural with Na3Fe2(AsO4)3 (II-NaFeAs) [68]. High pressure impedance spectroscopy (HPIS) of Na3Al2P3O12—I shows low conductivity and of the order expected for amorphous (glassy) Na3Al2P3O12 and Na3Al2(PO4)2F3 [70–72]. HPIS of Na3Al2P3O12—II indicates two phase transitions to true R3c Nasicon structure at 410 and 451 K, 0.4 Gpa (454 and 508 K, if pressure is 1.5 GPa) [69]. The isothermal conductivity of Na3Al2P3O12—II at 508 K is 2.5 orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolated data for Na3Al2 P3O12 glass [69, 73].

Partial trivalent metal substitution at the octahedral (M) site of AM2P3O12 has been widely studied. Rhombohedral Na1?xZr2-xInxP3-xO12 (x = 0.0–1.8) Nasicon materials have been studied by powder X-Ray diffraction (XRD), variable temperature neutron powder diffraction (NPD), 31P and variable temperature 23Na MAS NMR and impedance spectroscopy [74]. The compositional limit to x = 1.8 is due to the fact that at x [ 1.8 more than one phase was detected [74–77]. The composition with x = 2, i.e., Na3In2P3O12 crystallizes in the alluaudite (solid diamond) type structure [78].

Barj et al. have reported detailed infrared and Raman spectra of Nasicon type compositions, Na3L2P3O12 (L = Fe3? and Cr3?) and Na3?yCr2-yMgyP3O12 solid solutions [79]. The IR spectra of these compounds were characterized by m1, m2, m3 and m4 modes of phosphate group in the range 370–1200 cm-1 and FeO6 (CrO6) modes in the range 330–405 cm-1 [79]. The bands observed in the range 300–120 cm-1 were attributed to translational and vibrational modes of PO4 group while the far IR bands observed at 85 cm-1 and 50 cm-1 are attributed to Na? ions in the Na(1) and Na(2) sites, respectively [79]. They observed the relation between sub lattice disorder, phase transitions, and 0O– conductivity in Nasicon compounds in the M2O–M2 SiO2–P2O5 (M = Na, Li, K and Ag; M0 = Hf, Zr, Sc, and Ti) system in detail [80]. The Nasicon framework is described as an isolated tetrahedra sub lattice, where the M, M0 cations ﬁll cavities between tetrahedra. The conductivity of these compounds is correlated with the structure. The lowest activation energy of conduction is observed for materials having a high degree of local disorder [80].

Losilla et al. [81] have studied the structure and electrical properties of Na1.4M1.6In0.4P3O12 (M = Ti, Sn, Hf, and Zr). They have established the key structural parameters that relate the crystal structure with the Na? mobility and ionic conductivity. The triangle T1 formed by one O(1) and two O(2) is identiﬁed as the key bottleneck in the irregular M1–M2 conduction pathway [81].

Single crystals of zirconium deﬁcient Nasicon type compounds in the series Na1?4y?xZr2-yP3-xSixO12, with the composition Na5.5Zr(Si0.5P2.5)O12 (x = 0.5 and y = 1.0) were obtained by ﬂux method with Na4P2O7 as solvent. It shows two-phase transitions in the temperature range 30–200 °C [82].

Mixed valence Nasicon with Fe2? and Fe3? at M sites, (PO4)3 (y = 0, 0 B x B 1; x ? Na2?x?yZr1-yFex y = 1; 0 B y B 0.5), were prepared and measured their conductivities in vacuum. Maximum conductivity of 4 9 10-3 S cm-1 at 300 °C was observed for Na2.3 III (PO4)3 [83]. Asai et al. have investigated ZrFe0.2 3? the mixed valence Nasicon compositions, Na1?4xMxFe2x Zr2-3x(PO4)3 (M = Fe2?, Co2?, and Ni2?). Their conductivity is in the order of 7 9 10-3 S cm-1 at 300 °C [84]. They have also examined the ionic conductivity of Nasicon type materials, Na1.5M0.5Zr1.5P3O12 (M = Al, Ga, Cr, Sc, In, Fe, Yb, and Y) and concluded that the isothermal conductivity increases with increase in the ionic radius of M3? ion 2?Fe3?P3O12 [85]. Mixed valence Nasicons, Na3Zr0.5M0.5 (M = Co2?, Fe2?) were studied by EXAFS and XANES measurements. The population of Na? ions around the doped ions (Co2?, Fe2?, and Fe3?) in these two compounds increased preferentially compared to that of Zr4? [86].

Conductivity measurements of Na3Zr2-x/4Si2-xP1?xO12, for 0 \ x \ 2 were carried out. In these zirconium deﬁcient Nasicon compounds, a phase transition from monoclinic to rhombohedral occurs around x = 0.333. It is observed that the mobility of Na? ions in these materials is mostly inﬂuenced by the size of the bottlenecks through which the ions have to pass. The phase transition does not affect the ionic conductivity [87].

Fast sodium ion conducting ceramic electrolyte, Na3Zr2-xNb0.8ySi2PO12, has been prepared by high temperature solid phase reaction. A pure single Nasicon phase with space group C2/c was found for y \ 0.5. An unknown phase along with Nasicon was observed for y C 0.5. The results of electrical measurements indicated that the best conductivity in this system is 1.057 9 10-1 S cm-1 at 300 °C for the composition y = 0.3 and activation energy is 11.01 kJ/mole in the higher temperature range [88].

Engell et al. prepared several compositions in the Nasicon solid solution series from metal alkoxide derived gels. The effects on the polymerization and gel formation temperature, time, addition of water, and order of mixing of the components have been studied. The crystallization of gels and their usefulness as raw materials for the fabrication of dense ceramics of Nasicon have been discussed. The high temperature phase relations are also studied [89]. Porkodi et al. successfully synthesized the Nasicon compositions, Na1?xZr2SixP3-xO12 (x = 1 and 2), by molecular precursor approach. They initially prepared the molecular precursor, Na1?xP3-xSixO8 (x = 1 or 2) by the hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) using sodium phosphate solution. Later, Nasicon precursor was obtained by reacting the molecular precursor (Na1?xP3-xSixO8) with Zr(OC3H7)4 under solvolytic condition in ethanol. Finally, the Nasicon precursor was annealed at elevated temperatures to yield phase pure Nasicon. The conductivity of as synthesized Nasicon was measured using the pellet annealed at 900 °C and found to be 5.5 9 10-3 S cm-1 [90].

Lithium based solid electrolytes are mainly useful for all solid state batteries due to their high energy densities and high open circuit potentials. High temperature battery applications of some of the lithium containing Nasicons have been well reviewed [1, 18]. However, this section presents more details about lithium containing Nasicons.

Among the Nasicon type series, LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Sn, Hf and Ti), LiZr2(PO4)3, and LiTi2(PO4)3 are thoroughly investigated. LiZr2(PO4)3 is known to exhibit a complex polymorphism. It is observed that LiZr2(PO4)3 prepared above 1100 °C adopts rhombohedral structure (R3c) and undergoes a phase transition to triclinic structure below 55 °C [91–93]. LiZr2P3O12 may crystallize in the Nasicon or SW (orthorhombic scandium wolframate Sc2(WO4)3) structure depending upon the synthetic temperature [94]. The enhancement of ionic conductivity at 423 K is attributed to distorted tetrahedral coordination of Li? coupled with the large number of empty sites available for jumping in the rhombohedral phase, which was absent in the room temperature triclinic phase [93]. Earlier results on the characterization of LiZr2(PO4)3 gave a monoclinic unit cell parameters for this Lithium Zirconium Phosphate which is proved to be incorrect [95]. LiSn2(PO4)3 and LiHf2(PO4)3 also crystallize in the triclinic lattice while LiTi2(PO4)3 crystallizes lattice. Subramanian et al. have investigated the conductivities of LiZr2(PO4)3, LiZr2-xTix(PO4)3 (x = 0.1–2), LiTi2(PO4)3, Li1?xTi2-xScx(PO4)3, and Li1?xHf2-xInx(PO4)3 [96]. It is observed that substitution of M3? for M4? in the series Li1?xM3?M4?(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Ti, and Hf) increases the conductivity considerably [96].

Aono et al. have prepared Li1?xTi2-xMx(PO4)3 (M = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, Sc, In, Lu, Y, or La) and studied their conductivity. The enhanced conductivity in M3? substituted Lithium Nasicon was attributed to the densiﬁcation of the sintered pellets [97]. They have also investigated the inﬂuence of addition of Li3PO4 or Li3BO3 on the conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3. Addition of Li3PO4 or Li3BO3 resulted in densiﬁcation of sintered pellets and enhancement of the conductivity [98]. The conductivity of Li1?xTi2-xLnxP3O12 (Ln = La and Lu) was also investigated by the same group [70]. They observed that the substitution of Ti4? by Ln3? and Li? decreases the porosity of LiTi2P3O12 (LTPO) presumably due to the formation of a second phase at the grain boundary which increases the density of pellets resulting an enhancement in the conductivity of Ln doped LTPO [70].

Zu-Xiang et al. have investigated the effect of M3? substitution in Li1?xTi2-xMx(PO4)3 (M = In, Cr, and Ga) and Li1?2xTi2-xMgx(PO4)3 and correlated the variation in the conductivity to polarizability (a) of M3? (or Mg2?) [71, 99, 100]. Later, Hamdoune et al. reinvestigated Li1?xTi2-xInx (PO4)3 (0 \ x \ 0.4) and extended to the indium rich phases (0.4 \ x \ 2.0) [72]. Compounds with 0 \ x \ 0.4, 0.4 \ x \ 1.0, and 1.0 \ x \ 2.0 crystallize (R3c), orthorhombic (Pbca), and in the rhombohedral monoclinic (P21/n) lattices, respectively. Maximum conductivity at 300 °C was observed for x = 0.35 and x = 1.8 compositions [101]. Tran Qui et al. have demonstrated that Li1?xTi2-xLnxP3O12 adopt one of the above three structural types depending upon the x value [101, 102]. Wei Zhao et al. have investigated (i) conductivity of Li1?xTi2-xAlxP3O12 (x = 0.3) (LTPO:Al) and (ii) conductivity and luminescence of Li1?xTi2-xEuxP3O12 (LTPO:Eu) [103]. They have shown that the conductivity of LTPO:Eu is higher by 10 times to that of LTPO:Al. Luminescence and XRD studies reveal that a glassy phase of Li3Eu2P3O12 formed in the grain boundary of LiTi2P3O12 decreasing the pores and increasing the contact area between the grains leading to enhancement of conductivity in LTPO:Eu compared to LiTi2P3O12 [103].

Martinez et al. have studied the preparation and phase transformations of LiSn2P3O12 by powder XRD, 119Sn, 31P, and 7Li MAS NMR, conductivity (ac) and DSC techniques [104, 105]. They have noted that LiSn2P3O12 exists in two phases (Phase I and II). Phase I crystallizes in monoclinic lattice (a = 14.665, b = 8.405, c = 8.893 A˚ and b = 122.98°) while phase II lattice (a = 8.642, c = 21.574 A˚ ). Calcinations of stoichiometric amounts of precursors (Li2CO3, SnO2 and (NH4)2HPO4) at 1200 °C will result in the formation of phase I while calcinations of the same precursor in the 450–1100 °C range gives phase II contaminated with SnO2, SnP2O7 and Phase I. LiSn2P3O12 undergoes reversible monoclinic–rhombohedral phase transformation in the temperature range 10–250 °C with a well-deﬁned hysteresis cycle [104]. The monoclinic-to-rhombohedral phase transformation occurs in the range 120–190 °C on heating while rhombohedral to monoclinic transformation occurs between 60 and 100 °C on cooling cycle [104]. Paris et al. have investigated DSC, powder XRD, NMR (31P and 7Li) and ac conductivity of LiHf2P3O12 [106]. These studies indicate that LiHf2P3O12 exhibits a reversible ﬁrst order phase transition around 0 °C. It crystallizes in the hexagonal lattice and undergoes to a triclinic distortion at 0 °C. This is perhaps the ﬁrst time that a compound belonging to Nasicon family crystallizing in triclinic lattice [106]. DSC studies of LiHf2P3O12 show small hysteresis, which is similar to LiZr2P3O12 [107] and LiSn2P3O12 [104].

The effect of addition of Li3PO4 or Li2O on the conductivity of LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Zr and Hf) was studied by Kuwano et al. and observed an increase in the conductivity [108]. The electrical properties and the crystal structure for Nasicon type solid electrolyte based on LiHf2(PO4)3, i.e., LiHf2(PO4)3 ? Li2O system and Li1?x MxHf2-x(PO4)3 (M = Cr, Fe, Sc, In, Lu or Y) systems have been investigated [109]. The conductivity was considerably enhanced in these systems due to the densiﬁcation and decrease in the activation energy at the grain boundary [109].

later investigated preparation, diffuse reﬂectance, and impedance spectroscopy of Li1?xMxHf2-x (PO4)3 (M = Cr and Fe) [110]. It was noted that in the series Li1?xCrxHf2-x(PO4)3, rhombohedral structure exists for x = 0.1 and orthorhombic structure for 0.5 \ x \ 2.0. In the system Li1?xFexHf2-x(PO4)3, the orthorhombic structure exists for 0.3 \ x \ 1.5. The ionic conductivity increases with the substitution of M3? for Hf4? ions [110]. Shi-Chun et al. have investigated the phase relationship and conductivity of Li1?xGe2-xAlx(PO4)3 and Li1?xGe2-x Crx(PO4)3 systems [111]. It was observed single phase solid solutions of R3c structure can be formed in the range 0 B x B 0.6 for Al3? and 0 B x B 0.5 for Cr3? in LiGe2 (PO4)3. All compositions have relatively high conductivity. The electron transference numbers are around 10-5 for these compositions and the lithium mobility is of the order 3.5 9 10-5 cm2 s-1 [111]. Nanjudaswamy et al. have investigated redox potential evaluation and electrochemical characterization of Li3Fe2P3O12, LiTi2P3O12, and Li3 FeVP3O12 [112]. The conductivity of LiM2P3O12 (M = Ge, Ti, Sn, Zr and Hf) may be increased by partial substitution of M4? with trivalent cations such as Al, Ga, In, Sc, Y, La, Cr, and Fe [97, 113, 114].

Aono et al. have investigated the conductivity of Li1.3Ti1.7Al0.3P3O12 and attributed its enhanced conductivity to densiﬁcation of the sintered pellet and to a decrease in activation energy for the grain boundary ion transport [115, 116]. Later this system was further investigated. Substitution of (i) Al3? into Ti4? site, (ii) M?5 (V, Nb) into the P5? site in the series Li1?yAlyTi2-y(PO4)3 (M = V5?, Nb5?; and Li1?yAlyTi2-y(PO4)3-x(MO4)x y = 0.1, 0.3) gave several impurity phases such as TiO2 (Rutile), AlPO4-tridymite and TiP2O7 in addition to nonstoichiometric modiﬁed LTP (LiTi2P3O12) [117]. The increase in the conductivity is correlated to both the incorporation of Al and the presence of vacancies in the LTP framework [117].

Low and high temperature Nasicon phases, Li0.87 Hf2.032P3O12 and LiSn2P3O12, are reported [118]. Neutron diffraction studies of these compounds show a phase transformation from rhombohedral (R3c, Z = 6) at high temperature to triclinic (P 1, Z = 2) at low temperature. This result is in contrast to the earlier result of rhombohedral (high temperature) to monoclinic (low temperature) phase transition [104, 105]. Lithium and hydrogen ion transport in A1-xZr2-xNb(PO4)3 (0 \ x \ 0.2; A = Li, H) was investigated by Stenina et al. by 1H, 7Li, 31P NMR and impedance spectroscopy [119]. Nb substitution leads to cation mobility enhancement and triclinic-rhombohedral phase transition.

Sugantha and Varadaraju have synthesized lithium Nasicons of composition, Li2M3?M4?(PO4)3 (M3? = Cr, Fe and In; M4? = Ti, Zr and Hf), and investigated their ac conductivity. Among the systems investigated, Li2InTi(PO4)3 shows larger conductivity and the results are discussed in terms of the polarizability of network cations [120]. Wang and Hwu have investigated crystal structure of mixed valent Titanium (III/IV) phosphate with Nasicon type structure. They have synthesized single crystals of Li2.72Ti2P3O12, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic unit cell. It undergoes two reversible phase transitions at 165 and 230 °C [121]. Busu et al. investigated the ionic conductivity in the system Li9-4xZrx(PO4)3 (0 \ x \ 2) and the enhancement of conductivity with increase in the value of x [122].

Nasicon-related phases, Li3M2P3O12 (M = Cr3?, Fe3?, Sc3? and In3?), have been studied in detail [123–126]. Both Li3Fe2P3O12 and Li3Sc2P3O12 exhibit polymorphism. They exist in (i) low temperature monoclinic form, a, (ii) another monoclinic form, b, and (iii) high temperature rhombohedral form, c [64, 123]. a-Li3Fe2P3O12 shows least ionic conductivity among the three polymorphs due to complete occupation of Li? ions in three sets while in the high temperature, c-Li3Fe2P3O12 one set is fully occupied and the two other sets are only 25% full leading to enhanced conductivity [64, 123].

Nasicon type Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 solid electrolytes were prepared by crystallization of glasses, spark plasma sintering (SPS), and conventional sintering process from nanosized precursor powders synthesized by a sol–gel route. The experimental results showed that grain size and relative density were the main factors determining the ionic conductivity of the bulk materials. The SPS technique produced ceramics with nearly 100% of the theoretical density. Maximum room temperature conductivities, 1.39 9 10-3 S cm-1 and 1.12 9 10-3 S cm-1, of grain boundary conductivity and total conductivity, respectively, were obtained. Crystallization of ceramics from a glass was also certiﬁed as a favorable route to fabricate a bulk material with high conductivity [127]. Li0.2Nd0.8/3Zr2 (PO4)3 and Li3-2xAl2-xSbx(PO4)3 (x = 0.6–1.4) have been synthesized by a sol–gel process and solid state methods, respectively. The ﬁrst material, Li0.2Nd0.8/3Zr2(PO4)3, was characterized by TEM, neutron and powder X-ray diffraction. The Nd3? ions present an ordered distribution in the [Zr2(PO4)3]—network which leads to a doubling of the classical c parameter (a = 8.7160(3) A˚ , c = 46.105(1) A˚ ). Above 600 °C, Nd3? diffusion occurs at 1000 °C to the loss of the supercell [128]. The later composition, Li3-2xAl2-xSbx(PO4)3 (x = 0.6–1.4) was characterized by powder XRD and IR. DC conductivities were measured in the temperature range 300–573 K by a two-probe method. Impedance studies were carried out in the frequency region 102–106 Hz as a function of temperature (300–573 K) [129].

Copper containing Nasicons such as Cu1?Zr2(PO4)3 and Cu1?Ti2(PO4)3 were the earliest compositions reported [130, 131]. Crystal structure of Cu1?Zr2(PO4)3 was studied by Bussereau et al. using powder XRD and neutron diffraction techniques [132]. Mbandza et al. have reported preparation, powder XRD, IR, and UV–Visible spectra of Cu1?Ti2(PO4)3 and shown that this material is isomorphous with NaTi2(PO4)3 despite the absence of a few strong d-lines in the XRD pattern [131]. Transmission electron microscopy and catalytic activity of Cu1? Ti2(PO4)3 and AgTi2(PO4)3 on mild oxidation of propene to acrolein were also reported [133]. Catalytic activity of Cu1?Zr2(PO4)3 in the decomposition of isopropyl alcohol was studied [134]. Later, it was demonstrated that the compound Cu1?Zr2(PO4)3 can be oxidized to form Þ3 [135]. Detailed crystal structure, ESR, Cu2þ 0:5Zr2 PO4 Þ3 were and optical reported along with the preparation of M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (M = Ca, Sr, Cd, and Pb) [136]. Hydrogenated copÞ3 was prepared by the per(I) Nasicon, H0:5Cu1þ Þ3 in a ﬂow of hydrogen [135]. reduction of Cu2þ 0:5Zr2 PO4 Its crystal structure, ESR, and optical spectral studies are reported [135]. Hydrogen insertion studies of Cu1þZr2 Þ3 by ESR and magnetic susð PO4 ceptibility were carried out to locate the sites occupied by Cu? and Cu2? ions [137]. Solid state and sol–gel derived Þ3 was studied by X and Q-band ESR Cu2þ and magnetic susceptibility [138]. The distribution of Cu2? ions in the lattice in M1 and M2 sites is found to be dependent on the method of preparation [138]. EXAFS studies of Cu?M2(PO4)3 (M = Ti and Zr), A1 x x ¼ 0:5; A ¼ H Þ Cu1þ studies of Cu2þ Þ3 and Cu2þ Þ3 were studied by Fargin et al. [139]. and Cu2þ In these Cu? containing compounds, (Cu?Zr2(PO4)3, H0:5 Þ) copCu1þ per pairs have been detected with CuI–CuI distance of 2.40 A˚ . El Jazouli et al. have reported the preparation, neutron diffraction, ESR, magnetic and optical spectral Þ3 [140, 141]. Winand et al. have studies of Cu2þ reported synthesis, X-ray diffraction, infrared and conductivity (ac) of Nasicon like compositions, M?N4? (PO4)3 (M = Ag, Cu; N = Ge, Hf, Sn, Ti, Zr) [142]. Preparation, XRD and Sn-Mossbauer of mono valent copper containing Nasicon, Cu1?Sn2(PO4)3 was reported by Serghini et al. [143]. The ionic conductivities of silver containing Nasicons are always higher than those of corresponding sodium containing Nasicons, which was explained based on polarizability of silver ion [144]. Synthesis, structure, infrared, reﬂectance, ESR and temÞ3 was perature programmed reduction of Cu2þ reported by Ziyad et al. along with the preparation and Þ [144]. characterization of M2þ Copper containing Nasicons, Cu?M2(PO4)3 or Cu2þ 0:5M2 Þ3 with tetravalent M ions occupying the Nasicon ð PO4 framework have been studied [135, 138]. However, Þ3 or copper Nasicon compositions, Cu2þ Þ3 were not reported in literature. We Cu1þM5þN3þ PO4 have made attempts to synthesize these new compositions and were successful in preparing Cu0.5NbAlP3O12 (CNAP) and Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 (CTFP). The possibility of reducing the copper and thereby facilitating the hydrogen insertion (protonation) of these Nasicons either partially or completely in place of copper, to realize proton conductors was another reason that prompted us to explore new compositions of copper Nasicons. The reduction of CNAP in the presence of hydrogen gives rise to elemental copper and HNbAlP3O12 (HNAP). The electron spin resonance and photoacoustic spectra of these samples are consistent with this conclusion [145]. In principle, the presence of two reducible ions in the structure should provide scope for a more hydrogen insertion. Keeping this in view, we have prepared copper and iron containing Nasicon, Cu0.5TaFeP3O12 (CTFP), and studied the hydrogen insertion making use of ESR and Mossbauer techniques. The ESR and Mossbauer spectral results suggest only partial reduction of both Cu2? and Fe3? to Cu? and Fe2?, respectively, with simultaneous hydrogen insertion to balance the charge [146]. To verify the chances of reducing the ions that are not present in the channels, two experiments were carried out: (i) new compositions, Ca0.5NbMP3O12 (M = Fe, Al, Ga, and In), were prepared and the iron system was investigated by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The reduction of Ca0.5 NbFeP3O12 in hydrogen atmosphere gave Ca0.5HNbFe1-x (III)Fex(II)P3O12, which on heating in air gives back Ca0.5NbFeP3O12 (ii) A known composition, CaTiFeP3O12, was prepared and the reduction of Fe3? present in the framework was studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy. It was observed that CaTiFeP3O12 could not be reduced completely due to double the number of Ca2? present in this material compared to Ca0.5NbFeP3O12 [148]. Compared to sodium (or lithium) containing Nasicons, silver containing Nasicons are less studied. After the preparation of silver exchanged original Nasicon by Hong et al., it was Perret and Boudja who have for the ﬁrst time reported silver containing Nasicon, AgSn2P3O12 [149]. Later silver Nasicons, AgZr2P3O12 and AgTi2P3O12, were prepared [133, 150–153]. Preparation and selective catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons using M?Ti2P3O12 (M = Ag and Cu) as catalysts are reported by Oudet et al. [133]. Arsalane activity of AgZr2P3O12 in the butan-2-ol conversion to butanes and methyl ethyl ketones [154]. For the same reaction, Youness Birk et al. have reported the catalytic behavior of AgHf2P3O12 [13]. They have concluded that the dehydration activity of AgHf2P3O12 was higher than that of AgZr2P3O12 presumably because Hf enhances the acid properties of phosphate more strongly than Zr [13]. d’Yvoire et al. have reported the preparation and conductivity of Ag3M2P3O12 (M = Cr and Fe). Ag3Fe2P3O12, prepared by ionic exchange method undergoes a reversible phase transition b $ c at 346 K while Ag3Cr2P3O12 does not undergo any such transition [63, 64].

We have investigated the preparation, characterization, and new silver Nasicons, AgTaMP3O12 (M = Al, Ga, In, Cr, Fe and Y), AgSbMP3O12 (M = Al, Ga, Fe and Cr), and Ag3-2xTaxAl2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.6 to 1.4). The Cole–Cole plots do not show any spikes on the lower frequency side indicating negligible electrode effects. The isothermal conductivity obtained from dc (rdc) and ac (r(0)) agrees well. The activation energies obtained from the plots of log rdcT vs. 1/T, log r(0) vs. 1/T, and log s vs. 1/T are approximately same suggesting conducting species to be mobile silver ions. The room temperature Mossbauer spectrum of AgTaFeP3O12 suggests paramagnetic nature of this sample [155–157].

A non-stoichiometric Nasicon, Na0.5Nb2P3O12, containing mixed valence of niobium [(Nb(V) and Nb(IV)] has been synthesized and its crystal structure investigated [158]. This non-stoichiometric compound was found to be isostructural with stoichiometric mixed valence Nb2P3O12 [159]. Nasicon compounds with mixed valence of titanium (Na1?xTi2P3O12) were synthesized by (i) solid state,(ii) electrochemical, and (iii) reaction with organo-metallic compounds [160, 161]. Mixed valent vanadium containing Nasicons were prepared by Gopalakrishnan and Kasturi Rangan. It was achieved by oxidation of Na3V2P3O12 by bubbling chlorine gas in CHCl3. Sodium was de-intercalated from Na3V2P3O12 lattice to get V(IV)V(V)P3O12 in good yield. They also successfully prepared NaV2P3O12, Li0.86V2P3O12, Li2.4V2P3O12, Li3V2P3O12, and H3V2P3O12 using this deintercalation technique [17]. All these compounds were found to crystallize in rhombohedral lattice and isomorphous with Na3V2P3O12.

Nasicon type compositions, NaABP3O12 (A5? = Nb, Ta; B3? = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Al), LiNbMP3O12 (M3? = V, Fe) and LiTaMP3O12 (M3? = V, Cr, Fe, Al), were prepared and characterized by Gopalakrishnan. All these materials crystallize in rhombohedral lattice except LiNbVP3O12 and LiTaVP3O12, which crystallize in monoclinic lattice [162, 163]. Berry et al. have presented the synthesis and characterization of NaM0M00P3O12 (M0 = Nb, Sb; M00 = Al, Ga, In, and Fe). All these materials also crystallize in rhombohedral lattice [164]. Compounds of general formula A?M2 3?(Me5?O4)3 (A = Li, Na, Ag or K; M3? = Ga, Cr, Fe, Al, Sc, or In and Me5? = P or As) have been studied. Sodium phosphates of composition, Na3M2P3O12 (M3? = Fe, Cr, V, Sc), crystallize in the hexagonal lattice with space group R3c. All these phosphates exhibit monoclinic modiﬁcation at low temperatures [160, 165].

Sugantha et al. have synthesized a series of isostructural compounds belonging to NZP family by solid-state route [166]. The compositions prepared are ATiMP3O12, AZrMP3O12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, and M = Fe, In, and Cr), Nb(V)Nb(IV)P3O12 and ATi(IV)Ti(III)P3O12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba). All these compositions crystallize in rhombohedral lattice. (i) Detailed IR studies of all the compositions, (ii) UV–Visible and Diffuse reﬂectance spectra (DRS) of ABFeP3O12 (A = Ca, Ba, Sr; B = Ti, Zr), (iii) DC (M = Ti3?, magnetic Fe3?), SrTiFeP3O12, SrZrFeP3O12, BaZrFeP3O12, and (iv) ESR of ATi4?Ti3?P3O12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) and NbNbP3O12 are reported [166]. Multivalent cationic conduction in crystalline Nasicon phases was studied [167]. In these Nasicons, trivalent cations like Al3?, Sc3?, Ce3? and rare earth ions and tetravalent ions like Zr4? and Hf4? were found to be the conducting species by EPMA studies [168–172]. An extraordinary high Al3? ion conductivity was realized in the Nasicon type structure (AlxZr1-x)4/(4-x) Nb(PO3)4 by Imanaka et al. [173]. The Al3? ion conductivity in this material is considerable higher than the conductivity observed in Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and comparable to yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and calcia-stabilized zirconia (CSZ). Trivalent rare earth ion conducting phosphates, (RxZr1-x)4/(4-x)NbP3O12 (R = La, Nd, Gd) and (R0.1Zr0.9)(40?10x)/39NbP3-xSixO12 (R: Rare earth) were studied by the same group [173, 174]. Among the series, (NdxZr1-x)4/(4-x)NbP3O12 shows highest conductivity of 10-4 S cm-1 at 600 °C. The conducting species is found to be Nd3? by ac conductivity measurements in various oxygen partial pressures and also by dc electrolysis [173]. They have also studied the pure tetravalent M4? (M = Ti, Zr, and Ge) ion conduction in Ti(Nb1-x Wx)5/(5?x)(PO4)3, Zr1?x/4TaP3-xSixO12 and GeNb(PO4)3 time [174–177]. In Ti-Nasicon, W6? was for the ﬁrst partially substituted onto the Nb5? site to obtain high Ti4? ion conductivity by reduction of the strong electrostatic interaction between the Ti4? cation and the surrounding counter O2anions [175]. Zr4?-ion conducting Nasicon was developed by partially substituting the P5? ions in the Nasicon-type ZrTa(PO4)3 solid with Si4? ions having larger ionic size and lower valence [176]. Tetravalent Ge4? ion conduction was demonstrated by partial replacement of P5? ion in GeNb(PO4)3 by Si4? ion [177]. Similarly, they have also developed the tetravalent hafnium ion conducting Nasicons, HfNbP3-xVxO12 and Hf1-y/4 NbP3-yWyO12 by partial replacement of P5? ions by larger V5? or W6? ions, resulted in an enhancement in conductivity due to the expansion of Hf4? ion conducting pathways [178]. Orlova et al. have investigated the Nasicon (NZP) type microcrystals, Th1/4Zr2(PO4)3 by Pechini type sol–gel method at 900 °C. They stated that actinide phosphates lead to potential applications in the ﬁeld of radionuclide immobilization [179].

Chromium (Cr3?) substituted Nasicons, Na1?xCrxM2-x (PO4)3 (M = Ti, Hf, and Zr) and A(1?x)/2CrxM(PO4)3 (A = Cd, Ca, and Sr) have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, 31P-MAS NMR, and infrared spectroscopy [180]. The strength of the P–O bonds are affected by A and M ions in these phosphates [180]. Chakir et al. have synthesized Na3MZrP3O12 (M = Mg, Ni) by co precipitation method at 750 °C and characterized by Raman and powder XRD [181]. Ion exchange of this sodium Nasicon gave Li2.6Na0.4NiZrP3O12 which was also characterized. Diffused reﬂectance spectra indicate the presence of Ni2? in octahedral coordination [181]. Synthesis and crystal structure of Co2? doped Na3?xCr2-xCoxP3O12 (0 B x B 1) was studied by the same group [182]. The composition, Na3.5Cr1.5Co0.5P3O12 crystallizes in rhombohedral lattice with R3c space group. The infrared spectra of lithium iron phosphates including Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was reported by Salah et al. [183]. The internal and external modes of vibrations are analyzed to distinguish different phases and the type of cationic environment in the framework [183]. Mariappan et al. have investigated the synthesis of nano structured LiTi2(PO4)3 by pechini-type polymerizable complex method using soluble ammonium citratoperoxotitanate. The particle size measured from XRD patterns and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was in the range 50–125 nm [184].

Nasicon compositions, AFeSnP3O12 (A = Na2, Ca, Cd) and AFeTiP3O12 (A = Ca and Cd), were prepared by solid state method and their structures were determined by XRD using Rietveld analysis [185]. All these compounds cryslattice (R3c space group) with tallize in rhombohedral random distribution of Sn(Fe) (or Sn(Ti)) within the framework. is observed that partial occupancy of M1(Na(1)) and M2(Na(2)) sites in Na2FeSnP3O12 leading to cationic distribution [Na1.22–1.78]M2[Na0.78–0.22]M1]SnFeP3O12, Ca (in CaFeSnP3O12 and CaFeTiP3O12) and Cd (in CdFeSnP3O12 and CdFeTiP3O12) are found to occupy M1 sites [185, 186]. The preparation, structure determination, and thermal expansion of Ca1-xSrxZr4P6O24 (0 B x B 1) were carried out by Fischer et al. No structural transformation has been observed by high temperature XRD up to 1000 °C [187].

Aatiq et al. have reported the crystal structures of ortho phosphates, Ca0.5SbFe(PO4)3 and CaSb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3, obtained by conventional solid state reaction method at 900 °C. Both these compounds belong to the Nasicon family and crystallized in hexagonal lattice with the space group R3 and R3c, respectively [188]. They have also studied the synthesis and crystal structures of A0.5SbFe(PO4)3 (A = Mn, Cd), obtained by solid state reaction at 920 °C and their crystal structure possesses hexagonal lattice with the space group R3c [189].

Arbi et al. have prepared the titanium-based Nasicons, Li1?xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 and LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 and studied with X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electric Impedance (EI) techniques. From the analysis of the 7Li and 31P NMR spectra, cation distribution and Li mobility have been deduced [190]. Essoumhi et al. have reported the synthesis and characterizations of Nasicon type ionic conducting ceramics, Na1?xM1.775 Six-0.9P3.9-xO12 with 1.8 B x B 2.2 and M = Zr or Hf. The effect of the total substitution of zirconium by hafnium on electric properties has been studied. The various compositions were prepared by using the sol–gel method and the synthesized precursors were characterized by coupled DTA–TG [191]. Benmokhtar et al. have synthesized the new Nasicon type iron titanyl phosphate Fe0.50Ti2(PO4)3 by both solid-state reaction and Cu2?–Fe2? ion exchange method [192]. The material was then characterized by X-ray diffraction, Mo¨ssbauer, magnetic susceptibility measurements and optical absorption. The crystal structure of the compound was reﬁned, using X-ray powder diffraction data, by the Rietveld proﬁle method; it crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, space group R3, with a = 8.511(1) A˚ and c = 20.985(3) A˚ , V = 1316.45(3) A˚ 3 and Z = 6. It’s structure is comparable to that of Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3. Mo¨ssbauer studies showed that the presence of one Fe2? site 2). The Curie–Weiss-type behavior in the high spin state (t2g is observed in the magnetic susceptibility. Diffuse reﬂectance spectrum indicates the presence of octahedrally coordinated Fe2? ions [192]. Barre´ et al. have investigated the synthesis and structure of a new Nasicon type solid solution, Li1-xLax/3Zr2(PO4)3 (0 B x B 1). These phases were synthesized by a complex polymerizable method and structurally characterized from Rietveld treatment of their X-ray and neutron powder diffraction data. This solid solution results from the substitution mechanism Li? ? 1/ 3La3? ? 2/3 leading to an increase of the vacancies number correlated to an increase of the La content [193].

Blue luminescent material, Eu0.5Zr2(PO4)3, belongs to Nasicon family was prepared by solid state method [194]. This is the ﬁrst instance of Eu2? occupying the ‘‘A’’ site in the Nasicon framework structures. The emission studies of this material are carried out. We have studied conductivity and luminescence of Eu3? doped Nasicon compositions, Ca0.5Fe1-xEuxSb(PO4)3 (x = 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2) [195]. These compositions are prepared by Pechini type semi-sol– gel method and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction. An enhancement in conductivity is observed by doping the larger ions like Eu3? in place of smaller M3? (Fe3?) ions. The luminescence properties and local structure of Eu3? ions are derived by means of emission spectra and phonon sidebands. The electron–phonon coupling strength values are found to be more in crystalline Nasicon systems in comparison to the glassy Nasicon systems [195].

The general formula of Nasicon (AxByP3O12) can be written as A2OBO21.5P2O5. In this composition, P2O5 is a glass former and alkali oxides are glass modiﬁers. Under suitable conditions and depending on the nature of oxide of B, this composition can give rise to glassy materials. Compared to their crystalline counterparts, studies on the Nasicon glasses are meager. Susman et al. obtained Nasicon in the vitreous form for the ﬁrst time with a reduced ZrO2 composition in Na1?xZr2-x/3SixP3-xO12-2x/3 (x = 3) i.e., 2Na2OZrO23SiO2, with high conductivity (*2 9 10-3 S cm-1 and activation energy of 0.55–0.61 eV. This glass, called Nasiglas, is resistant to immersion in molten sodium and sodium poly sulﬁde at 300 °C [196]. Sobha and Rao prepared a series of glasses with Nasicon compositions such as A3Fe2P3O12 (A = Li, Na, and K), A3Ga2P3O12 (A = Na and K), A5TiP3O12 (A = Li and Na),A4NbP3O12 (A = Na and K) and Na4VP3O12 and investigated their ac conductivities [197, 198]. The total conductivity of law (s1 = 0.5 and s2 = 1.0) and is independent of nature and concentration of cations and structure of the glass. They have also investigated the IR and ﬂuorescence spectra of glassy LiSn2P3O12, NaSn2P3O12, and KSn2P3O12 and crystalline NaSn2P3O12 phases [199]. They have also investigated the ﬂuorescence studies of Dy3? and Tb3? doped Na5TiP3O12 and Na4NbP3O12 glasses. The energy transfer between Dy3? and Tb3? in these glasses, nature of energy transfer and concentration limits of quenching was presented [200].

Our group members have investigated the emission spectra of Pr3?, Eu3?, and Dy3? doped Na3TiZnP3O12 glass system [201]. Rare earth ions occupy 8-9 coordination in this glass matrix. The excitation spectra of Eu3?/ Na3TiZnP3O12 glass gave a phonon-assisted side band with phonon energy of 1022 cm-1, which agrees with the IR data [201]. The optical, thermal, and conductivity studies of Nasicon type Na2PbZnMP3O12 (M = Al, Ga and Fe) were also carried out by our group [202]. Physical properties such as refractive index, optical band gaps, Urbach energies, oxide ion polarizability, dc electrical conductivity, and DSC of these glasses are reported [202]. The optical spectral studies of Pr3?, Nd3?, Sm3?, Dy3?, Ho3?, and Er3? doped in Na4AlZnP3O12 glass were reported from our laboratory [201]. Prakash et al. have investigated the physical and optical properties of Nasicon type glasses, Na4AlZnP3O12, K4AlZnP3O12, Na4AlCdP3O12, Na4AlCaP3O12, Na3TiZnP3O12, K3TiZnP3O12, and Na3TiCdP3O12 refractive index, reﬂection loss, molar reﬂectivity, oxide ion polarizability, dielectric constant, optical band gap, and Urbach energies of these glasses were evaluated. A novel technique, frequency domain interferometry, has been employed to determine refractive indices over the transparency region for these glasses [204]. Govindraj and Mariappan have studied ac conductivity of Nasicon type glassy compositions, Na3TiZnP3O12, Na3TiCdP3O12, Na4AlCdP3O12, Na4FeCdP3O12, Na3Al2P3O12, Na5TiP3O12, Na5Cu2P3O12, Na6FeP3O12, and Na6AlP3O12 [73, 205]. The ac conductivity of law feature and scaling behavior [73, 205]. Mariappan et al. have also studied conductivity behavior of glassy compositions, A3TiB0P3O12 (A = Li, K; B0 = Zn, Cd) and K3M2P3O12 (M = B, Al, and Bi) [206, 207].

Xu et al. have synthesized the lithium–ion conducting Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 glass–ceramics with ultrapure Nasicon type phase by a citric acid-assisted sol–gel method and characterized with TGA-DSC, XRD, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and complex impedance techniques [208]. The inﬂuence of molar ratio of citric acid to cations as well as pH value on the formation of Li1.4Al0.4 Ti1.6(PO4)3 sol was studied. Experimental results indicated that the citric acid-assisted sol–gel method made it possible to obtain well crystallized glass–ceramics of Li1.4Al0.4 Ti1.6(PO4)3 at a much lower temperature within a shorter synthesis time in comparison to conventional solid-state reaction methods [208].

Nagamine et al. prepared the glasses with composition, 37.5Li2O–(25 x)Fe2O3-xNb2O5-37.5P2O5 (mol%) (x = 5, 10, 15) and developed the Nasicon-type Li3Fe2(PO4)3 crystals through the conventional crystallization in an electric furnace. They found that the addition of Nb2O5 led to glass formation effectively. They stated that crystallization of glass precursor is a new route for the fabrication of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 crystals, which can be used as electrolyte in lithium ion batteries [209].

Zhang et al. studied the new sodium-ion conducting glass–ceramics composed of Na1?xAlxGe2-xP3O12 (0.3 B x B 1.0) crystalline conducting phase with Nasicon type structure. They have characterized the materials with DSC, XRD, SEM, FTIR, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The reasons for the enhancement of the conductivity in glass–ceramics were discussed in view of the microstructure morphology and heating conditions [210].

Okura et al. investigated the glass–ceramics of titanium-, germaniumor tellurium-containing Na5RSi4O12-type (R = rare earth; Y) Na?-superionic conductors (N5YXS) by crystallization of glasses with the composition, Na3?3xY1-x XySi3-yO9 (X = Ti; NYTiS, Ge; NYGeS, X = Te; NYTeS). They studied the effects of X elements on the separation of the phase and the microstructural effects on the conduction properties of glass–ceramics. They explained the enhancement of electrical conductivity in glass– ceramics, i.e., grain growth leads to high conductivity in glass–ceramics [211].

Metal insertion studies on NaZr2P3O12 (NZP) type materials possessing vacant tunnel (absence of any ion in Na site of Nasicon) are reported [212–215]. Subba rao et al. have investigated characterization, IR and isothermal resistivity of AxNbTiP3O12 [A = Li, Mg, Sn, Pb, Zn, Y, Fe, Ti, Nb]. They have shown that most of the electropositive elements of periodic table can be inserted into NbTiP3O12 framework. The guest ion occupies the channels present in the framework structure of NbTiP3 O12. Berry et al. have reported detailed structural and Mossbauer studies of Fe and Sn inserted NbTiP3O12. Both Fe and Sn are accommodated as Fe2? and Sn2? in two types of sites in the channels of NbTiP3O12 lattice.

Electrochemical or alkali metal intercalation of ATi2(PO4)3 (A = Na, Li) has been carried out by Delmas et al. to yield A3Ti2(PO4)3 (A = Na, Li). The distribution of Li in Li3Ti2(PO4)3 is peculiar. In this compound, M1 site is empty and M2 is completely occupied, to ATi2(PO4)3 (A = Na, Li) where the M1 is fully occupied by A ions and M2 is vacant [16].

Orthorhombic Li3Ti2(PO4)3 and Li3(V1-xZrx)2(PO4)3 have been used as cathode materials. The discharge capacity of Zr substituted Li3(V1-xZrx)2(PO4)3 samples became much larger than that of pure Li3Ti2(PO4)3 [216]. Electrochemical behavior of monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 and LixV2(PO4)3 have been investigated by Saidi et al. [217, 218]. A combined computational and experimental study of structure and electrochemical properties of monoclinic and rhombohedral LixM2(PO4)3 (with a focus on M = V) have been reported by Morgan et al. [219, 220]. Charge ordering in monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 has been investigated by Yin et al. by using it as cathode material in lithium ion batteries [221, 222].

Aatiq et al. have studied electrochemical lithium intercalation, 31P NMR and powder XRD of Mn(0.5-x)Cax Ti2(PO4)3 lithium intercalation of [A0.5–0.5]M1Ti2(PO4)3 shows that intercalation occurs preferentially into the empty M1 site around 2.9 V and then into the M2 site in the voltage range of 2.5–2.3 V [223]. They have also reported structural and electrochemical behavior of Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3. It was observed that Li and Mn occupy statistically the M1 sites and the lithium ions electrochemically intercalated in this structure are localized in M2 site [224].

Nasicon type materials show low thermal expansion behavior, which was exploited in some of the applications of these materials. These materials are considered as attractive candidates for thermal shock, high-energy lasers, precision optics household ovenware and giant telescope mirrors [225, 226]. The reports pertaining to the thermal expansion studies are summarized below. Alamo and Roy have reported the thermal expansion behavior of compositions Na1?xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 B x B 1) and Na1?4zZr2-z P3O12 (0 B Z B 0.5). The thermal expansion is found to be dependent on the composition and the lowest value of thermal expansion coefﬁcient, a, was found for x = 0.33 and z = 0.125 compositions [225]. Roy et al. have reported near zero thermal expansion ceramic materials belonging to CTP family (the compositions belonging to CaTi4P3O12 structure are abbreviated as CTP). Table 1 gives the thermal expansion coefﬁcients of some of the Nasicon materials [226, 227]. Agrawal and Stubican have reported the preparation of single phase Ca0.5Zr2P3O12, its thermal expansion behavior and the effect of MgO and ZnO addition on the sintering behavior and thermal expansion characteristics [228]. Thermal expansion study of AZr2P3O12 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) by high temperature X-ray diffractometry and dilatometry were reported by Lenain et al. [229]. Some of the members of this NZP family exhibited very low thermal expansion coefﬁcients (\1 9 10-6) including some negative values. The composition LiZr2P3O12 shows a phase transition around 60 °C [230]. Limaye et al. have studied the preparation and thermal expansion of M0.5Zr2P3O12 (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) [230]. These materials were synthesized by solid state and sol–gel methods. Thermal expansion study was carried out by dilatometry, high temperature X-ray diffractometry, and laser speckle techniques. The compositions Ca0.5Zr2 P3O12 and Sr0.5Zr2P3O12 have exhibited negative and positive thermal expansion coefﬁcients, respectively [230]. Srikanth et al. have investigated thermal expansion anisotropy and acoustic emission studies of NZP type of compounds [231]. The anisotropy of axial thermal expansion of these materials is believed to induce micro cracking. A direct correlation between micro cracking of ceramics and their anisotropic axial thermal expansion coefﬁcients was established by employing acoustic emission monitoring techniques [231].

Thermal expansion studies by high temperature X-ray diffractometry on the composition, A0.5M2(PO4)3 (A = Ca or Sr; M = Ti, Zr, Hf, or Sn) were reported by Govindan Kutty et al. DSC measurements on tin compounds indicate the occurrence of a diffuse phase transformation at high temperatures [232]. Woodcock et al. have reported the variable temperature neutron diffraction studies to pinpoint the mechanism of low thermal expansivity in the Nasiconrelated material, Sr0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [233]. The mechanism of low thermal expansivity in Sr0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was established which is in contrast to that observed in NaZr2(PO4)3 [231]. Subsequently, they have investigated the variable temperature neutron powder diffraction studies of K0.5Nb0.5Ti1.5 (PO4)3, Ba0.5Ti2(PO4)3, and Ca0.25Sr0.25Zr2(PO4)3. These compositions exhibit anisotropic low thermal expansion, which is attributed to the thermal expansivity of M1–O bonds [234].

We have reported the preparation, characterization, impedance, and thermal expansion studies of A0.5MSb (PO4)3 (A = Ca, Mn; M = Al, Fe, and Cr). These materials have been characterized by several methods such as powder XRD, IR, Raman, ESR, 31P-NMR, and Impedance spectroscopy. All these compositions crystallize in Nasicon type lattice. The thermal expansion of these samples is studied in the temperature range 30–500 °C and they exhibit near zero thermal expansion coefﬁcients [235, 236].

It is well known that CO2 gas is a typical greenhouse effect gas which leads to rise in global temperature. Similarly, sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas in the global atmosphere is a major source of acid rain. Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas for human health and destroys the survival environment of human being. In the view of global and environmental safety concerns, the development of CO2 and SO2 sensors is very important. Nasicon is a promising material for SO2 and CO2 sensors because of its high Na? conductivity even at low temperatures, no crack formation upon heating and cooling [237]. The high ionic conductivity of Nasicon is used in the fabrication of sensors where the Nasicon phase acts as solid electrolyte [238]. The electrolyte in combination with an auxiliary phase like metal carbonate or nitrate on one side (to detect CO2 or NO2) acts as the sensing electrode and a platinum electrode on the other side acts as reference electrode [239]. Since the original Nasicon composition, Na3Zr2PSi2O12 has high ionic conductivity, it is used in the form of dense pellet or thick ﬁlm in the sensing devices now [240, 241]. Several reports were published based on Nasicon materials as sensors for CO2, SO2, NO, NO2, NH3, and H2S gases [237, 242–245]. Proton conducting Nasicon phases like the hydronium Nasicons are used to detect hydrogen in air potentiometrically[246]. Hydronium Nasicons are obtained by the exchange ? of the mobile Na? or Li? ions with H? ions or with NH4 ions and subsequent heating [50, 247]. Nasicon compositions are also used for immobilization of radioactive waste [248–250], as membranes for ion sensitive electrode and sodium removal from aqueous waste streams [12, 251] and in coupling catalysis [252].

More than one thousand research articles have been published based on Nasicon type materials up to now. Globally, many research groups are still working on this important family for various aspects. Therefore, we have prepared this review with about 252 research articles which cover the most important aspects, i.e., structure, compositional diversity, evolution, synthesis, characterization, and applications of Nasicon type materials at one place.
