Renewable energy resources such as solar and wind power are promising due to their abundance and possibility of mitigating strong dependence on fossil fuels.1 However, those resources suffer from apparent drawbacks due to their transient natures and ﬂuctuations.2 An effective approach to handle this limitation is to use electrical energy storage systems (ESSs) that can efﬁciently store excessive energy and release it when needed. Among various ESS technologies, rechargeable batteries are capable of reversibly storing and releasing electrical energy without involving “Carnot” cycles, thus potentially allowing for high efﬁciencies.1

Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated over other rechargeable batteries for mobile electronics primarily due to their superior performance in power and energy densities.3 Nonetheless, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) could be more suitable for large-scale utility grid applications dealing with the energy storage of renewable resources. The primary reason is that device scalability is very critical for grid applications, and various advantages of SIBs including abundant resources, low material cost, and easy accessibility of new reserves could be crucial for the scalability. Beside the scalability, high power performance is another critical standard for batteries targeting grid applications because they are expected to fulﬁll high rate operations such as frequency regulation and load balancing maintenance. The standards in various aspects for ESS applications were recently suggested.4 For reference, the traditional ESSs for utility grids use pumped hydropower facilities. However, they are location-dependent and suffer from low efﬁciencies and inevitable large capital investment.

Considering that these two aspects scalability and power performance are very critical for utility grid applications, in this study, we investigate a vanadium-based NASICON (Sodium Super Ionic Conductor) material, namely Na3V2(PO4)3, as a SIB cathode material. Our the intrinsically well-deﬁned electrochemical studies show that NASICON channel ionic conductivity5 results in decent performance in speciﬁc capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. Also, theoretical calculations provide correlations between the crystal structure and electrochemical properties. Moreover, various analyzes at different temperatures show that Na3V2(PO4)3 holds good thermal stability, thus suggesting the safe nature of this material, which is also critical for large-scale utility grid applications.

Next, ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, Aldrich, 28.0 ∼ 30.0% NH3 basis) was slowly added to the solution to adjust its pH to 9 at which metal ions ◦ C to can be chelated by citric acid. Then, water was evaporated at 80 transform the solution from sol to gel. After the transformation, the ◦ C for 1 day. Once the gel became comgel was dried in an oven at 70 ◦ C for 5 h under nitrogen pletely dry, the gel was heat-treated at 350 atmosphere to remove CO2, H2O, and NH3. After this step, the compound was ground once again in a mortar to ensure uniform mixing ◦ C under between precursors. Finally, the powder was annealed at 700 nitrogen atmosphere for 12 h to produce the ﬁnal compound.

Characterization of Physical Properties.— In order to obtain the crystal structure of the compound, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed using a conventional X-ray diffractometer (D/MAXRB, 12 kW) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10 ∼ 60 ◦ with ◦ / min. A multi-purpose attachment X-ray diffraca scan rate of 1 tometer (RIGAKU, D/MAX-2500) and a high/low temperature X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU, D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation were used for Ex-situ electrochemical and In-situ thermal XRD analyzes, respectively. The morphology of the compound was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Philps, XL30 FEG). The thermal stability of the compound was tested by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) meaC/min. surements under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 The infrared (IR) spectra was obtained using an FT-IR Spectrometer (Jasco, FT/IR-4100, Japan) under a transmission mode based on the KBr pellet method in the range of 550 ∼ 2000 cm

Electrochemical Tests.— In order to evaluate the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)3, 2032 coin-type half-cells with thin sodium disks used as both the reference and counter electrodes were prepared. For this, a slurry was prepared by mixing 75 wt% of the active material, 15 wt% of super P, and 10 wt% poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was cast onto aluminum foil using the doctor blade technique. The cast samples were dried ◦ in a vacuum oven at 70 C for 12 h. The mass loading of the active material was typically ∼ 1.5 mg/ cm2. The ﬁnal cells were assembled by sandwiching polyethylene separators (Celgard 2400) between both electrodes in an argon-ﬁlled glove box. 1 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) in propylene carbonate (PC) was used as electrolyte.

Density Functional Theory for Voltage calculations.— In order to obtain insight into the operational potentials and formation energy in conjunction with the crystal structure, spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)6 with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.7 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)8 exchange-correlation functional was used with the Hubbard Ucorrections in the rotationally invariant form introduced by Dudarev.9 The effective single U-J parameter of 4.2 eV was used for vanadium atom. In previous calculations for vanadium phosphates includ12 a smaller ing (LiV(PO4),10 Li3V2(PO4)3, value of U parameter (3.1 eV) was used for vanadium following the Wang et al.’s approach13,14 and results in the underestimated redox potentials compared to those observed in the experiments. The underestimated potentials probably originate from the improper value of the U parameter since Wang et al. estimated the U value from the experimental formation enthalpies of vanadium oxides that typically have smaller inductive effects compared to those of vanadium phosphates that locate polyanions next to vanadium. In order to reﬂect the stronger inductive effect in Na3V2(PO4)3, in this study, we used a higher U parameter of 4.2 eV. Indeed, Kuang et al. reported that a larger value of U parameter (4.0 eV) gives more consistent results with experiments for Li9V3(P2O7)3(PO4)2.15 A plane-wave basis with an energy cutoff of 520 eV was used, and a 2× 2× 1 k-points mesh was sampled for well converged energy values. All calculations were performed in a ferromagnetic ordering. The calculated crystal structures were visualized using the VESTA program.16 We assumed a ferromagnetic ordering for all of calculations since the magnetic structure of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 has not been reported. In fact, the calculated energy difference between ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering turned out to be less than 3 meV per formula unit, thus implying that the magnetic structure is insigniﬁcant for the energy calculation of Na3V2(PO4)3. The insigniﬁcant nature of magnetic structure is attributed to the large separation of metal atoms in the NASICON structure,17 and the weak magnetic interactions were indeed experimentally observed for isostructural Li3Fe2(PO4)3.18

the as-synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3. The XRD pattern was well-indexed to the R-3m space group under the rhombohedral NASICON structure with a = b = 8.7306 Å and c = 21.7863 Å. Rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 has a three-dimensional framework in which alkali metal ions can easily diffuse through well-deﬁned ion channels. As illustrated in Fig. 1b and 1c, octahedral VO6 corner-shares with tetrahedral PO4, which builds up [V2(PO4)3] units in the c-axis direction and each [V2(PO4)3] unit is interconnected through PO4 to the same neighboring units. Na ions selectively occupy Na1 and Na2 sites. While Na1 is located between [V2(PO4)3] units along the c-axis, Na2 is located at the same z value as the phosphorous atoms.19,20 If Na ions occupy all of the Na1 and Na2 sites, total four Na ions can be contained within each formula unit of Na4V2(PO4)3, one for Na1 site and three for Na2 sites. However, Na3V2(PO4)3 is more favorable to be synthesized due to the stable oxidation state of V3+ compared to the relatively unstable state of V2+ in Na4V2(PO4)3. In the crystal structure of Na3V2(PO4)3, one Na ion occupies Na1 site (1.0 occupancy) and two Na ions occupy Na2 site (0.67 occupancy). This will be described more in detail when the DFT results are discussed.

An SEM image of the as-synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3 (Fig. 1a inset) shows that the particle size is randomly distributed within the range of 1 ∼ 5 μm. The formation of the designated material was also conﬁrmed by an FT-IR analysis and the result is shown in Fig. 2 . The

-O2− vibration from V3+ bonds in VO6 octahedra was detected at 629 −1. The presence of P-O bonds of PO4 tetrahedra −1 and 979 cm cm −1 and 1048 cm −1. The infrared bands in was detected at 575 cm the range of 1150 ∼ 1250 cm −1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of PO4 units.21 The XRD and FT-IR analyzes indicate that the as-synthesized compound by the sol-gel method was properly synthesized.

In order to evaluate this material as a SIB cathode, the electrochemical measurements were carried out, and their data are presented in Fig. 3. In the ﬁrst cycle, the galvanostatic characterization (Fig. 3a) measured at a C/5 rate (1C: each charge or discharge sweep takes 1 h) shows clear plateaus around 3.4 V with charging and discharging capacities of 117.4 and 84.8 mAh/g, respectively. From the observed speciﬁc capacities, it is found that 2.0 and 1.4 Na ions per each formula unit of Na3V2(PO4)3 participate in the charging and discharging processes in the ﬁrst cycle. For reference, the theoretical capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is 117.6 mAh/g when two Na atoms

tributed to the well-developed three-dimensional channel structure, as we initially expected from its NASICON structure. It is noteworthy that by utilizing the efﬁcient Na ionic transport, this material exhibits the good rate performance even with micrometer-scale particles in the absence of carbon-coating. The rate performance is superior to that of most of other SIB cathodes23,28 and is even comparable to that of most Li battery cathodes. We expect that the performance could be improved further by reduction of particle sizes.

The correlation between the potential proﬁle and crystal structure was investigated further using the DFT calculations. For this, we ﬁrst simulated the stable structures for various desodiated states (x = 0 ∼ 4, NaxV2(PO4)3). As discussed in Fig. 1, this compound contains two kinds of Na sites, Na1 and Na2. Within these two kinds of sites, total four sites are available for Na assignment such that one Na site is assigned to Na1 and three Na sites are assigned to Na2. First, our calculation indicates that the most stable sodium ordering of the Na3V2(PO4)3 turns out to be identical to that of Na3Ti2(PO4)3, where among three Na atoms, one occupies the Na1 site and the other two occupy two of the three Na2 sites.29 As for the partially deintercalated states, NaxV2(PO4)3 with 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, the detailed occupancies of the sodium sites have never been reported. Thus, the most stable sodium ordering and occupancy of each sodium site were ﬁrst identiﬁed by ab initio geometry optimization. For this optimization, the Ewald summation technique30 was used as an input. For reference, as for the fully occupied state, Na4V2(PO4)3, it is likely to be very difﬁcult to directly synthesize the phase due to its mixed valence states of V3+ and unstable V2+ .31 However, this state can be achieved by electrochemical + reduction below 2 V vs. Na/Na

The voltage proﬁle was calculated by obtaining energy differences between the stable structures of different desodiated states (Fig. 4a and 4b).34 According to the calculation, Na ions are extracted in the sequence from three Na ions at the Na2 sites to one Na ion at the Na1 site, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 4a. This sequence is associated with the relative energy difference between the Na1 and Na2 sites that was evaluated from the energy of a single vacancy at each site. The Na occupancy energy for the Na1 site is 130 and 75 meV/f.u. lower compared to those of the Na2 site with x = 3 and 1, respectively,

are presumed to be involved in the reaction for each Na3V2(PO4)3. We anticipate that the relatively smaller discharge capacity compared to that of the charge in the same cycle is due to the increased kinetic barriers probably resulted from the structural changes during the Na extraction. The increased kinetic barrier was suggested for the isostructural Na3Ti2(PO4)3 case.22 The Na ion locations involved in charging-discharging within the given crystal structure will be described later when DFT data are discussed. It is also noteworthy that the hysteresis gap between charging and discharging curves is only 0.05 V at a C/5 rate, which implies that this material allows for good electronic and ionic conduction. The observed operation potential and speciﬁc capacities render this material promising as a SIB cathode. A variety of SIB cathodes have been studied and following materials are most representative: NaVPO4F23 and Na2FePO4F24 exhibited speciﬁc capacities of 73 and 115 mAh/g with redox potentials around 4.0 and 3.0 V at C/7 and C/15, respectively. Despite the decent speciﬁc capacities, however, these SIB cathode materials suffer from inferior rate capabilities perhaps due to impaired electric conductivities originating from the ﬂuorine addition. As a layered structure, Nax[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2 exhibited a high capacity of 190 mAh/g around 2.75 V at C/15, but showed limited cycle life (78% retention after 30 cycles).25 It is also anticipated that the layered structures suffer from relatively inferior safety. Manganese-based materials have also been investigated, and Na4Mn9O18 exhibited 128 mAh/g between 2.0 and 4.0 V at C/10. But, the operation potential was not exclusively deﬁned.26 As a vanadiumbased material, NaV6O15 exhibited a high speciﬁc capacity of 142 mAh/g in the range of 1.5∼ 4.0 V at C/7 but suffered from poor cycle life (20% retention after 30 cycles).27

As shown in Fig. 3b, this material exhibits decent cycling performance. When cycled at a 1C rate, a reversible capacity of 66.5 mAh/g was retained throughout 50 cycles: After 50 cycles, only 2.7% of the initial capacity was lost, indicating that Na insertion/extraction within this material is highly repeatable. During these cycles, the columbic efﬁciency increases from 94.4% at the ﬁrst cycle to 97.5% after 50 cycles. The efﬁcient Na insertion/extraction based on the welldeﬁned channels also results in good rate capability. As shown in Fig. 3c and summarized in Fig. 3d, capacities were measured at various c-rates. Even at 1C and 10C rates, speciﬁc capacities of 61.9 and 31.7 mAh/g are retained. This indicates that even when the current density increases by 10 and 100 times with respect to 0.1C, 75 and 38% of the original capacity are preserved, respectively. When the c-rate returns to 0.2C after the high rate tests, the original capacity is recovered, again suggesting that Na insertion/extraction with this material is robust. The decent cycling and rate performance are at-

indicating that the Na2 sites are mainly active in the composition region of 1 ≤ x ≤ 3. This trend of site occupancy is consistent with the previous report for isostructured Na3Ti2(PO4)3 in that the Na1 site is fully occupied but Na2 site is empty at the desodiated compound, Na1Ti2(PO4)3.35

Obviously, for the case of the as-synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3, only two Na ions are extracted from the Na2 sites because only two out of the three available Na2 sites are initially occupied by Na ions. Based on these structural characters, the calculation gives three plateaus for NaxV2(PO4)3, 1.84 V (3 ≤ x ≤ 4), 3.08 V (1 ≤ x ≤ 3), and 4.34 V (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), and the second plateau (1 ≤ x ≤ 3) matches with the plateau observed in the experiment, which corresponds to the two-phase reaction between Na1V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3. The two-phase reaction was supported by the formation energies of intermediate structures with respect to those of the initial and ﬁnal phases (Fig. 4b). The convex hull for the lowest formation energy at each desodiated state in the entire x range of 1 ≤ x ≤ 3 indicates that the formation of the two end phases is most energetically favorable, and the two-phase reaction between Na1V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)3 is therefore preferred. For the calculation of the minimum energy structure at each composition, total energy was calculated for an unit cell containing 6 formula units of Na3V2(PO4)3. For this, 20 lowest electrostatic energy conﬁgurations determined by the Ewald summation were used as an input for geometry optimization.30 Indeed, the preference of two-phase reactions between those two phases was veriﬁed by Ex-situ electrochemical XRD data, which will be discussed in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy that the calculated voltages are lower than the experimental ones by ∼0.3 V. These underestimated voltages are in similar tendency to those of the recent reports for Na3V2(PO4)3 (0.4 V)11 and Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.65 V)22 that used the same U-parameter for vanadium. This tendency is attributed to the strong inductive effect of six PO4 groups that surround each vanadium octahedron in the NASICON structure.

The crystal structure was monitored in a more stepwise manner by obtaining XRD spectra at different potentials during charging and discharging in the ﬁrst cycle (Fig. 5). A couple of points are noteworthy from these Ex-situ XRD data: First, as indicated from a single ﬂat plateau in the galvanostatic measurements, this material undergoes two-phase reactions in the process of charging and discharging. During the charging process, the peaks corresponding to Na3V2(PO4)3 (black dotted lines) gradually decrease and those corresponding to Na1V2(PO4)3 (gray dotted lines) continuously grow. During the discharging process, these peak intensity changes take place reversibly, verifying that the two-phase reaction is reversible. Second, from the peak analyzes for the end phases, it was found that as the material undergoes the phase transformation, the lattice parameters are changed from a = b = 8.7306 Å, c = 21.7863 Å (pristine) to a = b = 8.4272, c = 21.4871 (desodiated). The unit cell volume also decreases from

Figure 6. TGA/DSC data of (a) the pristine and (b) the desodiated states.

Thermal stability of this material was also thoroughly investigated because safety has become increasingly critical for large-scale battery applications. To this end, TGA and DSC were performed for the as-synthesized and desodiated phases. As shown in Fig. 6a and 6b, TGA data indicate that only 1.6 and 1.27% of the initial mass were

lost for the as-synthesized and desodiated phases, respectively, dur◦ C. Also, DSC data for both ing the temperature increase up to 450 phases conﬁrm that this material does not encounter any phase transformations in the same temperature range as it does not show any endothermic/exothermic peaks.

The excellent thermal stability of Na3V2(PO4)3 was veriﬁed further by In-situ thermal XRD analyzes. XRD data were obtained at various temperatures in the temperature range of 25 ∼ 450 ◦ C for the as-synthesized (Fig. 7a) and desodiated (Fig. 7b) states. All of the XRD data measured in this temperature range exhibit the same peak locations, indicating that no secondary phases are formed. Both pristine and desodiated of main peaks are well-indexed as in Fig. 1a. However, it was observed that lattice parameters corresponding to most crystal orientations increase, as the XRD peaks shift to lower 2 θ values. The increase in the lattice parameters originates from more signiﬁcant lattice vibrations upon heating. Overall, the decent thermal stability of this material is ascribed to the stable P-O bonding.36,37 Although basic electrochemical data with this structure were reported,32 comprehensive electrochemical and thermal investigation in conjunction with theoretical calculations have never been reported.

We report NASICON structured Na3V2(PO4)3 as a SIB cathode. It was observed that after the initial period that shows the discrepancy between charging and discharging capacities, ∼1.4 Na per each Na3V2(PO4)3 reversibly participate in the charging and discharging processes, which corresponds to a capacity of 84.8 mAh/g. The intrinsically well-deﬁned channel structure endows this material with decent cycling and rate performance. Moreover, owing to the stable C, P-O bonding, this material shows decent thermal stability up to 450 thus suggesting the safe character during cell operations. Overall, this material holds various advantages attractive for large-scale ESSs.
