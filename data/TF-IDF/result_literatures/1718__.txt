Lithium ionic conductive solid electrolyte discs based on NASICON-typeLi1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.1 - 0.9) were prepared by a wet-chemical route at 1173 - 1273K.
Crystalline phase, density, and electrical conductivity of the sintered discs were systematicallyinvestigated.
Single phase of LiTi2(PO4)3 systems were obtained at the calcination temperaturesabove 773K.
Maximum conductivity 7.3 x 10-4 S/cm at 303K and activation energy of 0.30eVwere obtained for the Li1.25Ga0.25Ti1.75(PO4)3 discs sintered at 1223K.
Recently high energy density and long life batteries using solid electrolytes have been requested.
Lithium ion conductors especially are promising as the electrolyte for this purpose .
It is wellknown that NASICON(Na3Zr2Si2PO12) is a good three–dimensional sodium ion conductor based onthe parent compound Na3Zr2P3O12(NZP) .
The usual structure of these compounds isrhombohedra, space group R3c, but in some particular cases they also show a low temperaturephase of lower symmetry .
In both phases the framework is built up by M2(PO4)3 units inwhich two MO6 octahedral and three PO4 tetrahedral share oxygen atoms.
Lithium analoguesof Na3Zr2P3O12(NZP), exhibits a low ionic conductivity because a Li+ ion is too small in size tomigrate freely in their three-dimension network structure.
The ionic conductivity for the system isgreatly increased when Zr4+ in LiZr2(PO4)3 is replaced by the smaller Li+ ion.
Since tunnels inLiTi2(PO4)3 are more suitable size for the lithium ion migration .
In general, Li+ conductivity ishigher and activation energy lower in rhombohedra phases.
Activation energies for lithium motiondecreases when the tetravalent M cations replaced with Ti4+.
In this paper, high lithium ion conductive solid electrolyte discs based on NASICON-typeLi1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.1 - 0.9) could be prepared by a wet-chemical route at 1173 - 1273K, andtheir phase, ionic conductivity, activation energy and density are investigated.
Compounds with composition Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3, with x = 0.1 - 0.9 were synthesized by a sol-gelmethod as shown in Fig.1.
 Aqueous solutions of LiNO3, TiO(OCCH3CHCOCH3)2, Ga(NO3)2･8H2O, TiO2(rutile), Li3(PO4) and (NH4)H2PO4 in stoichiometric ratios were mixed together to forma sol, which was dehydrated at 348K for about 3h to form a viscous gel .
The gel was thendried at 393K for 12h to form a fine dry xerogel powder, which was then ground and calcined at 773K for 3h.
The calcined material was ground again and ballmilled for 4h.
The powder was pressed into sample discs under520MPa, and finally sintered at 1173 - 1273K for 6h in air.
Theywere characterized by means of thermogravimetry differentialthermal analysis (TG-DTA) (Rigaku TG8120), X-ray diffraction(XRD) (XD-D1, Shimadzu Ltd), field emission scanningelectron microscopy (FE-SEM) (JIR-5500, Jeol Ltd), and ACcomplex impedance techniques(HIOKI 3521 Z), and so on.
Figure 2 shows XRD patterns of Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.1 -0.9) sintered at 1173 - 1273K for 6h in air.
All diffraction lineswere indexed based on a rhombohedral structure with a spacegroup of R3c.
When the discs were sintered at 1173K, thesingle phase solid electrolyte was formed between x = 0 and x =0.4, while the impurity phases of LiTiPO5 and GaPO4(hexagonal) appeared at the higher content ratio of x > 0.5.While, for the discs sintered at 1223K, the single phase solidelectrolyte was formed between x = 0.25 and 0.35. 
On theother hand, when the discs were sintered at 1273K, the singlephase solid electrolyte was formed up to x = 0.2, while theimpurity phases of LiTiPO5 and GaPO4 (orthorhombic)appeared for x > 0.4.
Figure 3 shows the TG-DTA curves of the Li1.2Ga0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 xerogel powder before heat treatment at 773K.
The sampleshowed weight loss in the examinedtemperature range between 373 and673K.
The TG curve was due to theseparated organics.
In contrast, DTApeak was appeared at around 873 -973K.
The DTA curves were due tobe crystallized.
All the other samples ofTG-DTA curves were similar in shapefor Li1.2Ga0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3.Figure 4 shows the SEM image of the surface of theLi1.3Ga0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 sintered at 1173K.
Similar sizedparticles with a mean particle size of about 1μm wereshown.
The particle size was increased by increasingthe sintering temperature and content of Ga3+, butsimilarly sized particles were not observed.
Fig.5shows the relation between the relative density of thesintered discs and the x value for the Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3systems.
Relative density of LiTi2(PO4)3 (x=0) was aslow as 55%.
Relative density was increased until formed up to x = 0.3, while relative density wasdecreased for x > 0.4, as impurity phases appeared for x > 0.4. 
Fig.6 shows variation of latticeconstants a(A) and c(A) for the Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 discs at 1173K.
The lattice constants a(A) andc(A) increased with the increase in Ga3+ up to x = 0.4 because the ionic radius of Ga3+ was slightlylarger than that of Ti4+.
The single phase was formed up to x=0.4, while an impurity phase appearedfor x > 0.5. 
The replaceable limit for a Ga3+ ion was around x = 0.4.Figure 7 shows the electrical conductivity results withx in the Li1+xGaxTi2-x(PO4)3 systems at 303K.
Theconductivity was greatly enhanced by Ga3+substitution.
The maximum conductivity of ca.
7.3×10-4 S/cm and activation energy of 0.30eV at303K was obtained for the Li1.25Ga0.25Ti1.75(PO4)3discs prepared at 1223K.
In order to clarify theeffect of high densification on the conductivityincrease, Li3PO4 or TiO2 (rutile type) (2, 5, 10 wt%)was used as a binder .
They were added toLi1.25Ga0.25Ti1.75(PO4)3 sintered 1223K, which had themaximum conductivity.
The conductivity of all ofthese samples with binder was lower than the diskwithout binder in which the maximum conductivitywas as high as 7.3×10-4 S/cm at 303K.
LiTi2(PO4)3 showed low ionic conductivity and density in the sintered discs.
The partial substitutionof Ti4+ site with Ga3+ in the LiTi2(PO4)3 system was very effective for the enhancement of theconductivity.
The maximum conductivity of ca.
7.3×10-4 S/cm and activation energy of 0.30eV at303K was obtained for the Li1.25Ga0.25Ti1.75(PO4)3 discs prepared at 1223K.
