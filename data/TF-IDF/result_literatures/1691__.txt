Until now, many types of solid electrolytes that conduct monoanddivalent ions have been developed since 1838, and some ofthese electrolytes are expected to be applied to electrical devices,such as rechargeable batteries (Li+ ion conductor), fuel cells (H+3or O2- ion conductors), and chemical sensors (many kinds of cationand anion conductors).
However, they have a potential disadvantagein lower chemical stability (e.g., explosive accidents for Li+ ionbatteries and deterioration in gas sensing with monovalent ionconductor) when compared with higher valency ionic conductorsthat are composed of only tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexavalent cations.
Therefore, if a solid electrolyte with high-ionic conductivity isdeveloped by selecting only such high-valency ions, it would be asuperior candidate for new types of components for various devices.
In 1995, the field of solid electrolyte research experienced adiscovery of a trivalent ion conductor of Sc3+ ion conductingSc2(WO4)3 solid.
Since this discovery, a variety of trivalent cationconductors have been reported.
Although tetravalent Zr4+ ionconductions in Zr2O(PO4)2,ZrNb(PO4)3, and ZrM(PO4)3 (M )Nb and Ta) have been reported since the year 2000, the Zr4+ ionconductivities in these solids were still appreciably lower (<10-4Sâcm-1) than that for mono- and divalent cations (>10-4 Sâcm-1),so that the enhancement of the Zr4+ ion conductivity will be requiredfor successful application in such electrical devices.
Here, we reporttwo potential ways for improving the Zr4+ ion conduction incrystalline solids: one is the expansion of the ion conductionpathway in the structure and the other is the reduction of strongelectrostatic interactions between the conducting Zr4+ ion and thesurrounding counter O2- anions.
In this Communication, we selected W6+ having larger ionic size(ionic radius: 0.056 nm [coordination number (CN): 4]13) and alsohigher valence compared to P5+ (0.031 nm [CN: 4]13) as a keycation for realizing the above-mentioned two potential ways simultaneously.
Zr4+ ion conducting properties of the Zr1-x/4TaP3-xWxO12solid, where the P5+ sites in NASICON14-type ZrTa(PO4)3 werepartially replaced with W6+, were investigated.
From the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses of theZr1-x/4TaP3-xWxO12 (0.0 e x e 0.2) solids prepared, it was foundthat single phase NASICON-type structures were successfullyobtained for the samples with x < 0.15, and the lattice volumelinearly increased with increase in x.
In contrast, the samples withx g 0.15 resulted in a two phase mixture of NASICON-typephosphate and TaPO5, without any lattice expansion of theNASICON-type phase compared with the case for the single phasesample (x ) 0.1).
These results clearly indicate that the solidsolubility limit for W6+ on P5+ sites is ca.x ) 0.1.
Figure 1 displays the compositional dependence of the electricalconductivity at 873 K for the Zr1-x/4TaP3-xWxO12 solids (0.0 e xe 0.2).

In the two-phase mixture region (x > 0.1), theconductivity was drastically reduced in comparison with that forthe sample with x ) 0.1. A significant reduction in conductivitythat appeared between the compositions at x ) 0.10 and 0.15 isascribed to the formation of low-conductive TaPO5 (the conductivityof TaPO5 is depicted in Figure 3), which prevents Zr4+ ionconduction in the solids.
(The direct demonstration of Zr4+ ionconduction in Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 (x ) 0.1) is described below.

This phenomenon also supports the idea that the compositional limitfor obtaining the single-phase NASICON-type structure is x ) 0.1.
For the purpose of identifying the conducting species in theZr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid, which shows the highest conductivityamong the samples prepared, the polarization behavior wasinvestigated by measuring the time-dependent dc to ac conductivityratio  in oxygen (PO2: 105 Pa) and helium (PO2: 12 Pa)atmospheres at 873 K.
This method can provide information as tothe type of charge carrier conduction in the solid.
The ódc/óac ratiowas reduced to values less than 0.005 in both atmospheres after 30min,which suggests that the conducting species in the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12solid is limited to cationic species, that is, Zr4+, Ta5+, P5+, andW6+.
To directly demonstrate Zr4+ ion conduction in theZr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid, dc electrolysis was carried out byapplying a dc voltage of 4 V for 380 h at 923 K, which is higherthan the decomposition voltage of ca.1.4 V.
Here, the dc electrolysiswas conducted at 923 K, which was 50 K higher than that for theabove polarization measurement to shorten the electrolysis periodby enhancing the Zr4+ ion conductivity.
By applying a dc voltagehigher than the decomposition voltage, only the conducting cationspecies is forced to continuously and macroscopically migratetoward the cathodic direction, and as a result, evidence of themigration of the conducting cationic species can be found at ornear the cathodic surface.
After the dc electrolysis, line electronprobe microanalysis (EPMA) measurements of the electrolyzedpellet were performed, and the results are depicted in Figure 2. 
Aclear segregation was observed only for Zr near the cathodic surface.
Zr segregation inside of the sample pellet indicates that Zr4+migrated from the anodic side through the sample and was notgenerated by sample decomposition at the cathodic surface.
Thisresult clearly demonstrates that only Zr4+ ion migration occurs inZr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12. 
Furthermore, the cation transference numberis estimated to be higher than 0.995 from the ódc/óac ratio after 30min, so that it is clear the conducting species in Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12is only the tetravalent Zr4+ ion.
The temperature dependence of Zr4+ ion conductivity for theZr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid is shown in Figure 3 with the correspondingdata for ZrTa(PO4)3, TaPO5, and representative conductivitiesfor the divalent oxide anion in yttria stabilized zirconia(YSZ) and calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ),4 which have alreadybeen applied as oxygen-gas detecting elements of commercializedoxygen sensors used in the automobile and steel industry fields.
The Zr4+ ion conductivity of Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 at 873 K wasapproximately 19 times as high as that of ZrTa(PO4)3, and the valueis comparable to those of practically utilized divalent oxide anionconducting YSZ and CSZ.
The average activation energy (48.7kJâmol-1 at a temperature range between 723 and 873 K) forZr4+ ion conduction in Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 is lower than that inZrTa(PO4)3 (55.9 kJâmol-1 at same temperature range), indicatingthat smooth Zr4+ ion conduction in the NASICON-type structureis realized for the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid by expansion of theNASICON-type crystal lattice.
In addition, the higher valence stateof W6+ over P5+ is effective for enhancement of the Zr4+ ionconductivity and lowering of the activation energy, because theelectrostatic interactions between the mobile Zr4+ cations andsurrounding O2- anions are reduced by the enlargement of theeffective valence state of (P, W), which attracts the O2- ionssurrounding mobile Zr4+ ions in addition to expanding the NASICONcrystal lattice.
