We report the electrochemical performance of porous NASICON-type Li3Fe2(PO4)3 thin films to be used as acathode for Li-ion microbatteries.

Crystalline porous NASICON-type Li3Fe2(PO4)3 layers were obtained by radiofrequency sputtering with an annealing treatment.

The thin films were characterized by XRD, SEM, andelectrochemical techniques.

The chronoamperometry experiments showed that a discharge capacity of88 mAhg−1 (23 μAhcm−2) is attained for the first cycle at C/10 to reach 65 mAhg−1 (17 μAhcm−2) after10 cycles with a good stability over 40 cycles.

In this work, we report the fabrication of mesoporousNASICON-type Li3Fe2(PO4)3 thin film by radio frequencysputtering.

The electrochemical studies suggest that afterannealing, the crystallized layer is also composed ofLiFePO4(OH), which is able to react reversibly with Li+.

In the first cycle, the discharge capacity reaches about88 mAhg−1 (23 μAhcm−2) at C/10 and attains 65 mAhg−1(17 μAhcm−2) after 10 cycles.

The electrochemical characterizations also reveal a good stability suggesting that thismaterial can be used as a cathode for Li-ion microbatteries.
