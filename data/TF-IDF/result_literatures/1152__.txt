Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is one of the most important cathode materials for sodiumion batteries, delivering about two Na extraction/insertion from/into the  unit structure. To understand the mechanism of sodium storage, a detailed  structure of rhombohedral Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  and its sodium extracted phase of  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  are investigated at the atomic scale using a variety of advanced  techniques. It is found that two different Na sites (6b, M1 and 18e, M2)  with different coordination environments co-exist in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , whereas  only one Na site (6b, M1) exists in NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . When Na is extracted from  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  to form NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , Na +  occupying the M2 site (CN = 8) is  extracted and the rest of the Na remains at M1 site (CN = 6). In addition, the  Na atoms are not randomly distributed, possibly with an ordered arrangement  in M2 sites locally for Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . Na +  ions at the M1 sites in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   tend to remain immobilized, suggesting a direct M2-to-M2 conduction  pathway. Only Na occupying the M2 sites can be extracted, suggesting about  two Na atoms able to be extracted from the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  structure. 

 Lithium  resource  is  limited  and  unevenly  distributed  in  a  few  countries, while sodium is the sixth richest element and widely  distributed  on  the  earth,  suggesting  that  sodium-ion  batteries  are  more  sustainable,  crust  and  economical  than  lithium-ion  batteries  for  large-scale  stationary  batteries. [ 1 ]   An  increasing number  of  researchers  are  realizing  the  importance  of  sodium-ion  batteries.  Numerous electrode materials for sodiumion  batteries  have  been  tested  in  the  last  few years. [ 1,2 ]  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  with NASICON  structure, which has large interstitial channels  for  fast  Na +   ion  migration, [ 3 ]   shows  a  very  ﬂ at  voltage  curve  with  a  plateau  at  around  3.4  V   vs .  Na + /Na  (similar  as  the  plateau  voltage  of  LiFePO 4  vs.   Li + /Li)  and  superior electrochemical performance. The  capacity is about 107 mAh/g, which corresponds to approximate two Na extraction/ insertion  from/into  the  structure. [ 3b , 4 ]   The  structure evolution of the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  electrode during cycling is a typical two-phase  transformation  between  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . [ 4 ]   Part  of  Na  atoms  remains  in  the  lattice,  which  cannot  be  completely  extracted from the structure by the electrochemical method, even with charge voltage  as high as 4.5 V vs. Na + /Na (Figure S1). Thus, chemical oxidation  method  was  carried  out  alternatively.  However,  X-ray  diffraction (XRD) results (Figure S2) show that when excess strong  oxidant NO 2 BF 4  is employed, NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  , rather than V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is obtained. In addition, when the ratio of NO 2 BF 4 : Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  1,  a  mixture  with  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  obtained,  conﬁ rming that two Na can be easily extracted and the third one  is difﬁ cult to be extracted from the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  structure. The  Na +  ion diffusion mechanism in this type NASICON structured  material is still in dispute. [ 3a , 5 ]  To further understand the structure evolution and mechanism of Na +  ion diffusion, it is necessary to characterize the local structure and dynamics at atomic  scale, whereas it remains a challenge. [ 6 ]  

 Rietveld method is a well-established technique for quantitative phase analysis that is successfully used with X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. [ 7 ]  The application of XRD Rietveld method to  lithium/sodium-ion  battery  for  structure  analysis, [ 8 ]   has  provided insight into mechanism of lithium/sodium storage. Aberration-corrected  annular-bright-ﬁ eld  (ABF)  scanning  transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides a feasible access to  a direct interpretation of the atomic structure at sub-angstrom  resolution. ABF-STEM has been successfully applied to observe  lithium ions in LiFePO 4 , [ 9 ]  Li 4 Ti 5 O 12  [ 10 ]  and so on. [ 11 ]  Compared  with lithium ion, sodium ion has a lager radius and larger scattering cross-sections for electrons, allowing it to be readily seen  in  ABF-STEM.  Solid-state   6,7 Li  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spectroscopy  is  a  routine  method  for  characterizing the  local  structure  and  dynamics  of  Li  ions  in  crystalline  or  amorphous solids, which cannot be easily accessed by conventional  structural  and  electrochemical  approaches. [ 12 ]   However,   23 Na NMR studies are hampered by the reduced resolution due  to  the  larger  quadrupole  broadening.  Furthermore,  the  existence of magnetic moment from redox active center yields very  short relaxation times which are even less than the correlation  times  of  ion  exchange  process, [ 13 ]   making  it  difﬁ cult  to  gain  microscopic information on ion motions. [ 14 ]  

 Here,  in  order  to  understand  the  mechanism  of  sodium  storage  in  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  we  combined  the  above  mentioned  techniques  to  study  the  structure  evolution  and  kinetics  from  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   to  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   by  preparing  chemically  sodiumextracted Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . We identiﬁ ed the information of sodium’s  occupancy in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  and NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . The evolution of sodium’s  occupancy  was  directly  observed  by  ABF-STEM.  Then  we  used NMR to probe sodium site structure at room temperature.  Na nuclei spin dynamics and magnetic properties at various temperatures were also investigated from the analysis of  23 Na NMR line shifts and line shapes.  

With  the  decrease  of  temperature,  the  lattice  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   shrinks  a  little  bit  (see  Table  S2),  in  this  case,  Na  is  possibly  more  thermodynamically  favorable  occupying  the  M1  site  which  has  smaller polyhedral volume than that of M2 site (see Table S3).  Therefore, part of Na at M2 site will be driven to adjacent M1  site  at  a  lower  temperature  until  the  occupancy  at  M1  site  is  1.  The  chemically  sodium  extracted  sample  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   based  on  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   shows  different  XRD  patterns.  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  a  single  phase  and  well  crystallized,  too.  It  still  remains  the  rhombohedral structure with the space group of  3R c. The unit  cell  parameters  are  as  follows:  a  =  8.426  Å  and  c  =  21.720  Å.  The  volume  decreases  because  of  the  sodium  extraction  from  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  and this change is only by 8.26%. Rietveld reﬁ nedXRD  results  (Table   2 )  exhibit  that  the  reliability  factors  are  as  follows: R p  = 7.17, R wp  = 10.3 and R exp  = 4.39. In NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , Na  occupies only one site (M1), whose occupancy rate increases to  0.9448, whereas no Na atom occupies any M2 site. It indicates 

  Figure     1    shows  the  Rietveld-reﬁ ned  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   obtained  at  room  temperature.  The  crystal  parameters  are  summarized  in   Table    1  ,  Table    2  , and Table S1. It can be seen  that  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   sample  is  a  single  phase  and well crystallized. All the diffraction peaks  are  indexed  in  a  rhombohedral  system  with  the  space  group  of  3R c.  The  structure  is  built  on  a  3D  framework  of  VO 6   octahedra  sharing  all  the  corners  with  PO 4   tetrahedra  (Figure  S3).  Two  octahedral  VO 6   connected  with three tetrahedral PO 4  constitute a basic  unit named as a lantern. Each lantern is connected  with  six  other  lanterns,  generating  a  large interstitial space that can accommodate  sodium  ions.  The  reliability  factors  are  very  good (R p  = 3.30, R wp  = 4.22 and R exp  = 1.93).  The unit cell parameters are indicated as follows: a = 8.738 Å and c = 21.815 Å. In order  to clarify the occupancy of Na sites, the atom  positions  and  occupancy  were  reﬁ ned.  The  results (Table  1 ) show two different occupancies  of  Na  sites:  6b  sites  (Na 1 ,  M1)  and  18e  sites  (Na 2 ,  M2).  The  corresponding  occupancy rates are 0.8430 (M1 sites) and 0.7190  (M2  sites),  respectively.  Numerous  vacancies  offer  the  channel  of  Na  ion  transport,  resulting  in  classical  NASICON  structure. [ 15 ]   It  is  very  interesting  to  ﬁ nd  that  the  occupancy  rate  is  highly  dependent  on  the  temperature as shown in Table S1. For instance,  at 100 K, the corresponding occupancy rates that  Na  is  extracted  from  the  18e  sites.  The  occupancy  rate  in  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  higher  compared  with  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  which  may be due to partial Na located at M2 sites moves to M1 sites  upon Na extraction. In general, Na is extracted from M2 sites,  whereas Na posited at M1 sites is remained.     

 In order to directly investigate the atomic positions of Na, aberration-corrected  STEM  was  carried  out.   Figures     2  a  and  b  show  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  unit  structures  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  respectively,  which  are  deduced  from  Rietveld  reﬁ ned-XRD.  In  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  there  is  only  one  sodium  occupancy  site  (M1),  which  is  located  at  the  shoulder  of  ellipse.  In  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  two  different  Na  sites  are  located  at  M1  and  M2.  Sodium atoms in M2 should be located at inside the ellipse and  at  both  sides  of  the  ellipse’s  tips,  as  shown  in  Figure   2 a.  Highangle annular dark ﬁ eld (HAADF)-STEM images of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  along the [111] projection are shown in Figures   2 c  and  d,  respectively.  The  phosphorus  and  vanadium  atoms  can  clearly  be  visible.  The  patterns  are  in  good  agreement  with  the schematic diagram of structure, indicating that Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  have the same cage construction. On the basis  of  this  observation,  it  is  very  clear  that  after  Na  extraction,  the  skeleton  NASICON  structure  keeps  very  well.  However,  the  sodium atom cannot be observed in the HAADF-STEM images.  The information of Na atomic positions can be observed in the  ABF-STEM  images.  Figures   2 e–h  show  the  ABF-STEM  images  of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  along the [111] projection, and their  corresponding line proﬁ les. The patterns are the same as those  in the HAADF-STEM images. Only one sodium occupancy position is found in NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , whereas two different positions exist  in  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  In  both  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   samples,  Na atoms occupying 6b sites can be visible (marked by yellow circles in the Figures  2 e,f). In the ABF-STEM image of NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  no  Na  is  occupying  the  M2  sites,  whereas  Na  can  be  visible  in the ABF-STEM image of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . This analysis is in accordance  with  the  reﬁ ned-XRD  results.  Each  NASICON  structural  unit can accommodate four Na atoms, wherein one is located at  M1 sites and another three are located at M2 sites. In the ABFSTEM  image  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  the  sodium  occupying  the  inside  of  the  ellipse  can  be  clearly  visualized  (shown  in  the  blue  circles and identiﬁ ed by blue arrows). The sodium occupying both  sides of ellipse’s tips can not obviously be visualized. Therefore,  we study the corresponding line proﬁ les, and the image contrast  of the dark dots are inverted and displayed as peaks. The result  shows  one,  rather  than  two,  obvious  peak  of  sodium  atoms.  Nevertheless,  no  peak  can  be  found  in  the  corresponding  sites  of  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  This  observation  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  reﬁ ned-XRD  results,  which  indicates  that  the  occupancy  rate  of  M2 sites is only 0.7190, implying numerous vacancies and that  Na atoms would not completely ﬁ ll the M2 sites of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  In  addition,  the  Na  atoms  are  not  randomly  distributed  in  the  M2  sites  but  are  possibly  distributed  in  ordering  locally  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . In Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , the distances between the P peak  and nearest P/O peak are different: 0.45 and 0.61 nm for d1 and  d2,  respectively.  The  occupation  of  Na  atoms  in  the  M2  sites  between  the  P  atoms  and  nearest  P/O  atoms  increase  the  distance. In addition, the distances between the P peak and nearest  P/O peak are the same in NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , that is, 0.41 nm (d3 = d4),  which is less than the distances in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . To further conﬁ rm  this  interesting  phenomenon,  a  larger  area  of  the  ABFSTEM  image  of  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   is  shown  in  Figure  S4.  The  same  behavior is observed. When Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  transfers to NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  Na atoms occupying M2 sites are extracted from the NASICON  structure, whereas other Na atoms remain at M1 sites.

Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   powder;  this  spectrum  is  broad  and  featureless,  approximately  Lorentzian  line shape with a full width (Δν) at half magnitude (FWHM) of 30 kHz, which corresponds  to  the  central  transitions  (m  =  1/2  ↔  -1/2).  Whereas the m = ±3/2 ↔ ±1/2 satellite transitions are not observed here, possibly due to  the distributions of quadrupolar interactions  (site  distributions  at  Na  site,  according  to  ABF-STEM  analysis)  that  cause  the  satellite  peaks  to  be  smeared  out.  For   23 Na  nucleus  with  a  mediate  quadrupole  moment,  central  lines  are  primarily  broadened  from  various  contributions  associated  with  dipolar,  quadrupolar  interactions,  anisotropic  chemical  shielding,  paramagnetic  hyperﬁ ne  interactions  or  their  distributions.  Dipolar  interactions,  ﬁ rst  order  quadrupolar  interactions,  chemical  shift  anisotropies,  and  magnetic  hyperﬁ ne  couplings  associated  with  second  rank  tensors,  can  be  averaged  out  by  magic  angle  spinning  (MAS).  Figures   3 b  and   3 c   23 Na  MAS  show  the  room  temperature  spectra  for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  respectively. In Figure  3 a, we can see that the  static spectrum is overlapped by two components from two non-equivalent Na sites (M1  and M2), whereas in Figures  3 b and S5, the  MAS  spectrum  clearly  exhibits  two  distinct  peaks  attributed  to  non-equivalent  occupancies of  23 Na. The stronger peak positioned at  79 ppm corresponds to two Na atoms bonded  to a triangular prism site (M2), and the peak  at -9 ppm corresponds to one Na atom at the  octahedral site (M1). [ 16 ]  This line assignment  can be simply justiﬁ ed by the analysis of line  intensity,  coordination  numbers  (CN)  at  corresponding  crystallographic  sites  and  the  temperature dependency of MAS line shape.  The  octahedral  Na  site,  M1,  is  coordinated  by  six  oxygen  ions  connected  to  six  V  ions  in  M1  sites  while  it  is  eight  oxygen  ions  at  M2  sites.  With  the  different  local  chemical  and  topological  environments,  Na +   ions  will  exhibit distinct nucleus spin dynamic behaviors, which can be shown in  Figure    4  c and d  that  the  position  and  width  of  the  M2  peak  is  signiﬁ cantly  affected  by  heating  while  it  is  not  the  case  for  M1  peak.  Furthermore,  the  line  assignment  based  on  intensity  is  also  in  accordance  with  electrochemical  behaviors. [ 3b ]   Figure   3 c  shows  the   23 Na  central  line  splitting  of  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  which  is  a  signature  of  change  of  the  local  chemical  environments  and/or  sub-lattice  distortion  that  occurs  at  the  M1  sites  upon  the  extraction  of  Na +   from  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  Rietveld  reﬁ ned-XRD  and ABF-STEM.   

 To  examine  the  oxidation  states  of  vanadium  centers  and  better  understand  the  local  structural  features  at  the  Na  sites,  the  electronic  and  magnetic  properties  were  further  investigated  by  NMR  and  superconducting  quantum  interference  device  (SQUID)  at  various  temperatures.  Figure   4 a  shows  the  temperature  dependence  of  magnetic  susceptibilities  (χ)  for  both  as-prepared  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   compounds.  Their  paramagnetic  parts  of  temperature  dependence  follow  the  Curie-Weiss  law  (C-W):  χ −1   =  ( T + θ )/ C ,  where  θ  is  Weiss  temperature  and  C  is  Curie  constant.  Linear  leastsquare  root  ﬁ ttings  yield   θ  =  26  K  and   C  =  2.2  emu  K/Oe-f.u.  for Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3,  while  θ  = −112 K and  C  = 1.2 emu K/Oe-f.u.  for NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3  compound. Effective magnetic moments for V  ions can thus be obtained from Curie constants of 3.1 µ B  and  1.9  µ B   for  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  respectively. [ 17 ]   These  values  are  roughly  close  to  the  V 3+   spin  with  value  of  2.83  µ B   ( C theo   = 1 with 3 d  2  and S = 1) and V 4+  of 1.5 µ B . In this material,  the clear change of V oxidation states upon Na extraction suggests the capacity as the redox of vanadium center in this material. Figure  4 b shows the linear dependence of  23 Na NMR isotropic shifts versus magnetic susceptibility. Linear ﬁ ttings yield  zH sd  = 54 kOe/µ B  at the M2 sites in  positive hyperﬁ ne ﬁ elds:  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   and  253  kOe/µ B   at  the  M1  sites  in  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3   compounds, respectively. The shift in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  extrapolated  to  χ CW   =  0  is  32  ±  5  ppm.  This  difference  in  hyperﬁ ne  ﬁ elds  is in good agreement with their chemical environments where  the oxidation state of vanadium centers coordinated with Na at  M1 sites is higher than those coordinated with Na at M2 sites.  The isotropic shift can be described by δ iso  = δ cs  + δ sd  (T), where  δ cs   is  the  chemical  shift  ascribed  to  chemical  shielding.  δ sd   is  the shift originating from the transferred hyperﬁ ne interactions  with local magnetic moments of neighboring V ions due to  s-d   exchange  polarization.  Transfer  of  electron  density  from  the  V 3+  t  2g -like  orbitals  to  the  Na  3 s   orbital  gives  rise  to  a  positive  shift  (delocalization  mechanism).  The  above  analysis  on  local  environments  and  shift  mechanisms  explains  the  observed  larger   23 Na  shift  at  M2  site  than  that  at  M1  site.  Similar  paramagnetic  effects  on   6,7 Li  NMR  shifts  have  been  observed  in  lithium-ion batteries. [ 18 ]  

 The  analysis  of  MAS  central  line  width  data  is  non-trivial  since  the  MAS  spectra  might  be  superposition  of  two  components,  such  as  second  order  quadrupolar  and  anisotropic  paramagnetic broadening. [ 19 ]  In paramagnetic samples, the distribution  of  isotropic  part  of  bulk  magnetic  susceptibility  only  results in a line broadening of the resonance but no overall the  isotropic  shift.  The  anisotropic  line  broadening  in  paramagnetic  materials  was  considered  to  have  a  similar  mechanism  as  second  order  quadrupolar  coupling, [ 20 ]   which  turns  out  to  be very small under fast MAS. [ 6,21 ]  In contrast to line shift, the  broadening  of  the   23 Na  NMR  spectra  grows  non-linearly  with  respect  to  χ  unexpected  from  magnetic  broadening  mechanisms, thereby indicating a linear relation between  23 Na shifts  versus  line  width, [ 22 ]   as  shown  in  Figure   4 c.  Thus,  the  temperature  dependence  of  MAS  line  width  opens  another  possibility of the onset of atomic motion on a timescale comparable  to  the  reciprocal  of  linewidth  (in  Hz)  broadened  by  second  order  quadrupole  interactions. [ 23 ]   The  MAS  central  linewidth  (Δν)  broadened  by  second  order  quadruple  interaction  can  be  described  as: [ 24 ]  υΔ = 25   for   23 Na  nuclear  spin ( I  = 3/2), where ν 0  is Larmor frequency and C Q  is quadrupole  coupling constant. The thermal motion of Na + , which is directionally bonded in a group, will rotate or liberate the Na-O bond  between  the  ion  and  its  surrounding  neighbors  and  hence  decrease  C Q . [ 25 ]   For  simplicity,  we  treat  the  occupied  M2  as  a  point defect. In this case, the spatial symmetry of a point-charge  quadrupolar interaction is identical to that of the dipolar interaction. [ 26 ]  For thermally activated process of atomic motions in  solid  states,  the  correlation  time  for  ions  resident  on  a  lattice  follows  the  Arrhenius  equation: [ 27 ] Δ = ,  where  A  is  a  pre-exponential  factor  and   E  a   is  the  activation  energy.  For  a  range of correlation times as a function of temperature, broadening behavior should appear when the system approaches the  condition: ωτ ≈ 1   regime  for  this  case  (weakly  collision within the investigated temperature range), by plotting  the logarithm of linewidth versus 1/ T  (in Kelvin), it can immediately be seen the slope of the linear part of the line should be  the activation energy  E  a , as shown in Figure  4 d. Thus, the temperature  dependence  of  linewidth  can  be  described  in  terms  of  a  thermally  activated  hopping  process  with  very  low  activation energy of 6.8 kJ/mol (∼0.1 eV), much smaller than that in  other NASICON compounds. [ 28 ]  For the Na +  ion extracted compound, NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , where Na resides in M1 sites, Δν remains  almost constant in the temperature range of 295 ≤T ≤ 375 K (as  shown in  Figure    5  ), as expected from the fact that the Na +  ion  coordination environment at the M1 sites (CN = 6) is different  from  that  at  the  M2  sites  (CN =  8)  (also  see   Figure     6  ). [ 29 ]   Na +   ions  are  mostly  entrapped  in  the  M1  sites  due  to  the  shorter  average Na-O bond length and smaller polyhedral volume than those of M2 sites (Table S3), thereby demonstrating the structural effects on the mobility of ions. [ 2c , 3a , 28a ]  Dynamic behaviors  show that the Na +  ions tend to remain immobilized in the M1  sites, whereas those ions in the M2 sites become mobile via a  M2-M2  sodium-transport  mechanism  within  the  investigated  temperatures, which are in good agreement with the report of  Goodenough. [ 3a ]      

 We  investigate  the  Na +   ion  positions  at  atomic  resolution  and  their kinetics to further understand the mechanism of sodium  storage in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 . Combined with Rietveld reﬁ ned-XRD,  ABF-STEM,  and  NMR,  we  have  conﬁ rmed  that  there  are  two  different types of Na sites (6b, M1 and 18e, M2) with different  coordination  environments  in  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ,  while  there  is  only  one  type  of  Na  site  (6b,  M1)  in  NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 .  In  addition,  in Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , the Na atoms are not randomly distributed in  M2 sites, but possibly in an ordered arrangement locally. When  Na is extracted from Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  to form NaV 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , Na +  ion  located at the M2 site is extracted and the rest of Na remain at  M1 site. NMR analysis indicates that Na +  ion at the M2 sites in  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3  is mobile whereas Na +  ion at the M1 site is immobile,  suggesting  a  direct  M2  to  M2  conduction  pathway.  Only  Na  at  the  M2  sites  can  be  extracted  at  room  temperature,  corresponding  to  about  two  Na  extraction  from  the  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   structure while its skeleton structure still remains well, which  is consistent with the experimental observation of a capacity of  107 mAh/g and excellent cycling performance.  

The  rhombohedral  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   compound  was  synthesized  by  mixing  stoichiometric amount of NaH 2 PO 4  (Aldrich, 99.6%) and V 2 O 3  (Aldrich,  98+%). Chemically sodium extraction of the sample was accomplished  by reaction with a strong oxidant nitronium tetraﬂ uoroborate (NO 2 BF 4 ,  Aldrich,  98%).  Different  molar  ratio  of  NO 2 BF 4 :  Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3   was  selected.  More  details  of  experiments  are  described  in  our  previous  reports. [ 3b , 4 ]  

 The  structural  characterization  was  performed  using  an  X’Pert  Pro  MPD  X-ray  diffractometer  (Philips,  Netherlands)  with  Cu  Kα  radiation  (1.5405  Å).  The  aberration-corrected  scanning  transmission  electron  microscopy  (STEM)  was  performed  using  a  JEOL  2100F  (JEOL,  Tokyo,  Japan)  transmission  electron  microscope  operated  at  200  keV.  The  microscope  is  equipped  with  a  CEOS  (CEOS,  Heidelberg,  Germany)  probe  aberration  corrector.  The  attainable  spatial  resolution  of  the  microscope  is  90  picometer  at  an  incident  semiangle  of  20  mrad.  To  observe  Na  directly  using  ABF  collection  geometry,  the  acceptance  semiangle  in  this  study  was  ﬁ xed  between  10–20  mrad.  The  NMR  spectra  were  measured  in  the  temperature  range  between  295  and  373 K with a Bruker ADVANCE III spectrometer operating at a magnetic  ﬁ eld of 9.39 T. The chemical shift reference is NaCl powder (7.3 ppm).  Susceptibility measurements were taken with a Quantum Design MPMS  SQUID magnetometer between 5 and 400 K. Data were taken with the  samples cooled in the absence of an applied ﬁ eld (zero-ﬁ eld cooled) and  in the measuring ﬁ eld (ﬁ eld cooled at 1 Tesla).
