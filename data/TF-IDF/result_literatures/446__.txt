The severe instability with lithium (Li) anode of NASICON-structure Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) solid-state electrolyte (SSE) greatly hinders its practical applications in the all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) with high energy density and safety. In order to alleviate this issue, here we employed an artificial protective layer of LAGP glass on the surface of ceramic LAGP sheet to construct a surface amorphized electrolyte via a spin-coating co-sintering method. AC impedance test and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling of Li/electrolytes/Li symmetrical cell suggest that enabled by this glass layer, the surface amorphized LAGP can exhibit better compatibility with Li anode. In addition, with a poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolyte in the cathode side, at 0.1 C under 60 °C, the LiFePO4/Li ASSLB using surface amorphized LAGP can keep stable for 120 cycles with a retention of 93.6%, which is more than 13 times of the cell using ceramic LAGP (6.9%). The formation mechanisms of unstable interphases in LAGP/Li interface were briefly summarized, and probable reasons behind the good compatibility between and LAGP glass and Li were discussed.

Possessing the traits of nonflammable, wide electrochemical window and easy assembly, solid-state electrolytes including polymer, sulphide, oxide, and composite materials are generally expected to be the substitute of liquid electrolyte for the high energy density and safety demands [1]. Moreover, the consociation of ultra-thin lithium (Li) metal anode, solid-state electrolyte which prohibits Li dendrites, and designated cathode is a reliable way to achieve the next-generation high energy density all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) [2,3]. Among the candidate electrolytes, the oxide NASICON-type ionic conductor (LAMP, Li1+xAlxM2-x(PO4)3, M = Ti, Ge, Zr, etc.) is regarded to be the most promising solid electrolyte for commercial application of ASSLB as its excellent stability in air and water [4], relatively high conductivity (7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature) [5], easy sintering and densification [6].

Although the Li dendrite growth in batteries owing to the non-uniform deposition and dissolution of Li+ can be suppressed by the high shear modulus of solid electrolyte, there are still some challenges in ASSLB based on LAMP. Firstly, being contacted with the Li metal which has a high Fermi energy level, the germanium (Ge) or titanium (Ti) in LAGP or LATP undergoes irreversible degradation reactions at the lithium/electrolyte interface (Ge 4+ → Gex+, Ti4+ → Tix+) ceaselessly, which leads to an increase in the electrolyte impedance with time [7]. Secondly, the lithium dendrites may proliferate from the surface along the grain boundary into the interior under a high current density, and causes the reduction of beneath electrolyte [8]. Thirdly, in the process of charge and discharge, the volume expansion and contraction of Li metal will cause gradual accumulation of stress on the interface, which even deform fragments into electrolyte and further deteriorates the electrolyte/anode contact [9]. As a consequence, the unstable interface between LAGP and Li anode causes inferior ASSLB cycling performance.

To solve the issues mentioned above, various approaches have been proposed, involving the fabrication of host materials for Li+ injection, designing of electrolyte components, and construction of artificial protective layers. Kobayashi et al. [10] replaced the anode from Li metal to a Li3V2(PO4)3, avoiding the direct formation of metallic Li, and the amorphous LAGP was added into electrode materials to increase the connect between electrodes and electrolyte. However, its unsatisfactory discharge capacity (42 mAh g−1) and low cell work voltage plateau (1.7 V versus Li/Li+) run counter to the demands of ASSLB with high energy density. Yu et al. [11] substituted Al3+ to Y3+ (yttrium) and Ge 4+ or Ti4+ to Zr4+ (zirconium) in the crystal framework, obtaining a new relatively Li-stable electrolyte of Li1.15Y0.15Zr1.85(PO4)3. Despite that, the high cost of rare-earth element Y and complicated preparation procedures limit the commercial application of this electrolyte. For the widely studied artificial protective layers, such as ionic liquid electrolyte [12], gel electrolyte [13], and sputtered coatings [14,15], some of them are restricted to cost, process, or the structural integrity of ASSLBs. Recently, our group reported a composite electrolyte constituted of NASICON ionic conductors and dry polymers, which presented enhanced electrochemical stability and compatibility with Li anode [16]. Whereas, whether the polymer can resist the penetration of lithium dendrites has always been the focus of debate among researchers.

In this work, inspired by the researches about sulphide that glass electrolyte is more stable with Li metal than ceramic electrolyte [17], as well as the soften of glass LAGP at a certain temperature [18], a layer of amorphous LAGP was completely covered on the surface of the substrate ceramic LAGP electrolyte sheet via a facile and economic spin-coating co-sintering process to enhance its stability with Li anode. For comparison, a conventional lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) layer was also deposited by radio frequency sputtering (RF-sputtering) technique on the ceramic LAGP sheet surface. The results show that the stability with Li metal of surface amorphized LAGP is better than that of ceramic LAGP, and the continuous surface glass layer without grain boundary could inhibit the extension of the ionic-electronic conductive interphases into the electrolyte bulk, demonstrating a comparable Li protection effect to the LiPON layer. Consequently, the optimized ASSLB shows stable cycling performance using the surface amorphized LAGP electrolyte and Li anode. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ an electronically insulated amorphized LAGP glass layer with certain ionic conductivity at the surface modification of LAGP electrolyte in order to circumvent the intrinsic chemical stability issues of LAGP to Li metal.

The ceramic LAGP electrolyte sheet with the Li+ conductivity (σLi+) of 2.99 × 10−4 S cm−2 at 25 °C was prepared according to the reported method [19]. Typically, Li2CO3, Al(OH)3, GeO2, and H3PO4 (99.9%, Aladdin) were ball-milled within the stoichiometry of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 for 10 h at 400 rpm, and pre-sintered at 700 °C for 2 h to release impurities. Afterwards, the mixture were heated up in a platinum crucible at 1400 °C for 2 h to get the melts, and then quenched into the air to form LAGP glass. The reground fine glass powder were pressed into sheets with a mold, followed by the cold isostatic pressing of 200 MPa and sintered at 850 °C for 5 h to get the ceramic LAGP electrolyte sheet with the thickness of 250 μm.

The glass LAGP coated electrolyte sheet was prepared in three steps: firstly, the adhesive of cellulose nitrate ester (5% in ethanol/diethyl ether, Aladdin), glass powder, and ethanol (99.5%, Aladdin) were mixed with a weight ratio of 2:1:8 for 0.5 h to obtain the spin-coating paste. Secondly, the paste is printed onto the LAGP sheet by a spin-coating machine. After drying, the obtained samples were isostatic pressed under 300 MPa. Finally, the sheets covered with dry paste were heated at 600 °C for 48 h under the heating rate of 2 °C min−1 to slowly remove the organic ingredients and soften the glass powder. The surface amorphized LAGP electrolyte was marked as LAGP@glass.

The LAGP sheet protected by a LiPON (Li3.3PO3.9N0.17) layer with 3 μm thickness was prepared by RF-sputtering which can be found in the early reports [20]. The LiPON coated LAGP was marked as LAGP@LiPON hereinafter.

After finishing the anode protection of LAGP as described above, the LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode layer was coated on the cathode side of the electrolyte via doctor-blade method and drying under 105 °C for 24 h. Typically, LFP (99.5%, Dynanonic), Super-P, Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, 99.9%, Aladdin) and LiClO4 (99.9%, Aladdin) were mixed at weight ratio of 7:2:1 in acetonitrile (ACN) and stirred for 12 h to gain a well-distributed slurry. The PEO-LiClO4 polymer electrolyte was used as the binder and ionic conductor in the cathode layer with a LFP loading of 1.5 mg cm−2. The Li foil with the thickness of 80 μm, China Energy Lithium. Co., Ltd., was attached to the protected side of LAGP sheet. Finally, the electrodes were elicited by lugs, and the whole ASSLB was encapsulated in the aluminum plastic film which was isostatic pressed with a pressure of 50 MPa, afterwards.

The surface structure of LAGP, LAGP@glass and LAGP@LiPON were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The morphology and elemental analysis of the surface and cross-section of electrolytes were analyzed by S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In order to get the appropriate softening temperature, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Netzsch DSC 404C, Germany) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG, Netzsch DSC 404C, Germany) was carried out for the LAGP glass powder in the temperature range of 100–1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The fine structures and the elements dispersion in microscopic scale of the electrolytes were investigated by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, JEOL2100, FEI).

Ionic conductivity of the electrolytes were obtained from the equation: σ = L/RS, where L represents the thickness, S represents the area of the electrodes and R represents the resistance. The R of electrolytes were got from Au/electrolyte/Au cell via AC impedance test using a Solartron 1470E potentiostat electrochemical workstation with a perturbation of 10 mV in the frequency range of 1 MHz - 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 10 mV. The interfacial impedance evolution of anode/electrolyte was evaluated on symmetric cells of Li/electrolytes/Li with AC impedance test and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. A standard battery test instrument (Wuhan Rambo Electronics Co., Ltd.) was carried out to measure the galvanostatic charge-discharge test of ASSLB and the symmetric cells.

Notably, the most critical preparation procedure in the LAGP protection process is to find the appropriate temperature for the softening of LAGP glass powder. The DSC measurement (Fig. 1a) reflects the glass transition temperature (Tg, 531.2 °C) and crystallization temperature (Tc, 627.5 °C) of LAGP powder. It is acknowledged that the Tg is the boundary between the glass state and the high elastic state of the amorphous materials. When in the glass state, the rigid material undergoes few deformation. While in a high-elastic state at increased temperature, the deformation of material increases significantly and produces a relatively stable state [18]. Therefore, in order to obtain the glass powder with deformation ability but without crystallization (<627.5 °C), 600 °C and 48 h were selected as the sintering duration for the preparation technology of surface amorphized LAGP. Moreover, the only 2.02% weight loss of the fine LAGP glass powder at 1000 °C shown in TG analysis from Fig. 1a indicates that the ingredient contains rare volatile impurities.

The surface XRD of LAGP@glass, LAGP@LiPON, and ceramic LAGP are shown in Fig. 1b, and the XRD of LAGP glass powder heated at various temperatures for 48 h are also displayed in the insert figure. Clearly, being consistent with the DSC results, the powder are demonstrated to be amorphous after sintering at 600 °C, but obvious crystallization appears according to the XRD pattern at 630 °C. Compared to ceramic LAGP, the XRD of LAGP@glass surface presents the analogous diffraction peaks but a broad background signal in the range of 10° to 30°, which is resulted from the thin glass layer. Some low conductive by-products containing Li4P2O7, AlPO4, and Al2O3 also appears at the LAGP@LiPON surface. It may be due to the LAGP decomposition under the N2 conditions during the sputtering [14].

The ionic conductivity Arrhenius plots of the electrolytes are presented in Fig. 1c, from which the σLi+ of ceramic LAGP, LAGP@LiPON, and LAGP@glass can be recognized to be 2.99 × 10−4 S cm−1, 1.46 × 10−6 S cm−1, and 0.91 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 °C; while at 60 °C, the values are 9.85 × 10−4 S cm−1, 1.43 × 10−5 S cm−1, and 3.12 × 10−6 S cm−1. The obvious decreases of σLi+ compared with ceramic LAGP indicates that the coverage of glass (2.7 × 10−9 S cm−1) [21] or LiPON (1 × 10−6 S cm−1) [20] layer causes kinetically sluggish of Li+ onto LAGP electrolyte.

It is reported that the ionic-electronic conductive interphases formed at the Li anode/electrolyte interface would ultimately proliferate through grain bulk, and the stress or corrosion would induce cracks in the ceramic electrolytes [22]. Besides, larger roughness of the electrolyte surface can aggravate the uneven current distribution, cause uneven deposition of Li+, and ultimately lead to the growth of lithium dendrite. It was also found from our preliminary experiments that the crystalline materials with high modulus would be too stiff to undergoing deformation and bond with the substrate. Hence, it is vital to obtain a cover layer with consecutive and flat amorphous structure rather than the crystalline materials to meet the demands above. In Fig. 2a, the LAGP shows a typical ceramic surface filled with grains and grain boundaries. Quite the opposite, Fig. 2d and g reveal that the surfaces of LAGP@LiPON and LAGP@glass are continuous and tight-knit, without obvious grains or grain boundaries. From Fig. 2e and h, the thicknesses of LiPON and LAGP glass layer can be confirmed to be ∼2.6 μm and ∼2.7 μm, respectively. Especially, it well demonstrates that a flat, thin, and complete glass surface layer is able to be prepared by proper process via spin-coating method. The EDXS element analysis (Fig. 2c, f and i) of the cross-section electrolytes manifest that in the same selected area which containing ceramic LAGP and the surface layer, the Ge content in the LAGP@LiPON is significantly decreasing, which leaded by the none-germanium LiPON layer. Interestingly, the contents of phosphorus (P), oxygen (O), and Ge in the LAGP@glass sample are obviously different from that of ceramic LAGP, demonstrating that the distribution of ingredients in LAGP glass may be different compared with ceramic LAGP.

In our early research [16], a loose and incoherent dark colored layer extends from the surface to inside the LAGP sheet after the three-day contact with Li metal was observed. It reveals that the surface of the LAGP has reacted with Li metal, and black resultants with low-valence Ge has been generated. Similarly, in Fig. 3a, the dark area also occurred in the interface of Li/ceramic LAGP after contact, and Li metal is found to be dim after scraping the surface electrolyte. In stark contrast, no apparently changes are shown between the Li and LAGP glass powder, and the surface of Li metal still gives out a light silver metallic luster as shown Fig. 3b. Besides, the XPS of the pristine ceramic LAGP and LAGP glass powder, as well as the samples contacted with Li foils are given out to certify that the generation of interphases containing low-valence Ge has been suppressed substantially (Fig. 3c and the insert figure).

The interphase with mixed conducting property generated between Li and LAGP leads to severely increased interface impedance, fracture of LAGP, as well as the finial failure of the ASSLB, worse still, it can be accelerated with an applied current [9]. As shown in Fig. 3d, the dynamical interface stability of Li/electrolytes are evaluated in the Li/Li symmetric cells by galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling at 0.1 mA cm−2. Due to the inferior σLi+, both the LAGP@glass and LAGP@LiPON samples show voltage hysteresis compared with LAGP (polarization voltage of 25 mV) at the initial, i.e. 95 mV and 235 mV. Whereas, the voltage-time profiles present different trends afterwards. The polarization of Li/LAGP/Li cell grows very rapidly and reaches 1.5 V at 80 min, but the Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li cell goes through a process of slow growth and then stabilization. For the Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell, it is able to stably cycle during the test period within a larger polarization voltage of ±0.25 V. To further evaluate the stability of the cycle of Li anode and ASSLBs under higher current density, we test the Li/electrolyte/Li cell at 1 mA cm−2 under 80 °C. As shown in Fig. S1, the initial polarization voltage of Li/LAGP/Li, Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li, and Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell are 0.05 V, 0.1 V, and 0.95 V, respectively. Note that the polarization of Li/LAGP/Li cell grows very rapidly and reaches 6 V at 17 h. The polarization voltage of Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li cell goes through a process of slow growth, reaching 0.24 V at 40 h whereas Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell decreases at first and then increases to 0.63 V, showing a relatively stable cycle performance.

The static monitoring for EIS-time evolution of Li/electrolyte/Li cell delivers corresponding results with the foregoing measurement. The fitting of the EIS Nyquist plots were measured via a quantitative equivalent circuit of LR(RC)(RC)W as shown in the insert of Fig. 3f. In the circuit, Rb is matched to the bulk impedance of LAGP, R1 is the grain boundaries impedance of LAGP, and R2 is the interface impedance of Li/protective layer. The line self-inductance (L), the capacitor (CPE) and the Li+ diffusion impedance in electrodes (W) were also taken into account. As shown in Fig. 3e–g, at the 1st day, the total impedance (including the bulk impedance at the beginning of the curve and interfacial impedance of the semicircle) of Li/LAGP/Li is about 1/3 of Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li and about 1/5 of Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell. However, on account of the extremely unstable interface of Li and LAGP, the total impedance of Li/LAGP/Li is about 5 times of the Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li cell and 4 times of the Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell at the 15th day, reflecting a continuously increased stagnant layer for Li+ migration. Notably, the bulk impedance of the latter two cells are relatively constant but for the LAGP cell, indicating that the bulk of LAGP has also been corroded or some micro-cracks have appeared on the LAGP substrate [9,23], since the generated ionic-electronic conductive interphase cannot suppress the development of spontaneous reaction from surface into interior [7]. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that the interfacial impedance of the Li/LiPON/LAGP/LiPON/Li cell (Fig. 3e) and the Li/glass/LAGP/glass/Li cell (Fig. 3f) have also increased during the test period of the 1st day to 10th day. With respect to the LiPON/Li interface, the as-produced interphase with poorly ionic conductivity containing Li3PO4, Li2O, Li3P, etc. will result in an incipient increase of interface impedance [24]. While, the interphase are also electrical insulators which cannot afford the electronic migration for the reduction of the internal electrolyte. Thus, the LAGP coated with LiPON presents high stability with Li metal [25]. As for the glass/Li interface, the EIS of Li/LAGP@glass/Li along time appear to be distinctive overlapped semicircles (dotted line in Fig. 3g), indicating that some complicated interface reaction may occurred during the contact process or the protective layers on both sides are not exactly the same [26]. But overall the tendency of increasing impedance also stagnated after ten-day contact. In order to explicate the Li-stability mechanism of LAGP glass, its elements composition and dispersion in microscopic scale were identified by HRTEM and EDXS mapping.

As shown in Fig. 4a and b and Fig. 4e-f, the lattice fringes in high-resolution TEM and the symmetrical diffraction spots in SAED pattern distinguish the ceramic LAGP from LAGP glass. Of particular note, EDXS element mappings of ceramic LAGP (Fig. 4d) and LAGP glass (Fig. 4h) reveal that each element in ceramic LAGP distributes more uniform than that in LAGP glass. Moreover, the cross-section SEM in Fig. 4i clearly displays that the reaction interface layer extends downward continuously with the increase of ceramic LAGP/Li contact time (figures on left), and obvious lateral boundaries exist in the reaction layer, i.e., concentration gradients of the reactant (figures on right). That means, with the electronic conductive interphases offered by the surface reaction and the oxidants (Gex+ ions) offered by the uniform array of crystal cells, the reaction between ceramic LAGP and Li presents a succession process [27], as demonstrate in the left figures of Fig. 4j.

However, for LAGP glass, it is known that atoms are short-range ordered and long-range disordered in the amorphous structure, and generally there is no periodic atomic arrangement, but only irregular [28]. Combining the EDXS element semi-quantitative analysis in macro-scale (Fig. 2), it can be reasonably infer that the disordered Ge distribution in the amorphous LAGP glass, possessing no sequential electronic conductive channels or oxidants, that results in the electrolyte bulk cannot to be continuously reduced by the surface reductant, as demonstrate in the right figures of Fig. 4j.

In this part, the ASSLBs constructed with LFP cathode, LAGP-based electrolytes, and Li metal anode are characterized under the same test conditions so as to compare the electrochemical properties. Specifically, as Fig. 5a–c shows, despite the LFP/LAGP/Li cell exhibits the highest initial capacity of 158.3 mAh g−1 (vs. 155.5 mAh g−1 of LFP/LAGP@LiPON/Li cell and 152.2 mAh g−1 of LFP/LAGP@glass/Li cell), it decays to less than 15 mAh g−1, only processing a poor capacity retention of 6.9% at the 120th cycle. Nevertheless, the discharge capacity of LFP/LAGP@LiPON/Li is 147.9 mAh g−1 at the 120th cycle with the capacity retention of 95.1%, and as for the LFP/LAGP@glass/Li cell, the values are 142.5 mAh g−1 and 93.6%, respectively. The reasons for the serious decay of LFP/LAGP/Li cell cycling are mainly composed of two aspects. Firstly, the increasing interface impedance and the changing interphase thickness of LAGP/Li causes the unstable interfacial ion transport channels and the unreliable electrode-electrolyte contact conditions. Secondly, the micro-cracks on the electrolyte surface resulted from the unreleased interface stress would propagation into the substrate of LAGP, leading to the fracture of ceramic sheet and the eventually self-discharge of ASSLB [25]. The abnormal charge-discharge curves of ASSLB with LFP cathode shown in Fig. 5d exactly illustrate the second issue, that is, the curves far below the typical redox 3.4 V platform of LFP at the 120th cycle shows this battery has already short-circuited. In contrast, the charge-discharge plateau potential difference of LFP/LAGP@LiPON/Li cell (Fig. 5e) keeps 0.3 V during the overall test period, shows a substantially stable LAGP@LiPON/Li interface. As for LFP/LAGP@glass/Li cell, unfortunately, there is a stable but big redox polarization (0.45 V, Fig. 5f) which mainly due to the inferior σLi+ of the glass buffer layer. Fig. S2 shows the cycle stability of LFP/Li cells at 0.5 C under 80 °C. After 40 cycles, the discharge capacity retention for LFP/LAGP/Li, LFP/LAGP/LiPON/Li, and LFP/LAGP/glass/Li cell are 2.9%, 94.9%, and 93.1%, respectively. In spite of the initial discharge capacity of LFP/LAGP/glass/Li cell is slightly lower (129.0 mAh g−1, 120.1 mAh g−1, and 107.1 mAh g−1 for LFP/LAGP/Li, LFP/LAGP/LiPON/Li, and LFP/LAGP/glass/Li cell, respectively, in Fig. S3), the cycle stability has greatly enhanced.

Summarizing the cycle performance of the ASSLBs, and combining the Li-stability analysis above, it can be clearly concluded that both the glass protective layer and LiPON layer are able to improve the cycling stability of LFP/Li ASSLB from the perspective of Li anode protection. However, the unsatisfied discharge polarization brought by the low Li+ conductivity of LAGP glass cannot be underestimated, pending further study and resolution.

In this work, the characteristics of LAGP glass, including the variability under the certain temperatures, the higher modulus, an acceptable Li+ conductivity, and no sequential electronic conductive channels owing to the irregular Ge distribution, were utilized to incorporate with ceramic LAGP sheet and prepare an integrated bi-layer electrolyte with high Li-stability. In addition, the ceramic LAGP with conventional LiPON layer was also prepared to compare with the LAGP glass layer in the aspect of Li-stability and cell cycle performance.

The amorphous layer with continuous surface could suppress the growth of interphases into the inner electrolyte, while the imperfect physical contact of Li/LAGP could be improved by the surficial products. Meanwhile, although the elements composition of LAGP glass are same with ceramic LAGP electrolyte substrate, the disordered element distribution in the amorphous LAGP glass possesses few sequential electronic conductive channels, may insulating the internal electrolyte from the external highly reducing environment, which protect the inner part of the ceramic LAGP electrolyte and reducing the electrolyte/electrode interface impedance. As a result, the surface amorphized LAGP electrolyte shows enhanced Li-stability as well as a better ASSLB cycle performance based on it.

Compared with the conventional LiPON protective layer, the surface amorphized LAGP exhibits the beneficial effect on the Li-stability and cell cycle stability. More importantly, the spin-coating co-sintering processes more facile and economic advantages, readily to scale up for the commercial application of ASSLB.
