An Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid, highly conductive to Ag+ ions and with a three-dimensional Na+ superionic conductor Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 ?NASICON?-type structure, was developed by introducing pentavalent Nb5+ ions into NASICON-type AgSc?PO4?3. Because Nb5+ ion doping of the NASICON-type solid reduced the interaction between Ag+ and the surrounding O2− ions, the highest Ag+ ion conductivity among the NASICON-type Ag+ ion conducting solids was obtained.

In solid-state ionics, various monovalent ions are widely accepted as conducting ion species in solids. Because ion mobility in solids generally depends on the size of the conducting ion species, small Li+ ?ionic radius: 0.09 nm, coordination number ?CN?: 6 1? and Na+ ?0.116 nm, CN:6 1? ions are fast conducting species in solids. However, silver ions ?Ag+? with larger ionic size ?0.129 nm, CN: 6 1? are generally regarded to be poor migrants, because more open conducting pathways are required to obtain a high ion conductivity. Although the disordered ?-phase of silver iodide ??-AgI?, with many vacancies in the structure, was reported to show a high Ag+ ion conductivity,2,3 AgI transforms from the ?-phase to the ordered ?-phase with decreasing temperature; thus, forming a rigid crystal lattice at 146°C that results in a steep decrease in Ag+ ion conductivity. Along with the phase transition, AgI often experiences cracked grains because of the morphological change accompanying the volume change. A similar disordered structure at room temperature has been artificially obtained for RbAg4I5 by introducing Rb into the ?-AgI structure, and this solid possessed a high Ag+ ion conductivity even below 146°C.4,5 However, RbAg4I5 does not have sufficient thermal stability ?the stable temperature region for the disordered phase is from ?155 to 228°C? or chemical stability in atmospheric air. Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 has been reported to be a Ag+ ion conducting solid with an ordered crystal structure.6 Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 h a s a N a+ superionic conductor Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 ?NASICON?-type structure, which is a three-dimensional network linking ?P,Si?O4 tetrahedrons and ZrO6 octahedrons. Although the Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 solid has good thermal and chemical stability even at elevated temperatures, its Ag+ ion conductivity is lower than Na+ 7 or Li+ ion conductors8 having a similar NASICON-type structure. If ion conductivity in solids depends only on the ionic size of the conducting ion species, the order of conductivity should be Li+ ? Na+ ? Ag+. However, Na+ ion conductivity is similar to or higher than Li+ ion conductivity in the NASICON-type structure. Therefore, there is another factor causing the low Ag+ ion conductivity: the electronegativity of the ions. The electronegativity of Ag ?1.93? is considerably higher than that of Na ?0.93? or Li ?0.98?. This tendency is similar to that of ion conductivity in NASICON-type solids. Therefore, one effective method of improving Ag+ ion conductivity in a NASICON-type solid should be the reduction of the strong interaction between Ag+ ions and the surrounding O2− anions caused by the covalent bond. In this article, we discuss the partial substitution of the Sc3+ site in an Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 solid with high valence Nb5+ to realize high Ag+ ion conductivity by weakening the interaction between Ag+ and O2− ions. After introducing Nb5+ into the structure, O2− anions should interact strongly with Nb5+, resulting in a relative reduction of Ag+ to O2− interaction. Finally, we experimentally investigate Ag+ ion conduction in this Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 solid.

Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 ?x = 0.0–1.0? solids were prepared via solid-state reaction using Ag2O, Sc2O3, N b2O5, and ?NH4?2HPO4 as starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of these powders were mixed in an agate pot with a ballmilling apparatus ?Pulverisette 7, Fritsch GmbH? at a rotation speed of 300 rpm for 3 h, and the mixed powder was calcined at 600°C for 6 h i n a n a i r a t mosphere. After the obtained powder was ground by the ballmilling apparatus ?300 rpm, 3 h?, the powder was calcined at 1100°C for 24 h in an air atmosphere. The samples obtained were identified by X-ray powder diffraction ?XRD? analysis using Cu K? radiation ?MultiFlex, Rigaku?. The XRD data were collected by a step-scanning method in the 2? range between 10 and 70°, with a step width of 0.04° and a scan time of 4 s. The lattice volume was calculated from the XRD peak angles, which were refined using ?-Al2O3 powder as a standard. After the identification, the powder was pelletized and sintered at 1100°C for 12 h in air. The ac conductivity of the sintered sample pellet, with Pt sputtered electrodes centered on both faces, was measured by a complex impedance method in the frequency range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz ?precision LCR meter 4192A, Hewlett-Packard? in various oxygen pressures ranging from 10−9 to 105 Pa, which were controlled by adjusting O2, He, and CO–CO2 gas mixture. DC electrolysis of the sintered Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 ?x = 0.2? pellet was conducted by applying a dc voltage of 6 V for 72 h at 600°C, and line electron probe microanalysis ?EPMA? was carried out ?EPMA-1500, Shimadzu? for the electrolyzed sample.

Figure 1 shows XRD patterns from Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 ?x = 0.0–1.0? solids. Although the samples with x ? 0.05 had a single phase with a rhombohedral NASICON-type structure, the sample with x = 0.0 was a two-phase mixture of rhombohedral and monoclinic NASICON-type structures. Figure 2 depicts the compositional dependencies of the lattice volume, Ag+ ion conductivity at 300°C ?Ag+ ion conduction is demonstrated below?, and activation energy ?Ea? for Ag+ ion conduction estimated from the ac conductivity between 300 and 400°C for Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 ?x = 0.0–1.0? solids. Here, we plot the total conductivity of bulk and grain boundary, because it is difficult to separate individual conductivity from the obtained Nyquist plot. Angenault et al. claimed to have obtained a single phase of Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 ?x = 0.0?.6 Although the crystallographic symmetry has not been clarified, we plot their reported values as data for the sample with x = 0.0 for comparison. The lattice volume of the rhombohedral Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 ?x = 0.05–1.0? solids decreased linearly with increasing Nb5+ content, indicating that the small Nb5+ ions ?ionic radius: 0.078 nm? 1 successfully replaced Sc3+ ?0.0885 nm? 1 sites over the entire compositional range. For Ag+ ion conduction in this series, the conducting behavior changed around x = 0.2. The highest Ag+ ion conductivity ?7.7 ? 10−1 S c m−1 at 300°C? and the lowest activation energy ?Ea= 11.9 kJ mol−1? were simultaneously obtained from the sample with x = 0.2. Because the lattice volume of the sample linearly decreased with x for the single phase rhombohedral NASICON-type structure, the reason for the change in Ag+ ion conductivity was likely as follows: With increasing Nb content ?x? up to 0.2, the electrostatic interaction between Ag+ and the surrounding O2− ions was reduced by the introduction of high valence Nb5+ ions into the structure, because a pentavalent Nb5+ cation in the structure should attract O2− ions more strongly than monovalent Ag+, enabling easier Ag+ ion conduction. Although the lattice volume and Ag concentration are reduced with increasing x, both of which should negatively affect ion conduction in the rigid solid lattice, the weakening of the interaction between Ag+ and O2− ions should greatly lower the energy required to break the Ag–O bond. Based on the competition between counter effects on ion conduction, the highest Ag+ ion conductivity was obtained for the sample with x = 0.2. Reduced electrostatic interaction is the predominant factor improving the Ag+ ion conduction at x ? 0.2. However, for x ? 0.2, the effects of lattice shrinkage and the smaller amount of Ag in the structure had a stronger effect on Ag+ ion conduction than at x = 0.2, even though the electrostatic interaction between Ag+ and O2− ions may have been further reduced by the higher Nb5+ concentration. To identify the conducting species in the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3solid which showed the highest conductivity among the samples prepared, ac conductivity was measured in various atmospheres, with oxygen pressures from 10−9 Pa ?i n a C O – C O2 mixture? to 105 Pa ?in pure O2? ?Fig. 3?. In general, when electrons ?e−? or holes ?h+? are the conducting species in solids, ac conductivity increases in reducing or oxidizing atmospheres because of the appearance of n- or p-type electronic conduction, respectively. Because the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid showed no meaningful conductivity change indicating electronic conduction over a wide PO2 range, it was clear that the predominant conducting species was ionic. Furthermore, we can estimate the cationic transference number in the present solid to be over 0.999 from the ?dc/?ac ratio in both oxygen ?PO2:105 Pa? and helium ?PO2:63 Pa? atmospheres at 600°C. ?This is described in detail in our previous paper.9? To directly demonstrate Ag+ ion conduction in the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid, dc electrolysis was carried out by sand wiching a Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 sintered pellet between two Pt electrodes. After electrolysis, the elemental distribution inside the sample pellet was investigated by EPMA line measurements, with the results depicted in Fig. 4. A clear Ag segregation was observed near the cathodic surface, while no such segregation was found for Sc, Nb, or P . If the solid simply decomposed by heating to 600°C and/or applying a dc voltage of 6 V , other cationic species would also segregate at the cathodic surface. Ion segregation of only Ag+ strongly suggests that Ag+ ions migrated into the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid from the anode to the cathode by dc electrolysis. Moreover, since the cation transference number in the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid was over 0.999, the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid was a pure Ag+ ion conductor. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of Ag+ ion conductivity for the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid, along with the corresponding published data for Ag3Sc2?PO4?3.6 The present Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid had ca. 4.2 times the Ag+ ion conductivity at 300°C and a lower activation energy ?Ea= 11.9 kJ mol−1? for Ag+ ion migration than the Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 solid ?Ea = 28.9 kJ mol−1?. Although the lattice volume ?1.570 nm3? of the Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid was smaller than that of Ag3Sc2?PO4?3 ?1.578 nm3?, as mentioned above, the high Ag+ ion conductivity resulted from an effective reduction of the interaction between Ag+ and O2− ions by introducing high valence Nb5+ ions into the structure of the Ag3−2xSc2−xNbx?PO4?3 solids. Furthermore, Ag+ ion conductivity of the present solid is the highest among all the known NASICON-type Ag+ ion conductors. This re sult supports the idea that the electronegativity of a conducting ion species is an important factor contributing to ion conductivity in NASICON-type solids.

To develop a high Ag+ ion conductivity solid with a threedimensional NASICON-type structure, which is well known as a suitable crystal structure for various conducting ion species, we successfully synthesized an Ag2.6Sc1.8Nb0.2?PO4?3 solid. Because of reduced electrostatic interaction between Ag+ and O2− ions in the NASICON-type structure due to the introduction of pentavalent Nb5+ ions, the present solid demonstrated the highest Ag+ ion conductivity among all the known NASICON-type solids.
