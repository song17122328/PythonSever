Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be the most promising electrochemical energy storage devices for large-scale grid and electric vehicle applications due to the advantages of resource abundance and cost-effectiveness. The electrochemical performance of SIBs largely relies on the intrinsic chemical properties of the cathodic materials. Among the various cathodes, rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), a typical sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) compound, is very popular owing to its high Na+ mobility and firm structural stability. However, the relatively low electronic conductivity makes the theoretical capacity of NVP cathodes unviable even at low rates, not to mention the high rate of charging/discharging. This is a major drawback of NVPs, limiting their future large-scale applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent progresses made in NVP fabrication has been presented, mainly including the strategies of developing NVP/carbon hybrid materials and elemental doping to improve the electronic conductivity of NVP cathodes and designing 3D porous architectures to enhance Na-ion transportation. Moreover, the application of NVP cathodic materials in Na-ion full batteries is summarized, too. Finally, some remarks are made on the challenges and perspectives for the future development of NVP cathodes.

The development of civilization is closely associated with the availability of energy in useful forms. As the consequences of burgeoning economy and growing population since the twenty-first century, concerns have been rising over the rapid depletion of natural resources and heavy environmental pollution that threatens the survival of humanity. Therefore, the search for new energy sources and more efficient means of employing energy has accelerated. In recent years, apart from the vigorous developments in solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and other renewable clean energy sources, rechargeable (or secondary) batteries with reliable and efficient energy storage systems have shown tremendous potential in a wide range of applications. Among them, lithium (Li)-ion batteries (LIBs) with advantages of high working voltage, high energy density, low self-discharge rate, wide operating temperature range, no voltage decay, long cycle life, and environmental-friendliness are dominating in portable electronic products and equipment,1–7e.g., large-scale grid, plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicles (EVs). However, the scarcity and uneven distribution of Li as a resource, which only accounts for 0.0065% of the Earth's crust, poses challenges to the future development of the energy industry as a result of the shortfall and high price of the raw material. Hence, it is imperative to explore alternatives to Li that are abundant, less expensive, and environmentally friendly. Given the sixth richest element on the earth (about 2.74%) and shared physical as well as chemical properties with Li in many aspects, sodium (Na) is featured as a promising candidate to substitute Li in secondary batteries.8–12 When compared with LIBs, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are considered to be a safer and lower-cost candidate for large-scale energy storage. Although the use of SIBs effectively ameliorates the aforementioned problems of Li, the current version of SIBs has not yet achieved parity with LIBs with respect to performance, which has prompted considerable research devoted toward the investigation of promising electrode materials for SIBs. Hence, investigation on green, cheap, and new electrode materials for SIBs can effectively resolve the problems involved in the shortage and high price of Li resources, which also has significance for the sustainable development of human society.13

A typical SIB, with a similar working principle as LIBs, consists of four parts: positive electrode (cathode), negative electrode (anode), separator, and nonaqueous salt containing the electrolyte. During the charging process, Na ions leave the cathode and migrate through the electrolyte toward the anode, while the electrons are driven by an external circuit, flowing from the cathode toward the anode. The Na ions are repeatedly shuffling between the cathode and anode in the process of charging and discharging, following the rocking-chair mechanism.14–17

To a large extent, the electrochemical performance of SIBs relies on the intrinsic chemical properties of the anodic and cathodic materials. A large number of studies have been recently conducted to investigate the potential of different electrode materials. The currently available anodes for SIBs can be divided into two main categories: (i) carbon-based materials, mainly including hard carbon,18–21 carbon nanowires,22,23 and N-doped carbon nanosheets,24,25 and (ii) non-carbon materials, mainly including metal oxides (NiCo2O4,26,27 Sb2O4,28 TiO2,29–31etc.), metal sulfides (TiS2,32 MoS2,33–36 Ni3S2,37–39 FeS,40–43 FeS2,44–48etc.), alloys (SnSb/C,49etc.), organic compounds (Na2C8H4O4,50etc.), and Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-based materials (NaTi2(PO4)3,51–54etc.). Some of them can exhibit specific capacities of 300–600 mA h g−1 in the operating potential values of 0.1–0.6 V, which is very close to the potential of Na plating. Cathodic materials also play an important role in achieving exceptional Na storage performance because cathodic materials not only share a large mass fraction in SIBs, but also dominate the operating voltage ranges. As a result, cathodic materials determine the cost, safety, specific energy, and specific power of SIBs. Till date, a large number of Na+-intercalated oxide materials (NaMxOy, M = V,55 Fe,56 Mn,57 Cr,58 Co,59,60 Ti,61–65 Ni,66etc.), transition metal fluorides (NaXF3, X = Fe,67,68 Mn,69etc.), and sodium phosphates (NaFePO4,70 Na2Co2Fe(PO4)3,71 Na2FePO4F,72 NaVOPO4,73 Na2MnP2O7,74 Na3V2(PO4)2F3,75–77etc.) have been investigated for use as cathodes in rechargeable SIBs. However, their intrinsic disadvantages hinder the exploitation of the full potential of these cathodic materials. For example, some Na+-intercalated oxides cannot accommodate the conspicuous structural variations occurring during the deep-removal/intercalation process, easily causing severe capacity decay and voltage platform fading (e.g., NaCoO2 78 and Na0.44MnO2 79); some Mn compounds may produce undesirable side-effects resulting from Mn3+ dissolution (e.g., NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 80 and Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 81); some olivine-structured compounds (e.g., NaFePO4 82) may have sluggish diffusion efficiency for Na-ion spreading, seriously limiting the electrochemical performance of the entire electrode; the use of F has a formidable environmental impact, which limits its development (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)2F3 83). Since the cathodic side is the limiting factor that hinders the realization of high-performance SIBs, tremendous effort has been focused on the development and improvement of cathodic materials for SIBs. To provide an overview of recent developments in those potential cathodic materials for SIBs, the specific capacities and their corresponding working voltages are summarized in Fig. 1.

When compared with the aforementioned cathodic materials, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with a NASICON structure is a promising candidate that satisfies the requirements of being a high-performance cathode. Its stable 3D host framework owing to the strong covalent bonding of oxygen atom in the polyanion polyhedra leads to better thermal stability, longer cycle life, and better safety features. Such excellent characteristics have made it fairly popular in SIB applications.84–86

Herein, we present a review specifically on the latest developments in NVP cathodic materials for SIBs. Host structure, mechanisms for sodiation/desodiation, transport properties, and strategies for performance improvement of NVP cathodes (e.g., NVP/carbon nanocomposites, elemental doping, and designing 3D porous architectures) are introduced. In addition, the practical applications of NVP cathodic materials in full cells are also summarized.

The electrochemical voltage–composition curve for sodiation and desodiation reactions in NVP is shown in Fig. 2a. Obviously, it displays a very flat voltage plateau located at around 3.4 V versus Na+/Na, which is associated with the V3+/V4+ redox couple, corresponding to the two-phase transition reaction (i.e., Na3V2(PO4)3 ↔ NaV2(PO4)3).87–89 As a result, impressive theoretical capacity of 118 mA h g−1 is demonstrated.

The 3D crystal structure of rhombohedral NVP comprises [PO4] tetrahedra and [VO6] octahedra interlinked via common apical oxygen atoms (Fig. 2b).90 In particular, two octahedral [VO6] connected with three tetrahedral [PO4] form a basic framework anion [V2(PO4)3]3− “lantern” unit. This “lantern” unit is a parallel arrangement along the c axis and the unit cell parameters are as follows: a = b = 8.738 Å and c = 21.815 Å (space group: R[3 with combining macron]c).87 Furthermore, there are two types of Na ions in the crystal NVP structure, and the two isolated Na ions are partly occupied and located in the channels with two different oxygen environments: Na1 (M(1), sixfold coordination) and Na2 (M(2), eightfold coordination) sites.87,91 Each formula unit of [V2(PO4)3] can, at the most, fill four Na ions. For the formula unit of Na3V2(PO4)3, there is one Na ion at the Na1 site (1.0 occupancy) and two Na ions at the Na2 site (0.67 occupancy). When Na+ is extracted from Na3V2(PO4)3 during the charging process at room temperature, two Na2-sited ions are completely removed and the remaining single Na ion remains at the Na1 site.

Furthermore, the migration pathways of Na ions in Na3V2(PO4)3 were investigated by using first-principles calculations.92 Three main migration pathways for Na ions (Fig. 2c) were selected to evaluate their migration energies (E). Na ions diffused along the a direction (i.e., channels between two [PO4] tetrahedra) were noted as pathway 1, and those along the b direction (voids between a [PO4] tetrahedron and a [VO6] octahedron) as pathway 2. The values of E for pathways 1 and 2 were calculated as 0.0904 and 0.11774 eV, respectively. While E for Na ions migrating along the c direction (channels between adjacent [VO6] octahedra) was extremely high (>200 eV), which was an impossible diffusion path. However, when Na ions transported along a curved c direction (pathway 3), the E value was significantly decreased to 2.438 eV, showing a possible migration way.

Although NVP has many obvious advantages, such as high stability and relatively high voltage, it suffers from the key drawback of inferior intrinsic electronic conductivity (1.63 × 10−6 S cm−1).93 On the other hand, the ionic radius and molecular weight of Na+ are larger than those of Li+ (rNa+ = 1.02 Å, rLi+ = 0.76 Å; MNa+ = 23 g mol−1, MLi+ = 7 g mol−1), which would create certain potential obstacles to hinder Na+ diffusion kinetics in the NVP host, resulting in poor electrochemical performance.94 To overcome these problems, researchers have carried out many explorations, mainly concentrating on surface-conducting modification (e.g., carbon coating), elemental doping, downsizing the NVP particles, and so on.

The incorporation of NVP and carbon materials (e.g., amorphous carbon, carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene) is a very popular strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of NVP (Fig. 3). The carbon materials can act as reducing agents to reduce V5+ to V3+, as well as conductive additives to minimize battery polarization. Moreover, they can also inhibit the overgrowth and aggregation of NVP nanograins during high-temperature calcinations. Furthermore, such nanostructures can shorten the Na+ diffusion distance and provide a large electrode/electrolyte contact area, and therefore, enhance the kinetics of the electrochemical reactions.

To improve the electronic conductivity, fabricating an in situ coating of a thin amorphous carbon layer on the surface of NVP is the most common strategy, which is usually realized by introducing carbon sources (e.g., organic compounds) into the precursor preparation procedure and converting into amorphous carbon through high-temperature pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere.

Li et al.95 employed a simple solid-state reaction method to synthesize NVP/C cathodic materials by using glucose as the carbon source. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image shows that the particle sizes of NVP/C prepared by 15 wt% glucose were less than 300 nm with good uniformity (Fig. 4a), and there was a thin carbon layer (around 3 nm) coated on the surfaces of NVP nanoparticles as verified by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation (Fig. 4b). This NVP/C nanocomposite exhibited initial specific discharge capacity of 98 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, and capacity of 76 mA h g−1 could be obtained at a high current rate of 30C. In addition, the electrochemical performance of NVP/C samples prepared with different glucose contents (12.5 wt%, 15 wt%, 17.5 wt%, and 20 wt%) were studied. It was found that an appropriate carbon shell layer derived from proper glucose content had a positive effect on the specific capacity of NVP/C nanocomposites. Thereafter, a simple pre-reduction process, combined with a subsequent calcination process, was adopted to synthesize a NVP/C nanocomposite by employing V2O5, NH4H2PO4, Na2CO3, and oxalic acid as the raw materials.96 The average sizes of the NVP/C particles were around 200 nm and ∼5 nm carbon layer was coated on the surfaces of crystallized NVP nanoparticles. The well-crystallized NVP/C nanoparticles showed initial discharge capacity of 106 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 20 mA g−1 and capacity retention of 90% after 50 cycles. Carbon sources are significantly important. On the basis of the same solid-state carbon-thermal reduction reaction method, as shown in Fig. 4c and d, fine NVP/C nanocrystals (30–50 nm) were prepared by Nghia et al.97 using citric acid as the carbon source.

Moreover, Wang et al.98 reported a self-combustion method to fabricate NVP/C nanoparticles. Citric acid was used as the fuel, and continuously heating the precursor solution in an electric oven would spontaneously lead to fire, resulting in a voluminous precursor powder. After calcination, NVP nanoparticles (25–100 nm) coated with a carbon layer (thickness: ∼3 nm) were obtained. Such a NVP/C nanocomposite delivered initial discharge capacity of 101 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and capacity retention of 95% after 50 cycles.

Sol–gel chemistry is also an effective approach to produce fine NVP/C nanocomposites. Based on this method, Zhang et al.99 synthesized a nanosized NVP/C composite by employing oxalic acid as the chelating agent as well as the carbon source. The nanocomposite showed an average particle size of 350 nm and a uniform carbon coating (layer thickness: ∼3 nm). Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that it had superior rate capability in aqueous electrolytes (e.g., 95 mA h g−1 at 10C; 72 mA h g−1 at 20C). Thereafter, Zhou et al.100 improved the cycling stability of NVP/C nanocomposites in aqueous SIBs. Furthermore, a porous NVP/C cathodic material was designed for high-performance SIBs based on the sol–gel method combined with a freeze-drying process.101Fig. 4e and f clearly demonstrated the porous morphology and microstructure of the sample, which significantly increased the specific surface area of the material, significantly enhancing the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte. As a result, this porous NVP/C cathode displayed remarkably high rate performance (e.g., 98 mA h g−1 at 5C) and cycling stability (showing capacity retention of 89% after 100 cycles at 5C). Yao et al.102 introduced a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel method to synthesize N-doped carbon-coated NVP (NVP@C–N) nanocomposites, in which the ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide (EMIm-dca) was employed as the nitrogen-doped carbon source. When applied as the cathode for SIBs, the optimized sample displayed excellent Na storage performance, including long cycle life (85 mA h g−1 at 20C after 5000 cycles) and outstanding rate behavior (71 mA h g−1 at 80C).

Electrospinning is an efficient nanofabrication technique that easily produces 1D nanofibers of electrode materials for energy storage applications.103,104 Using this technique (detailed experimental procedure shown in Fig. 5a), a NVP/C cathode with 20–30 nm NVP nanoparticles uniformly encapsulated in interconnecting 1D carbon nanofibers (diameters: 200–300 nm) was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 5b–d.105 Such a unique structure of NVP/C hierarchical nanofibers facilitated both fast electronic and Na-ion transport. When used as the cathode for SIBs, it displayed initial charge capacity of 103 mA h g−1 and discharge capacity of 101 mA h g−1. Thereafter, Yang et al.106 reported a distinctive composite structure in which carbon nanofibers were located at the centre of the composite and partially embedded NVP nanoparticles (50–200 nm) onto their shells (Fig. 5e and f). Such cathodes not only delivered high discharge capacity of 89 mA h g−1 even at high current densities of 50C, but also maintained ∼93% of their initial discharge capacity after 300 cycles at 1C. Moreover, NVP nanoparticles (20–50 nm) confined in a 1D carbon sheath (i.e., NVP core–sheath mesostructured nanowires)107 and 1D NVP/C nanorods108 were also successfully fabricated by the electrospinning method, further enhancing the long cycle life and high rate capability.

In addition to the electrospinning technique, a facile hydrothermal method combined with subsequent heat treatment was developed to produce 1D NVP nanomaterials (i.e., active carbon-coated NVP embedded in 1D porous carbon nanowires, NVP@C-CNW).109 After the hydrothermal reaction of the precursor solution (vanadium pentoxide, sodium carbonate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, oxalic acid dehydrate, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), amorphous nanowires were obtained (Fig. 6a). Subsequent high-temperature treatments converted nanowires into NVP@C-CNW. As shown in Fig. 6b, the mean diameter of NVP@C-CNW was around 200 nm, and there were also some particles with the size of ∼200 nm, which could be attributed to the corruption of the nanowire precursors during the annealing process. This structure facilitated fast electron/ion transport, exhibiting superior rate performance (62 mA h g−1 at 60C) and an ultralong cycle life (97 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 1C).

CNTs with excellent conductivity (electrical and thermal) are favorable for use in batteries.110 Incorporating CNTs into NVP composites was also extensively studied to increase the capacity and rate capability. In 2015, Tao et al.111 reported a simple sol–gel method to prepare porous NVP/carbon matrices microspheres. In particular, these microspheres consisted of NVP nanoparticles (ranging from 100 to 200 nm) embedded into acetylene carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) matrices (Fig. 6c and d). As a result, this cathode exhibited capacity retention of up to 90% of its initial capacity after 400 cycles at 1C and capacity of 70 mA h g−1 at 10C. Moreover, Chu et al.112 fabricated core–shell-structured NVP/C nanocrystals embedded in MWCNTs using a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel method, which demonstrated superior rate performance (e.g., 82 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 10C and 93.9% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 10C).

Graphene, the basic building unit of graphite (i.e., a monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms), is one of the most fascinating topics of research of the past decade due to its remarkably brilliant electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties and ultrahigh specific surface area as well as chemical stability.113–116 Owing to these advantages, graphene can not only be used as the electrode material for SIBs, but also as the conducting supporting material to enhance the capacity delivery and cycle performance of NVP batteries.

In 2013, Jung et al.117 reported a highly crystalline NVP/graphene composite as a cathodic material for Na-based rechargeable batteries using a simple synthesis approach that combined sol–gel and solid-state reactions. The well-crystallized NVP particles with sizes of hundreds of nanometers were enwrapped into the graphene sheets. This composite with a low graphene amount (5 wt%) could achieve a high C-rate capability (e.g., 75 mA h g−1 at 20C and 60 mA h g−1 at 30C) and exhibit high capacity retention at both 1C and 10C during 300 cycles. Thereafter, to construct an effective conducting network, Chu et al.118 developed a hydrothermal-assisted sol–gel method to synthesize graphene-wrapped NVP/C nanocomposites for SIBs. Such a cathode delivered discharge capacity of 89 mA h g−1 at a rate of 5C and displayed a capacity retention of 93% after 200 cycles. Liu et al.119 adopted a similar strategy to fabricate carbon-coated NVP nanocrystals (∼120 nm in size) wrapped on the surface of N-graphene (NVP/C@N-graphene). With support from highly conducting N-graphene sheets, NVP/C@N-graphene delivered initial discharge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and stable cycle performance with high capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles at a high rate of 15C.

In order to let the NVP particles adhere stably onto the graphene surface for perfect electrical conductivity, Chang et al.120 fabricated a graphene-bound NVP film cathode by simple vacuum-assisted filtration process and subsequent thermal reduction treatment. This cathode composed of NVP nanoparticles (100–300 nm) with a high-conductivity graphene network exhibited remarkably high rate capability and good cycling ability, e.g., delivering a discharge capacity of 115 mA h g−1 at 1C and a low capacity fading rate of 0.0052% in each cycle at 20C over 10 000 cycles. Chen et al.121 adopted a spray-drying method to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-sheet-decorated NVP microspheres. The carbon network (i.e., rGO and amorphous carbon) created good interfacial contacts between the NVP particles, which remarkably improved the electrochemical performance, particularly with regard to rate capability. It was found that the cathode prepared with 8 wt% rGO exhibited the most comfortable rate performance (e.g., 64 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 70C) and the most popular cycling stability (e.g., showing capacity retention of 95.5% at 10C after 100 cycles). Zhang et al.122 developed a cathodic material of graphene-scaffolded NVP microspheres (NVP@rGO) through a conventional spray-drying method, which exhibited an impressively long cycle life (81% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at a high rate of 5C). Besides, Gu et al.123 developed a strongly chemically bonded (i.e., V–O–N bonds) NVP/reduced graphene oxide–carbon nanotube (NGC) nanocomposite, in which rGO and CNTs formed a double conductive network to yield superior Na storage properties. This nanostructured NGC composite showed reversible capacity of 105 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1C.

Graphene can not only act as a conductive network to enhance the charge transfer, but also as a self-template to regulate the morphology and microstructure. Recently, a self-assembled flake-shaped NVP@rGO sheets with a thickness of 400–800 nm was produced by Li and co-workers,124 which delivered large reversible capacity of 80 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 100C (36 s to full charge/discharge) and retained 71% of its initial capacity after 10 000 cycles. Moreover, the self-assembly approach was developed to fabricate layer-by-layer-structured NVP@rGO nanocomposites.125 This structure was realized on the basis of the interfacial coupling (i.e., hydrogen bonds and amphiphilic interactions) of graphene oxide nanosheets and NVP/acetylacetone gel. As shown in Fig. 7a–c, NVP@rGO had a sheet-like structure spread over tens of micrometers and consisted of a NVP nanocrystal in between the rGO sheets. As a result, this novel structure could provide high electronic and ionic conductivities and mechanical stability in the process of Na insertion/extraction, leading to remarkably high rate capacity, e.g., 91, 73, and 41 mA h g−1 at the rates of 50, 100, and 200C, respectively (Fig. 7d), and ultralong life cycling stability (63 mA h g−1 at 50C after 15 000 cycles).

In addition to incorporating carbon materials into NVP, elemental doping is considered as another effective modification strategy to improve the intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities of NVP, and many cations, namely, Mg2+,126–128 Mn3+,129,130 Fe3+,131,132 Al3+,133–135 Ca2+,136 Ni2+,137 Ce3+,138 Ti4+,139 Mo6+,140 K+,141 Li+,142etc., have been employed as dopants in NVP cathodes. For example, in 2015, Li et al.126 prepared a series of Mg2+-doped NVP/C cathodes (i.e., Na3V2−xMgx(PO4)3/C, x = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1) through a sol–gel method. Owing to the smaller radius of Mg2+ (rMg2+ = 0.65 Å) than that of V3+ (rV3+ = 0.74 Å), the addition of the Mg2+ dopant could shorten the average lengths of V–O and P–O bonds, which might provide broader channels for Na-ion diffusion. The electrochemical measurement revealed that the Mg2+-doped NVP/C had significant improvement in the rate capability and cycle performance, particularly for the Na3V1.95Mg0.05(PO4)3/C, which delivered capacity of 94 mA h g−1 at 30C (Fig. 8a). Moreover, Xu et al.143 also used Mg2+ as the dopant to fabricate Mg2+-doped NVP/C nanocrystals decorated with graphene sheets, showing optimized performance of 85 mA h g−1 at 20C rate. Klee et al.130 employed a citric-acid-based sol–gel method to prepare Na3V2−xMnx(PO4)3/C (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7) composites. It was found that the incorporation of Mn3+ into NVP had a significant influence on the sample morphology. The substitution amount in the range of x = 0.3–0.5 facilitated the formation of a homogeneous composite. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed the substitution of V3+ by Mn3+, and the unit cell parameters remained almost the same at low Mn3+ content (x < 0.5). When evaluated as the cathode for SIBs, the Na3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3/C composite showed the best performance, e.g., delivering a capacity value of 104 mA h g−1 at C/2 and 92 mA h g−1 at 2C (Fig. 8b). Aragón et al.132 reported the partial substitution of V in NVP by iron (Na3V2−xFex(PO4)3/C, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that upon increasing the iron content, the unit cell volume was slightly increased due to the higher radius of Fe3+ (rFe3+ = 0.785 Å) than that of V3+. Galvanostatic cycling indicated a significant increase in the capacity for samples prepared with x = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 (Fig. 8c). Thereafter, Aragón et al.135 selected another cation, Al3+ dopant, to enhance the electrochemical performance of NVP cathodes. In this study, four Na3V2−xAlx(PO4)3/C (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) samples were prepared by a simple sol–gel method in which citric acid was employed as the carbon source. The electrochemical performance evaluation showed that Na3V1.8Al0.2(PO4)3/C exhibited the highest capacity of 97 mA h g−1 at 6C (Fig. 8d).

In addition, Li et al.140 introduced the high-valence Mo6+ (rMo6+ = 0.62 Å) in the V sites of NVP (i.e., Na3−5xV2−xMox(PO4)3/C, 0 < x < 0.04). It was found that the conductivity and Na-ion diffusion kinetics of Mo6+-doped NVP were significantly enhanced, displaying superior rate capability (e.g., 94 mA h g−1 at 10C) and stable cycle life (capacity retention: 93.5%) over 500 cycles (Fig. 8e).

Moreover, doping univalent cations (e.g., Li+ and K+) at the Na sites instead of V sites in the NVP system was also investigated, and some positive effects on active material utilization and capacity fading were obtained. For example, Lim et al.141 selected large K ions as the dopant to broaden the Na-ion channel and stabilize the NASICON framework. The effects of K+ doping (i.e., Na3−xKxV2(PO4)3/C, x = 0.04, 0.09 and 0.12) on the crystal structure and electrochemical performance were investigated. The results demonstrated that Na2.91K0.09V2(PO4)3/C had the lowest charge transfer resistance and highest Na+ diffusivity, leading to the best rate capability (Fig. 8f). Zhang et al.142 synthesized Li-ion-doped Na3−xLixV2(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0) compounds and analyzed their rearrangement mechanisms through a variety of characterization methods including DFT, NMR, and Rietveld XRD. It was found that Li ions tended to occupy the Na2 sites when the x value was small (x ≤ 0.1), while Li ions occupy both the Na1 and Na2 sites when the x value was higher than 0.1. Further, 7Li, 23Na, 51V ssNMR, and 7Li liquid NMR tests showed that Li ions were reversibly replaced by Na ions in the abeyance state for a small difference in energy conversion between Li and Na ions. The electrochemical measurement revealed that the Na2.5Li0.5V2(PO4)3/C sample showed the best rate performance (e.g., 102 mA h g−1 at 20C, Fig. 8g).

Apart from cation doping, it has been reported that anion doping was also an effective way to enhance Na storage performance of NVP. For example, Muruganantham et al.93 adopted F as the doping element to synthesize a series of Na3−xV2(PO4−xFx)3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.3) polyanion composites by using a feasible sol–gel method. It was noteworthy that the radius of F− (rF− = 1.33 Å) is similar to that of O2− (rO2− = 1.40 Å) and larger than that of V3+ (rV3+ = 0.64 Å)/V2+ (rV2+ = 0.79 Å) and Na+ (rNa+ = 1.02 Å) cations, which facilitated F− to replace O2− in order to enhance the working potential and conductivity of the host material. As a result, Na2.85V2(PO3.95F0.05)3 displayed stable cycling performance and high rate capability (Fig. 8h).

3D porous architectures are highly attractive for battery applications since they can offer several advantages as follows: (i) they can provide interstitial channels to ensure fast electron transport within the electrode and to the current collector; (ii) short lengths for fast Na-ion diffusion; and (iii) 3D porous architectures are useful for electrolyte penetration to facilitate rapid Na-ion transport and buffer the strain experienced during repeated charge/discharge cycles to maintain structural integrity. Hence, NVP cathodes with 3D porous architectures are expected to achieve high energy density, high power density, and high structural stability.

The design and fabrication of 3D porous architectures with the help of graphene is a comparatively mature technology.144–146 Inspired by this approach, Rui et al.147 developed a 3D composite of NVP nanocrystals coated with amorphous carbon attached onto rGO nanosheets (NVP@C@rGO) through a feasible freeze-drying-assisted method. Low-magnification SEM images (Fig. 9a–c) revealed the formation of an interconnected, porous 3D framework with continuous micropores. TEM examination confirmed that the NVP nanoparticles were effectively protected by an amorphous carbon layer and rGO nanosheets, ensuring fast charge transfer within the entire electrode. As a result, NVP@C@rGO was capable of completing the charge/discharge process in less than a minute (e.g., 86 mA h g−1 at 100C), and an ultralong life cycling stability (64% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at 100C, Fig. 9d). Furthermore, a similar 3D composite (i.e., NVP nanoparticles with a thin carbon layer dispersed on graphene sheets) was also reported by Fang et al.,148 displaying capacity of 76 mA h g−1 at 60C.

Introducing active materials into 3D porous frameworks/matrixes is a very simple and effective approach. For example, Zhong et al.149 deposited NVP/C on free-standing graphite foam (NVP@C-GF), and the schematic of the preparation procedure is shown in Fig. 10a. When evaluated as the cathode for SIBs, NVP@C-GF could achieve reversible capacity of 95 mA h g−1 at 10C and displayed capacity retention of 95% after 1000 cycles. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 10b and c, Jiang et al.150 developed a simple nanocasting technique to confine NVP/C nanoparticles into highly ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 matrixes (NVP@C@CMK-3). Here, the double carbon coating design suppressed the crystal growth of NVP (i.e., short Na+ diffusion distance) and provided fast electron transport pathways. This unique architecture enabled superior high-power performance (81 mA h g−1 at 30C) and better cycling stability (78 mA h g−1 at 5C after 2000 cycles).

Jiang et al.151 designed a wet chemical method to produce a N, B co-doped carbon-coated 3D flower-like composite (NVP@C-BN, Fig. 11a and b). This special architecture has advantages of short distance for electronic transport and Na-ion diffusion, high surface wettability, and more active sites for Na-ion storage due to the N, B co-doping, as well as accommodating volume expansion (Fig. 11c). As a result, the NVP@C-BN showed initial reversible capacity of 114 mA h g−1 at 1C and maintained at 104 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles. At high rates of 40, 60, 80, and 100C, reversible capacities of 101, 94, 92, and 84 mA h g−1 were still obtained, respectively. Remarkably, reversible capacity of 79 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 100C was also achieved. In addition, Wang et al.152 fabricated a new structure of “honeycomb-type hierarchical porous microball” by a simple sol–gel method. In the preparation process, surfactant in the form of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) played an important role, which could act simultaneously as a carbon source and a soft template to produce the hierarchical porous architecture. As shown in Fig. 11d–f, the as-prepared composite exhibited macro/mesopores and interconnected nanochannels on the surface of the spherical particles, which facilitated electrolyte penetration and promoted high-efficiency ion transport. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance of the honeycomb-structured microball was significantly decreased as compared to the traditional carbon-coated NVP, leading to high discharge capacities of 97 and 80 mA h g−1 at the rates of 5C and 20C, respectively.

Using the electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique (Fig. 12a), a self-supported interpenetrating 3D tricontinuous cathode, i.e., NVP-reduced graphene oxide–carbon nanotube (NVP:rGO–CNT, Fig. 12b and c), was directly deposited on the current collector of a stainless steel foil for SIBs without adding any conductive additives or binders.153 This structure combined the advantages of both batteries and supercapacitors, demonstrating impressive capacity of 82 mA h g−1 at the extremely high current density of 100C (Fig. 12d). The cycling performance was also excellent, maintaining 96% of its initial capacity at 10C after 2000 cycles. Based on ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (Fig. 12e), NVP/C porous hollow spheres were synthesized.154 As shown in Fig. 12f–h, NVP particles were uniformly decorated on the inner and outer surfaces of the porous hollow carbon spheres, showing enhanced Na storage performance for SIBs.

Biochemistry strategies are also very common in synthesizing nanomaterials with interconnecting pore cannels or hollow porous architecture for the rapid transmission of electron and Na ions. Based on these superiorities, Zhou et al.155 proposed a novel biochemistry-based synthesis route to successfully prepare NVP 3D foam nanostructures via the assembly of elastin-like polypeptides ([(VPGIG)2VPGKG(VPGIG)2]16, abbreviated as ELP16), as shown in Fig. 13a. Here, ELP16 would undergo self-aggregation through low-temperature-induced coagulation and degrade into carbon matter at 750 °C to envelope NVP nanoparticles (∼200 nm) within a 3D conductive network. This unique architecture was conducive to obtain stable and highly reversible discharge capacity of up to 109 mA h g−1 at 5C and excellent high-rate capability of 51 mA h g−1 at 200C (corresponding to a time of 18 s to fully discharge). In addition, a microalgae-based biochemistry-directed bottom-up strategy was employed by Lin and co-workers156 to construct 3D hollow porous NVP microspheres, as shown in Fig. 13b. The as-synthesized biodirected NVP sample had a highly hierarchical porous structure with abundant interconnected small pores (Fig. 13c), facilitating easy electrolyte penetration and fast ion transport. This cathodic material showed excellent cycling stability performance (e.g., 96.2% of capacity retention at 20C after 500 cycles).

Furthermore, additional details about the effect of incorporation of carbon materials, elemental doping, and designing 3D porous architectures on the electrochemical performance of NVP cathodes are summarized in Table 1.

As demonstrated in section 3, considerable efforts have been expended toward improving the electrochemical performance of NASICON-type NVP cathodic materials by carbon coating, elemental doping, and structural engineering. Their battery performances were evaluated on the basis of the half-cell configuration by using NVP composites as the cathode and Na metal foils as the anode. In practical applications, however, it is necessary to develop NVP-based full cells. Therefore, research progress on the superiority of NVP-based full cells is introduced in this section.

NASICON-type NVP, a typical polyanionic compound with a 3D open framework structure, has been considered to be a very promising cathodic material with fantastic electrochemical properties, thermal stability, and high voltage plateau (∼3.4 V) for SIBs. Meanwhile, the NVP can also be applied as the anodic material for SIBs based on the redox couple of V3+/V2+ with a voltage plateau at around 1.6 V versus Na+/Na. Inspired by these uniquely electrochemical characteristics of NVP, high-performance symmetric NVP||NVP full cells (overall reaction: 2Na3V2(PO4)3 ↔ Na5V2(PO4)3 + NaV2(PO4)3) were developed. For example, Zhang et al.210 fabricated a symmetric full-cell system (Fig. 14a) by applying the NVP/elastic carbon foam (NVP/ECF) as both self-supported cathodic and anodic materials. The NVP/ECF was prepared by using melamine foam as the scaffold. The galvanostatic charge/discharge investigation indicated that the NVP||NVP symmetric cell had an output voltage plateau located at around 1.8 V and discharge capacity of 108 mA h g−1 (based on the weight of the cathodic materials) at a current density of 0.25C (Fig. 14b). This symmetric cell could also exhibit long cycling stability (81% retention at 2C after 280 cycles, Fig. 14c). In addition, Duan et al.168 employed nano-core–shell NVP@C to construct a symmetric full cell, which delivered specific capacity of 91 mA h g−1 (based on the weight of the cathodic materials) at 2C (energy density: 155 W h kg−1) and capacity retention of 81% after 50 cycles. To further improve the performance of the symmetric full cells, interpenetrating 3D tricontinuous NVP:rGO–CNT was adopted as both cathodic and anodic materials,153 which delivered reversible capacity of 90 mA h g−1 (based on the weight of the cathodic materials) at 10C and maintained at 70 mA h g−1 with coulombic efficiency of ∼99% after 100 cycles.

On the other hand, Noguchi et al.211 designed a novel all-solid-state Na-ion symmetrical battery with NVP as the electrode and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) as the solid electrolyte. The NVP was synthesized by a routine sol–gel method and showed comparable electrochemical performance to that of a symmetric cell using a traditional liquid electrolyte, delivering initial discharge capacity of 68 mA h g−1 at current density of 1.2 μA cm−2. Furthermore, F. Lalère et al.212 successfully developed symmetrical NVP|Na3Zr2Si2PO12|NVP cells using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique, reaching 85% of the theoretical capacity of NVP at C/10 at an operating temperature of 200 °C.

To further explore the practical applications of NVP cathodes in a SIB system, a variety of anodic materials (e.g., carbonaceous materials, alloys, metal oxides, metal sulfides, polyanionic compounds, etc.) were investigated to match NVP in order to fabricate high-performance Na-ion full batteries.

Carbonaceous materials (e.g., hard carbon, graphite, etc.) are promising cost-effective anodic materials. Recently, a full cell based on NVP/C nanocomposites (cathode side) and hard carbon spheres (anode side) was reported by Jian et al.89 Although it displayed an average operating voltage of about 2.7 V, its coulombic efficiency and cycling performance were not satisfactory. Moreover, a 3D hard carbon matrix (3DHCM) derived from a sodium polyacrylate precursor was adopted as the anode for Na-ion full batteries.213 The 3DHCM||NVP full cell exhibited initial discharge capacity of 107 mA h g−1 (based on the 3DHCM mass) at 1C and maintained at 82 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. Moreover, a superior full cell was also constructed by coupling the cathode made of NVP nanoparticles wrapped by nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon layer (NVP@NSC) and the anode made of hard carbon (Fig. 15a).176 It could still exhibit initial discharge capacity of 99 mA h g−1 (based on the cathodic mass) at current density of 100 mA g−1 (Fig. 15b), corresponding to the energy density of 329 W h kg−1. In addition to hard carbon, Zhu et al.214 found outstanding Na storage performance (life span of up to ∼6000 cycles and rate capability reaching 10 A g−1) in a graphite anode. Using this anode, a full cell of graphite||NVP was constructed, showing capacity retention of ∼80% for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a cathode made of graphene-like cage structures on NVP nanoflake (NVP-NF) arrays and an anode of 3D graphene-like cages after removing NVP were paired together to form a high-performance full cell (Fig. 15c).207 This cell displayed a slope profile with average operating potential of 2.7 V and high specific capacity of 109 mA h g−1 (based on the mass of NVP-NF cathode) at 0.1 A g−1 (Fig. 15d), as well as 77.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g−1.

Polyanionic compounds with large ion transport tunnels are also favorable for use as SIB anodes. By employing the NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP) anode, a full cell of NTP||3D NVP nanofiber network (Fig. 16a) was developed by Ren et al.169 Surprisingly, this cell exhibited excellent rate capability and unprecedented cycling stability, e.g., delivering reversible capacity of 80 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 50C (Fig. 16b) and capacity retention of 97% over 300 cycles at current density of 5C (Fig. 16c). Another NTP||NVP full cell was fabricated by Rudola et al.,215 and good cycling stability was demonstrated at a rate of 5C. Furthermore, Klee et al.216 assembled a Na1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3||NVP full cell, delivering initial discharge capacity of 103 mA h g−1 (based on the NVP mass) at C/2 (energy density: 125 W h kg−1) and 67 mA h g−1 at 10C.

In addition, several high-capacity anodes were developed to couple with the NVP cathode. For example, Sun et al.217 used layer-by-layer VS2-stacked nanosheets as the anode and NVP/C as the cathode to fabricate a full cell, which showed an average operating voltage plateau at ∼1.5 V and reversible capacity of ∼220 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 17a). Peng et al.218 developed a full cell based on CoS@rGO hybrid anode and electrospun NVP@C cathode, displaying reversible capacity of ∼300 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 17b). The full cell of Ni3S2/C||NVP/rGO demonstrated by Zhao et al.37 showed an average discharge voltage platform of 1.7 V and initial discharge capacity of 167 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at 0.5 A g−1. Rui et al.147 produced a Fe3S4||NVP@C@rGO full cell, exhibiting highly reversible capacity of around 305 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at current density of 100 mA g−1 with an average output voltage of about 1.7 V (Fig. 17c). Moreover, a structure comprising FeSe2 microspheres assembled by nanooctahedra was adopted as the anode to couple with the NVP cathode,219 which delivered discharge capacity of 366 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at 1 A g−1 at an output voltage of about 1.7 V (Fig. 17d). The full cell consisting of NVP/C cathode and MoSe2-covered N,P-doped carbon nanosheet (MoSe2/N,P-rGO) anode showed superior energy densities of 114 and 57.6 W h kg−1 at 0.1 and 1.68 kW kg−1, respectively (Fig. 17e).220 A pouch-type Na-ion full cell comprising a Cu3P nanowire anode and NVP cathode exhibited high practical energy density of 104.5 W h kg−1.221 Moreover, Zhang et al.222 successfully assembled a Na-ion full cell of Sb/rGO||NVP/rGO, which presented initial discharge capacities of 642 mA h g−1 (based on the anodic mass) at a current rate of 100 mA g−1 and maintained at 400 mA h g−1 with the coulombic efficiency of more than 95% upon 100 cycles (Fig. 17f).

Furthermore, more details about the electrochemical performance of the NVP-based full cells with various types of anodic materials are summarized in Table 2.

NVP cathodic materials have received increasing attention with respect to their prominent advantages of high voltage platform, good cycle performance, and outstanding thermal stability. However, their electrical conductivity is relatively poor, limiting their practical applications in large-scale energy storage systems. To resolve this problem, several strategies, e.g., surface modification and elemental doping, have been developed to enhance the electrochemical performance of NVP cathodes. Therefore, recent advances in the strategies for performance improvement in NVPs have been reviewed, mainly involving the incorporation of carbon materials (e.g., amorphous carbon, CNTs, and graphene) in NVP cathodes and elemental doping. In addition to electrical conductivity, Na-ion transportation is also very important, and therefore, the designing and fabrication of 3D porous NVP-based architectures have been summarized. Finally, to demonstrate the application prospects of NVP cathodes, some full cells constructed by the combination of anodes of NVP, NaTi2(PO4)3, hard carbon, graphite, CoS, Ni3S2, etc. are discussed.

Significant improvement has been made in NVP cathodes over the past decades in terms of cycling stability and rate capabilities. While mature synthesis methods of NVP have been achieved, the challenge now involves the migration of NVP beyond lab-scale research and toward industry-compatible production. For example, the novel freeze-drying method is limited by its long experimental time, high cost, and low efficiency, and therefore, it is imperative to explore alternative strategies that can yield smaller but more uniform NVP compounds in a large scale for SIBs. In addition, novel advancements at the fundamental and mechanistic levels might reduce the gap in understanding the intriguing electrochemical characteristic of modified NVP composites with a relatively long voltage zone. Apart from the development of NVP cathodes, the optimization of the anodic materials is equally essential to further improve the assembly process of SIBs. Most anodic materials have an inherently low initial coulombic efficiency owing to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, consuming a large amount of NVP cathodes in the full-cell configuration and subsequently decreasing electrochemical stability. It is, therefore, highly desirable to combine high-performance SIB anodic materials to well-coupled NVP-based cathodes. Furthermore, the optimization of the electrolytic system is another important aspect for practical applications of NVP cathodes. Developing environmentally friendly, low cost, highly safe electrolytes (e.g., aqueous and solid-state electrolytes) is also attractive. Overall, it is certain that a wide range of applications can be envisioned if SIBs are being developed into an affordable and efficient large-scale storage system, taking it one step closer to eventual commercialization.
