In this study, amperometric NO2 sensors based on Na+ superionic conductor electrolyte and sensing electrodes with different WO3 nanostructures (WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3) have been fabricated and compared. Sensing properties, such as optimum test temperature, sensitivity, repeatability, and selectivity have been determined and compared. Compared with the literatures, the sensors, prepared using three different WO3 nanostructures, all showed improved sensing properties to 100–1000 ppb NO2 at low work temperatures of 100–150 °C. Among above sensors, the sensor equipped with mesoporous WO3 sensing electrode exhibited the best amperometric sensitivity characteristics and the minimum test temperature. The relationship between the sensing properties and the mesoporous structure has also been discussed. What’s more, the sensor can test ppb-level NO2 in low temperature, which makes it possible to monitor low concentrations of NO2 in the air.

In recent years, with industrial and economic growth, exhaust gases emitted from industry and automobiles have posed a severe threat to human health and environment [1, 2]. To solve these urgent problems, high-performance sensors are critical. The detection of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is especially important because besides being a highly toxic gas, it is the main source of acid rain and photochemical smog. As per the environmental regulations of many countries, the maximum allowable concentration of NO2 in the air is 5 ppm [3]. US Environmental Protection Agency’s report states that children frequently exposed to NO2 concentrations higher than 53 ppb may be more susceptible to acute respiratory illnesses [4]. Therefore, monitoring of NO2 levels in air is of great importance in terms of both environmental protection and human health.

Many types of NO2 sensors have been reported thus far, such as current-type [5, 6], potential-type [7, 8], resistance-type [9, 10] and SAW-type (surface acoustic sensor) [11, 12]. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON) have emerged as popular solid electrolytes used in gas sensors. YSZ has stable properties and shows high oxygen ionic conductivity at high temperature (0.16 S/cm at 1000 °C) [13], and can only be used at temperatures above 500 °C [14,15,16]. NASICON shows high ionic conductivity at comparatively low temperatures (2.7 × 10−3 S/cm at room temperature) [17], making it suitable for operation at low to medium temperatures [18, 19]. The sensing electrode plays an important role in determining sensing performances because sensing electrode materials can catalyze chemical reactions. Metal oxide materials, such as ZnO, In2O3, and SnO2 [20,21,22], have been widely used as sensing materials in gas sensors. Among these, WO3 is a suitable candidate for application in the detection of NO2 at low concentrations and low temperatures [23,24,25].

It has been reported that the surface morphology of metal oxides can effectively enhance the sensor response and lower the working temperature [26,27,28]. To increase the sensitivity of the sensors to NO2 and to reduce the test temperature, different WO3 nanostructures (WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3) have been investigated herein as sensing materials and compared to each other. The designed WO3 nanostructures should enhance the NO2 sensing performances of the sensors.

NASICON was prepared by a high-temperature solid-state method according to a reported procedure [29]. WO3 nanoparticles were prepared as follows: 5 g commercial WO3 was added to 100 mL alcohol and was ground for 2 h by sand milling at a rotational speed of 1800 rpm.

WO3 nanosheets were synthesized by exfoliation from layered compounds. First, Bi2W2O9 was prepared by a solid-state reaction between Bi2O3 and WO3 at 800 °C for 2 h. Then 5 g Bi2W2O9 was added to 400 mL 6 M HCl and was heated in a microwave oven to yield H2W2O7·xH2O. The as-obtained H2W2O7·xH2O (0.1 g) was added to 25 mL 0.05 M tetramethylammonium hydroxide and was ultrasonicated for 30 min to produce WO3 nanosheet sol.

Mesoporous WO3 replica was synthesized by using SBA-15 as a hard template. SBA-15 was prepared according to previous reports [30]. SBA-15 (1 g) was added to a solution of 10 g ethanol and 3.5 g silicotungstic acid, followed by ultrasonic treatment to expel the bubbles in the pore channel. After stirring for 24 h, the mixture was dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h in air. Finally, the SBA-15 was removed with 60 mL 3 M HF. The obtained slurry was centrifuged, washed, and dried to obtain mesoporous WO3.

The synthesized WO3 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Agilent 7890B D8), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, LVEM5 JEM-2100F), Specific surface area meter (Kodak DXS4000pro BELSORP-max), Dynamic light scattering particle size analysis (HYL-1076, Dandong haoyu), and Atomic Force Microscope (NX12, Park SYSTEMS).

Schematic diagram of the sensor is shown in Fig. 1. The sensing electrode (SE), reference electrode (RE), and counter electrode (CE) were formed by screen-printing Pt paste on both sides of the NASICON disk, and Pt wires were attached to all the electrodes. The RE was sealed with an inorganic adhesive (HR-8767, Huirui Electronic Co., Ltd) to avoid direct contact with the sample gas. The CE was coated by NaNO2. WO3 nanoparticles and mesoporous WO3 were separately mixed in ethyl alcohol by ball milling for 30 min to form WO3 paste, which was then spread on the SE. According to the same amount WO3 as above SE, WO3 nanosheet sol was directly dropped on the SE.

The sensor was placed inside a quartz tube in a tube furnace. The background gas contained 79% N2 and 21% O2. The total flow rate was fixed to 100 mL/min, controlled by a computer-controlled gas mass flow controller (MFCs). The current value was measured by an electrochemical workstation. The sensitivity of sensor was defined as the slope of the working curve.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized NASICON (Fig. 2A(a)) shows that the phase is Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (JCPDS: 33-1314), which has a trigonal crystal structure. Figure 2A(b) displays the main XRD peaks of WO3 nanoparticles, well conformed to the monoclinic WO3 phase (JCPDS: 43-1035). The crystal size calculated by Scherrer’s formula is 38 nm, which is smaller than that shows in TEM, so the observed particles are formed by aggregated nanocrystals. As shown in Fig. 2A(c), the wide-angle XRD pattern of mesoporous WO3 is similar to that of WO3 nanoparticles, but the peaks are weaker and wider than those of WO3 nanoparticles. No diffraction peaks attributed to silicon dioxide are observed, indicating that the SBA-15 template was completely removed. The low-angle XRD pattern of mesoporous WO3 (Fig. 2B) reveals that mesoporous WO3 and the SBA-15 template (inset of Fig. 2B) exhibit similar regular channel structures [31]. However, the intensities of the (110) and (200) diffraction planes of mesoporous WO3 are lower than those of SBA-15, implying that the nanostructure sequence of mesoporous WO3 is lower than that of the template [32]. The XRD of WO3 nanosheets is shown as Fig. 2A(d). Near the position of main peaks displayed in the patterns of WO3, there is only a weak broadening peak due to the disordered stacking of 2D nanosheets.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations are used to characterize the microstructures of the WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3. The TEM image of WO3 nanoparticles (Fig. 3a) shows various oval-shaped particles with a particle size distribution between 30 and 100 nm. The particle size of WO3 nanoparticles determined by DLS technique is about 200 nm, which also indicates the aggregation of nanoparticles. Figure 3b shows WO3 nanosheets with plate-like morphology. The enlarged image of the local area shown in Fig. 3b (Fig. 3c) reveals a smooth and transparent surface. Figure 3d is a typical AFM image of WO3 nanosheets, indicating very thin thickness of about 1 nm. From Fig. 3e, the long-range order of the mesostructure and the uniformity of the pore channels are confirmed. The inset of Fig. 3e shows a uniform honeycomb pore with a diameter of 7.5 nm.

Specific surface area (SSA) of different nano-structured WO3 was measured by using N2 adsorption isothermal at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The BET SSA of the samples was calculated using multipoint method, based on the linearized BET equation accorded to thirteen points of relative pressure (P/P0) ranging from 0.05 to 0.35 and the corresponding adsorption amount. SSA of WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3 was 25 m2/g, 99 m2/g, and 209 m2/g, respectively. The large specific surface area of mesoporous WO3 is conducive to gas adsorption, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the sensor.

The polarization curves of the gas sensor device fabricated herein were obtained in 500 ppb NO2 by varying the applied voltage between − 500 and 100 mV, relative to the RE. Figure 4 shows that the transient signal of the three SE materials could reach a stable plateau within the voltage range from − 400 to − 100 mV, which suggested that the potential of the Pt electrode sealed with an inorganic adhesive remained constant during the test. In other words, the electrode can work as a stable RE [33]. Therefore, an intermediate value (− 250 mV) from the stable potential range was selected for the sensor test. Temperature can influence Na+ migration, adsorption and desorption of gases, and generation and decomposition of sodium nitrite. Therefore, the best test temperature should be explored. Figure 5 shows the working curves of the three SE materials at different temperatures at the voltage of − 250 mV. The highest temperature in our experiment is 170 °C because above this temperature, the NaNO2 is easy to form into cakes and relaxation connected to the NASICON and thereby deactivates the NASICON electrolyte [34]. With increasing temperature, sensitivity performance first increased and then decreased. The optimal performance temperatures of WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3 are 150 °C, 120 °C, and 100 °C, respectively. Thus, the temperature limit for detection of the three SE materials was 100 °C, 80 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. These results indicate that the specific surface obviously influences the activity of SE electrode. High specific surface area usually causes a large number of active sites, which enhances the gas adsorption, improves the catalytic efficiency and then reduces the working temperature of sensing electrodes.

Working curves of the three SE materials, at their respective optimal operation temperature, are presented in Fig. 6a. The sensitivity of mesoporous WO3 (S = 3.1) is larger than those of WO3 nanosheets (S = 2.25) and WO3 nanoparticles (S = 1.05), attributed to the unique structural properties of stable mesopores and the large surface area of mesoporous WO3, which can improve sensitivity to NO2 and significantly lower the test temperature. Figure 6b shows the dynamic response curve. The current of all three sensors increased with the increasing NO2 concentration. The sensors all demonstrated good response–recovery performance.

Sensor parameters of the different reported SEs are listed in Table 1. The comparison reveals that mesoporous WO3 has the lowest test temperature, the highest current value, and the highest sensitivity. Therefore, an NO2 sensor equipped with mesoporous WO3 as the SE and NASICON as the solid electrolyte has the best performance.

As mentioned in most papers, repeatability and stability of a sensor are important determinants of its quality. Therefore, we studied the repeatability of sensors designed herein under their respective optimum test conditions; the results are shown in Fig. 7. Over 28 days, the working curves of the sensors designed using the three different SE materials are almost superposed, indicating that all the sensors have satisfying repeatability and stability. Among these, the sensor with mesoporous WO3 shows the best repeatability.

High selectivity for the target NO2 gas when exposed to other gas molecules is very important for a real-time gas monitoring equipment. The cross-value of the three SE materials to other gases is measured at − 250 mV at their respective optimum operation temperatures, and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 8. The cross-values to CO2, CO, H2O, CH4, C2H6O, and CH3COCH3 are rather small or almost none, indicating excellent NO2 selectivity of all three SE materials studied. Therefore, the interference from other gases can be ignored. For example, the current of mesoporous WO3 SE material is 3300 nA in 1000 ppb NO2, while the currents associated with CO2 CO of concentrations 1000 ppm were 300 and 160 nA, respectively, and is 80 nA for water vapor, 10 nA for 200 ppm CH4, 120 nA for 110 ppm C2H6O and 50 nA for 470 ppm CH3COCH3.

Figure 9a shows the proposed sensing mechanism of an amperometric NO2 sensor, when an appropriate voltage is applied between the SE and the RE. When the gas is piped in, reaction (1) occurred at the SE while the reverse reaction (2) occurred at the CE [37, 38]. On the CE, NaNO2 decomposed to produce Na+, NO2, and electrons. The produced Na+ ions flow though NASICON to the SE under the influence of the applied electric field, and the electrons flowed to the SE through the external circuit simultaneously. An electrochemical workstation was employed to record the current resulting from this movement between the SE and the CE. Once the Na+ and electron generated on the CE reach the SE, they react with NO2 to regenerate NaNO2. Therefore, the current produced by the directional migration of the electron can reflect the concentration of NO2.

The above electrochemical reactions occur with high selectivity under the operating conditions; therefore, NO2 sensitivity is hardly influenced by the presence of other gases (Fig. 9b).

WO3 is a typical n-type semiconductor that can provide electrons directly to NO2. When exposed to NO2, reaction (3) occurs on the WO3 surface to produce NO2− [39], which will react with Na+ from the CE to form NaNO2. Therefore, the decomposition of NaNO2 on the CE is accelerated, thus increasing the current [36].

The sensitivity depends on the catalytic activity of WO3. Good sensitivity is obtained by using mesoporous WO3 as the SE, which can be explained as follows. Firstly, mesoporous WO3 has a large specific surface area and provides much more catalytic active sites [40]. Secondly, catalytic activity increases strongly with Knudsen diffusion of NO2 in mesoporous WO3. The mean free path of NO2 is 1.14 × 10−7 m at 100 °C, which is larger than the diameter of mesoporous WO3 (7.5 × 10−9 m). Therefore, the gas diffusion is dominated by the Knudsen diffusion. During Knudsen diffusion of NO2 in mesoporous WO3, the collision numbers, collision frequencies of NO2 with WO3 surface arise greatly as shown in Fig. 9b. So mesoporous structures have excellent catalytic performance [41,42,43].

A compact solid electrolyte sensor using a NASICON disk and sensing electrodes composed of different WO3 nanostructures have been examined to show good sensing properties for ppb-level detection of NO2. The current value is linearly dependent on the NO2 concentration in the range of 100–1000 ppb at the examined temperature. The sensitivities of WO3 nanoparticles, WO3 nanosheets, and mesoporous WO3 at their respective optimum test temperatures are 1.05, 2.25, and 3.1 nA/ppb, respectively. With increasing specific surface area of the SE materials, their optimum test temperatures decreased. All the results reveal that mesoporous WO3 shows the highest catalytic activity even at a low working temperature of 100 °C due to its large specific surface area and uniform mesoporous structure. The as-prepared sensors also showed excellent reproducibility and selectivity to NO2 in the presence of interfering gases like CO, CO2, and water vapor.
