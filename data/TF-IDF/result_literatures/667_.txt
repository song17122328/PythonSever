Lithiu m ion conducting NASICON glass-ceramics have been prepared by a novel planetary ball millingassisted synthesis route.
Structural, thermal and electrical investigations have been carried out on the novelcomposites composed of LiTi(PO4)3 (LTP) and 50[Li2SO4]-50[Li2O-P2O5] ionic glass reveal interesting results.
Co mposites were prepared keeping the concentration of the ionic glass fixed at 20 wt%.
X-ray diffraction anddifferential thermal ana lysis confirm the glass-ceramic formation.
Moreover, the structure of LTP remains intactduring the glass-ceramic formation.
Electrical conductivity of the glass-ceramic co mposite is found to be higher thanthat of the pristine glass (50LSLP) and LTP.
The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of LTP exhib itimprovement in composite.
Owing to high ionic conductivity and thermal stability, novel glass-ceramic seems to bea promising candidate for all solid-state battery applications.
The investigations on novel glass-ceramics reveal the following results:1. The process leads to glass-ceramic formation.
In these, superionic LTP exists in large amount.
The processalso gives a freedom to choose appropriate particle size of LTP.
A significant rise in the in-grain and notable rise in grain boundary conductivity is witnessed in glassceramics.
The added glassy phase possibly provides high Li+ ion concentration at the grain boundaries andgrain interface.
Thus, Li+ ion moves through connected pathways.
The novel glass-ceramics are thermally stable and potential candidates for all solid-state battery applicationsdue to their high conductivity and thermal stability.
