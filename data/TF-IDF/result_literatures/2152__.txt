Introduction Nasicon-type phosphates have been extensively studied and they present various applications. In addition to their ionic conductivity they can be used as electrode materials, low thermal expansion ceramics, luminophores and catalysts [1–10]. Their ionic exchange properties interest the nuclear industry and they can help to store radioactive wastes [11].

The copper Nasicon-type phosphates are favored among other compounds by the presence of copper in two oxidization states (C1 and C2). These phosphates have been used as catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions [6–8]. CuZr2(PO4)3 was lately discovered as the ﬁrst Cu(I)-rich insulator phosphor exhibiting two types of emitting centers [9]; as the structure present a vacant character, the enrichment in these Cu(I) centers has been also performed [10]. Oxidation of CuZr2(PO4)3 leads reversibly to the Nasicon phosphate Cu0:5Zr2(PO4)3 involving a redox system in a broad temperature range without three-dimensional network modiﬁcation, since it displays a substantial rigidity [12]. Recent works using EPR experiment at X and Q bands of the Cu0:5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphate have revealed the presence of Cu2C ion in both M(1) and M(2) sites

C C of the Nasicon-structure [13]. Furthermore, Cu -H exchange has studied in CuZr2(PO4)3, leading to new derived protoned phosphates as supports for catalysis [1, 2], formulated as follows: Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 (0 < x < 1) and Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 (0:5 < x < 1). These phosphates, being Cu(I) and Cu(II)-rich compounds respectively, have been investigated by different techniques (X-ray diffraction, Infrared spectroscopy, EXAFS, : : :) [1, 5]. They belong to Nasicon-type family with a three-dimensional network built up of ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra (Fig. 1). Its structures show triclinic distortion compared with that of NaZr2(PO4)3 [1], in which two sites usually labeled as M(1) and M(2) can be occupied by copper ions. The M(1) site is a trigonally distorted octahedron, formed by the common faces of two neighboring ZrO6 octahedra perpendicular to the c-axis of the hexagonal cell. Thus the 3D-network can be considered as made up of inﬁnite ribbons [O3ZrO3M(1)O3ZrO3M(1)O3ZrO3]1 linked by PO4 tetrahedra. The M(2) site with a coordination varying from eight to ten is located in a large and distorted cavity between these layers.

In the lack of detailed structural information concerning the distribution and the local environment

of Cu2C (0 < x < 1) and Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 (0:5 < x < 1) sets have been investigated using EPR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Covalence of copper-oxygen bondings is discussed in terms of the Molecular Orbital theory in the case of Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3.

2. Experimental Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 samples (0 < x < 1) were obtained by washing the compound CuZr2(PO4)3 with 0.3N HCl. This latter compound was previously prepared by heating a stoichiometric mixture of ZrP2O7, ZrO2 and Cu2O. The oxidation of the products at 400 C leads to Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 samples with 0:5 < x < 1. The preparation mode has been described in Ref. [1].

EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature on Varian spectrometer operating at X-band frequency (9.5 GHz) using a dual sample cavity. It produces the ﬁrst derivative of the absorption spectra with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld B. The static magnetic ﬁeld is measured by means of a nuclear ﬂux-meter linked up to a Hewlett-Packard frequency counter; the microwave frequency is measured with the same counter.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range from 4.2 K to the ambient were carried out using the Faraday method.

3. Results Figs 2 and 3 illustrate the room temperature EPR spectra recorded at X-band for Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 and Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 solid compounds respectively. Several compositions have been investigated (1¡ x D 0:03; 0.24; 0.26 for Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 and 1¡ x D 0:15; 0.20; 0.24; 0.26 for Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1 Zr2(PO4)3). Four hyperﬁne lines occur, they are attributed to the interaction between the unpaired electronic spin (S D 1=2) and the nuclear one (I D 3=2) of Cu2C ion. For the ﬁrst set this structure is relatively resolved, the hyperﬁne line intensities are low and slightly favored by the copper content. For the second one the spectra present greater width with poorly resolved hyperﬁne structure.

The spectra have been described by the spin Hamiltonian formed by the Zeeman term perturbed by the hyperﬁne one [13]:

where ﬂ is the Bohr magneton, B the static magnetic ﬁeld, g and A the g-factor and the hyperﬁne term A tensors, respectively.

W ( 181); ’) is the transition probability for the hyperﬁne line corresponding to a magnetic quantum number of spin m, it depends on the orientation of the applied static magnetic ﬁeld with respect to the principal axes of the g-tensor. F((B ¡ B0)=1B) is the ﬁrst derivative of the function-shape, B0 the resonance magnetic ﬁeld and 1B the half-width at half-height. The spectra have been simulated using an isotropic line-width and more marked anisotropies of the g and A tensors.

The simulated spectra are compared with the experimental ones for Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2); the hyperﬁne structure is reproduced in computing one signal. The EPR parameters derived from these ﬁts are reported on Table I. As Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 compounds EPR spectra are very similar to that of Cu0:5Zr2(PO4)3 prepared by solid route (for which the presence of two EPR signals has been concluded using X and Q bands [13), computations in Fig. 3a are therefore realized for this second set taking into consideration two signals, called thereafter signal 1 and signal 2 (Fig. 3b). The signal 1 is similar to Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 EPR spectra with a partially resolved hyperﬁne structure, while the second one is not resolved. Best-ﬁts simulation parameters are listed in Table I.

4. Discussion 4.1. EPR parameters and characterization of Cu2C sites Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 contains a very low Cu2C content which lightly increases with (1¡ x), the line-width 1B growth (Table I) is explained by the decrease of the average distance between paramagnetic centers as their ¡3 i). A maximal anisotropy of rates increase (1B / h r g and A tensors is observed along the local z-axis, while anisotropy can be neglected in the perpendicular plane. So, the symmetry can be considered as quasi-axial and we can deﬁne parallel and perpendicular components with respect to the z-axis:

g-factor values suggest a predominate jdx 2 ¡ y2i ground orbital state and an axially distorted octahedral oxygen environment of Cu2C ion (as gk > g? > ge with ge D 2.0023 is the free-electron g-value [14–17]) which would be close to the M(1) site geometry. In the case of Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 compounds the C Curie’s constant [18], deduced from the magnetic susceptibility measurements (Fig. 4), allows to estimate the Cu2C concentration (Table II); the rate of paramagnetic ions increases with the copper content.

lution of the ratio of the Cu2C occupation of M(2) sites to that of M(1) ones versus (1¡ x). This shows that Cu2C ions are located in majority at M(1) sites (from about 73% for 1¡ x D 0:15 to 69% for 1¡ x D 0:26), the M(2) sites are ready to be occupied as the copper content increases.

In M(1) site Cu2C

Bond covalence The spin hamiltonian parameters of the signals 1 and 2 vary with the composition of Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 set (Table I), this variation can be related to the covalent character of Cu2C ion bondings in M(1) and M(2) sites. ion is subjected approximately to axial crystalline ﬁeld (e.g., D4h). Using the relationships quoted in Ref. [20], we have calculated the molecular orbital coefﬁcients ﬁ2, ﬂ2 1 and ﬂ2 values, in terms of gk, g?, Ak and A?. These coefﬁcients represent respectively the electron densities on dx 2 ¡ y2, dx y and dxz;yz orbitals involved in Cu-O bondings, they describe respectively the covalence of in-plane  190) and … bondings and out-of-plane … bondings. The calculations of these coefﬁcients require the use of 1Ex y and 1Exz;yz energy values, which correspond to jdx 2 ¡ y2i!jdx yi and jdx 2 ¡ y2i ! jdxz; yzi electronic transitions respec¡1, deduced from tively; the values 11300 and 14290 cm the Cu0:5Zr2(PO4)3 optical spectrum [13], have been adopted.

Results of calculations are listed in Table IV. ﬁ2 change little in terms of the composition indicating that the local environment of Cu2C ions is not largely affected. Furthermore, ﬁ2 is close to 1 suggesting that the unpaired electron is almost located in the dx 2 ¡y2 atomic orbital. Moreover, the slight decrease of ﬁ2 as the copper content increases (Table IV) indicates that the Cu2C ion  190) bondings with the four equatorial oxygen become then more covalent. In the same way the 1¡ ﬂ2 1 coefﬁcient decreases (Table IV) expressing therefore a more ionic character of in-plane … bondings. (ﬁ2 C ﬂ2 1 )=2 characterizes the average d-electron delocalisation in x y plane of Cu2C complex [21], as this parameter decreases the in-plane bondings become more covalent. This bonding parameter presents diminishing values when the rate of copper ion increases (Table IV). This variation signiﬁes a “more free” unpaired electron in x y plane; consequently, the local directional difference  176) between x y plane and z-axis (Table III) and the average g-factor gav should decrease (Table IV). ﬂ2 is close to 1 indicating that there is very low overlaps of d-orbitals with ligand pz atomic orbitals in xz and yz planes; hence, the out-of-plane … bondings of the CuO6 octahedron are ionic. This latter character is consistent

For the portion of Cu2C

ions occupying M(2) sites in Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1Zr2(PO4)3 hosts the symmetry is lower than axial, the approximation of the square-planar model is not valid. For simplicity, we assume an orthorhombic symmetry (e.g., D2h) [13]. Under the inﬂuence of this ﬁeld the jdx 2 ¡ y2 i ground orbital state is combined with the jdz2i excited orbital state [15]:

where ﬁ2 is the probability of the electron to be found in metal d-orbitals, and t the mixing ratio of the dz2 excited orbital to the dx 2 ¡ y2 orbital linked to gx and gy by the following relationship [15]:

(5) with 1gx;y D gx;y ¡ ge. The values of the mixing ratio t of the dz2 excited orbital to the dx 2 ¡ y2 orbital are not negligible, it ranges from 8 to 11%.

Using the relations quoted in Ref. [15] we have also calculated, in terms of EPR-parameters, the anisotropic hyperﬁne terms adi (i D x; y and z) and the d-orbital unpaired spin density ﬁ2 (Table V). For these ions the absolute values of adx , ady , adz and ﬁ2 decrease as copper ion rate increases (Table V). It suggests that the covalence become more important and the unpaired electron tends to move more far from the nucleus along the three x, y and z directions. This evolution can be explained by the increase of copper content which reduces the absolute value of the negative charge of ligand. In accordance with this result, the directional difference  176) (Table III) and also gav tend to decrease (Table V). The relatively smaller values of ﬁ2 indicate that the in-plane  190)Cu-o bondings in M(2) sites are more covalent than in M(1) ones.

5. Conclusion C reaction in the CuZr2(PO4)3 The exchange Cu host has formed two Nasicon-type sets with variable rates of copper. In Cu1¡ xHxZr2(PO4)3 compounds, Cu2C ion is located in axially distorted octahedron which concords with M(1) site geometry. The g-factor

components suggest that the ground orbital state is predominately jdx 2 ¡ y2i. The EPR results reported in the case of Cu1¡ xH2x ¡ 1 Zr2(PO4)3 have revealed that Cu2C ions are located in M(1) and M(2) sites, with a majority in the ﬁrst one; the ratio of the Cu2C occupation of M(2) sites to that of M(1) ones rises with copper content. Following the molecular orbital theory Cu2C ion in M(1) site is interpreted by a model of square-planar conﬁguration with a jdx 2 ¡ y2i predominant ground orbital state character. The g-factor components suggest a more distorted geometry of coordination in M(2) sites and the fundamental orbital state isjdx 2 ¡ y2i with a small admixture of the jdz2i excited orbital state. The in-plane  190)Cu-o bondings in M(2) sites are more covalent than in M(1) ones.
