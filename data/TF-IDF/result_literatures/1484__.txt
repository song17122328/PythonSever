Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound was synthesized by solid-state reaction, and ceramics were sintered. The surfaces of the ceramics were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 samples were tested in solid g a l v a n i c c e l l s A g | O 2 + C O 2 | L i 2 C O 3 | L i 1 . 3 A l 0 . 1 5 Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3|LiMnO2+Mn2O3|O2|Ag. The electromotive force measurements of this cell indicated that investigated samples are practically pure Li-ion conductors. Impedance spectroscopy studies have been performed in the −2–3·109 Hz and temperatures from −57 °C frequency range 10 to 334 °C. Three dispersion regions related to Li+ ionic transport in bulk, grain boundaries of the ceramics and to polarization of electrodes have been found. Total conductivity changes according to Arrhenius law in the studied temperature range, but an anomalous behavior was observed for the bulk conductivity of the ceramics.

Li+ ion solid electrolytes (SE) with NASICON-type framework have been found and are candidates for applications in CO2 gas sensors and solid-state batteries [1–5]. The system Li1+xMxTi2−x(PO4)3 (where M=Al, Sc, Y, Fe, Cr) seems to be most suitable for Li+ ionic transport in the framework [6, 7]. A host compound LiTi2(PO4)3 is a its bulk ionic conductivity σb=2 pure ionic conductor, −4 S/m at room temperature [8]. Conductivity increases 10 rapidly then Ti4+ is partially substituted by MIII+Li+ ions in the above-mentioned system up to about x=0.3 [6]. The biggest attention has been paid to the Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 system changing the stoichiometric factor x and conditions of ceramics’ preparation. Conventional solid-state reaction [9, 10], sol-gel process [11], ceramics’ crystallization from glass [12], and ionic exchange Na+⟶Li+ in Na1.3 Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 [13] have been performed to obtain any of Li1.2Al0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3, Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, or Li1.4 Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 solid electrolytes. Different procedures of the preparation of solid electrolytes cause different grain boundary conductivity of the obtained ceramics; on the other hand, bulk conductivity can be changed by changing the cation MIII and consequently the NASICON framework dimensions [14]. Bulk ionic conductivities of Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 and Li1.3Y0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics −2 S/m, respectively [14]. Authors are 2.1 10 [15] have reported conductivity of a double substituted Li1.3Sc0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics, its σb=0.18 S/m at room temperature.

High ionic conductivity of above-mentioned NASICONtype structure solid electrolyte compounds stimulate further investigation and make the materials promising for applications in the functional elements of solid-state ionics. The crystal structure, microwave electrical properties at high temperatures, and nuclear magnetic resonance of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound were investigated in [16]. This material belongs to the rhombohedral crystal symmetry (space group R− 3c) which is typical for most NASICON conductors, but nuclear magnetic resonance investigation has showed only one lithium site [16]. In some NASICON-type structure compounds, Li ions occupy two different energy sites in the lattice [8, 9]. In the present paper, we continue the study of solid electrolyte LiTi2(PO4)3 compound where Ti4+ is partially substituted by Al+3 and Y+3 ions. In the work, we present the results of the investigation of electrical properties of Li1.3Al0.15 Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics in the wider frequency range −2–3 109) Hz and low temperature range (−57 °C to (10 334) °C by impedance spectroscopy. In the literature, we did not find experimental results concerning Li-ion transfer number of this compound so the electronic conductivity of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics was investigated in this work by electromotive force (EMF) method. The surfaces of the ceramics were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The powder of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 has been prepared by solid-state reaction in the same way as reported in [16]. Eight-millimeter die was used to press the pellets at 300 MPa pressure, and ceramics have been sintered at 1,130 °C for 1 h. The polished and thermally etched (1,000 °C for 20 min with 10 °C/min heating and cooling rates) surface of ceramics was investigated by SEM (LEO 1530, Carl Zeiss SMT). XPS were recorded by the LAS3000 (ISA-Riber) surface analysis equipment. The instrument was equipped with a double-pass cylindrical-mirror analyzer MAC2. The XPS spectra were obtained by using Mg Kα (hν=1,253.6 eV) radiation at an average of ten scans with step size 0.05 eV. Before measurements, the samples were kept in a preparation chamber (residual pressure 1.3 10 −6 Pa) of the experimental setup for 1 day. pressure 1.3 10 The residual pressure in the analyzer chamber was equal to −8 Pa. In order to extract the surface core level shifts 1.3 10 and relative intensities of these components, a curve-fitting procedure was utilized. The fitting of the core level data was performed using a nonlinear fitting procedure (Software XPSPEAK 41).

Platinum electrodes were prepared on sintered cylindrical sample by sputtering and applying a conductive Pt paste (Demetron 308A) fired at 800 °C. Two probe ac measurements −2–107 Hz of electrical impedance in the frequency range 10 and temperatures form −57 °C to 334 °C were performed by Novocontrol Alpha-N Dielectric Analyzer or Solartron 1260 Impedance/Gain Phase Analyser connected to Keithley 428 Current Amplifier. Temperature of the sample was controlled by Eurotherm 2408 temperature controller. A heater was used for sample heating, and Peltier elements were used for cooling. In the frequency range 3 105–3 109 Hz and temperature range 300–600 K, the measurements were carried out by Agilent Network Analyser E5062A connected to coaxial line. Transmission coefficient of the coaxial line loaded with the sample was measured to calculate impedance. The temperature was measured by Digital Thermometer TMD 90A and controlled by a computer connected to Mastech DC Power Supply HY 30005-2.

Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 samples were also comparatively tested as Li-ion conducting solid electrolytes in a solid galvanic cell, which could be written schematically:jLiMnO2þMn2O3jO2jAg ð1Þ LiMnO2 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction from a mixture of Li2CO3 (Merck) and Mn2O3 (Merck) with 1:1 ratio at 1,023 K in inert gas atmosphere. The working electrode in the cell (1) contains mixture of MnO2 and Mn2O3 powders whereas the reference electrode is pure Li2CO3 powder (Merck). The respective powders were pressed at 200 MPa to obtain cylindrical pellets of about 10 and 2 mm in thickness. The same cell (1), but containing Li–β-Al2O3 as a solid electrolyte was previously successfully applied to determine standard molar free energy of formation of LiMnO2 [17, 18]. The EMF of the cell (1) is a result of a difference in the activity of lithium ions at the electrodes.

The relative density of the ceramics was found to be 92%. Figure 1 shows SEM image of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics’ surface. Grain sizes of the ceramics are highly distributed. The average grain size of the ceramics was determined using linear intercept method and is about 14 μm. A correlation factor between intercept length and grain size was 1.56. The distribution of the grain sizes of the studied Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics is shown in Fig. 2.

XSP spectra of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics are shown in Fig. 3a–f. To exclude any effects on the values of binding energies due to charging of the sample during the XPS analysis, all data were corrected by a linear shift such that the peak maximum of the C 1 s binding energy of adventitious carbon corresponded to 284.6 eV. Ti 2p, P 2p, O 1s, Y 3d, Al 2p, and Li 1s core level XP spectra were fitted. Ti 2p spectrum is shown in Fig. 3a. The spectrum shows spin-orbit doublet of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2. The determined binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 are 459.5 and 465.3 eV, respectively. The binding energy splitting between 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 is 5.8 eV. The binding energy splitting between 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 is 5.4 eV [19]. Ti 2p spectrum has been deconvoluted into two spin-orbit doublets. The one at lower 2p3/2 binding energy (458.9 eV) is associated with a lower oxidation state (Ti3+). The peak at higher 2p3/2 binding energy (459.8 eV) is associated with the Ti4+ state [20]. The ratio of Ti+4 and Ti+3 was determined by fitting and estimating the area of each doublet and it corresponds to different amounts of Ti4+ and Ti3+ states. The amounts of tetravalent and trivalent states are 66.4 and 33.6 at.%, respectively. The different amount of Ti+4 and Ti+3 was found in Li-conducting solid electrolytes LiM0.05Mn1.95O4 (M = Ni, Fe, and Ti) [19] or Li2O–Al2O3–(TiO2 or GeO2)–P2O5 glass–ceramics [20].

The deconvolution of the P 2p3/2 XP spectra of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 into two peaks is shown in Fig. 3b. The peak at binding energy 133.1 eV can be associated with group PO3  4 and the peak at binding energy   133.9 eV to group PO 3 . The results of P 2p XP spectra fitting show that amounts of P5+ and P3+ states in the investigated ceramics are 51.8 and 48.2 at.%, respectively. Figure 3c shows the fitting pattern of O 1s XP spectrum of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic surface. It can be seen that the O 1s spectrum has been deconvoluted into for peaks. The O 1s peak at binding energy 531.1 eV (53.6 at. %) was attributed to the lattice oxygen at the normal sites of the NASICON structure, while the O 1s peaks at 530.4 (5.8 at. %), 532.1 (28.5 at.%), and 533.1 (12.1 at.%) are assigned to   the chemisorbed oxygen in the forms O2− 2 , and in hydroxyl environment (OH) as in La0.6Sr0.4Co1−yFexO3 ceramics [21].

Figure 3d shows Y 3d XP spectrum of Li1.3Al0.15 Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic surface. The spectrum shows spinorbit doublet of Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2 as in [22]. The binding energies of Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2 were found to be 158.5 and 160.1 eV, respectively. The binding energy splitting between 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 is 1.6 eV. According to [22] in the Y2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses this splitting is 1.73 eV. Each of the spin-orbit lines has been deconvoluted into two peaks. The peak 3d5/2 at binding energy 158.4 eV (splitting energy 1.8 eV) can be attributed to the Y3+ state (amount 66.4 at.%) and the peak 3d3/2 at binding energy 159.7 eV (splitting energy 1.8 eV) was associated with the Y2+ state (amount 33.6 at.%).

The Al 2p core level XPS from Li 1 . 3Al 0 . 1 5 Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic surface is presented in Fig. 3e. The Al 2p spectrum curve is centered at 74.2 eV, and this energy corresponds to Al+3 as in [23]. The Li 1 s core level XP spectra are shown in Fig. 3f. The Li 1s XPS signal is very low intensity but it is clear peak centered at 55.8 eV. It is reported that the Li 1s core level XPS peak is at binding energy around 55.8 eV [24].

These fitting results indicate the presence of mixed valence state that could be caused by oxygen deficiency. Elemental composition of Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramics’ surface has been estimated from XPS spectra and is shown in Table 1, the result shows deficiency of oxygen. The quantitative analysis was done by use of atomic sensitivity factors and peaks’ areas of experimental results. The error value of such analysis is 10–20% if sample is homogeneous. Microscopic character of the ceramics influences the quantitative results and error will be larger, so quantitative results in the Table 1 show average composition of ceramics’ surface.

The presence of a mixed valence states of Ti and Y atoms plays a large role in controlling the structure and electronic states in oxygen deficient ceramics. So it has been shown that the oxygen vacancies could be formed in LiTi2(PO4)3 under oxygen-poor conditions, and this may significantly decrease the donor levels of other possible donor defects and thus improve the electronic mobility [25]. Three relaxation dispersions have been found in complex conductivity and impedance spectra of the studied ceramics. The one in the high frequency region was attributed to Li+ ion relaxation in the bulk of the ceramics;in the intermediate frequency range, a dispersion was caused by ion blocking effect at grain boundaries, and in the low frequencies—by blocking Pt electrodes. Frequency dependences of the real part of complex conductivity measured at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 4. Bulk (σb) and total (stot ¼ 1 , where ρb is bulk specific þr resistance and ρgb is grain boundary specific resistance of the ceramics) conductivities were derived from impedance complex plain plots. The low frequency arc in ρ”(ρ’) plot at low temperature corresponds to grain boundary impedance as can be seen in Fig. 5. In the insert of Fig. 5, high-frequency arc can be seen, corresponding to bulk impedance of the ceramics. The dispersion regions shift to higher frequencies while temperature is increased and unfortunately σb could not be found in the temperature range from −26.45 °C to room temperature. The high frequency arc is observed in the frequency range 0.1–3 GHz at 27 °C again (Fig. 6). Temperature dependences of σb and σtot are shown in Fig. 7. σtot change according to Arrhenius law in the studied temperature range: stot ¼ s0 ð2Þ where T is temperature, σ0—pre-exponential factor, ΔEtot— activation energy of total conductivity, and k—Boltzmann’s constant. The activation energy of total conductivity ΔEtot = 0.45 eV. On the other hand, σb shows nonArrhenius temperature dependence. At low temperatures (from −56.5 °C up to room temperature), the activation energy of bulk conductivity ΔEb=0.38 eV was found; and at higher temperatures (from room temperature to 117 °C), the activation energy ΔEb=0.26 eV was found. Similar behavior of bulk ionic conductivity has been reported for Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 compound [8, 26]. The change in activation energy of bulk ionic conductivity is related to cancellation of correlation effects, produced by the creation of M1 sites in the NASICON structure [8, 26].

Figure 8 shows temperature dependence of EMF of the cell (1) in the temperature range 300–550 °C. The linear decrease of the EMF values measured for the cell (1) with Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 as the solid electrolyte and for the same cell involving Li–β-Al2O3 [16] is observed. The comparison of the EMF values reveals similar performance of both cells what suggested pure lithium ionic conduction of the Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 prepared sample.

The results of the electrochemical measurement has shown that Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound is pure ionic conductor. Ti 2p, P 2p, O 1s, Y 3d, Al 2p, and Li 1 s core level XP spectra were fitted. The results of the investigation of XPS suggested that Ti ions are at Ti3+ and Ti4+ oxidation states. It was ascertained that there are four different kinds of oxygen on the ceramic surface, including lattice oxygen,   chemisorbed oxygen in the forms O2–, O 2 , and oxygen in hydroxyl environment (OH). The XPS has shown spin-orbit doublet of Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2. The binding energy splitting between 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 is 1.6 eV. Impedance spectroscopy −2−109 Hz revealed that study in the frequency range 10 there is no change of activation energies of total conductivity in the temperature range −57 °C to 334 °C, but bulk conductivity shows non-Arrhenius behavior. The change in activation energy of bulk conductivity from 0.38 to 0.26 eV has been estimated at around room temperature. The change of activation energy of the bulk ionic conductivity is related to cancellation of correlation effects, produced by the creation of M1 sites in the NASICON structure. The results presented in the paper reveal also that the Li1.3Al0.15Y0.15Ti1.7(PO4)3 investigated material could be a promising solid electrolyte for application in solid galvanic cells to determine lithium activity in solids or molten melts.
