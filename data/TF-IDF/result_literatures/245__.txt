The abundant flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 have been prepared via a simple spray drying method. As a cathode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), the galvanostatic charge-discharge test  results  indicate  that  the  initial  reversible  discharge  specific  capacity  of  flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode can  reach  to 100.8 mAh  g-1 (about  93% the theoretical  capacity of 105 mAh g-1) under a current density of 10 mA g-1 (0.1C), and the high rate capability at 500 mA g-1 (5 C) is up to 60 mAh g−1 after 1100 cycles. The in-situ X-ray diffraction pattern and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy test results indicate that the charge/discharge processes of this cathode material  go through the  reversible electrochemical  reaction of Na3Fe2(PO4)3/Na5Fe2(PO4)3. The outstanding electrochemical performance of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is attributed to its’ [Fe2(PO4)3] “lantern units”  stacked  NASICON-type  structure  and  2D  sheet-porous  morphology.  The  flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode with commercial hard carbon anode full cell shows an energy density of 76 Wh  Kg-1  and  the  maximum  power  density  can  be  up  to  760  W  Kg-1.  The  full  cell  also  shows excellent low temperature performance even at -20 °C (40 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1). The outstanding electrochemical and low temperature performance prove that this full cell is an ideal device for large-scale energy storage (EES). 

The  extensive  usage  of  fossil  fuels  has  resulted  in  more  and  more  serious  environmental pollution [1-3]. In order to increase the usage ratio of cleaner energy, such as solar, wind and tidal energy,  in  the  total  energy  consumption,  various  high-performance  sodium-ion  batteries  (SIBs) and corresponding electrode materials have been developed over decades [4-8]. In recent years, many endeavors have made efforts to search for an ideal SIBs cathode material with low cost, high structural stability and energy conversion efficiency [9-16]. The polyanionic compound (LiFePO4) as  cathode  material  for  lithium  ion  batteries  (LIBs)  exhibited  outstanding  electrochemical performance  and  high  structural  stability  during  it  was  first  reported  [17].  The  iron-based phosphate with Na+ guest structure is an ideal SIBs cathode for reasons that the abundant Na and Fe element in the earth and the high stability of polyanionic “host” structure [18-20]. In the recent years, so much attempts were made to develop other high performance polyanionic compounds as cathode material candidates in SIBs. The common NASICON structure polyanionic compounds cathode materials, such as Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [21], NaFe2PO4(SO4)2 [22, 23], Na3V2(PO4)3 [24-27], Na3V2(PO4)2F3  [28-30],  Na4Fe7(PO4)6  [31]  and  Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7  [32],  have  shown  excellent electrochemical performance, high ionic conductivity and thermal stability in SIBs. Masquelier et al reported a new NASICON-type Na3Fe2(PO4)3 with a larger ion-channel radius of 6.487 Å and presented its crystal structure model which was very suitable for Na+ insertion-deinsertion [33-36]. 

The  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  as  cathode  material  in  SIBs  shows  low  production  cost  and  high  structure stability which is very suitable for industrialization. Also, the commercial hard carbon (CHC) as a low-cost  anode  with  particular  amorphous  structure  and  high  electronic  conductivity  has  been widely used in LIBs, SIBs and supercapacitors [37-41].   


In this work, we use a simple spay drying method to prepare a flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NFP) as cathode material in SIBs.  As cathode material, the flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, and the electrochemical process of flake-porous cathode  goes through the reversible electrochemical reaction  of Na3Fe2(PO4)3/Na5Fe2(PO4)3.  The flake-porous  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  cathode  with  pre-sodiated commercial hard carbon (P-CHC) anode is assembled into a full SIBs. The simple electrochemical pre-sodiation  process  of  CHC  (Nax+yC)  was  divided  into  two  parts.  The  initial  pre-sodiation treatment is to solve the irreversible capacity during the intercalation of Na+ into the hard carbon anode (equation 1), followed by the formation of reversible capacity (equation 2) which can be extracted from hard carbon to Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode. 

After the pre-sodiation processes, a full SIB is assembled by using flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode and pre-sodiated hard carbon anode (Nax+yC). 

The  flake-porous  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  was  synthesized  by  spray  drying  process.  Firstly, stoichiometric Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (8.08 g, Sinopharm), CH3COONa (2.46 g, Sinopharm) and oxalic acid (3.8 g, Sinopharm) were put into a beaker with deionized water (300 ml), and stirred for 30 minutes  by  a  magnetic  stirrer.  Then,  NH4H2PO4  (3.451  g,  dissolved  in  50  ml  deionized  water) solution  was  slowly  dropped  to  maintain  the  solution  with  pH=  1.9.  Once  the  solution  was homogeneous  and  clear,  it  was  dried  by  spry-drying  device  (QFN-8000T,  China)  at  the  inlet temperature of 220 °C and the outlet temperature of 80 °C. The obtained yellow precursors were preheated at 300 °C for 3 h and followed by annealing at 600 °C for 10 h in Air with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. Finally, the wheat flake-like porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 were synthesized. All the reagents used are analytically pure (AR) without any further treatment. The detail illustration of spray drying process is shown in Figure 1. 

The crystallographic information of flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and commercial hard carbon were tested by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8, Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation X-ray diffractometer (λ = 0.1546 nm), and the scanning speed 2θ ranged from 10° to 60° was 0.1° min-1. Thermogravimetric measurement (TG, DTA Instruments, American) was tested using SDT Q600 from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 2 °C min-1 under an air atmosphere. 

The infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, PerkinElmer, America) was used to characterize the structure of Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The morphology of as-prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)3 powders were characterized by the field  emission  scanning  electron  microscopy  of  JSM-7800F  (SEM,  JSM-7800F,  Japan).  The microstructure  of  as-prepared  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  and  commercial  hard  carbon  were  measured  using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy of JEM-2100F (HR-TEM, JEM-2100F, Japan) equipped  with  an  energy  dispersive  X-ray  spectrometer  (EDX).  The  X-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Perkin Elmer, America) analyses were carried using an RBD upgraded PHI-5300 ESCA system with Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV) to determine the oxidation state of as-prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and the complete discharge state of electrochemical Na insertion process. 

After the half-cell was discharged to 1.5 V at 10 mA g-1, it was disassembled in the glove box under argon (Ar) atmosphere. The in-situ XRD tests were measured by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8Advance, Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation X-ray diffractometer and the cells were assembled using a beryllium window as a current cathode collector. The charge/discharge voltage window is 1.5-3.5 V under a current density of 10 mA g-1. 

All the electrochemical tests were evaluated using a standard type coin cell (CR2016). The composite  cathode  was  prepared  using  Na3Fe2(PO4)3,  carbon  black  (Alfa  Aesar)  and polytetraﬂuoroethylene  (PTFE,  Sigma-Aldrich)  with  a  weight  ratio  of  7:2:1.  


The  average composite mass loading was 10 mg and the stainless-steel electrode  was 1 cm2. The composite anode is composed of commercial hard carbon (CHC, BCH-240), carbon black (Alfa Aesar) and polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PVDF, Sigma-Aldrich) with a mass ratio of 8:1:1, which was prepared by high energy ball milling with N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent for 2 h. After, the mixed anode material was coated on copper foil with a mass loading of 3 mg/cm2. The cathode and anode electrode were dried in a vacuum oven drying at 120 °C and 80 °C for 12 h, respectively. After rolling the electrodes at a pressure of 0.2 MPa (The SEM images of cathode and anode electrode are shown in Figure S 1), the half cell was assembled using pure sodium foil (AR, Sinopharm) as the counter electrode and glass fiber (Whatman, GF/D) as the separator in an argon filled glove box. The electrolyte was prepared using ethylene carbonate (EC, AR, Sinopharm) and dimethyl carbonate  (DMC,  AR,  Sinopharm)  (EC/DMC,  1:1  by  volume  ratio)  which  dissolved  in  1  M NaClO4  (AR,  Sinopharm).  

The  charge-discharge  tests  were  measured  using  a  Land  CT2001A battery test system (Wuhan Land, China) in the voltage range of 1.5-3.5 V. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiment was tested on the electrochemical work-station (Gamry 5000E, America) with different  scanning  rates  of  0.05,  0.08,  0.1,  0.2,  0.3  and  0.5  mV  s-1,  respectively.  The  low temperature test box (HS-225, China) equipped with Land CT2001A battery test system (Wuhan Land,  China)  was  used  to  test  the  low  temperature  performance  of  NFP-Nax+yC  full  cell.  All electrochemical tests were measured at room temperature (25 ºC) or at a certain temperature. 

The Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NFP) cathode and commercial hard carbon (CHC) anode were studied, respectively. Herein, the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was prepared using a simple spray drying method. The X-ray  diffraction  profile  of  as-prepared  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  is  shown  in  Figure  2  a.  The  refinement process  is  carried  out  via  the  GSAS  software  [42,  43].  During  the  refined  process,  the following instrumental and structural parameters are refined. The original parameters are derived from previous reports [33-37]. The detailed crystallographic information of atomic fractional coordinates, atomic isotropic displacement parameters and site occupancies after refining  are  summarized  in  Table  S  1.  The  refined  results  indicate  the  crystal  structure  of synthesized NFP can be indexed using a monoclinic unit-cell, and the lattice parameters were a= 15.011 Å, b= 8.685 Å, c= 8.687 Å, and β= 126.5° and V=  959.87 Å. The reasonably small value of Rwp (1.608 %) and Rp (1.315 %) demonstrate our refinements are reasonable and the fitting results indicate our obtained NFP is pure phase without any crystalline impurity. The SEM and TEM images are shown in Figure S 2 (a-d) indicate that the morphology of NFP is a typical flake-porous structure with large numbers of porous in micro-flake. The EDX mapping images of NFP are shown in the Figure S 2 (f) which indicate that the element of Na, Fe, P, O distribute uniformly in theNFP matrix. The thermogravimetric (TG-DTA) measurement curve of precursor indicates that the optimized calcination temperature is 550 °C.  

The  electrochemical  mechanism  and  changes  of  crystal  structure  during  charge-discharge processes are shown in Figure 4 and 5, respectively. The XPS study was tested to investigate the valence state changes of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode during the discharge process and the result are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 a shows the whole spectrum of the prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode before and  Figure  4  b shows  the narrow spectra of Fe (2p), the fitting results indicate that the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode before the charge/discharge shows binding energies locate at 727.8 eV and   714.01 eV which corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 orbit, respectively. The results indicate the presence of iron in Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode are all in Fe3+ state before charge/discharge [20]. Figure 4 c is the whole spectrum of the prepared Na3Fe2(PO4)3 electrode after discharge to 1.5V and Figure 4 d shows the Fe (2p) spectra. The fitting results indicate the binding energies locate at 727.1 eV and   723.8.01 eV are corresponding to Fe 2p1/2 orbit and the binding energies locate at 714.2 eV and 710.5 eV are corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 orbit. Compared with Figure 4 b, we can clearly see that the Fe3+ ions’ binding energy shift to small value which corresponding to Fe2+ ions’ binding energy [20, 23, 24]. The date clearly indicates that more than 88% of iron are transformed into  Fe2+ state during the electrode discharges to  1.5 V and  about  12% of Fe3+ in  the  electrode material  are  not  involved  during  the  electrochemical  reaction  process  which  is  higher  than  the result  (9%)  calculated  based  on  the  initial  discharge  specific  capacity  due  to  the  Fe2+  may  be oxidized during the test process.


Na3Fe2(PO4)3 to Na4Fe2(PO4)3 during first Na+ insert. This phase transformation process consistent with the flat discharge voltage plateaus in discharge curve. In the last discharge stage (2.5-1.5 V), the crystal structure does not change which is corresponding to the part of tilt discharge curve. By combining  the  charge  diffraction  curves  (1.5-2.5  V),  we  can  clearly  see  that  the  tilt  curves  are asymmetric which indicate that the process is a sodium-ion insertion reaction and not a pseudo-capacitance  reaction  process.  Also,  the  result  of  in-situ  XRD  pattern  indicates  that  the Na5Fe2(PO4)3 has the same crystal structure with Na4Fe2(PO4)3. So, the calculation of theoretical capacity by two electron transfer model is  accurate. During the  charge process,  the sodium  ion deserting  process  shows  outstanding  reversibility  which  prove  that  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  has  higher structure stability as cathode materials for SIBs. 

The  commercial  hard  carbon  (CHC)  was  directly  used  without  any  further  treatment.  The XRD analysis (Figure 6 a) indicates that the crystal structure of CHC is amorphous with numerous defects. The particle size of CHC is about 5 μm (Figure S 2 (g, h)) and the HR-TEM image shows a  disordered  lattice  with  much  of  distorted  nanodomains  and  nanovoids.


In order to provide enough sodium-source, the electrochemical pre-sodiation process through form (Nax+yC) is necessary to make up for the part of irreversible specific capacity and provide adequate Na+ for whole electrochemical reaction. The rate capability performance of CHC anode were  provided  in  Figure  6  c  which  indicate  that  the  reversible  capabilities  are  337.8  mAh  g-1, 288.8 mAh g-1, 229.3 mAh g-1, 170.8 mAh g-1, 141.7 mAh g-1 and 92.5 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, 100 mA g-1 , 200 mA g-1, 500 mA g-1, 1000 mA g-1 and 2000 mA g-1. The cycle stability performance of CHC anode at 100 mA g-1 are shown in Figure 6 d which indicates that the reversible specific capacity can be up to 288.8 mAh g-1 and maintains 254.3 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles. 

In conclusion, the flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is synthesized as cathode material in SIBs. The electrochemical performance is significantly enhanced, which is attributed to the 2D porous-sheets structure with a larger specific surface area, and thus accelerate the reaction speed of sodiation-desodiation in the interface of electrolyte/active material. The initial reversible specific capacity is up  to  100.8  mAh  g-1  at  10  mA  g-1  (i.e.  about  93%  of  theoretical  capacity).  In  particular, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 displays an reversible discharge specific capacity of 60 mAh g−1 after 1100 cycles at  a  current  density  of  500  mA  g-1.  The  electrochemical  reaction  mechanism  indicates  that  the cathode  material goes through the reversible electrochemical reactions Na3Fe2(PO4)3/Na5Fe2(PO4)3.  During  this  two  Na+  transportation  process,  the  first  Na+ inserting reaction is a phase transformation process (from Na3Fe2(PO4)3 to Na4Fe2(PO4)3) and the second Na+ inserting reaction is a solid-solution reaction (from Na4Fe2(PO4)3 to Na5Fe2(PO4)3). The flake-porous Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode (NFP) with commercial hard carbon anode (CHC) SIBs shows an energy  density  of  76  Wh/Kg  and  the  maximum  power  density  can  be  up  to  760  W  Kg-1.  The excellent cycle stability and low temperature performance prove that the NFPfull cell is an ideal energy storage device for EES.
