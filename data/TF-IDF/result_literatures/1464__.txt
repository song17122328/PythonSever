Lithium mobility in LiM2(PO4)3 compounds, M = Ge and Sn, has been investigated by 7Li Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and deduced information compared with that reported previously in Ti, Zr and Hf members of the series in the temperature range 100–500 K. From the analysis of 7Li NMR quadrupole interactions (CQ and h parameters), spin–spin T 2 T 1 250 K, Li ions are preferentially located at M1 sites in rhombohedral phases, but occupy intermediate M12 sites between M1 and M2 sites in triclinic ones. In high-temperature rhombohedral phases, a superionic state is achieved when residence times at M1 and M12 sites become similar and correlation effects on Li motion decrease. This state can be obtained by large order–disorder transformations in rhombohedral phases or by sharp ﬁrst order transitions in triclinic ones. The presence of two relaxation mechanisms in T 1 -1 plots of rhombohedral phases has been associated with departures of conductivity from the Arrhenius behavior. Long term mobility of lithium is discussed in terms of the cation vacancy distribution along conduction paths.

The preparation of high performance new materials is crucial for developing new generation Li-ion batteries, required for largescale applications in electric and hybrid electric vehicles.1–3 Lithium metal phosphates, with higher energy and power densities, are among active materials those that can answer safety concerns surrounding oxide chemistry.4 Among phosphates, good electrochemical performances have been reported for NASICON-type materials, proposed as electrode and/or electrolyte for secondary lithium batteries.

The framework of NASICON-type materials is built up by M2(PO4)3 units, in which two MO6 octahedra are linked to three PO4 tetrahedra by sharing oxygens.9,10 Tetrahedra and octahedra of contiguous M2(PO4)3 units are bound to form the threedimensional network of Nasicon phases (Fig. 1a). The usual symmetry of LiM2(PO4)3 compounds is rhombohedral R3¯ c, although in some cases a triclinic distortion (space group C1¯ ) has been found.11–15 Triclinic phases are transformed into rhombohedral phases by increasing temperature.13–15 In rhombohedral Ge and Ti samples, Li+ ions are surrounded by six oxygens at M1 sites;11,12 but in triclinic Sn, Zr and Hf phases, Li+ ions are coordinated to four oxygens at M12 sites located between M1 and M2 positions.13–15 Both sites alternate along the conduction network of these compounds. Three conduction pathways intersect at M1 sites,meaning that vacancies at these strategic sites enhance long range Li conductivity (Fig. 1b).

Impedance Spectroscopy (IS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxations have often been used to analyze Li dynamics in fast ion conductors.16–19 The analysis of the temperature dependence of NMR T 1 -1 relaxation rates is often used to investigate Li motion mechanisms.18,19 In previous work, the study of stoichiometric samples improved the analysis of relaxation mechanisms.20,21 Differences detected in slopes of low and high temperature branches of T 1 -1 maxima are often ascribed to the presence of correlated Li motions. Activation energies of local and macroscopic motions, Em and EM, are related by the expression Em = b . EM, where b indicates the presence of correlation effects (0 <b <1).17 In the absence of correlations, the b parameter takes the value 1 (Em = EM) and T 1 -1 maxima become symmetric. On the other hand, it has been shown that ion conductivity often displays important deviations from Arrhenius behavior. Ngai and Rizos proposed the elimination of correlation effects at increasing temperatures as the main reason for this departure.22 In this sense, Robertson and West suggested that the inﬂuence of structural factors on ion mobility diminishes as the temperature increases; the Li conductivity of the best ion conductors approaching a common value near 10-1 S.cm-1.

Li NMR spectroscopy was used previously to analyze the inﬂuence of structural factors on Li mobility of LiM2(PO4)3 compounds, with M = Ti, Zr and Hf.21,24,25 In the present work, Li mobility in Ge and Sn phases has been investigated by 7Li NMR spectroscopy between 100 and 500 K, comparing obtained

results with those previously reported. Information deduced in LiM2(PO4)3 compounds will be also compared with that reported in the fast ion conductor Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3,26,27 affording an uniﬁed microscopic description for Li motions. In particular, the mobility of lithium at long distances will be discussed in terms of the cation vacancy distribution along conduction paths.

Samples were prepared by heating stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3, (NH4)2H(PO4)3, and GeO2 or SnO2, in the temperature range 573–1373 K, following the procedure described elsewhere.28,29 X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of powder samples were recorded with the Cu-Ka radiation (l = 1.5405981 A˚ ) in a PW 1050/25 Phillips diffractometer. The Fullprof program was used to determine unit cell parameters of phases using the pattern matching technique.30

7Li NMR spectra of samples heated between 100 K and 500 K were recorded in static conditions with a SXP 4/100 Bruker spectrometer operating at 31 MHz. 7Li chemical shift values were referenced to a 1 M LiCl aqueous solution. A p/2 pulse of 3 ms and a period between accumulations of 5 s were used in single pulse experiments. 7Li NMR spectra were ﬁtted with the Bruker WINFIT31 software, which takes into account ﬁrst order quadrupolar interactions. This program allows the position, linewidth and intensity of components to be determined; however, quadrupole CQ and asymmetry h parameters have to be deduced with a trial and error procedure

-1 values were calculated as 0.6p times the full width at half height (FWHH) of central NMR Gaussian lines and as p times that of Lorentzian ones.32,33 When the intrinsic linewidth was smaller than ﬁeld inhomogeneities, T 2 -1 values were determined by using the Meiboom–Gill Carr–Purcell (CPMG) sequence (p/2)x¢ t [(p)y¢ t (p)y¢]n.34,35 The determination of T 1 values was done using the classical p t p/2 pulse sequence.

XRD patterns of LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiSn2(PO4)3 samples recorded at 300 K conﬁrmed the single phase character of two prepared samples (Fig. 2). Unit cell parameters were deduced by using the Fullprof program (pattern matching technique).30 In this analysis, unit cell parameters of the rhombohedral Ge phase (S.G. R3¯ c) were a = 8.272(3) and c = 20.70(3) A˚ , and those of the triclinic Sn phase (S.G. C1¯ ) were a = 8.404(1), b = 8.442(2), c = 8.890(1) A˚ , a = ◦ . The XRD pattern of 118.12(1) the rhombohedral Sn phase, recorded at 400 K, showed a = 8.633 (1) and c = 21.53(2) A˚ for unit cell parameters.

In previous papers, 31P MAS-NMR spectroscopy was used to differentiate structural sites occupied by phosphorous atoms36–38 In samples analyzed in this work, three signals at -21.3, -22.3 and -24.8 ppm were resolved in 31P NMR spectra of the triclinic Sn phase and only one signal at -43.6 ppm (not shown) in the rhombohedral Ge phase.38 In the case of the Sn sample the triclinic–rhombohedral transition was observed between 310–400 K. In the rhombohedral Sn phase, the 31P MAS-NMR spectra displayed a single component at -23.9 ppm.

In this work, structural sites and mobility of lithium have been investigated. In order to determine structural sites occupied by lithium, 7Li NMR spectra were recorded at temperatures lower than 250 K. To analyze Li dynamics, spectra were taken in the range 250–500 K. In all cases, 7Li NMR spectra were recorded in static conditions.

Li NMR spectra of powder LiM2(PO4)3 samples, with M = Ge, Ti, Sn, and Hf, recorded at 240 K, are given in Fig. 3. In all cases, spectra are formed by the central (-1/2→1/2) and two complex lateral (-3/2→-1/2 and 1/2→3/2) transitions. The separation between lateral transitions depends on quadrupolar interactions of nuclei with electric ﬁeld gradients at structural sites.32 In all analyzed samples, spectra recorded at low temperature were reproduced with a single component. From spectral ﬁtting, quadrupolar coupling (CQ) and asymmetry (h) parameters were determined. In rhombohedral Ge and Ti samples, quadrupole parameters are similar (CQ ~25 kHz and h = 0), indicating that sites occupied by Li ions display axial symmetry. In triclinic Sn and Hf (Zr) phases, CQ values are considerably higher (185 and 125 kHz) and h values are 0.3 or 0.7, indicating a lower symmetry for Li sites. In agreement with structural analyses carried out in Ge and Sn phases, Li ions occupy regular M1 octahedral sites (Li–O = 2.21 A˚ ) in rhombohedral Ge11 and distorted fourfold coordinated M12 sites (Li–O = 1.9–2.1 A˚ ) in triclinic Sn phases.13 In the last case, Li ions are located out of trigonal axes. At 400 K, rhombohedral Ge and Ti phases display CQ values near 50 kHz. Above the triclinic– rhombohedral transition, Li sites of rhombohedral Sn, and Hf (Zr) phases display axial symmetry with CQ values near 70 and 115 kHz (Fig. 3).

In absence of Li motion (T < 250 K), dipolar interactions between nuclear magnetic moments of atoms broaden NMR lines. This effect has been used to investigate the chemical nature of Li environments. Experimental second moment values deduced from the central transitions, (Dv 2), were calculated (see ref. 38) with the Van Vleck expression:Dv g gg = ++ + I ∑ ∑ jk I S k jk k hI I r hSS where the ﬁrst term accounts for interactions between like spins I and the second one for unlike I and S spins. g I and g S are gyromagnetic ratios of atoms and rjk distances between interacting nuclei. In general, Dv 2 values are higher in triclinic than in rhombohedral phases. Taking into account atom positions deduced for lithium in structural analyses, the contribution of Li–M interactions is negligible; however, Li–P and Li–Li interactions affect appreciably the linewidth of the central transition. In a previous study, calculated Dv 2 values for Li ions occupying M1 and M12 sites were compared with experimental Dv 2 values, see Table III of ref. 38. It was observed that, for both sites, Li–P (0.09 and 0.32 G2) are higher than Li–Li interactions (0.04 G2). The good agreement obtained between experimental and calculated Dv 2 values (0.13 G2), indicates that Li ions are preferentially located at M1 sites in rhombohedral LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 compounds11,12 In triclinic Sn, Zr and Hf samples, experimental Dv 2 values (0.37 G2) increase considerably, indicating that dipolar Li–P interactions are considerably higher at M12 sites.38 Information deduced by NMR coincides again with that deduced from neutron diffraction experiments, where lithium occupies a distorted fourfold coordination at M12 sites, near P tetrahedra, in triclinic phases.13–15

The variation of CQ with the temperature is analyzed in Fig. 4. CQ values of Ge and Sn samples, prepared in this work, are indicated by closed symbols, however, those reported in other phases are denoted with open symbols.21,25,27,28 Below 250 K, CQ is almost constant, indicating that the interaction of lithium ions with the structural framework remains constant. With increasing temperature, CQ values of triclinic Zr and Hf samples decrease abruptly from 180 to 115 kHz, but in the case of the Sn sample, CQ value decreases from 120 to 55 kHz at 400 K, when the rhombohedral phase is detected (this work). The behaviour of the rhombohedral Sn phase is different from those of Zr and Hf samples. As temperature increases, CQ values decrease slightly in Zr and Hf, but increase in a progressive way in Ge, Ti and Sn phases towards a common value, 100 kHz. In the case of rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 samples, variations from 25 to 62 kHz and 35 to 65 kHz were reported in the 100–500 K interval.

In the temperature range 230–330 K, Li hopping is responsible for increments detected in T 1 -1 plots. If Li ions occupy M1 and M12 sites simultaneously, two different T 1 -1 values should be detected; however, local Li motion averages the spectral features of two sites, giving one signal with intermediate characteristics.

-1 (spin–spin) relaxation rates, deduced from the central transition, are plotted vs. reciprocal temperature in Fig. 5a and 5b. T 2 -1 values of Ge and Sn samples, prepared in this work, are indicated by closed symbols, however, those reported in other phases are denoted with open symbols.21,24,25,27 In the absence of Li motion, T < 250 K, the line shape of the central transition is Gaussian; however, at increasing temperatures, this line narrows and becomes Lorentzian as a consequence of the Li motion. In the rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 sample, T 2 -1 decreased above 250 K, reached a small maximum at 330 K, and decreased again above this temperature (Fig. 5a).21 In the Al doped sample Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 all observations were shifted towards lower temperatures,27 but in the Ge sample these observations are shifted towards higher temperatures. In triclinic samples, T 2 -1 values decrease when rhombohedral phases are formed; abruptly in Zr and Hf,24,25,28 but in a progressive way in the Sn sample (this work). In triclinic samples, T 2 -1 plots display a cycle of hysteresis in heating–cooling cycles that becomes more visible in the Sn sample (Fig. 5b).

In all analyzed samples, spin–lattice T 1 -1 relaxations display a single exponential relaxation at each temperature; however, in LiGe2(PO4)3, two relaxations were detected in the magnetization recovery (not shown) that have been ascribed to differences in probabilities for Zeeman transitions between energy levels separated by Dm = 1 and Dm = 2. Individual relaxation rates are averaged at increasing temperatures by spin diffusion.40 In Fig. 6a, these two values were averaged when T 1 -1 rates were analyzed as a function of the reciprocal temperature. Ge and Sn samples, analyzed here, are indicated by closed symbols and those reported previously by open symbols.21,24,25,27 In the rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3, T 1 -1 values remained constant below 200 K, but increased above this temperature.21 In the case of the Al-doped sample, T 1 -1 values increased above 130 K,27 but in the Ge sample they increase above 250 K.

In the Ti sample, T 1 -1 values display a broad maximum with two relaxation maxima at 300 and 400 K.21 As a consequence of the shift or the broadening of maxima, the resolution of two mechanisms was not attained in Ge and Al-doped Ti samples. In triclinic Zr and Hf samples, T 1 -1 values increase abruptly when rhombohedral phases are formed, allowing again the observation of two maxima above the transition (Fig. 6b).24,25 In the case of the Sn sample, Li mobility is lower and T 1 -1 values increase much less with temperature, not reaching the maximum detected in other phases (this work). In this sample, the cycle of hysteresis, 310– 400 K, ascribed to the triclinic–rhombohedral transition, is larger than in Zr and Hf phases.

In general, T 2 -1 decreases as a consequence of the cancellation of dipolar interactions (Fig. 5). In order to produce the line narrowing detected in 7Li NMR spectra, the residence time at structural sites must decrease below that deduced with the expression (Dv 2)-1/2 from spectra recorded at low temperature. In analyzed samples, motion is detected when residence times t c become lower than 10-5 s.

In rhombohedral Ge and Ti phases, the line-width decrement -1) is accompanied by the increment of CQ (Fig. 4). This trend, (T 2 which is contrary to that expected for lithium motion, indicates that other sites with higher CQ values than M1 are involved in Li hopping.21 Dipolar Li–P interactions are higher in M12 than in M1 sites, which explains the small maximum detected at ~330 K in the T 2 -1 plot of LiTi2(PO4)3 produced by the progressive occupation of M12 sites. In the case of the Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample, similar observations are detected; however, the line-width of the central line is somewhat broadened by Al and observed features are shifted towards lower temperatures. In the case of the Ge phase, the small maximum was not clearly resolved in the T 2 -1 plot. In triclinic Zr and Hf phases T 2 -1 decreased abruptly when rhombohedral phases are formed.24,25 In the case of LiSn2(PO4)3, a cycle of hysteresis differentiates the variation of T 2 -1 in triclinic and rhombohedral phases (this work). Above the transition, the temperature dependence of T 2 -1 becomes similar to that detected in the rhombohedral Ti phase.

The existence of fast exchange processes between M1 and M12 sites favours the detection of only one signal with averaged parameters. If we assume the existence of lithium exchange between M1 and mid-way M12 sites, CQ values could be estimated with the expression:C CP PP PQ Q 1 and CQ 2 are quadrupolar constants, P1 and P2 are where CQ probabilities for Li to occupy M1 and M12 sites and the factor 3 takes into account the multiplicity of M12 with respect to that of M1 sites.

In the Al doped Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample, displaying a higher conductivity than Ti phase, NMR results were reproduced by assuming CQ constants for M1 and M12 sites near 15 and 120 kHz.27 Below 200 K, most of the M1 sites are occupied by lithium (CQ = 35 kHz); however, at increasing temperatures, the probability to ﬁnd Li ions at M12 sites increases. The analysis of the temperature dependence of CQ values showed that creation of vacancies at M1 sites is an activated process, with Ev ~ 0.07 eV.27 This value corresponds to the difference in low and high temperature activation energies, 0.29 and 0.21 eV. However, only 2/3 of M1 sites were occupied by lithium at 450 K in this phase, indicating that the limit case, P1 = P2 = 0.25, is difﬁcult to attain.

In the case of the triclinic Sn sample, strong changes detected in CQ have been ascribed to the modiﬁcation of Li site occupation along the triclinic–rhombohedral transition (this work). This change is associated with the destabilization of Li ions at M12 sites induced by tetrahedra rotation during the triclinic–rhombohedral transition.13–15 At increasing temperatures, the increment of CQ has been again associated with the progressive delocalization of Li on M1 and M12 sites. In triclinic Zr and Hf phases, local mobility of lithium increases abruptly, achieving CQ values close to 110 kHz in high temperature phases. In these phases, the local exchange between M1 and M12 sites averages h values to zero.

The analysis of the temperature dependence of T 1 -1 values showed the presence of a broad maximum, formed by two relaxation mechanisms (Fig. 6). In all cases, T 1 -1 values measured below 150 K display values near 0.2 s-1 (not reported in the LiZr2(PO4)3 study24). As mobility of Li increases, T 1 -1 increases with temperature attaining a maximum when residence times at structural sites are near t c ª w0 -1ª1.4 ¥ 10-8 s (w0t c = 1). In general, the low temperature regime (correlated motions) is associated with residence times between 10-5 and 10-8 s-1, and the high temperature regime (non correlated motions) covers the range between 10-8 and 10-11 s-1. The position of the maximum shifts with the composition of samples, indicating that residence times near 10-8 s are achieved at lower temperatures in better conductors. In rhombohedral phases, residence times at 300 K are considerably higher in Ge and Sn than in Ti, Zr and Hf samples, as a consequence of the lower mobility.21,24,25 In the case of the Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample, conductivity is higher and residence times at structural sites are still shortened.

In most of the analyzed phases, T 1 -1 (spin–lattice) and T 2(spin–spin) plots display two relaxations in the 200–500 K interval. In the Ge phase, the T 1 -1 maximum was shifted to high temperatures making the analysis of the high temperature regime difﬁcult. In the Sn phase, detection of the T 1 -1 maximum was not achieved, impeding a reliable analysis of NMR relaxations. Taking into account these considerations, a full NMR analysis of Li mobility at the frequency used, 31 MHz, will only be possible in good fast ion conductors displaying rhombohedral symmetry. The temperature dependence of T 1 -1 values was analyzed by considering the presence of two modiﬁed BPP (Bloembergen– Purcell–Pound) relaxation mechanisms described with expressions (3) and (4).41 In LiTi2(PO4)3, both mechanisms were resolved in T 1 -1 plots. In Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3, these two relaxation mechanisms were shifted to lower temperatures making their analysis easier (Fig. 5a and 6a).

In analyzed samples, T 1 -1 (spin–spin) values were ﬁtted to two relaxations in the 200–500 K interval. In this analysis, we have used the expressions:-1 (spin–lattice) and T 2 1 PAR T 1 1 HT 2 2 LT)-1 and (T 1 where (T 1 HT)-1 stand for low (correlated) and high temperature (extended) motions. In the absence of lithium motion Dw increases with dipolar interactions; and T 1 PAR decreases with residual paramagnetic interactions.

The temperature dependence of T 1 -1 and T 2 -1, expressed in rads-1, can be described with the expressions:-1 and T 1

where C and C¢ depend on the magnetic interactions that cause lithium relaxation, b is a constant that takes into account correlation effects on Li motions and t c is the mean residence (correlation) time at structural sites. In the LiTi2(PO4)3 sample, C ª 5 ¥ 109 (rad s-1)2 and C¢ª1.6 ¥ 107 (rad s-1)2 were previously associated with ﬂuctuations of quadrupolar interactions at Li sites and with ﬂuctuations of dipolar interactions (Li–P and Li–Li) produced during Li hopping.

The temperature dependence of t c is given by the expression:tc = tc0 exp(EM/kT) where k is the Boltzmann constant,t c0 is the residence time extrapolated to inﬁnite temperature and EM is the activation energy deduced from dc-conductivity or from high temperature data of NMR T 1.

The existence of two relaxation mechanisms has been related to the departure of conductivity from the Arrhenius behavior. If activation energies, deduced from conductivity data measured at 300 K and 400 K, are analyzed, it is observed that the activation energy, EM, decreases at increasing temperature from 0.29 to 0.21 eV in Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 and from 0.45 to 0.25 in the LiTi2(PO4)3 sample. This information has been used to analyze NMR results (Fig. 7). The decrease observed in EM = Em/b during the heating of the sample, could be associated with either a decrease of Em or an increase of the b factor (see Table 1). Since structural features do not change during heating of rhombohedral phases, it was assumed that the microscopic activation energy Em, deduced from the low temperature T 1 -1 regime, does not change with temperature. From this fact, the increment deduced for b from 0.6 to ~1, explains the decrease observed in EM for two regimes in the Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 sample. The temperature dependence of NMR and conductivity results has been associated with the creation of vacant sites at the intersection of conduction channels (M1 sites), that opens new conduction paths. The creation of vacancies (order–disorder transition) reduces ion motion correlations and activation energy EM (Fig. 8).

In triclinic samples, Li-network interactions change drastically above the triclinic–rhombohedral transition. As a consequence of this transition, occupancy of M1 and M12 sites becomes similar, allowing the detection of the superionic state reported in Zr and Hf rhombohedral phases.24,25 In these samples, changes of EM must be associated with structural changes produced along the triclinic–rhombohedral (ﬁrst order) transition. In this case, detected changes of EM have been ascribed to modiﬁcations in Em rather than in b values (Fig. 8).

Deduced EM, b and t 0 values are depicted in Table 1. Values deduced in LiZr2(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 samples are similar, indicating that two detected mechanisms display similar characteristics in high temperature phases. From the simultaneous ﬁtting of T 2 -1 data, the temperature dependence of residence t times has been estimated. In Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3, two straight lines with different slopes were deduced.27 Extrapolated t 0 values to inﬁnite temperature are t 10 = 7.10-15 s for correlated and t 20 = 2.10-12 s for extended motions. An estimation of diffusion coefﬁcients D was performed with the expression D a = 02 6t where a0 is the distance between equivalent sites related by hopping and t is the correlation time. If it is assumed that a0 ~ 3.5 A˚ and -1 maxima, we deduce D ~ 1.5 ¥ 10-12 m2 t ~ 1.4 ¥ 10-8 s for T 1 s-1 for Li1.2Ti1.8Al0.2(PO4)3 at 250 K, which is one of the highest values reported in crystalline Li conductors.27 Taking into account correlation times deduced in this analysis, diffusion coefﬁcients should cover the interval 10-15 – 10-12 m2 s-1 in the low temperature regime of T 1 -1 plots, and 10-12 – 10-9 m2 s-1 in the high temperature regime. In poor conductors, estimated diffusion coefﬁcients are produced at higher temperatures.

From the 7Li NMR study of the LiM2(PO4)3 series, M = Ge, Ti, Sn, Zr and Hf, an uniﬁed microscopic description for Li motion has been obtained. In particular, three stages for lithium motion have been deduced:

1) Below 250 K, Li+ ions occupy speciﬁc sites in the structure of Nasicon compounds. From analysis of 7Li NMR spectra, lithium ions are preferentially located at M1 sites in rhombohedral and at M12 sites in triclinic phases.

2) Between 250 and 400 K, lithium mobility increases. In triclinic Zr and Hf samples, Li mobility increases and activation energy Em decreases abruptly when rhombohedral phases are formed. In rhombohedral Ge, Ti and Sn phases, Li motions display some correlations that disappear at increasing temperatures.

3) Above 400 K, extended non-correlated motions are achieved in some samples (superionic state). In this regime, activation energies EM decrease as a consequence of the elimination of correlation effects produced when a considerable amount of vacancies are created at M1 sites of rhombohedral phases.

The existence of two relaxation mechanisms is responsible for the non linear departures detected in Arrhenius plots of rhombohedral phases. From T 1 -1 plots, residence times at structural sites and diffusion coefﬁcients along conduction paths were estimated.
