Solid electrolytes with satisfactory ionic conductivity, good ﬂexibility, and ideal interface compatibility are the key to developing next-generation solid-state rechargeable sodium metal batteries. Herein, nano-sized NASICON-type Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) powders were ﬁrstly prepared by sol–gel method. After that, two kinds of high-performance polyethylene oxide/NZSP composite solid electrolytes were fabricated by solution-casting method, which exhibit high ionic conductivities (> 10−4 S cm−1 at 55 °C), wide electrochemical window (> 4.7 V vs. Na+/Na), and good capability to impede sodium dendrites. In order to build better transfer channels for sodium ions in cathode and relieve the volume change of cathode particles during cycling, succinonitrile interphase was introduced by a simple dispersing method. The all-solid-state Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2|Na batteries based on the two kinds of electrolytes both exhibit excellent electrochemical performances with high discharge capacity of 73.2 mA h g−1 (68.2 mA h g−1) and high capacity retention of 98.4% (97.6%) after 100 cycles at 0.5C and 55 °C. These results promise a splendid strategy for designing high performance all-solid-state sodium batteries.

Rechargeable sodium (Na) batteries have recently be extensively studied owing to potentially low cost, natural abundant Na resources compared with lithium (Li) metal, and environmentally friendly for electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storages [1,2].


principles of Na batteries are very similar to those of Li batteries, and the voltage and cycling stability of Na electrode materials are competitive with those of Li electrode materials [3–5]. Advanced lithium batteries have achieved brilliant results, and the high-performance sodium batteries continue to make breakthroughs [6–8]. However, using Na anode in the current liquid electrolyte battery may cause safety concerns as in the case of Li battery. The Na with high chemical reactivity is easy to react with the organic electrolyte solvents (e.g. ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate), which leads to the growth of Na dendrites during long cycling [9,10]. Several strategies have been adopted to eﬀectively suppress Na dendrites, such as electrolyte additives [11], Na anode protection [12] and solid electrolytes [13–15]. Among them, replacement of suitable solid electrolyte to traditional liquid electrolyte is high advisable for all-solid-state Na batteries. Solid electrolyte not only can inhibit the Na dendrites growth, but also meet the safety requirements of high-voltage Na cathode to achieve highenergy-density Na batteries [16].

The Na-ion (Na+) solid electrolytes can be generally classiﬁed into two types: inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) and solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). ISEs, such as Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) and Na10SnP2S12 display potential advantages in room-temperature ionic conductivity (10−4 ~ 10−3 S cm−1), (t ≈ 1), electrochemical window (> 5 V vs. Na+/Na), and thermal stability [17,18]. However, the high fragility and large electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistances limit their applications, especially for the oxide based solid electrolytes [19,20]. Compared to ISEs, SPEs possess with the characteristic of light weight, excellent ﬁlm-forming with good viscoelasticity and easy to package [21,22]. In various polymer electrolytes, poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) based electrolytes are the most attractive because the amorphous area in PEO has a strong ability to dissolve Na salts [23]. Therefore, the composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) composed of Na+-conductive active ceramic powders and PEO polymer electrolytes have been considered as admirable strategies because of the simultaneous eﬀect of active ceramics and polymer matrix, which present enhanced ionic conductivities, satisfactory ﬂexibility, good electrochemical/thermal stability, and excellent interfacial compatibility with Na anode.

Besides the electrolyte/anode interfacial stability, the Na+ eﬃcient migration in the solid-solid cathode/electrolyte interface must be also considered, the introduction of plastic crystal succinonitrile (SN, NCCH2-CH2-CN) electrolyte interphase into the cathode is an eﬀective strategy due to its high room-temperature ionic conductivity (> 10−3 S cm−1) [24,25]. The SN molecules are ordered into a crystalline lattice and exhibit a ﬂuctuational degree of freedom [26]. The high polarity nitrile groups do not attract Na+ too strongly and will promote charge separation of Na salts, which is beneﬁted to enhance Na+ transport [27]. In addition, the SN electrolyte can match with the high-voltage cathode owing to high oxidation potential of nitrile groups [28,29], which can improve the energy density of all-solid-state Na batteries.

In this work, we report two kinds of inexpensive CSEs with PEO as ion conductor polymer, sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) as free Na+ provider, and nano-sized NZSP as active ion conductor ﬁller. Both PEObased and NZSP-based electrolytes exhibit excellent ﬂexibility and high ionic conductivities. The adhesion of PEO polymer matrix can increase eﬀective electrolyte/electrode contact area, improving the solid-solid interfacial stability. Tiny polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) was introduced to the NZSP-based electrolytes to enhance the ﬁlm-formation. The rigid NZSP matrix helps to improve ionic conductivity and thermal stability, and suppress the growth of Na dendrites physically. In addition, considering the fact that the volume change of active cathode particles during cycling would deteriorate electrolyte/electrode contact, SNNaClO4 electrolyte was introduced into the cathode side to improve interface stability between electrode and electrolyte. The as-assembled all-solid-state Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2|Na batteries with two kinds of CSEs both exhibit excellent electrochemical performances.

Na3Zr2Si2PO12 preparation by sol-gel method: Stoichiometric amounts of NaNO3, Ti(OC4H9)4, ZrO(NO3)2 and NH4H2PO4 were used as starting materials. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Ti (OC4H9)4 in a mixture of ethanol and water followed by adding a stoichiometric combination of citric acid, NaNO3, ZrO(NO3)2, and NH4H2PO4. The precursor solution was heated at 80 °C to evaporate solvent under magnetic stirring. The obtained sol was dried overnight at 120 °C and a gel was formed. The product was then heated at 500 °C for 3 h and sintered at 950 °C for 12 h. In order to prepare nanoscale NZSP powders, the as-prepared NZSP powder was pulverized for 6 h by a planetary ball-milling at 390 rpm min−1.

Flexible composite solid electrolytes preparation by solution-casting method: Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mw = 600,000) and sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dried under vacuum at 50 °C and 100 °C for 12 h before using, respectively. Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG, Mw = 400) was purchased from SigmaAldrich with no prior puriﬁcation. PEO, NaClO4 and nano-sized NZSP powders were added into anhydrous acetonitrile and stirred intensely overnight until forming a homogeneous slurry (EO:Na = 8:1). Finally, the slurry was poured into a Teﬂon dish, and the solvent was evaporated in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The resultant electrolytes with various NZSP contents were successfully prepared. The composite electrolytes can presents as (100-x)%(PEO8-NaClO4)-x%NZSP, abbreviated as (100-x)(PEO8-NaClO4)-xNZSP, and x represents the weight ratio of NZSP powders in the electrolyte (x = 0, 10, …, 70 and 80). For the NZSP-based electrolyte, the preparation procedure is similar, and small amount of PEG was added to enhance the ﬁlm-formation of electrolyte membrane. The NZSP-based composite electrolyte are labeled as (10PEO-85NZSP-5PEG)-yNaClO4 and the mass ratio of PEO, NZSP, PEG an NaClO4 is 10:85:5:y (y = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50). The thickness of (100-x)(PEO8-NaClO4)-xNZSP and (10PEO-85NZSP-5PEG)yNaClO4 composite solid electrolyte membranes can be controlled by optimizing the amount of slurry and the area of the Teﬂon dish.

X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) of NZSP and Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 was carried out using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in the 2θ range of 10 ~ 70° and 10 ~ 80°, respectively. The microstructure of the materials was observed by ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS SUPRA 55). The average particle size of NZSP was calculated with a Laser particle-size analyzer (Mastor 2000). Diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried out on a TA Instrument (Q5000IR) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 40 to 75 °C under N2 atmosphere.

Alternate current (AC) impedance method was used to measure the ionic conductivity over a frequency range of 1 MHz ~ 0.1 Hz from 25 to 90 °C. Prior to measurements, the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at each test temperature. The electrochemical window of the samples was determined on a Stainless steel (SS)|electrolyte|Na cell using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) under a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1 from 2.5 to 6.0 V at 55 °C. The whole measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1260 + 1287). The symmetric Na|electrolyte|Na cells were tested with AC impedance and galvanostatic cycling to quantify the interface stabilities of CSEs against Na metal electrodes at 55 °C.

The cathode was prepared by mixing the Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNM), Super P carbon, and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) binder with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 in N-methylpyrrolidone to obtain a slurry. After that, the resultant slurry was casted onto aluminium foil and dried at 120 °C for 24 h overnight under vacuum to obtain the NNM cathode. The active materials loading on the cathode ranged from 3 to 4 mg cm−2. The NNM cathode modiﬁed with plastic-crystal interphase (named S-NNM) was prepared by spreading the succinonitrile (SN)-

The ﬂexible composite solid electrolytes were fabricated via traditional solution-casting method, and the suggested Na+ transport model schematic of various composite electrolytes is shown in Fig. 1a-b. With the increase of NZSP powders content, the ion conduction is mainly changed from PEO segment movement (Fig. 1a) to ceramic Na+ conductor (Fig. 1b). There are three pathways of ion conduction in composite solid electrolyte [5,13]: (1) PEO ion conductor; (2) polymerceramic interface; and (3) ion hopping among the NZSP ceramic particles. Given that the ionic conductivity of PEO electrolytes and NZSP electrolytes, the former two ion-conducting pathways are the main transmission path in PEO-based composite electrolyte membrane. In general, there is a peak in the ionic conductivity of PEO-based composite electrolyte with increase of NZSP content. While the latter two ion-conducting pathways are the dominant transport mechanisms in NZSP-based composite electrolyte. The role of PEO in CSEs is converted from polymer ion conductor to binder. NZSP ceramic particles mainly increases EO chain segments motion (reduce the crystallization degree) in the PEO-based composite electrolyte, and aﬀord Na+ and the transport channel of Na+ in the NZSP-based composite electrolyte. Fig. 1c-d displays the model schematic of conventional NNM cathode and the cathode modiﬁed with plastic crystal electrolyte. It is obviously seen that there are several pores in the cathode without SN, and the poor interfacial contact between cathode and solid electrolyte (Fig. 1c), which block Na+ transport in the cathode and the electrolyte/cathode interface. Comparatively, the addition of SN can ﬁll the pores and beneﬁt to form a compact and steady contact interface between NNM composite cathode and solid electrolyte (Fig. 1d).

Nano-sized Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic powders were prepared through a sol-gel approach. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) pattern of the obtained NZSP powders is shown in Fig. S1a. It can be seen that the main phase of the as-prepared powders is consistent with the NASICON structure in the monoclinic C2/c space, demonstrating that there is no impurity in the NZSP ceramic powders. The ceramic particles can be uniformly distributed without any obvious agglomeration (Fig. S1b). The particle size distribution of NZSP powders was from 30 nm to 2.5 μm, and the average particle size is about 200 nm (Fig. S1c). The room-temperature ionic conductivity of NZSP ceramic pellets is up to 3.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Fig. S1d).


The photographs of 90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP was shown in Fig. 2a. The PEO-based electrolyte with 10 wt% NZSP presents good ﬁlm-formation. In comparison, several cracks can be clearly observed in the ceramic-based 20(PEO8-NaClO4)-80NZSP or (10PEO-85NZSP)40NaClO4 electrolytes (Fig. S2). In order to improve the ﬁlm-formation of ceramic-based electrolytes with NZSP content higher than 80 wt%, a small amount of PEG is added to the electrolyte membrane. As shown in Fig. 2b, the NZSP-based composite electrolyte containing PEG is ﬂat without any cracks and can be easily bent. The typical surface morphologies of electrolyte membranes are displayed in Fig. 2c-d and Fig. S3. Nano-sized NZSP particles are uniformly dispersed in the PEO matrix.


The thermal behaviors of (100-x)(PEO8-NaClO4)-xNZSP composite electrolytes were measured by diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As the increase of NZSP content, the endothermic peak (Tm) shifts from 60 °C (x = 0) to 50 °C (x = 80), which indicates the NZSP can eﬀectively impede the crystallization of PEO and increase the polymer segmental mobility. The ionic conductivities of the (100-x)(PEO8NaClO4)-xNZSP electrolytes varied from 25 °C to 90 °C were illustrated in Fig. 3a. Compared with the pure PEO8-NaClO4 electrolyte, the 90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP composite electrolyte shows the highest ionic conductivity of 2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 55 °C. The introduction of nano-sized NZSP particles impede the crystallinity and increase movement of polymer chain segments, which is beneﬁt to improve the ionic conductivity. But as the NZSP content increased furtherly, the ionic conductivities of composite electrolytes gradually decrease (Fig. 3b).

This result is due to the increased polymer-ceramic grain boundaries impendence [31]. The temperature-conductivities curves of the (10PEO-85NZSP-5PEG)-yNaClO4 electrolytes were presented in Fig. 3c. Compared with the NaClO4-free composite electrolyte, the composite electrolytes with NaClO4 show signiﬁcantly improved ionic conductivities. When the value of y is up to 40, the (10PEO-85NZSP-5PEG)40NaClO4 electrolyte presents high ionic conductivity, which reaches 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 1.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 55 °C.

The electrochemical stabilities of PEO8-NaClO4, 90(PEO8-NaClO4)10NZSP, and (10PEO8-85NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4 electrolytes were investigated by LSV curves from 2.5 to 6.0 V. As shown in Fig. 3d, small current is recorded from 4.2 V for the PEO8-NaClO4 membrane, which is attributed to the decomposition of PEO. When the NZSP powders was introduced into PEO8-NaClO4 electrolyte, the electrochemical window of 90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP and (10PEO8-85NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4 electrolytes are stable up to 4.7 V and 4.8 V respectively. The improved electrochemical stabilities are due to the addition of ceramic NZSP powders. Besides electrochemical stability, thermal stability is also crucial for the safety of Na battery. Flammability tests of the (10PEO885NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4 electrolyte is displayed in Fig. 3e, the electrolyte could hardly burn and retain an integral NZSP matrix after being ﬁred 10 s, demonstrating the good thermal stability.

The interface stability of electrolyte against Na metal is investigated by AC impedance method with a Na|electrolyte|Na symmetrical battery (Fig. 4a). The Nyquist plots of Na|PEO8-NaClO4|Na, Na|90(PEO8NaClO4)-10NZSP|Na, and Na|(10PEO8-85NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4|Na symmetrical cells with diﬀerent storage time at 55 °C are presented in Fig. S4. In the Nyquist plot, the ﬁrst interception at high frequency is related to the bulk resistance, which represents the ionic conductivity of electrolyte. The semicircle interception at medium frequency is associated with the interfacial resistance. Fig. 4b depicted the interfacial resistance evolution of the Na|electrolyte|Na symmetrical cells over aging time at 55 °C. The interfacial resistance of the Na|PEO8-NaClO4|Na cell increased from 390 to 530 O after 3 days, implying an unstable interface between PEO8-NaClO4 electrolyte and Na anode. By contrast, no obvious changes are observed in the interfacial resistances of Na|90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP|Na and Na|(10PEO8-85NZSP-5PEG)40NaClO4|Na cells, and the interfacial resistance values were stabilized at 354 O and 383 O after one week, respectively. The improved interfacial compatibles between composite electrolytes with Na anode were due to the introduction of nano-sized NZSP, which minimizes the contact area of Na electrode exposed to PEO and eﬀectively impede the reaction between Na metal and PEO matrix [32]. The electrochemical performances of symmetric Na batteries were also evaluated by repeated charging/discharging for 1 h at a constant current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and 55 °C. Fig. 4c presents the time dependent potential proﬁles of symmetric Na cells with diﬀerent electrolytes. The Na|PEO8NaClO4|Na cell can only operate for 110 h before short circuit occurs. By contrast, the Na|90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP|Na and Na|(10PEO885NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4|Na cells show stable cycling for 300 h without short circuit at the same condition. This is owing to that NZSP particles can act as a physical barrier to suppress Na dendrites growth. In addition, it is needed to point out that Na|90(PEO8-NaClO4)10NZSP|Na cell shows the smaller overpotential than Na|(10PEO885NZSP-5PEG)-40NaClO4|Na cell, which is due to the low interfacial impedance between electrolyte and Na electrode (Fig. 4b).

It is well known that the poor interfacial contact seriously hinder Na+ transport, especially, in the solid electrolyte/cathode interfaces and the interfaces between cathode particles. To address this issue, the small molecule plastic crystal electrolyte interphase was introduced to the NNM cathode, which not only serves as an interface phase conduction ion, but also can alleviate the volume expansion problem during the cycling. The XRD and SEM characterizations of pristine NNM particles are shown in Fig. S5. The phase-pure hexagonal P2Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode is primarily comprised of stacked hexagonal plates. The solid-state SN-NaClO4 electrolyte with a molar ratio of 20:1 was shown in Fig. 5a, which possesses high ionic conductivity of 3.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C (Fig. 5b). The plastic crystal modiﬁed NNM cathode was fabricated by casting the melting SN-NaClO4 electrolyte to the surface of cathode at 65 °C. SEM images of NNM cathode and S-

In summary, we have successfully prepared nano-sized NZSP by a sol-gel method and developed two kinds of ﬂexible polymer/ceramic (PEO-based and NZSP-based) composite solid electrolyte membranes by a solution-casting method. The as-prepared two kinds of solid electro(2 × 10−4 and lytes both exhibit optimal 1.4 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 55 °C and excellent electrochemical stability (4.7 V and 4.8 V vs. Na+/Na). The PEO/NZSP composite solid electrolytes possess good interface stability and can eﬀectively inhibit sodium dendrites growth. The introduction of plastic-crystal electrolyte (SNNaClO4) increases the sodium ion transference channels in cathode and cathode/electrolyte interface. The assembled all-solid-state S-NNM|Na ionic conductivitiesbatteries with 90(PEO8-NaClO4)-10NZSP and (10PEO8-85NZSP-5PEG)40NaClO4 composite electrolytes both deliver good electrochemical performance with high discharge capacity (73.2 mAh g−1 and 68.2 mAh g−1) and high capacity retention (98.4% and 97.6% after 100 cycles, respectively) at 0.5 C and 55 °C, showing great application prospects.
