In this work, we revisited the stability of the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in a NASICON-type compound, Na2TiCr(PO4)3. Experimental results showed that the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 compound exhibited a specific capacity of 49.9 mA h g−1 at 20 mA g−1, about 80% of its theoretical capacity of 62.2 mA h g−1 with one Na+ insertion/deinsertion per formula Na2TiCr(PO4)3. The redox couple was found to be stable against cycling with some 90.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles within the voltage range between 2.5 and 4.7 V. With a wider voltage range between 2.5 and 5.0 V, the capacity retention was about 76.6% after 1000 cycles, indicating the redox couple is stable against overvoltage. In addition, the effect of Ti/Cr ratio on the reversibility of the redox couple was studied by varying x in Na1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 (where x = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 2.0). It was confirmed that x = 1 is optimal for balancing the electrode stability and the capacity. The obtained optimal content of Cr in the compound provides useful guidance for designing new Cr-based NASICON-type cathode materials. Furthermore, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of compound Na2TiCr(PO4)3 indicated a two-phase sodium-ion storage mechanism, which is different from the previously reported one-phase mechanism. Rietveld refinement XRD analysis showed a small volume change of the compound during cycling (about 2.6%), indicating good structural stability.
Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable and viable means of energy storage for large-scale electric storage applications because of the low cost of sodium in comparison with that of lithium.High-performance electrode materials that can store sodium ions with high capacity and rate capability are the key to success in NIB technology.Transition-metal oxides (TMOs) with TM redox couples responsible for loss and gain of electrons during charge/discharge, such as Ti, V, Cr, Mn,Fe,Co,and Ni,have been widely explored as cathode materials for NIBs. The stability of the redox couple is extremely important because it also determines the discharge voltage, cycling stability, and so forth. The sodium superionic conductor (NASICON)-type polyanion materials are particularly outstanding because of their high potential and ionic conductivity.The Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in the NASICON compound Na3Cr2(PO4)3 was first reported by Yamada and co-workers with a redox potential as high as 4.5 V (vs. Na+/Na).10 This voltage is the highest among all NASICON-type materials reported so far, and also higher than that of most cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) (e.g., LiFePO4, LiCoO2, and Li2Mn2O4). However, the authors observed that the charge storage capacity of the compound decayed rapidly during cycling. This instability is explained to be due to the disproportionation reaction of Cr4+ to Cr3+ and Cr6+, as has been observed from layered oxide cathode materials.23 A subsequent work of Yamada and coworkers demonstrated that the cycling stability of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 can be significantly improved by partial substitution of Cr with Ti.24 However, Cr2O3 was found to be present as an impurity in the synthesized compound Na2TiCr(PO4)3. The authors assigned the discharge plateau to a monophasic reaction mechanism. Very recently, another Crbased NASICON-type Na4CrMn(PO4)3 cathode was reported in which the Cr4+/Cr3+, M n4+/Mn3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ were efficiently combined and an unprecedented high energy density was obtained.25,26 However, the cycling stability of the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in high-voltage regions in the reported NASICON-type compounds does not meet the requirements of practical applications.
In this work, the cycling stability and high-voltage durability of the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in compound Na2TiCr(PO4)3were investigated. In addition, the effect of Ti doping on the cycling stability of Na1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 (where x = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 2.0) was studied. The maximum discharge capacity and long-term cycling stability of compound Na2TiCr(PO4)3 were tested in voltage windows between 2.5 and 4.7 V and 2.5 and 5.0 V, respectively. A specific capacity of 49.9 mA h g−1 was obtained at a current density of 20 mA g−1, reaching about 80% of its theoretical capacity (62.2 mA h g−1 with one Na+ insertion/deinsertion per Na2TiCr(PO4)3). Capacity retention of 90.3% was achieved after 300 cycles in the voltage window of 2.5−4.7 V, and it became 76.6% in the voltage window of 2.5−5.0 V after 1000 cycles measured at 50 mA g−1. It was found that the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in Na2TiCr(PO4)3 exhibits a high overvoltage durability. An in situ XRD analysis showed a two-phase reaction mechanism, which is different from the reported monophasic mechanism.24 This two-phase reaction mechanism is the main cause leading to the small volume shrinkage upon desodiation (about 2.6%). The stoichiometry of Na2TiCr(PO4)3 was found to be optimal for stabilizing the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple.
Materials Synthesis. The Na2TiCr(PO4)3 compound was synthesized by using a sol−gel method. 2 mmol of sodium acetate, 1 mmol of tetrabutyl titanate, and 1 mmol of chromium acetate were dissolved in 40 mL of ethanol at 60 °C to form solution A. 3 mmol of phosphoric acid was diluted in ethanol with a mass ratio of 1:2 to form solution B. Then solution B was added to solution A under vigorous stirring, followed by evaporation of the solvent at 80 °C. The as-prepared solid was annealed in a tube furnace at 900 °C for 5 h in an argon atmosphere to obtain a powdery sample light green in color, which is designated as Na2TiCr(PO4)3. N a1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 series (x = 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.4, 2.0) compounds were also synthesized following the above process except for using 1 + x mmol of sodium acetate, x mmol of chromium acetate, 2 − x mmol of tetrabutyl titanate, and 3 mmol of phosphoric acid.
Materials Characterization. The phase purity of the assynthesized Na2TiCr(PO4)3 and Na1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 series compounds were analyzed by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on a Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scanning speed of 5° min−1. In situ XRD patterns of Na2TiCr(PO4)3were obtained during cycling in a Be-equipped electrochemical cell between 18° and 35° with a scanning speed of 3° min−1. The Rietveld method was applied to refine the XRD patterns using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) with the EXPGUI graphical user interface. The microstructure and composition of the samples were characterized by using field-emission scanning electron microcopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) equipped with an energy dispersive function at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Surface chemical compositions of the sample were investigated by using an Xray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi) with an Al Kα X-ray source at 15 kV and 10.8 mA.
Electrochemical Measurements. The electrochemical performances of the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 and Na1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 series compounds were tested with standard CR2032 coin cells. The electrode slurries consisting of the active materials (80 wt %), acetylene black (10 wt %), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (10 wt %) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent were cast onto aluminum foils and then dried at 110 °C for 6 h. The average loadings of the active material were about 2 mg cm−2. The CR2032 coin cells were assembled with sodium metal as the anode electrodes, 1 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC)/fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (95:5 v/v ratio) as the electrolyte, and glass-fiber filters (Whatman GF/D) as the separators, in an argon-filled glovebox with H2O and O2concentrations of less than 0.01 ppm. Galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles were recorded on a Neware CT-4008 (Newell, China) multichannel battery testing system in a voltage range of 2.5−4.7 V for the cycling performance test and in a voltage range of 2.5−5.0 V for the rate performance and high-voltage durability tests. The applied current density and the specific capacity were calculated on the basis of the mass of active materials. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were collected in the voltage range of 2.5−5.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 on a CHI600E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, China).
Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern of Na2TiCr(PO4)3. All diffraction peaks can be indexed to a rhombohedral unit cell with the space group R3̅c, in good agreement with the standard card (PDF #97-009-8159). No impurity peaks were observed. The refined XRD profile fits well with the experimental XRD data. Atomic coordinates of Na2TiCr(PO4)3 are listed in Table S1. The Rietveld refinement revealed that the occupancy factors of Na(1) and Na(2) are 0.9626 and 0.3428, respectively, corresponding to 11.95 (0.9626 × 6 + 0.3428 × 12) Na+ per unit cell (Z = 6), and matching well with the expected chemical formula Na2TiCr(PO4)3. The unit-cell parameters obtained from the structure refinement (a = b = 8.560 Å, c = 21.692 Å) are a little different from previously reported results (a = b = 8.563 Å, c = 21.684 Å), which may be caused by a slightly lower occupancy of Na+ in this work (11.95 vs 12.06 Na+ per unit cell).
Figure 1b shows the XPS spectrum of Na2TiCr(PO4)3. I t can be seen that elements Na, Ti, Cr, P, O, and C are present in the compound. As shown in the insets of Figure 1b, the XPS peaks at binding energies of 460.0 and 579.9 eV indicate the presence of Ti 2p3/2 and Cr 2p3/2 orbits, demonstrating the Ti4+ and Cr3+ states.28,29 HRTEM image of the compound is shown in Figure 1c. The lattice fringe spacing of 0.37 nm observed is consistent with the (113) plane of Na2TiCr(PO4)3. Figure 1d shows the morphology of the as-synthesized Na2TiCr(PO4)3, and the sample consisting of small particles with sizes in the range between 200 and 500 nm can be seen. The elemental mapping data of the particles in a selected area shown in Figure 1e confirmed that the elements of Na, Ti, Cr, P, and O are present in the sample.
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) profiles of the Na2TiCr(PO4)3/Na cell within 2.5−5.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in Figure 2a. The appearance of only one redox couple at about 4.5 V with the anodic and cathodic peaks respectively at about 4.58 and 4.42 V during the first 10 cycles can be seen, which is consistent with the reported Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in Na3Cr2(PO4)3.10 The difference of 0.16 V is caused by the polarization effect. Considering that the redox couple potential of Ti4+/Ti3+ is about 2.1 V (vs. Na+/Na) in NASICON-type compounds, such as NaTi2(PO4)3,7 Na2VTi(PO4)3,30 and Na3TiMn(PO4)3,12,28 it can be concluded that the redox peaks in Figure 2a can be attributed only to the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple. Stronger polarization can be seen in the first CV curve , which may becaused by particle aggregation, as indicated by the SEM images in Figure S1. I t is notable that there were well-defined splits of the anodic and cathodic peaks in the first few CV curves. The phenomenon can be associated with the structural rearrangements caused by the transfer of Na+ from Na(1) to Na(2) site.18 This transformation was found in an early research study on NASICON-structured Na3M2(PO4)3 (M: Sc, Cr, Fe) frameworks.31 Similar splits were also reported in many previous works of NASICON-structured compounds, for example, Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3, and were mainly attributed to the structural rearrangements mechanism.32,33 Therefore, we speculate the structural rearrangement leads to the splits. However, the splits of CV curves disappeared progressively and stabilized after about 10 cycles, which was consistent with the charge/discharge profiles as shown in Figure 2b.
Figure 2b shows the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) profiles measured at a current density of 20 mA g−1 within 2.5−4.7 V. A single charge and discharge voltage plateau of about 4.5 V can be observed, which is in agreement with the sharp insertion/desertion peaks observed from the CV curves, indicating a two-phase reaction mechanism. As expected, small plateaus in discharge curves (the inset in Figure 2b) in the first few cycles were observed. This can also be attributed to the structural rearrangement as described above, which was consistent with the splits in CV curves. An inconsistency between the first anodic CV curve and first GCD charge profile can also be observed. This was due to the different current densities used in the CV and GCD measurements. A high current density can lead to a more significant CV curve split and the appearance of small GCD voltage plateaus.The electrode delivered an initial charge capacity of 67.1 mA h g−1 and a discharge capacity of 49.9 mA h g−1, about 80% of its theoretical capacity, giving a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of about 74.4%. The relatively low CE may be mainly attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at such a high cutoff voltage (4.7 V vs Na+/Na). The same phenomenon was also observed by Yamada and co-workers.
Figure 2c shows the rate performance of Na2TiCr(PO4)3measured with current densities varying from 10 to 320 mA g−1. A higher charging cutoff voltage of 5.0 V was used to ensure sufficient charge at high charging rates. A decrease in the specific capacity from 51.8 to 29.7 mA h g−1 was observed when the current density increased from 10 to 320 mA g−1. The capacity was recovered to 49.5 mA h g−1, which is very close to its original capacity of 51.8 mA h g−1 when the current density was changed back to 10 mA g−1.
Figure 2d shows the cycling performance of Na2TiCr(PO4)3evaluated between 2.5 and 4.7 V at a current density of 20 mA g−1. The electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 49.9 mA h g−1 and a capacity of 45.1 mA h g−1 at the 300th cycle, leading to 90.3% capacity retention (∼0.032% capacity decrease per cycle). It should be noted that the compound exhibited poor initial CE, which was about 74.4%. The relatively low CE can be attributed to the electrolyte decomposition at high voltage. However, the CE at the 10th cycle increased to 97.7%. It became 99.0% after about 100 cycles. An average CE of 98.8% was obtained in the 300 cycles.
The cycling stability was further evaluated in the voltage window of 2.5−5.0 V. The results are shown in Figure 2e. Capacity retention of 76.6% after 1000 cycles was achieved (∼0.024% capacity fading per cycle). The high-voltage test results indicate that the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple in the NASICON-structured Na2TiCr(PO4)3 is stable against overvoltage cycling. Because of the 5.0 V high cutoff voltage, an initial CE of about 71.7% was obtained. However, the CE increased to 92.9% at the 10th cycle and increased to about 98.0% and 99.0% after about 30 and 300 cycles. An average CE of 98.5% was obtained for all of the cycles. The SEI film with thicknesses of about 5−10 nm can be observed from the TEM images shown in Figure S2. The SEI film formed after several cycles at high voltages, as is the case of LIBs.36 The SEI is important in preventing the electrolyte from further decomposition.37
Figure 3a shows the in situ XRD patterns of cathode Na2TiCr(PO4)3. Upon charging, all diffraction peaks (marked in red) of the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 phase (phase a, φa) gradually disappeared and new peaks appeared (marked in dark green), indicating a new phase (phase b, φb) was generated. Upon discharging, the peaks of phase b disappeared gradually and the diffraction peaks entirely restored to the pattern of phase a, indicating a highly reversible crystal structure. As a result, a typical biphasic transition process can be concluded, consistent with the charge/discharge curves of the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 with flat voltage plateaus. At the end of the desodiation process, all of the characteristic peaks can be indexed to a new phase of NaTiCr(PO4)3 crystallized in a rhombohedral structure with an R3̅c space group, which is similar to those of NaTi2(PO4)3. It can be seen that all peaks of the new phase show a higher 2θ angle than those of the initial phase, indicating shrinkage of the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 unit cell during the desodiation process. The in situ XRD patterns were refined by using the Rietveld method. The obtained unit-cell parameters of phases a and b are shown in Figure 3b. The volume shrinkage from the initial state to the fully charged state was calculated to be about 2.6%.
It should be noted that the structural evolution during charging/discharging observed in this work is different from that reported by Yamada and co-workerswho observed that the Na2TiCr(PO4)3 compound synthesized by using the solidstate reaction method underwent a monophasic process along with a continuous lattice volume change when cycled in the voltage window between 2.5 and 4.7 V. In this study, an obvious biphasic region can be seen from Figure 3a (highlighted by the dashed oval). In addition, the volume change is also different. The 2.6% volume shrinkage observed in this study is smaller than the value of 3.3% reported by Yamada and co-workers.It is believed that the different structural evolution processes may account for the different volume changes, which may also affect the cycling stability.
The volume shrinkage of 2.6% is relatively small compared to those of other NASICON-structured compounds. A small volume shrinkage is favorable for cycling stability.For the well-documented compound Na3V2(PO4)3,8 the volume shrinkage was reported to be about 8.3% after 2 Na+ deintercalation, equivalent to 4.2% volume shrinkage for 1 Na+ deintercalation. The Ti-substituted compound, Na2TiV(PO4)3,with the same crystal structure as compound Na2TiCr(PO4)3, exhibited volume shrinkage of about 3.5% for 1 Na+ deintercalation, which is obviously bigger than the case of Na2TiCr(PO4)3. The smaller volume shrinkage of Na2TiCr(PO4)3 compared to that of Na2TiV(PO4)3 may be due to the smaller ionic radius difference between Ti4+ (0.60 Å) and Cr3+ (0.615 Å) than that between Ti4+ and V3+ (0.640 Å).42 As can be seen from Table 1, the desodiated NaTi(IV)Cr(IV)(PO4)3 and NaTi(IV)V(IV)(PO4)3 compounds have a very close unit cell volume (∼0.09% difference) in spite of a 5.45% ionic radius difference between Cr4+ and V4+ (0.55 vs 0.58 Å). By contrast, in the case of Na2Ti(IV)Cr((III)(PO4)3 and Na2Ti(IV)V(III)(PO4)3, t h e v o l u m e difference is about 1.48%, despite the fact that the ionic radius difference between Cr3+ and V3+ (0.615 vs 0.64 Å) is about 4.06%. Therefore, it is believed that the average volumes of the M(Ti, Cr, V)O6 octahedra in NASICON-structured compounds may be determined by the larger atoms located at the same position and sustain the skeletons of the crystal structures as pillars. Concerning compounds NaTi(IV)Cr(IV)(PO4)3 and NaTi(IV)V(IV)(PO4)3, T i4+ with a larger atomic radius than Cr4+ and V4+ may act as a pillar in both of the compounds, bringing about very similar volumes. However, in the cases of Na2Ti(IV)Cr(III)(PO4)3 and Na2Ti(IV)V(III)(PO4)3, the Cr3+ and V3+ are larger than Ti4+ and act as the “pillar” atoms. Therefore, the smaller radius of the Cr3+ atom leads to a relatively smaller volume expansion of Na2Ti(IV)Cr(III)(PO4)3.
The effect of Cr content on the electrochemical performance of the NASICON-type compounds was investigated by varying x in Na1+xTi2−xCrx(PO4)3 (x = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 2.0). No impurity was found from the XRD patterns shown in Figure S3. The atomic coordinates of Na2Cr2(PO4)3 from the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern are shown in Table S2. All peaks can be indexed to a rhombohedral unit cell with the space group of R3-c. Figure 4a shows the first charge and discharge profiles of the compounds. It can be seen that the charge capacity increased with the increase in Cr content, reaching 80−85 mA h g−1 when x was equal to and above 1.2. However, the trend of the discharge capacity was significantly different. It first increased to a maximum of 52.7 mA h g−1 at the point of x = 1.2 and then decreased rapidly as shown in the inset. The irreversible capacity increased significantly when x was above 1.0. It can be concluded that the stability decreased significantly. The conclusion was further confirmed by the cycling stability test shown in Figure 4b. Excellent cycling stability can be observed when the x was no more than 1.0. In sharp contrast, the cycling stability became worse and worse with increasing Cr content when x was above 1.0, especially for the case of Na3Cr2(PO4)3 (x = 2.0). The results are also consistent with the reported work on the NASICONstructured Na3Cr2(PO4)3 in which a rapid capacity decrease was observed.
The above results confirmed that the Cr stoichiometry should be maintained equal to or smaller than 1.0 to stabilize the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple. Excessive Cr deteriorates the cycling stability. However, it should be pointed out that the 4.5 V high discharge voltage can still bring about 270 W h kg−1 (∼60 mA h g−1) energy density for 1 Na+ transfer per formula, which is the highest among all transition metals in NASICONstructured compounds.
 A NASICON-type compound, Na2TiCr(PO4)3, was synthesized by using the sol−gel method for investigating the longterm cycling performance of the 4.5 V high-voltage Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple. An excellent capacity retention of 90.3% was obtained after 300 cycles (0.032% decay per cycle) in a voltage range of 2.5−4.7 V. An overvoltage durability test within 2.5− 5.0 V also showed an unexpected surprise that a capacity retention of 76.6% after 1000 cycles (0.024% decay per cycle) was obtained, confirming the redox couple is robust enough to cope with the overvoltage. A small volume shrinkage of 2.6% was found to be responsible for the observed excellent cycling stability. In situ XRD data revealed a two-phase reaction mechanism during the charge/discharge process, which is different from the monophasic reaction mechanism reported earlier.24 An optimal stoichiometry of Na2TiCr(PO4)3 is favorable for stabilizing the Cr4+/Cr3+ redox couple against cycling.
