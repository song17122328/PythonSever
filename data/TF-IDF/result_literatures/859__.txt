The cooperation between host and activator ions in nature could enable novel controllability of emissioncolors in single host.

 This work presents the vacuum ultraviolet-visible (VUV-Vis) spectroscopic properties of Tb3þ-doped NASICON-type RE1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (RE ¼ Y, La, Gd and Lu) prepared by a Pechini method.

The cooperation between self-active host and Tb3þ ions leads to tunable emission from the (greenish-)blue to yellowish-green region by appropriate adjusting the Tb3þ content.

The visible cross relaxationbetween Tb3þ ions and energy transfer from host/Gd3þ to Tb3þ were observed and confirmed.

A detailedenergy level diagram that contains 4f levels of all divalent and trivalent lanthanide ions with respect tothe valence and conduction bands of Gd1/3Zr2(PO4)3 has been constructed and explained.

In addition, theenergy transfer processes and cross relaxation processes were discussed.

Luminescent materials have played an important role in thedevelopment of novel lighting and display technology [1,2].

VUVexcited luminescent materials are indispensable for applicationsof plasma display panels (PDPs), vacuum fluorescent displays,three-dimensional (3D) displays, and Hg-free fluorescent lamps.

 Finding novel bright luminescent materials with goodcontrollability of emission colors in single-phase host is one hotresearch topic [1].

Based on the energy transfer mechanism fromhost to activators, utilizing the cooperation between self-activehost and activator ions is one effective strategy for synthesis ofsingle-phase tunable luminescent materials [1].

Besides phosphates [4e10], many compounds containing closed-shell transitionmetal cations such as Zr4þ [11,12], Ti4þ, and W6þ [13,14], are widelyused in the area of luminescent material, due to their bright broadultraviolet-visible emissions and effective energy transfer to activator ions [5,15e18].

 For luminescent materials research, the rareearth (RE) ions play an important role overall system performance due to their f-f or d-f transitions.

Among these RE ions, theTb3þ emission with high luminescence efficiency can be tunedalong a large color region from blue to green by well-known crossrelaxation energy transfer process, which depends on Tb3þ concentration and cut off phonon frequency of host lattices [19,20].

It isnecessary to study the luminescence behavior of Tb3þ cations indifferent hosts in detail due to its host dependent characteristics[19,20].

Recently, Naþ ion super ionic conductors type (NASICONtype) zirconium phosphates with a three-dimensional (3D) rigid[Zr2(PO4)3] network have attracted intense attention, due to theirexcellent properties, including the large band gap [11,12,21] and thehigh chemical [22] and physical [23,24] stability.

The typicalNASICON MZr2(PO4)3 crystal structure consists of a 3D rigidnetwork formed by PO4 tetrahedra sharing the corners with ZrO6octahedra.

Many NASICON-type related zirconium phosphates withdifferent substitutions have been extensively studied as novel REdoped luminescent materials [11,21,22,24e27].

This NASICON-typecrystal structure could offer several conditions suitable for Tb3þdoped luminescent materials: (1) The 3D rigid [Zr2(PO4)3] networkexhibits great VUV luminescence properties [11,27].

The 3Drigid [Zr2(PO4)3] network shows high chemical and physical stabilities [21e25].

Large average distance (>5 Å) between Tb3þions [26] would inhibit luminescence concentration quenching ofTb3þ emission intensity.

 The VUV luminescence propertiesof RE-doped AZr2(PO4)3 (Aþ ¼ Li, Na, K) [11] and MII1/2Zr2(PO4)3(MII ¼ Ca, Sr, Ba) [16,18,21,25,26] were demonstrated as novel potential luminescent materials.

In this study, a series of Tb3þ-doped RE1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (RE ¼ Y, La,Gd and Lu) phosphors are synthesized by a facile Pechini method.

Inaddition, the Tb3þ-related luminescence behavior and the energytransfers from host/Gd3þ to Tb3þ were investigated according to thespectroscopic characteristics.

The Tb3þ concentration dependentcolor tunable luminescence properties are discussed.

Moreover, theenergy level diagram containing the position of the 4f and 5d levelsof all divalent and trivalent lanthanide ions relative to the valenceand conduction band of Gd1/3Zr2(PO4)3 has been constructed anddiscussed in detail.

In conclusion, Tb3þ-doped RE1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (RE ¼ Y, La, Gd, and Lu)samples were prepared using a Pechini method.

In these samples,tunable emission from the (greenish-)blue to yellowish-green region was obtained by varying the Tb3þ concentration under thecooperation between host and Tb3þ ions.

By comparing the luminescence properties of these samples, it has been found that theGd3þ ions play an intermediate role in energy transfer from the hostabsorption band to the Tb3þ ions in host lattice.

The energy levelscheme of lanthanide 4f/5d states in Gd1/3Zr2(PO4)3 will be onestrong aid in the research on the luminescence properties of theseRE-doped NASICON zirconium phosphates compounds.
