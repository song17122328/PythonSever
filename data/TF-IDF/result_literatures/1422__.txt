The title compound, KSn2(PO4)3, belongs to the NASICONtype family of phosphates with the space group R3. Its structure is constructed by very regular [with P—O distances ranging from 1.513 (6) to 1.522 (6) A˚ ] P O4 tetrahedra and SnO6 octahedra on the 3. axis, which are linked by O atoms, forming an [Sn2(PO4)3] framework. The K atoms occupy the 3. axis sites and are located in the voids of this arrangement. The crystal studied was a merohedral twin with twin law (010 100 001) and a component ratio of 0.580 (7):0.420 (7).

In the past, the family of AM2(PO4)3 (A = alkali metals; M = Ti, Zr, Ge, Sn) compounds with the NASICON-type (Na3Zr2Si2PO12: Boilot, et al., 1987) structure have been extensively investigated for their intriguing properities, such as the ionic conductivity properities which may due to the complex and subtle interactions between NASICON framework and mobile ions. The NASICON-type structure with a flexible three-dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra sharing comers with MO6 octahedra, is amenable to a wide variety of chemical substitutions at the various crystallographic positions, thus yielding a large number of closely related compounds, such as NaFeNb(PO4)3 (Zatovskii, et al., 2006) and K2Ca2(SO4)3 (Boujelben, et al., 2007). In order to inrich this family of compounds, we synthesis the compound KSn2(PO4)3 by the high-temperature reaction and determine the crystal structure from single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.KSn2(PO4)3 is isostructure with Na (Alamo & Rodrigo, 1992) and Rb (Zhao et al., 2011) analog crystals which crystallizes in the trigonal space group R-3. A projection of the crystal structure of KSn2(PO4)3 is given in Fig. 2. It is characterized by the presence of PO4 tetrahedra and SnO6 octahedra, linked by sharing corner O atoms, to establish a three-dimentional [Sn2(PO4)3] framework. Furthermore, this framwork delimits two types of channels in which the K atoms are located to compensate the negative charges. The PO4 tetrahedra are quite regular, with the P–O distance ranging from 1.513 (6) to 1.522 (6) Å, while the SnO6 octahedra is quite regular too, with the Sn–O distance ranging from 2.003 (6) to 2.045 (6) Å.

Compound KSn2(PO4)3 has been prepared by a high-temperature method in air. A powder mixture of K2CO3, SnO2 and NH4H2PO4 in the molar ratio of K: Sn: P = 15: 1: 15 was first ground in an agate mortar and then transferred to a platinum crucible. The sample was gradually heated in air at 1173 K for 24 h. After that, the intermediate product was slowly cooled to 773 K at the rate of 2 K h-1, and finally quenched to room temperature. The obtained crystals were colorless with a prismatic shape.

The KSn2(PO4)3 crystal studies was twinned by merohedry. For refinement the twin law (0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1) was used; the twin component ratio refined to 0.580 (7): 0.420 (7). The highest peak in the difference electron density map equals to 2.23 e/Å3 at the distance of 0.05 Å from Sn1 site while the deepest hole equals to -2.99 e/Å3 at the distance of 0.99 Å from Sn2 site.

All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.

Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating Rfactors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
