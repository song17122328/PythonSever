Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has been considered as a potential positive electrode material for sodium ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its high theoretical speciﬁc capacity. Nonetheless, the practical application of NVP is hindered by the intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. Herein, polydopaminederived nitrogen-doped carbon-covered Na3V2(PO4)3/C composites (NVP/C/NC) have been prepared through a self-polymerization of dopamine on the NVP/C surface and subsequent calcination at high temperature. The assynthesized NVP/C/NC composite cathode exhibits a high initial reversible capacity (109.2 mAh/g at 0.2C), superior rate performance (87.2 mAh/g at a rate up to 20C), and excellent cycling capability (91.2% of the initial capacity is kept after 500 cycles at 2C) in NIBs. Furthermore, compared with NVP/C electrode, the NVP/C/NC electrode presents low resistance and high sodium ions diﬀusion coeﬃcient. The good performance can be ascribed to the nitrogen-doped carbon layer in improving the electronic conductivity, shortening diﬀusion length of Na+ ions and electrons, and relieving the volume changes of electrode materials. These preliminary results suggest that the as-obtained NVP/C/NC composite is a novel promising electrode material for low-cost sodium energy storage.

Nowadays, lithium ion batteries (LIBs), owing to their large energy density and long lifespan, have been utilized in a broad range of applications, such as portable electronic equipment, electric vehicles and smart grid [1,2]. However, the limited and unevenly distribution of lithium resources has led to the relatively high cost for LIBs in largescale applications [3,4]. Therefore, the development of new alternative energy storage system is not only desirable but also extremely essential. In recent years, due to the low price and natural abundant of sodium sources, sodium ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted great attention for future large-scale energy storage [5,6]. In addition, the similar physical and chemical properties between lithium and sodium elements further promote the development of NIBs [7].

For example, Mai et al. prepared threedimensional graphene frameworks covered LVP (LVP-G-FD) composite, which exhibits large energy density (501.3 Wh/kg) and superior cycle performance with a capacity retention of 65% after 500 cycles at 500 mA g−1 structured Li3V2(PO4)3@C nanocomposite with approximately 86% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 5C (1C = 197 mAh g−1), showing outstanding rate capability [17]. Wan et al. prepared carbon-coated LiMn0.5Fe0.5PO4@C core-shell composite through in-situ resorcinolformaldehyde polymerization method, exhibiting a remarkable high rate capability (155 mAh g−1 at 17 mA g−1 and 105 mAh g−1 at 1700 mA g−1) [18]. Chung et al. reported the preparation of polythiophene coated NaFePO4, which displays a ﬁrst discharge speciﬁc capacity of 142 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1 with a capacity retention of 94% over 100 cycles and superior rate capability (70 mAh g−1 at 150 mA g−1 and 42 mAh g−1 at 300 mA g−1) [19].

Herein, we prepared a nitrogen-doped carbon-coated NVP/C positive electrode material by employing dopamine as the nitrogen source and carbon source simultaneously through a versatile and simple method. Owing to the good ﬁlm-forming ability of dopamine, a homogeneous coating layer was successfully covered on the surface of NVP/C particles, which would suppress structural collapse resulting from the volume changes during ions insertion/extraction. The coated nitrogen-doped carbon layer could enhance the electrical conductivity greatly. Also, it will further improve the cycling stability, particularly the high rate performance. As expected, the NVP/C/NC composite cathode shows a larger ﬁrst discharge speciﬁc capacity of 109.2 mAh/g at 0.2C with capacity retention of 95.4% over 100 cycles. Even at a current density of 20C, a high speciﬁc capacity of 87.2 mAh/g is delivered.

Citric acid and NaOH were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. NH4VO3 and NH4H2PO4 were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and dopamine hydrochloride were obtained from J&K Scientiﬁc Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and employed without any puriﬁcation. Citric acid was used not only as a carbon source but also as a chelating agent.

The pristine Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample was fabricated by the sol-gel approach according to the previous work [20]. In brief, citric acid, NH4VO3, NH4H2PO4 and NaOH with the molar ratio of 1:2:3:3 were sequentially dissolved in 75 mL of deionized water to get an orange solution. Subsequently, the solution was agitated magnetically at 80 °C for 8 h to obtain a dark blue sol. Then, the sol was dried in a drying oven at 80 °C overnight to form a gel. After grinding, the dried gel powder was calcined in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 3 h, then annealed at 800 °C for 16 h under an Ar atmosphere to achieve the NVP/C material.

NVP/C/NC composite was fabricated through a self-polymerization process of dopamine monomers. 1.5 g of the as-prepared NVP/C powder was dispersed in a tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buﬀer aqueous solution (75 mL, 0.5 M) by ultrasound for 30 min. Then, HCl (1 M) was injected drop by drop into the solution under magnetic stirring until the pH value of the tris-buﬀer solution reached 8.7. Later, 0.15 g of dopamine hydrochloride was added into the suspension with continuous and vigorous stirring for 24 h under ambient temperature. The polydopamine-coated NVP/C/NC precursor was harvested via centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the nitrogen-doped carbon-wrapped NVP/C (NVP/C/NC) was obtained after sintering in a tube furnace at 350 °C for 3 h followed by calcining at 750 °C for 3 h in an Ar atmosphere. The fabrication process of the NVP/C/NC composite is illustrated in Fig. 1.

X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) measurements were conducted with a Rigaku SMARTLAB diﬀractometer (Rigaku, Japan) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the scanning range of 10–60°. SEM with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) was performed for morphology analysis using ZEISS SUPRA55 ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscope (ZEISS, Germany) working at 15 kV. TEM was carried out on a JEOL 2100F transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) working at 200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the compound was achieved by an HCT-2 device (Hengjiu Instrument Co., Ltd., China) under air from ambient temperature to 700 °C, with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. Raman spectrum is measured by Renishaw 2000 spectrometer (Renishaw, UK) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The carbon content is measured by carbon sulfur analyzer (ELTRA, CS800). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and porous structure were estimated by SSA-4000 automatic speciﬁc surface area and pore size distribution analyzer (Builder, China). Tap density was measured by tapping 1 g NVP 1000 times in a cylindrical container.

The working electrode was mixed by dispersing the active material (80 wt%), acetylene black (10 wt%), and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride) binder (PVDF, 10 wt%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution. The acquired homogenous slurry was pasted on an Al foil, followed by drying at 120 °C in a vacuum oven for 12 h. Then the electrode was cut into circles with a diameter of 10 mm. CR2032 type button batteries were assembled in an Ar-ﬁlled glove-box (O2 ≤ 0.1 ppm and H2O ≤ 0.1 ppm) with sodium metal foils as the counter/reference electrodes. 1 M NaClO4 in the ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 by vol.) mixed solvent, with 5 wt% ﬂuoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as an additive was used as the electrolyte. Glass ﬁber ﬁlter (Whatman, GF/D) was chosen as the separator. The typical mass loading of the active material is about 1.3 mg/cm2. The galvanostatic charging and discharging testing were performed in the voltage window of 2.5–3.8 V vs. Na+/Na using a Land CT2001A battery test system at room temperature. In this work, C rates are utilized for characterizing the current rate, where 1C corresponds to a current rate of 117.6 mA g−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted with a CHI660C electrochemical workstation at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s between 2.5 V and 3.8 V (vs. Na+/Na). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an AC voltage of 10 mV by using a Solartron 1260 electrochemical analyzer.

The carbon content in the NVP/C and NVP/C/NC composite was also estimated from the TGA test in air as displayed in Fig. 2b. In the TGA curves, the slight weight loss at around 100 °C is attributed to the volatilization of adsorbed water molecules. The carbon contents are 2.20% for NVP/C and 5.91% for NVP/C/NC, which are in good agreement with the results of carbon sulfur determinator. After 500 °C, both samples show the same tendency of a slight weight increase, which can be ascribed to the oxidation of V ions in the NVP from 3+ to 4+ and 5+ [24]. Moreover, the packing density of NVP/C and NVP/C/NC samples measured is 0.93 and 0.87 g cm−3, respectively.

The nature of carbon layer in the NVP/C and NVP/C/NC composites is further characterized by Raman spectroscopy and the result is shown in Fig. 2c. Two characteristic peaks centered at 1360 and 1582 cm−1 are seen for both of them, corresponding to the D (disordered carbon) band and G (graphite carbon) band, respectively [25]. Generally, the intensity ratio of D/G peak (ID/IG) is often deﬁned to evaluate the structural disordering of carbon materials [26]. And the values of ID/IG for NVP/C and NVP/C/NC are about 1.04 and 1.02, respectively, implying the partial graphitization of the deposited carbon [15,27]. There is no doubt that the ID/IG value of NVP/C/NC is lower than that of NVP/ C, suggesting the high degree of graphitization and high conductivity of carbon, which result from the additional coated nitrogen-doped carbon layer. It is worth mentioning that this could eﬃciently improve the electrical conductivity and accelerate the electron transport [28].

The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were utilized to investigate the porous structure of the NVP/C/NC composite. Fig. 2d exhibits the nitrogen isotherm adsorption-desorption plot and the pore size distribution of the NVP/C/NC. The isotherms of the sample are assigned to the type IV curve with an H3 hysteresis loop between the P/ P0 range of 0.4 and 1.0, which corresponds to the mesoporous structure [29]. Based on the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) equation, the speciﬁc surface area of the NVP/C/NC was estimated to be 49.1 m2 g−1, much larger than that of pristine NVP/C (25.66 m2 g−1, Fig. S1). The enlarged surface area of NVP/C/NC provides more active sites for sodium ions insertion/extraction and facilitates the eﬀective contact area between electrode and electrolyte, leading to improved reaction kinetics [30]. In addition, the pore size of the NVP/C/NC composite is distributed mainly below 10 nm with an average pore diameter of approximately 3 nm (inset in Fig. 2d).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out to analyze the surface chemical composition of the NVP/C/NC, as shown in Fig. 3. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum (Fig. 3a) displays four types of carbon: C]C at 284.6 eV, CeC at 285.4 eV, CeN at 287.8 eV, and O–C=O at 288.6 eV. [31] This demonstrates that nitrogen has been successfully doped into the carbon layer. For the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of NVP/C/NC in Fig. 3b, three peaks located at about 398.5, 399.5 and 400.4 eV correspond to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, respectively. [32] Additionally, the nitrogen content for NVP/C/NC is

The morphological characteristic of the as-obtained NVP/C and NVP/C/NC samples was studied by a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). As displayed in Fig. 4a and b, both the two samples are composed of plate-like nano-particles with a size of about 100–375 nm. Although both of them showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the morphology, the NVP/C/NC composite has a porous structure after the carbonization procedure of the polydopamine, which can not only shorten the sodium ion diﬀusion distance, but also facilitate the inﬁltration of electrolyte, thus providing better performance. Moreover, the pristine NVP/C occurs in an apparent agglomeration compared to NVP/C/NC composite, suggesting that the coated nitrogen-doped carbon layer can inhibit particle growth to a great extent. Meanwhile, smoke-like carbon grains were seen for NVP/C/NC composite but were hardly seen for NVP/C. Therefore, it was evident that the nitrogendoped carbon, derived from polydopamine, can inhibit the particle growth and agglomeration of NVP/C. In Fig. 4c, the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mappings indicate that Na, V, P, C, and N elements are homogeneously distributed in NVP/C/NC composite.

The detailed microstructure of the NVP/C/NC sample was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 5 displays the TEM images of the NVP/C/NC composite. It is observed that the surface of grains is wrapped and connected by nitrogen-doped carbon derived from polydopamine, which provides a facial channel for electrons transport [34]. The appropriate carbon layer is a key factor on the enhancement of electrochemical capabilities of NVP. A coating of the carbon layer on the surface of NVP can eﬀectively prevent the particles from further growing and aggregating so as to acquire smaller grains [35]. It also reveals that the particle size is about 100–180 nm, which is in accordance with the above SEM result. As seen in Fig. 5b, the NVP/ C/NC composite has a relatively uniform amorphous nitrogen-doped carbon layer with the thickness of < 10 nm, demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of the carbon coating strategy.

The cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 6a) was conducted in a potential range of 2.5–3.8 V at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV/s. As observed from the CV curves, there appears a couple of well-deﬁned redox peaks on both the electrodes, which correspond to the reversible transformation of V3+/V4+ [36,37]. However, in the reduction (sodiation) process, the single peak splits into two parts, which is owing to the structural rearrangements when sodium ions transfer from Na(1) to Na(2) sites [38–40]. The voltage distance (ΔV) between the reduction and oxidation peaks of NVP/C and NVP/C/NC is 243 mV and 216 mV, respectively, suggesting the lower polarization and easier migration of Na+ in NVP/C/NC composite electrode. Meanwhile, the peak current of NVP/ C/NC is much higher than that of pristine NVP/C, proving the faster

In summary, polydopamine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon coating NVP/C/NC cathode material has been synthesized by a simple sol-gel and post-sintering process. The obtained NVP/C/NC composite exhibits high speciﬁc capacity, good cycling stability and superior rate performance, which are ascribed to the expanding contact area between active material and electrolyte and enhanced electronic conductivity of the in situ generated nitrogen-doped carbon coating. The relatively uniform and stable coated nitrogen-doped carbon layer restrains the volume change and agglomeration of the electrode during cycling. Therefore, this polydopamine-derived nitrogen-doped carbon coating approach developed here represents a promising technique to improve the electrochemical properties of NVP or to design new electrode materials.
