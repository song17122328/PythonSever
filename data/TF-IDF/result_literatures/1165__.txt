Vanadium  substituted  LiTi2(PO4)3  (LTP)  samples  of  composition  of  Li1–x[Ti2–xVx](PO4)3  (x = 0⋅0,  0⋅05, 0⋅10 and 0⋅15) have been prepared by solid-state reaction method. XRD data for these compositions indicated  the  formation  of  phase  pure  materials  of  rhombohedral  structure  with  space  group  3R c   (167).   Microstructural  studies  by  scanning  electron  microscope  indicated  particle  size  in  the  range  of  0⋅5–1 µm.  Electrochemical impedance  studies showed  that ionic  conductivity  is  high for  x = 0⋅10 composition.  a.c.  and  d.c.  conductivity  results  up  to  573 K  are  in  accordance  with  the  Jonscher’s  power  law.  Cyclic  voltammetry  study showed its electrochemical stability in the voltage range from 0⋅5 to 3 ⋅5 V. 

Many researchers are concentrating on finding high energy  density and long life solid-state lithium-ion batteries using  solid electrolytes (Birke et al 1999; Dhivya et al 2013) to  power  several  portable  electronic  devices  such  as  cell  phones,  laptops,  digital  cameras,  etc  (Bruce  et  al  2008;  Ellis  et  al  2010;  Goodenough  and  Kim  2010).  Since  no  other  cations  except  H+  can  penetrate  easily  into  solids  than Li+, the study  of rechargeable Li batteries has been  actively pursued since 1970s with lithium insertion electrodes (Hong 1976; Aono et al 1990; Kasturi Rangan and  Gopalakrishnan 1994) in the form of layered LiCoO2 and  spinel  type  LiMn2O4.  On  the  other  hand,  NASICON  [Na3Zr2  (SiO4)2(PO4)]  structured  materials  have  been   explored  because  of  their  high  ionic  conductivity,  low  thermal expansion coefficient and low thermal conductivity (Goodenough  et  al 1976). NASICON-type materials  (isostructural  with  NaZr2(PO4)3)  are  good  ionic  conductors  with  negligible  electronic  conductivity  and  they   are  stable in  air (Kosova  et  al 2008).  LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP)   (Xia  and  Luo  2009)  is  one  of  the  most  promising  solid  electrolyte with high ionic conductivity. LTP structure is  made  up  of  two  TiO6  octahedra  linked  with  three  PO4  tetrahedra via oxygen sharing. Lithium is present in two  different  types  of  interstitials  formed  by  six  and  eight  oxygen  atoms,  respectively.  These  interstitials   arranged alternatively along the conduction channels provide  a  three-dimensional  network  for  Li-ion  transport.  

In order to improve the conductivity and electrochemical  properties  of  these  materials  several  approaches  have  been  developed  in  terms  of  substitution  of  ions  such   as  Al,  Zr,  Fe,  La,  Mn  in  Ti  site  or  by  increasing  Li   content in the unit cell or by generating oxygen vacancies  in  the  lattice  (Kazakevicius  et  al  2008;  Chen  et  al   2011). The present paper describes the effect of V5+ substitution  in  the  form  of  Li1–x[Ti2–xVx](PO4)3  on  the  electrochemical  properties  of  lithium  titanium  phosphate  material. 

Li1–x[Ti2–xVx](PO4)3  samples  with  x = 0⋅0,  0⋅05,  0⋅1  and  0⋅15 are synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction  method.  Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Li2CO3,  TiO2,  NH4H2PO4  and  V2O5  for  each  composition  are  finely  ground in an agate mortar in the presence of methanol for  6 h  to  obtain  homogeneous  mixture.  The  powders  are  then calcined at 900 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 5 °C  per  min.  White  coloured  calcined  powders  are  pressed  into  pellets  using  PVA  as  binder  and  the  pellets  are   sintered at 1323 K for 2 h on Pt foil.    Phase  identification  of  sintered  powders  has  been   performed on D8 ADVANCE diffractometer of BRUKER  AXS  with  CuKα1  radiation  (λ = 1⋅5406 Å)  in  the  2θ  range from 10 to 70° in steps of 0⋅02°. Experimental densities  of  LTP  and  vanadium  doped  LTP  pellets  are  measured  at  room  temperature  using  standard  Archimedes  principle.  Morphologies  of  fractured  surfaces  of  pellets  are  examined  with  scanning  electron  microscopy  on JEOL-JSM 6610LV apparatus. Raman spectra are recorded  on  a  RAMAN  HORIBA  JOBIN  YVON-LABRAM-HR  800  Raman  spectrometer  in  the  frequency  range  of  50– 1200 cm–1. Ionic conductivity studies are made on pellets  of  12 mm  diameter  and  1⋅5–2⋅5 mm  thickness  and  the  measurements are carried out on a HIOKI 3532-50 LCR  HITESTER  LCR  meter  in  the  frequency  range  from  50 Hz to 1 MHz and in the temperature range from 313 to  573 K.  Electronic  conductivities  are  noted  using  digital  multimeter  by  MT  4090  LCR/ESR  meter  in  the  temperature range from 303 to 523 K. In order to understand the  electrochemical  window  of  the  solid-state  electrolyte  LTP,  a  simple  method  of  cyclic  voltammetry  has  been  carried  out.  The  active  material  is  coated  on  steel  foil  (cell) and then it is placed in Swagelok set up containing  1M  LiPF6  dissolved  in  ethylene  carbonate and dimethyl  carbonate  (1 : 1  volumetric  ratio).  Lithium  metal  is  used  as  both  counter and reference  electrodes. The  entire  cell  set  up  is  assembled  in  an  argon-filled  glove  box  and  tested  with biologic potentiostat/galvanostat model VMP3  at  a  scan  rate  of  0⋅1 mV/s  for  three  cycles  between  0⋅5  and  3⋅5 V.  Lithium  titanium  phosphate  was  originally  studied  for  using  it  as  a  solid-state  electrolyte  and  is  found to react at about 2⋅5 V vs pure lithium in the cyclic  voltammetry study (Wessells et al 2011). 

XRD patterns of Li1–x[Ti2–xVx](PO4)3 powders sintered at  1050 °C  for  2 h  are  shown  in  figure  1.  XRD  pattern  at this  temperature  corresponds  to  phase  pure  compounds  with  rhombohedral  structure  and  all  the  observed  peaks  could  be  indexed  as  per  the  JCPDS  Card  No.  35-0754  (LiTi2(PO4)3). The  phase  formed in  figure 1  is  in agreement with XRD pattern for LTP indicating the formation  of single phase compounds. Unit cell parameters are calculated  using  UNITCELL  software  (Unit-Cell  software,  1995)  and  the  values  are  shown  in  table  1.  Lattice   parameters  of  LTP  calculated  from XRD  data and listed  in  table  1  agree  with  earlier  reports  of  crystallographic  data  (Wang  et  al  2003;  JCPDS  Card  No.  35-754).  The  lattice parameters are decreasing with increasing x value  in LTP except for x = 0⋅1. Corresponding peak shift (for  1 1 3)  is  observed  as  shown  in  inset  of  figure  1.  From  table 1, it is also observed that the experimental densities  increased  with  increasing  dopant  concentration  in  LTP.  Colour  of  vanadium  doped  samples  after  calcination/  sintering  is  light  green  and  as  vanadium  concentration  increased  the  colour  intensity  also  increased  from  light  green to thick green.    Raman spectra of LTP and vanadium doped LTP samples are shown in figure 2 from which it can be seen that  three intense-symmetric  stretching modes appear at  967,  986,  1002 cm–1  along  with  two  other  antisymmetric  stretching  modes  at  1091  and  1121 cm–1.  The  peak  at  1002 cm–1  is  due  to  the  symmetric  stretching  mode  of  PO3 – while the peaks at 443 and 430 cm–1 are due to the  symmetric bending modes. Bands below 350 cm–1 are due  to external modes and are difficult to be assigned because  of  mixing.

Figure 5 depicts  variation  of  a.c.  conductivity  as a  function  of  frequency  at  different  temperatures  for  LTP  and  Vdoped  LTP  samples.  It  is  clear  from  the  figure  that  the  materials  at  low  frequencies  exhibit  dispersion  phenomena.  Ionic  conductivity  increases  with  increase  in  frequency  and  temperature  in  all  the  doped  samples.  The  low-frequency  dispersion  has  been  attributed  to  the  a.c.  conductivity  whereas  the  frequency-independent  plateau  region  in  the  conductivity  pattern  corresponds  to  d.c.  conductivity of the material sample.  Ionic  conductivities  of  3⋅02 × 10–4,  4⋅26 × 10–4  and    5⋅99 × 10–5 S/cm are  observed  for  x = 0⋅05, 0⋅1 and  0⋅15  doped  LTP  samples,  respectively  at  room  temperature.  But  all  the  vanadium  doped  samples  showed  high  ionic  conductivity  than  LTP  (7⋅20 × 10–5 S/cm).  These  results  showed that the ionic conductivity is high for V (x = 0⋅1)  doped  LTP.  Table  2  shows  ionic  conductivity  values  of  LTP  and  vanadium  doped  LTP  materials  at  different   temperatures.  From  this table  it is  observed  that  in  each  composition the ionic conductivity is increasing with increasing frequency and temperature.    Figure  6  shows  Arrhenius  a.c.  conductivity  plots  for  Li1–xTi2–xVx (PO4)3. From the figure it is observed that the  ionic  conductivity  continuously  increased  from  room  temperature to high temperatures, which are tabulated in  table 2. The plots between log σ and 1000/T K are found  to  be  very  nearly  linear  obeying  the  Arrhenius  relation.  The activation energies for a.c. conductivities in different  temperature  regions  have  been  obtained  by  measuring  slope of the curves and using the relation, where  σ0 is a pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation  energy, k is the Boltzmann’s constant and T is the absolute  temperature.  The  activation  energy  values  of  ionic  conduction  are  0⋅29,  0⋅30  and  0⋅31 eV  for  V  (x = 0⋅05,  0⋅10 and 0⋅15) doped LTP samples, respectively.    The  measured  d.c.  conductivities  are  8⋅60 × 10–9,  1⋅22 × 10–8  and  4⋅30 × 10–9 S/cm  for  V = 0⋅05,  0⋅1  and  0⋅15 doped LTP materials, respectively.

Vanadium  substitution  into  LTP  showed  some  noticeable  changes   on  asymmetric  stretching  modes.  All  the  high  intense  peaks  got  slightly  shifted  to  lower  wavenumber  side   with  a  simultaneous  decrease  in  intensity  of  peaks  at  1091 and 1121 cm–1 due to some local disordering about  PO3 – ions as vanadium is inserted into the titanium site of  LTP.    Figure  3  shows  SEM  images  of  fractured  surfaces  of  pellets  of  LTP  and  vanadium  doped  LTP  sintered  at  1050 °C for 2 h. From SEM micrographs, it can be noticed  that the grain size considerably increased with increase in  vanadium  content  with  certain  degree  of  porosity.  In   figure 4, Cole–Cole plots for x = 0⋅05 doped LTP shows   a  broadened  semicircle  in  the  high  frequency  region  at  low  temperature  and  size  of  the  semicircle  decreased   with  increasing  temperature. 

Figure 7 shows cyclic  voltammogram  of  Li0⋅90Ti1⋅90V0⋅10(PO4)3  sample.  Initially  the reduction peaks are observed at 1⋅8 V, but the reduction peaks are stabilized at 2⋅41 V. The oxidation peaks are  observed at 2⋅52 V. The difference between reduction and  oxidation  voltages  is  0⋅13 V.  The  redox  voltage  difference  of  0⋅13 V  for  vanadium  dopant  is  less  than  that observed  for  LiTi2  (PO4)3  which  is  0⋅24 V.  The  peak   intensities  and  electrochemical  reactivity  of  vanadium  doped  samples  is  higher  than  that  of  LTP.  This  shows  that the  electrochemical  properties  of  LTP are improved  with vanadium doping. 

Powders of different compositions corresponding to Li1–x  Ti2–xVx (PO4)3 (x = 0⋅0, 0⋅5, 0⋅1 and 0⋅15) have been prepared  by  conventional  solid-state reaction method.  XRD  patterns  of  LTP  heat  treated  at  1050 °C  for  2 h  showed  formation of phase pure LTP of rhombohedral symmetry  with  space  group  3R c   (167).  Vanadium-doping  in  LTP  led  to  observable  shift  of  high  intense  bands  to  low  wavenumber  side  along  with  an  increase  in  intensity  of  peaks  at  1091,  1121 cm–1  in  the  Raman  spectra.  SEM  micrographs showed increased grain size of samples with  increase  in  vanadium  content.  The  ionic  conductivity  at  room  temperature  is  4⋅26 × 10–4 S/cm.  A.c.  conductivity  studies  indicated  that  V  (x = 0⋅1)  has  resulted  in  high  conductivity  compared  to  0⋅05  and  0⋅15.  The  measured  d.c.  conductivity  for  V  (x = 0⋅05)  is  1⋅22 × 10–8 S/cm.  From cyclic voltammetry results it is observed that vanadium doping concentration of x = 0⋅1 is good for enhancing the electrochemical properties of LTP.
