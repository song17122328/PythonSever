New trivalent ion conducting solid electrolytes with NASICON type structure, [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3, were successfully developed and their ion conducting behaviors were investigated. Among the [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 series prepared, the highest ion conductivity was obtained for [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 (x = 0.8). The trivalent ion conductivity was approximately four times higher than that of cerium (Ce3+ ) ion conducting (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3, and the values exceeded the region of the representative divalent oxide anion conductors such as yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ) at temperatures below 500 © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the solid electrolyte ﬁeld, many kinds of mono and divalent ions have been well known as migrating ion species in solids, and some of them have been already commercialized for chemical gas sensors. In contrast, trivalent cations have been considered to be extremely poor migrants in solids due to their strong electrostatic interaction with the surrounding counter anions of the framework constituents. In 1995, the trivalent cation conduction in solids has been ﬁrst reported for the M2(WO4)3 (M = Al, Sc, Y, and Er–Lu) tungstate series with the quasi-layered Sc2(WO4)3 type structure [1]. After the discovery of the M2(WO4)3 solid electrolytes, R3+ cation conducting R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R = Sc, Y, and Eu–Lu) phosphates with NASICON type structure (NASICON is the Na super ionic conductor, which has a three-dimensional network structure suitable for ion conduction) were also developed [2–4]. 
While various trivalent cation species including rare earth ions have been demonstrated to conduct in solids so far, cerium (Ce3+ ) ion conducting solids have not been developed since cerium ion is considered to be an unsuitable migrating ion species due to both the appearance of an electronic conduction by the valence change of cerium and large ionic radius. However, we have succeeded in developing a novel trivalent cerium ion conductor, (CexZr1−x)4/(4−x)Nb(PO4)3 (x = 0.1) with the NASICON type structure in 2002, by strictly selecting the constituent ions [5]. While the trivalent cerium ion has been demonstrated to conduct in solids, the conductivity was still low for a practical application use.
In this paper, for the purpose of enhancing the trivalent ion conductivity toward the practical application range of σ > −3 S·cm −1, the lattice size of (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 10 phosphates was expanded by substituting the cerium ion (0.115 nm) [6] in (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 with larger trivalent ion, La3+ (0.1172 nm) [6], and the ion conducting properties in [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 were investigated.
[(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 were prepared by mixing a stoichiometric amount of Ce2(SO4)3·8H2O, La(NO3)3·6H2O, ZrO2, Nb2O5, and (NH4)2HPO4 in an ◦ C agate mortar. The mixed powder was heated at 1000 C for 12 h in for 6 h, 1200 air. The samples obtained were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu-K␣ radiation (MultiFlex Rigaku). The XRD data were collected by a ◦ step-scanning method in the 2θ range between 10 and 70 ◦ with a step width of 0.04 . For the electrical conductivity measurements, the samples were pressed into pellets and sintered at 1300 C for 12 h. The platinum layer was formed on both center surfaces of the sintered sample. The ac conductivity measurements were carried out by a complex impedance method in a frequency range between 5 and 13 MHz (Hewlett-Packard precision LCR meter, 4192A) at the temperatures between 300 and 600 C. 
The time dependencies of the dc conductivity were investigated by passing the dc current of 1 ␮A between the two Pt mesh electrodes sandwiching the sample, and monitoring the dc voltage as a function of time in both oxygen (Po2: 105 Pa) and nitrogen (Po2: 40 Pa) atmospheres. For the purpose of directly identifying the migrating species, dc electrolysis was carried out by applying a dc voltage of 3 V for 100 h at 700 C with an ion-blocking Pt bulk electrodes. After the electrolysis, the cathodic surface of the sample was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-800, Hitachi) measurements and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA-1500, Shimazu).
La3+ (0.1172 nm; six-coordinate) [6] was replaced for Ce3+ (0.115 nm; six-coordinate) [6], and the solid solution was successfully formed.
Fig. 2 depicts the relationship between the electrical conductivity and the La content in [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb (PO4)3 at 600 C. The conductivity increases with the La content, and the [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 (x = 0.8) solid exhibited the maximum conductivity of 1.8 × 10 −1. This phenomenon clearly indicates that the sample with x = 0.8 possesses the most suitable lattice size for trivalent cation conduction in the [(Ce1−xLax)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 solid.
For the purpose of identifying the migrating species in [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3, which shows the highest conductivity, the ac conductivity dependencies on the oxygen pressure was investigated at 600 C, and the result is shown in Fig. 3 with the corresponding data for the Ce3+ ion conducting (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3. In the case of (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3, the conductivity increases at the −5 Pa, indicating an apoxygen partial pressure lower than 10 pearance of n-type electronic conducting characteristics. 
In order to determine the migrating cation species in [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3, a dc electrolysis was performed by applying a dc voltage of 3 V which is higher than the decomposition voltage (approximately 1.5 V) of [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 at 700 C for 100 h. Here, the conducting cation generated at the anodic side by the decomposition of the sample migrates from anode to cathode direction. Deposits were observed on the cathodic surface after the electrolysis. The EPMA spot analysis was carried out for the deposits and the result is tabulated in Table 1. Both the content of cerium and lanthanum elements in the deposits were found to increase approximately three times compared with that of the sample before electrolysis. These results suggest that both cerium and lanthanum ions migrate in the sample, therefore, the [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 electrolyte is identiﬁed to be a multi cationic conductor of both cerium and lanthanum ions.
For the purpose of enhancing the trivalent ion conductivity in the NASICON type phosphate, the lattice size of (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 was expanded by replacing the Ce ion site in (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 for larger La3+ . The highest trivalent ion conductivity was obtained [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3, which was apfor proximately four times as high as that of Ce3+ ion conducting (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 electrolyte and reaches −3 S·cm −1, and the practical application range of σ > 10 the values exceed the conductivity range of the oxide anion conductors such as YSZ and CSZ at temperatures below 500 C. Furthermore, the stability in a lower oxygen partial pressure atmosphere was highly improved in comparison to that of (Ce0.1Zr0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3. 
Since the [(Ce0.2La0.8)0.1Zr0.9]40/39Nb(PO4)3 solid solution is chemically stable in such a wide oxygen partial pressure region with showing the high trivalent ion conductivity, the application for various electrochemical devices is greatly expected in the future.
