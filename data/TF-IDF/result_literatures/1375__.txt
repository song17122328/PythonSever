Recently,  NASICON-related  compounds,  A3M2(XO4)3 (A  =  Li,  Na; M;  Fe,  Cr,  Ti,  V;  X  =  P,  As,  S)  have  gained  much  attention  as  active cathode  materials  due  to  their  superior  properties:  favorable  redox properties,  good  ionic  conductivity  and  low  cost  [1–3].  The  NASICON  structure  consists  of  a  three-dimensional  framework  built up  by  a  framework  of  FeO6 octahedra  and  XO4 tetrahedra  sharing  all  vertices  [4,5].  Each  FeO6 octahedron  is  surrounded  by  six XO4 tetrahedra  and  each  tetrahedron  is  linked  to  four  FeO6 polyhedra,  forming  the  [Fe2(XO4)3]3− open  framework  [6].  Monoclinic Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and  rhombohedral  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 have  two   similar [Fe2(PO4)3]  frameworks  in  the  ac-plane.  The  different  distribution of  alkaline  cations  within  the  structure  is  responsible  for  the  different  crystal  symmetries  [7].

Masquelier  et  al.  [8]  found  that  optimized  electrodes  based on  the  monoclinic  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase  cycle  remarkably  well in  the  3.5–2.0  V  potential  range.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  NASICON  compounds  can  be  enhanced  by  partial substitution  of  iron  by  other  transition  metals.  For  example, Li3Fe1.8Ti0.1Mn0.1(PO4)3 shows  a  speciﬁc  capacity  of  123.3  mAh/g for  the  ﬁrst  discharge  at  C/20  and  90.8  mAh/g  for  the  20th  cycle  at C/2,  and  shows  better  conductivity  as  compared  with  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [9].   Also,  Li1.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 shows  lower  speciﬁc  capacity  in

Several  cathode  materials  containing  chromium  have  been proposed  in  the  literature,  such  as  chromium  oxide  (CrOx)  [11], Cr8O21[12],  and  LiMnxCr1−xO2 [13].  Nevertheless,  the  toxicity  of chromium  imposes  the  use  of  this  transition  metal  in  low  concentrations,  e.g.,  by  using  only  partially  substituted  materials  [13], thin  coating  ﬁlms  [14]  or  doping  [15].  Chromium  substitution  in positive  electrodes  such  as  LiMn2O4 has  been  previously  reported [16].  Beneﬁcial  effects,  including  extra-capacity  at  high  voltage  [17] or  suppression  of  the  cooperative  Jahn–Teller  distortion  [18]  have been  evidenced.

In  this  work,  two  new  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 and  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 ≤ ≤ (0    1)  series  have  been  synthesized  by  a  low-cost,  wet  method   x  for  their  use  as  cathode  materials  in  lithium-ion  batteries.  The  aim of  the  study  is  to  evaluate  the  validity  of  a  precipitation  method to  synthesize  the  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 series  and  ion  exchange  to prepare  the  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 series.  The  effects  of  chromium  substitution  on  the  local  structure  and  electrochemical  behavior  in lithium  test  cell  are  examined.

Known  volumes  of  0.4  M  Fe(NO3)3·9H2O  and  Cr(NO3)3·9H2O solutions  were  mixed  in  a  beaker  according  to  the  metal  ratio in  the  solid  product.  Then,  the  stoichiometric  amount  of  a  0.6  M NaH2PO4·H2O  solution  was   added  dropwise  into  the  beaker  containing  the  transition  metals.  The  mixture  was  vigorously  stirred  to obtain  a  clear  dissolution  and  neutralized  by  adding  concentrated

ammonia.  The  resulting  slurry  was  vigorously  stirred  to  ensure  a homogeneous  pH  in  the  whole  volume.  The  solvent  was  evaporated  on  a  hot  plate  under  continuous  stirring  and  ﬁnally  dried into  an  oven  at  80 ◦C  overnight.  The  precursors  were  ground  and annealed  at  600 ◦C  under  air  atmosphere  for  10  h  with  a  heating rate  of  2 ◦C/min.

Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 samples  were  prepared  by  ion  exchange  processes.  For  this  purpose,  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 powders  were  added into  a  concentrated  solution  of  LiNO3 with  Lisolution/Nasolid >  10 molar  ratio.  The  slurry  was  continuously  stirred  at  room  temperature  for  24  h.  The  solid  residua  were  centrifuged  and  washed  with deionized  water  several  times  to  remove  NaNO3 and  excess  of LiNO3.  The  whole  process  was  repeated  three  times  to  ensure  a high  efﬁciency. The  XRD  patterns  were  recorded  using  a  Siemens  D5000  diffrac(2)   =  0.040◦ step  size,  and tometer  in  the  10–70◦2 20  s  step  time.  The  Rietveld  analyses  were  performed  using  the Fullprof  software. 57Fe  Mossbauer  spectroscopy  studies  were  carried  out  at  room  temperature  with  an  EG&G  constant  accelerator spectrometer  in  transmission  mode.  The  source  was 57Co  in  a  Rh matrix.  The  velocity  scale  was  calibrated  from  the  magnetic  sextet  of  a  high  purity  iron  foil  absorber.  Experimental  data  were ﬁtted  to  Lorentzian  lines  by  using  a  least  squares  based  method  4)2 test. [19].  The  quality  of  the  ﬁt  was  controlled  by  the  usual  ␣-Fe All  the  isomer  shifts  are  given  relative  to  the  center  of  the  spectrum  at  room  temperature.  Transmission  electron  microscopy (TEM)  images  were  recorded  in  a  PHILIPS  CM-10  microscope.

The  electrode  material  was  prepared  by  mixing  the  active  materials,  carbon  black  and  PVDF  (polyvinylidene  ﬂuoride)  in  a  75:15:10 ratio,  respectively.  A  slurry  was  formed  by  adding  N-methyl-2pyrrolidone  which  was  subsequently  ball  milled  at  500  rpm  for 30  min.  The  working  electrode  material  was  supported  on  a  9  mm aluminum  plate  and  dried  at  120 ◦C  under  vacuum.  Then,  the  electrodes  were  kept  overnight  in  an  argon  atmosphere  at  250 ◦C in  order  to  improve  the  polymer  characteristics.  The  cells  were assembled  inside  an  MBraun  glove  box  under  argon  atmosphere. Swagelok  type  cells  were  used  with  lithium  foil  (diameter  of  9  mm) as  an  auxiliary  electrode.  A  solution  of  LiPF6 in  (EC:DEC)  supported on  glass  ﬁber  separator  (GF/A-Whatman)  was  used  as  electrolyte. The  lithium  cells  were  galvanostatically  cycled  between  2  V  and 4.2  V.  The  charge  and  discharge  rate  was  expressed  as  C/n,  n  being the  number  of  hours  needed  for  the  reaction  with  1  F  mol−1 in  n  h at  the  applied  current  intensity.  Values  of  C/10  and  C/40  were  used. Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  was  carried  out  in an  Autolab  PGSTAT12  system.  For  this  purpose,  the  electrode  was assembled  in  a  three-electrode  Swagelok  type  cell  and  was  discharged  to  the  lower  cut  off  voltage  by  passing  a  constant  current (C/10)  between  the  working  electrode  and  the  counter  electrode (Li).  A  quasi-equilibrium  system  was  achieved  by  relaxing  the  cell for  at  least  12  h  corresponding  to  a  cell  potential  of  10  mV/h.  Eventually,  the  impedance  spectra  were  recorded  versus  a  Li  reference electrode.  An  AC  voltage  signal  of  5  mV   was  applied  from  100  KHz to  2  mHz.

The  XRD  patterns  of  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 (0 

≤   1)  are  shown in  Fig.  1.  The  patterns  are  characterized  by  narrow  reﬂections corresponding  to  well-crystallized  phases.  Most  of  the  reﬂections could  be  indexed  to  monoclinic  Na3Fe2(PO4)3 with  space  group C2c.  Several  authors  have  identiﬁed,  in  both  single-crystal  [20]  and powder  samples  [21],  a  superstructure  with  a  superlattice  unit   =  90.14(1)◦ cell  a  =  15.128(1) ˚A,  b  =  8.721(1) ˚A,  c  =  21.564(1) ˚A,  and  ˇ in  the  space  group  C2/c.  Several  peaks  (e.g.,  in  the  13◦ and  37◦ regions)  reveal  that  superstructure  is  present  in  Cr-containing

Fig.  1.  XRD  patterns  of  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3;  x  =  0,  0.2,  0.4,  0.6,  0.8  and  1.0.

samples.  Nevertheless,  impurities  are  clearly  evident  by  some  weak peaks  at  ca.  17◦ and  32◦ in  samples  with  x  =  0.8  and  1.0  (marked with  an  asterisk  in  Fig.  1),  which  are  ascribable  to  some  of  the  most intense  reﬂections  of  Na3Cr3(PO4)4 (JCDS-ICDD  35-0043).  The  precise  quantiﬁcation  of  impurities  is  difﬁcult,  due  to  the  coexistence of  the  supperlattice,  and  the  absence  of  data  on  the  atomic  coordinates  in  this  superstructure,  which  prevent  an  accurate  Rietveld analysis.  A  simpliﬁed  analysis  of  the  position  of  the  peaks  of  the sublattice  evidenced  the  effect  of  Cr  substitution.  Fig.  2  shows  a decrease  of  the  unit  cell  parameters  on  increasing  chromium  content  that  may   be  ascribed  to  the  small  difference  in  ionic  radius between  Fe3+ (0.645 ˚A)  and  Cr3+ (0.615 ˚A)  [21].  The  unambiguous presence  of  impurities  at  x  =  1.0  can  be  responsible  for  the  constancy of  the  c  parameter  after  x  =  0.8,  evidencing  the  solubility  limit  of chromium  in  the  structure.

samples  were recorded  in  order  to  obtain  accurate  information  about  the  oxidation  state  and  local  environment  of  iron  as  probe  atoms.  The

spectra  are  characterized  by  one  doublet  signal  with  isomer  shift value  corresponding  to  the  presence  of  Fe3+ ions,  suggesting a  unique  site  for  iron  atoms  in  the  structure.  The  splitting  of the  signal  is  indicative  of  an  anisotropic  distribution  of  charges surrounding  the  probe  atom.  The  introduction  of  Cr  atoms  does not  involve  signiﬁcant  changes  in  the  spectrum  proﬁle  (Fig.  3a). The  hyperﬁne  parameters  of  these  spectra  were  calculated  from their  decomposition  in  lorentzian  proﬁles.  The  results  evidence  a slight  decrease  of  the  isomer  shift  values  as  Cr  content  is  increased (Fig.  3b).  This  effect  can  be  interpreted  in  terms  of  the  lower electronegativity  of  chromium  as  compared  with  iron.  Thus,  the introduction  of  chromium  in  the  phosphate  framework  leads  to  an

increase  of  electrons  available  for  the  neighbors  Fe-O  bonds.  Consequently,  the  population  of  electrons  surrounding  the  iron  atoms R/R  ratio,  a would  increase  and,  due  to  the  negative  sign  of  the  diminution  of  the  isomer  shift  values  is  observed.  Contrarily,  a  clear tendency  could  not  be  discerned  from  the  analysis  of  the  changes in  quadrupole  splitting  vs.  transition  metal  composition  (Fig.  3c), which  is  probably  indicative  of  a  random  distribution  of  iron  and chromium  atoms  that  averages  the  anisotropic  distribution  of charges  surrounding  the  probe  atom.

Lithium  cells  assembled  with  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 samples were  discharged  and  charged  for  several  cycles  (Fig.  4).  During  the  electrochemical  process  Na+ deinsertion  and  further  Li+

insertion  from  the  electrolyte  take  place  [22].  Discharge  and  charge curves  are  characterized  by  two  insertion  quasi-plateaus  of  similar extent.  Masquelier  et  al.  suggested  a  three  phase  system  involving  the  existence  of  an  intermediate  composition  [23].  This  effect is  preserved  in  chromium  substituted  solids.  Also,  it  is  clearly observed  that  the  partial  substitution  of  Fe  by  low  Cr  contents  in Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 and  Na3Fe1.6Cr0.4(PO4)3 decreases  the  polarization  between  charge  and  discharge  branches  as  compared  to Na3Fe2(PO4)3.  Also,  1.6  and  1.5  Li  could  be  inserted  in  the  framework  of  Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 and  Na3Fe1.6Cr0.4(PO4)3 respectively during  the  ﬁrst  discharge.  In  contrast,  only  1.25  Li  were  inserted in  Na3Fe2(PO4)3.  Nevertheless,  the  electrochemical  performance becomes  poorer  for  samples  with  Cr  contents  higher  than  0.6,  as shown  in  Fig.  4.  These  results  agree  fairly  well  with  recent  reports in  which  the  beneﬁcial  effect  of  Cr  doping  in  LiFePO4 has  been demonstrated  [24].  Synchrotron-based  in  situ  XRD  analysis  clearly showed  that  Cr  doping  facilitated  the  phase  transformation  during cycling  and  thus  improved  the  rate  performances  of  LiFePO4/C.  Also, some  authors  have  conﬁrmed  an  enhancement  of  the  electronic

Fig.  5.  XRD  patterns  of  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3;  x  =  0,  0.2,  0.4,  0.6,  0.8  and  1.0.

conductivity  up  to  eight  orders  of  magnitude  from  pure  LiFePO4 to  Li1−3xCrxFePO4 with  x  =  0.01  and  0.03  [25].  Contrarily,  higher Cr  contents  do  not  lead  to  a  further  enhancement  of  the  electrochemical  performance.  This  result  is  not  surprising  and  is  the  direct consequence  of  the  electrochemical  inactivity  of  chromium  in  the range  of  potentials  here  studied.  Among  the  various  Cr  substituted samples,  Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 offers  the  highest  speciﬁc  capacity  for the  ﬁrst  discharge  of  88.3  mAh/g.  However,  these  cathode  materials  exhibit  reduced  speciﬁc  capacity  and  rapid  capacity  fading,  most probably  as  a  consequence  of  the  large  Na+ size  as  compared  to  Li+, leading  to  a  poor  ionic  diffusion.

The  crystal  structure  of  monoclinic  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 consists of  a  3D  framework  in  which  FeO6 octahedra  and  PO4 tetrahedra are  connected  to  each  other  through  all  their  vertices.  In  the  real NASICON  structure,  the  arrangement  of  MO6 and  XO4 polyhedra results  in  an  open  structure  which  allows  fast  alkali-ion  diffusion through  the  bottlenecks  deﬁned  by  eight-member  rings  [23].  In order  to  enhance  the  electrochemical  behavior  of  these  compounds, ion  exchange  reactions  were  used  to  replace  the  alkaline  ions.  The efﬁciency  of  the  ion  exchange  process  was   checked  by  Energy  Dispersive  Spectroscopy  (EDS).  The  analysis  clearly  shows  the  effective reduction  of  the  sodium  content.  It  leads  to  a  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 nominal  stoichiometry.  The  EDS  results  are  shown  as  Na/P  ratios  in Table  1.

The  XRD  patterns  of  the  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 samples  prepared by  ion  exchange  of  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 are  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The peaks  observed  in  the  patterns  can  be  indexed  as  rhombohedral R ¯3  [26].  Again,  the  peaks  located Li3Fe2(PO4)3 with  space  group  around  17◦ and  particularly,  at  32◦ 2   correspond  to  Na3Cr3(PO4)4 impurities.  In  addition,  the  low  atomic  scattering  of  lithium  prevents  the  detailed  Rietveld  reﬁnement  of  the  patterns.  However, the  presence  of  impurities  is  unambiguous  for  x  =  0.8  and  1.0, which  may   indicate  the  solubility  limit  of  chromium  in  the  structure.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  impurities  may  result  from microinhomogeneities  during  the  preparation  of  the  samples,  and

thus  their  presence  may   not  be  directly  related  with  solubility  limits.

A  continuous  decrease  in  the  unit  cell  parameters  was  observed on  increasing  chromium  content,  except  for  the  sample  with  x  =  1 (Table  2).  These  results  agree  with  those  of  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 where  the  partial  substitution  of  Fe  by  Cr  does  not  change  the crystal  structure  and  has  a  reduced  effect  on  the  lattice  dimensions. Fig.  6  shows  TEM  images  of  Na3Fe2(PO4)3,  Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 and  Li3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3.  A  large  inhomogeneity  is  observed  in  both particle  size  and  shape.  For  Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and  Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 samples,  particle  sizes  were  in  the  125–750  nm  and  200–850  nm ranges,  respectively,  in  agreement  with  Fig.  6a  and  b.  For  the Li3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 sample  (Fig.  6c),  it  can  be  seen  that  the  edges  of the  particles  are  more  rounded  as  compared  to  Na3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3. Most  probably,  the  continuous  stirring  during  the  ion  exchange process  polished  the  sharp  edges  of  the  particles.

The  Mössbauer  spectra  of  ion  exchanged  samples  are  characterized  by  a  low  splitting  signal  (Fig.  7a).  This  proﬁle  is  similar  to  that obtained  by  Thomas  et  al.  on  rombohedral  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [7].   The  isomer   shifts  reveal  that  the  oxidation  state  of  iron  remains  unchanged upon  the  chemical  exchange  of  the  alkaline  ions.  However,  metal substitution  has  a  signiﬁcant  effect  on  isomer  shift.  The  observed decrease  on  increasing  Cr  content  (Fig.  7b)  may   be  interpreted  in terms  of  the  different  electronegativity  of  chromium  and  iron.  On the  other  hand,  the  effective  reduction  of  the  quadrupolar  splitting on  increasing  Cr  content  (Fig.  7c)  is  a  direct  proof  of  the  transition from  the  monoclinic  system  to  the  more  symmetric  rhombohedral system.  Thus,  the  presence  of  chromium  leads  to  a  more  isotropic distribution  of  charges  around  the  probe  atom.

From  Fig.  8,  it  is  clear  that  the  electrochemical  performance of  the  different  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 samples  improves  signiﬁcantly as  compared  to  the  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 series.  Also,  the  polarization  between  charge  and  discharge  proﬁles  decreased,  and  a higher  Li  content  is  inserted  upon  discharge.  This  improvement can  be  ascribed  to  the  more  open  framework  of  rhombohedral Li3Fe2(PO4)3 which  results  in  the  ease  of  Li  insertion/extraction into/from  the  structure.  Previous  reports  have  shown  that  the  insertion  reaction  proceeds  as  in  a  solid  solution  [25].

Among  the  different  Cr-substituted  samples,  Li3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 shows  the  best  efﬁciency,  as  evidenced  in  Fig.  8b.  Up  to  1.7  Li  per  formula  unit  are  inserted  with  a  speciﬁc  capacity  of  105  mAh/g  for  the ﬁrst  discharge.  These  results  conﬁrm  the  beneﬁcial  effect  of  Cr  substitution  on  the  electrochemical  behavior  and  agree  with  the  results obtained  for  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3.  Thus,  the  sample  with  0.2  Cr  per formula  unit  is  able  to  signiﬁcantly  enhance  the  insertion  capacity as  compared  to  the  non  substituted  sample.  In  addition,  the  cycling efﬁciency  was   evaluated  after  the  ﬁrst  discharge  for  selected  samples.  Thus,  a  75.7%  of  reversibility  was   calculated  for  the  chromium free  sample,  while  96.7%  of  the  capacity  of  the  ﬁrst  cycle  was  recovered  for  Li3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3.  Nevertheless,  larger  Cr  contents  did  not involve  further  improvements  of  the  electrochemical  behavior.  The

≤ rate  capability  of  cathode  materials  with  Cr    0.4  was   also  tested  at a  charge/discharge  rate  of  C/10  (Fig.  9).  It  can  be  seen  from  the  ﬁgure that  the  speciﬁc  capacity  of  the  ﬁrst  discharge  drops  as  increasing in  kinetic  rates  for  all  materials.  However,  Li3Fe1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 has the  capability  to  maintain  the  discharge  capacity  at  97%  after  the ﬁrst  discharge  when  the  rate  is  increased,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9b.  For Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and  Li3Fe1.6Cr0.4(PO4)3,  the  capacity  at  the  ﬁrst  discharge  drops  18%  and  14%,  respectively,  when  the  rates  increase from  C/40  to  C/10.

The  different  kinetic  response  of  samples  with  a  dissimilar  level of  substitution  may   also  explain  the  divergences  in  the  observed electrochemical  performance.  Fig.  10  displays  the  Nyquist  plots obtained  for  selected  compositions.  The  spectra  were  recorded  on pristine  materials  before  lithium  reaction,  and  after  the  ﬁrst  discharge  for  selected  samples.  The  spectra  were  recorded  at  the  end  of the  ﬁrst  discharge.  The  semicircle  observed  at  medium  frequencies is  attributed  to  the  charge  transfer  occurring  when  lithium  migrates through  the  electrode/electrolyte  interphase.  The  depression  of  the semicircles  reveals  a  deviation  from  the  ideal  capacitor  expressed in  terms  of  a  constant-phase  element  (CPE).  The  straight  line  at  low frequencies  relates  to  the  Warburg  impedance  which  interpreted  in terms  of  the  lithium  diffusion  into  the  particles  [27,28].  A  semicircle at  high  frequencies,  ascribable  to  the  lithium  migration  through  a passivating  ﬁlm,  was  not  observed  in  these  samples.  Franger  et  al. have  correlated  the  presence  of  this  second  semicircle  to  the  use of  propylene  carbonate  (PC)  as  a  solvent  component  in  the  electrolyte  composition,  whose  degradation  product  the  formation  of the  polymer  ﬁlm.  The  absence  of  this  organic  solvent  in  our  cells would  justify  the  observed  proﬁle  [29].  These  plots  evidence  that the  substitution  of  iron  by  chromium  leads  to  a  notorious  decrease in  the  electrode  impedance.  It  may   justify  the  improvement  in  the electrochemical  performance  of  Cr  substituted  compounds,  in  spite of  the  lack  of  electroactivity  of  this  transition  metal.

studies  reveal  that  monoclinic  phases  are  obtained  with  a  slightly decrease  in  the  unit  cell  parameters  as  increasing  the  Cr  content. Mössbauer  spectroscopy  evidences  the  presence  of  Fe3+ ions  which isomer  shift  values  slightly  decreased  as  the  Cr  content  increased. This  effect  has  been  correlated  to  changes  in  the  bond  covalence due  to  the  less  electronegative  character  of  chromium  atoms. The  electrochemical  behavior  of  monoclinic  Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 ≤ versus  lithium  showed  that  partial  chromium  substitution  (x    0.4) involves  an  increase  in  capacity  and  a  decrease  in  polarization between  charge  and  discharge  branches.  Nevertheless,  the  electrochemical  performance  becomes  poorer  for  samples  with  Cr contents  higher  than  0.4.  In  order  to  improve  this  behavior,  the  samples  were  subjected  to  an  ion  exchange  process  in  order  to  modify their  compositional  and  structural  properties.

A  rhombohedral  Li3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3 series,  where  (0 ≤  1), were  reaction  of Na3Fe2−xCrx(PO4)3.  Mössbauer  studies  revealed  that  the  oxidation state  of  iron  remains  unchanged  upon  the  chemical  exchange  of the  alkaline  ions.  The  electrochemical  studies  versus  Li  evidenced that  the  partial  substitution  of  low  Cr  contents  improved  the electrochemical  performance  of  Li3Fe2(PO4)3.  The  most  promising performances  corresponded  to  the  sample  nominally  containing 0.2  Cr  per  formula  unit.  For  this  sample,  1.7  Li  ions  per  formula unit  are  inserted  delivering  a  speciﬁc  capacity  of  105  mAh/g after  the  ﬁrst  discharge.  The  remarkable  decrease  in  electrode impedance  for  Cr  substituted  samples  may   counterbalace  the non-electroactivity  of  chromium,  at  least  for  low  contents.
