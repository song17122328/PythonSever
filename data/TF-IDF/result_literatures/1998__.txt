The Nasicon-type family has been the subject of intensive research due to its potential applications as solid electrolyte, electrode material and low thermal expansion ceramics [1 – 9]. Recently, intensive research work was done by Masquelier et al. [10 – 12] on the A3M2(XO4)3 (A = Li, Na; X = P, As) phases. The structure of such materials with a general formula of AxTi2(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional network made up of PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with TiO6 octahedra. In this skeleton, there are interconnected interstitial sites usually labelled M1 and M2 where the A cation is located. The octahedral M1 sites share two faces with two adjacent TiO6 octahedra forming short chains along the hexagonal c-axis, linked to one another by PO4 tetrahedra. The infinite ribbons resulting from this linkage are connected together by the PO4 tetrahedra along directions perpendicular to the c-axis; large ‘‘M2’’ cavities are thus formed.
The structure of Ca0.50Ti2(PO4)3 was first studied by Senbhagaraman et al. [13]. Using the LAZY PULVERIX program, these authors generated powder diffraction patterns. Among the various possible space groups (R3¯ c, R3¯ m, R3¯ and R32), only R3¯ could reproduce the XRD pattern. The structure was determined completely by Mentre et al. [14] who showed that the R3¯ space group gives the best results: Ca2 + ions and vacancies are ordered in the M1 sites. More recently, we synthesised the manganese titanium phosphate Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 [15] and reported that its structure is isotypic with that of Ca0.50Ti2(PO4)3. In all stages of the structural refinement, the Mn2 + ions are supposed to reside only in one of the two possible types of M1 sites, 3a (000); the other, 3b (001/2), was considered to be empty. 
In the scope of our general studies of Mn-Nasicon-type materials [15 – 18], a peculiar Mn2 + ions distribution was recently found in the Mn(0.5 + x)Ti(2   2x)Cr2x(PO4)3 (0 V x V 0.50) system, although the Mn2 + ions occupy only the M1 site. Materials with x V 0.15 compositions crystallise in the R3¯ space group, while those with x>0.15 crystallise in R3¯c. For materials with the R3¯ space group, the M1(3b) site is filled progressively when increasing the Mn2 + amount: 25% of Mn2 + is located on the 3b position of Mn0.60Ti1.80Cr0.20(PO4)3 and 44% for Mn0.65Ti1.70Cr0.30(PO4)3 [18]. This distribution leads to the formation of vacancies in the 3a site. Therefore, the structure of Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 was reconsidered in order to check whether or not the manganese ordering is ideal. In the present study, the occupancy for Mn2 + ions in the 3a and 3b positions was therefore allowed to vary. 
In order to confirm the structural results obtained from X-ray diffraction, a 31P NMR study was carried out to give local information. The structural study was then extended to the Mn(0.5   x)CaxTi2(PO4)3 solid solution. The lithium intercalation in all these materials was then studied.
Initial starting parameters for the Rietveld refinement of Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 were based on those already reported in the R3¯ space group, but the Mn2 + ions were allowed to occupy the two possible M1 sites (3a and 3b) instead of only 3a in the previously reported study [15]. The total manganese content was constrained to 0.5. The reliability factors obtained in this case (RWP = 12.0%; RB = 4.1%) are slightly better than those obtained for only one of the 3a sites occupied by Mn2 + ions (RWP = 12.1%; RB = 4.5%). The results of the refinement are reported in Table 1. A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRD profile is shown in Fig. 1. In this refinement, 0.04 Mn2 + ions are found in the 3b position of the M1 site. Although this occupancy is significantly larger than the standard deviation, the question of its physical meaningfulness arises. 
Several reports in the literature suggest that 31P MAS NMR spectra exhibit separate signals for crystallographically different phosphorus atoms in Nasicon-type structures [22 – 26]. Sobha and Rao [24] the 31P MAS NMR report spectra show only one peak, which is consistent with the occupation by the phosphorus atoms of the 18e position of the rhombohedral R3¯c space group. On the other hand, the spectrum of Na5Ti(PO4)3 presents two peaks corresponding to two crystallographically distinct positions (9d and 9c) for the phosphorus atoms in the rhombohedral R32 space group [24].
Remarkably, these environments lead to NMR lines separated by more than 5 ppm, although only chemical-shift effects occur in these diamagnetic compounds.
M1 sites (3a), all phosphorus atoms have exactly the same surroundings and the absence of paramagnetic ion leads to a single, rather narrow NMR signal. This study clearly shows that in Ca0.50Ti2(PO4)3, Ca2 + ions are completely ordered on the M1 site, whereas, for Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3, the partial ordering of Mn2 + ions over the two positions (3a and 3b) of the M1 sites is confirmed. Note that similar results have been reported for the rhombohedral Nasicon phases Na(1 + x)M(2   x)Inx(PO4)3(M = Ti,Sn,Hf, Zr) (R3¯cspace group) [26]. 
For more structural information about the Li0.50 Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 phase, and since the XRD pattern exhibits a good quality, we have undertaken a structural determination by Rietveld analysis. The starting parameters were based on those obtained for Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3, and two hypotheses were considered for the lithium – manganese distribution.
The Mn2 + ions were first considered to be in the 3a type M1 sites in the R3¯ space group, and the Li + ions to occupy the 3b sites which were almost empty in Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3. As expected, a significant intensity is observed for the (003) and (101) lines contrary to experiment; moreover, the reliability factors are not good.
Mn2 + and Li + ions were then allowed to be statistically distributed over the M1 sites. In this case, two space groups must be considered (R32 and R3¯c). Note that, in the R32 case, the Li + (Mn2 + ) ions are not at the centre of the M1 site. Consequently, two M1 – O distances are expected. This distribution leads to two types of TiO6 octahedra (Ti(1)O6 and Ti(2)O6; Ti being in the 6c position) and also to two types of phosphorus atom (P(1) and P(2) in 9d and 9c positions, respectively). Thus, in the R32 space group, the (003) and (101) diffraction lines are generated. The refinement leads to irregular P – O distances, and the RB value is quite high. The model was, therefore, also dismissed. The Rietveld refinement using the R3¯c space group, with a statistical distribution of Li and Mn atoms within the M1 sites, leads to the best results. 
The fitted XRD profile and the final atomic parameters are given in Fig. 9 and Table 4, respectively. The P – O distances (1.509(2), 1.567(2) A˚ ) match well with those typically observed in Nasicon phosphates. The TiO6 octahedra are slightly distorted, with Ti – O distances of 1.916(3) and 1.948(3) A˚ . This distortion is intermediate between that found in Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 due to the cationic distribution in all M1 sites. The Li(Mn) – O(2) distance is 2.266(2) A˚ , which is smaller than the Mn(3a) – O(1) (2.289(2) A˚ ) and 5(3b) – O(2) (2.350(2) A˚ ) distances found in Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3.This leads to a decrease in the chex. parameter when all M1 sites are fully occupied (i.e. in Li0.50Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3). The presence of the very small (003) and (101) peaks shows that the Li(Mn) distribution on the M1 sites is not completely random. 
In fact, the R3¯ space group, which considers two types of M1 sites, might have been used since the distribution is not ideally random. However, the intensity of the (003) and (101) lines is so weak that no reliable information can be obtained under this hypothesis.
The lithium intercalation study was extended to calcium-substituted phases. The OCV curves obtained for the first discharge, given in Fig. 10 for the x = 0.25 calcium-substituted phase, is quite similar to that obtained for the LiyMn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 system (Fig. 7). In the case of the LiyCa0.50Ti2(PO4)3 system, the relaxation potential in the first step of the intercalation is very sensitive to the conditions imposed for the limit of relaxation. When a very severe criterion (0.1 mV/h) is used, the equilibrium voltage is close to 2.9 V, as in the case of the LiyMn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 system (0 V y V 0.5). This behaviour shows that kinetic limitations play a very important role. In the case of the LiyMn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3 system, the equilibrium is easily reached but the equilibrium cell voltage is significantly lower than that in the other systems.
In order to emphasize the effect of kinetics, the V = f(t) curves are plotted for the three systems: LiyMn0.50Ti2(PO4)3, LiyMn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3 and LiyCa0.50Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 11). In the LiyCa0.50Ti2(PO4)3 system, two steps are clearly shown on the relaxation curves. Just after opening the circuit, there is a tendency to relax around 2.5 V (lithium intercalation into M2 sites) while, after a while, the voltage evolves toward 2.9 V (lithium intercalation into M1 sites). A similar tendency is observed when 0.40 Li is intercalated into Mn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 11b). Fig. 12 shows the XRD patterns of Mn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3 and Li0.50Mn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3. The Bragg peaks clearly shift during lithium intercalation. Note also that the (003) and (101) diffraction peaks have almost disappeared. This also suggests a statistical distribution of Li + and Mn2 + /Ca2 + ions over the M1 sites of Li0.50Mn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3. 
The main result of this study is the disappearance of the Mn(Ca)/5 ordering when lithium is intercalated into the remaining empty sites of the [Mn(0.5   x)Cax]3a [50.5]3bTi2(PO4)3 (0 V x V 0.50) phases. After intercalation of 0.5 Li, the material crystallises in the R3¯c space group and there is only one type of M1 site, which is randomly occupied. As discussed in the following, the migration of a divalent ion is promoted by the intercalation process. In the Nasicon structure, where each M1 site is surrounded by six M2 sites and each M2 site is connected to only two M1 sites, longrangelithiumdiffusionrequiresM2 ! M1 ! M2 ! M1 transfer. If half the M1 sites are occupied in an ordered way by normally immobile cations (Mn2 + or Ca2 + ), long-range lithium diffusion cannot occur. One can thus assume that lithium intercalation is the driving force of divalent cation migration. 
When some of the Mn2 + (Ca2 + ) ions have migrated from the 3a to the 3b sites, long-range lithium diffusion can occur, since percolation of the vacant (or occupied by Li + ions) M1 sites occurs. At first sight, manganese migration from one M1 site to a neighbouring one through the M2 site is very surprising. In fact, as we have recently shown in the structural determination of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 by neutron diffraction, the migration pathway from one M1 site to a neighbouring site can be considered as a succession of seven face-sharing tetrahedra [29]. It is well known that the Mn2 + ions with the t2g 2 3 eg electronic configuration are stable both in octahedral and tetrahedral environments. This point was considered very recently for the layered-to-spinel transition observed upon lithium deintercalation from 2D Lix MnO2 by Reed et al. [30] from ab initio calculation and by some of us in a more experimental approach [31]. 
It is well known that divalent cation migration is much more unfavourable than that for monovalent ions. In the case of the homologous Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phase, migration of Mg2 + ions has been reported. Nevertheless, it is not highly favourable, as seen from   5 S the low ionic conductivity values (r = 2.9.10   1 at 400 jC) [32]. This must lead to the strong cm polarisation observed in the first domain of the OCV curves. It implies that, on discharge, there is a tendency to fill up the M2 sites of the external parts of the crystallite, even if all M1 sites are not occupied at the centre of the grains. This behaviour explains why, as shown in Figs. 7 and 10, the intercalation voltage corresponds to that of the M2 site, while the relaxation voltage corresponds to that of the M1 site. In the case of the large Ca2 + ions, the migration is so unfavourable that the two intercalation steps are apparent in the relaxation curves (Fig. 11). 
In the case of the LiyMn0.25Ca0.25Ti2(PO4)3 system, one can assume that the presence of three types of cation, with different sizes and charges, at the same crystallographic site leads to a destabilisation of the M1 site and a lowering of the intercalation voltage: in a corner-sharing structure, the size of a given site is imposed by the cationic distribution over the neighbouring sites.
The Mn2 + /Ca2 + occupation of only the M1 sites in the Mn(0.5   x)CaxTi2(PO4)3 (0 V x V 0.50) solid solution is shown by XRD. Unlike in our recently reported structural characterisation of Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 [15], the present Rietveld refinement in combination with a 31P NMR MAS investigation shows clearly that the Mn2 + ions in Mn0.50Ti2(PO4)3 are not completely ordered in the two possible types of M1 site, 3a (000) and 3b (001/2) of the R3¯ space group, whereas, in calcium-substituted phases (Mn(0.5   x)CaxTi2(PO4)3; 0 V x V 0.50), only one of these two positions is occupied. Indeed, these results show the usefulness of 31P MAS NMR as a complementary tool to characterise the cationic distribution in A0.50Ti2(PO4)3 (A = Mn, Ca) phosphates. The electrochemical lithium intercalation study for [A0.5050.50]M1Ti2(PO4)3 shows that intercalation occurs preferentially into the empty M1 site around 2.9 V, and then into the M2 site in the voltage range of 2.5 – 2.3 V. 
As we have recently reported [16,17], the presence of a jump in the OCV curve around the composition corresponding to a complete occupation of the M1 site shows how electrochemical intercalation can be used as a complementary structural characterisation tool in appropriate situations, especially when other techniques lead to ambiguous results.
