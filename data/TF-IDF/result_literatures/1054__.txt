Li3V2(PO4)3 and Li3V1.9M0.1(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Al) samples were synthesized via spray-drying-assisted carbothermal solid-state reaction, and their structural and electrochemical properties were investigated by XRD, SEM, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. Li3V2(PO4)3, Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, and Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3 showed initial discharge capacities of 103.3 mAh g−1, 107.6 mAh g−1, and 105.6 mAh g−1, respectively, in the allsolid-state symmetric batteries with Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid-state electrolytes at a rate of 7.5 mA g−1. The enhanced discharge capacities of Fe and Al-doped Li3V2(PO4)3 could be attributed to the increased electrical conductivity induced by the introduction of Fe3+ or Al3+ trivalent ions into the V3+ sites and to the structural stabilization of the monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 by the spray-drying process.

Lithium ion secondary batteries have been considered as one of the best electrochemical energy storage systems especially for portable devices. However, the structural instability and the high oxidation power of layered rocksalt-type lithium transition-metal oxide cathodes in the fully-charged states have seriously hindered the commercialization of larger-scale Li-ion batteries. Intensive research to develop lower-cost and safer cathode materials has led to spinel-type LiMn2O4 and olivinetype LiFePO4 as possible alternatives. However, even these safer cathodes cannot avoid the thermal runaway perfectly by the soft short of the Li dendrite in aprotic liquid electrolytes. Therefore, all-solid-state batteries with inorganic solid-state electrolyte are considered the safest possible lithium-ion energy storage systems.

Polyanionic host materials such as NASICON are promising candidates for both electrode active materials and solid-state electrolytes in allsolid-state batteries due to their three-dimensional open framework and the inductive effect of the hetero atom in the polyanion groups. Lithium vanadium phosphate, Li3V2(PO4)3 is one such electrode candidate with a theoretical capacity of 197 mAh g−1 (based on 3 Li/mol) in the voltage range above 3.6 V against Li. In addition, it also has an additional capacity corresponding to V3+/V2+ redox at 1.8 V [1].

The monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 consists of inﬁnite chains of octahedral VO6 linked together with tetrahedral PO4, making three-dimensional channels with large bottlenecks for the Li ions in the NASICON matrix [2,3]. However, the transition metal atoms in the NASICON framework are isolated each other by tetrahedral PO4 and these NASICON-type compounds suffer from the low electronic conductivity as an electrode material. In a previous work [4], our group has reported for the ﬁrst time an all-solid-state symmetric Li-ion battery, Li3V2(PO4)3/ Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3/Li3V2(PO4)3, which can operate reversibly at RT. However, the reversible capacity was restricted to 92 mAh g− 1 even at a low current density of only 8.8 μA cm−2 (6.1 mA/g). In order to improve the rate capability and the utilization of the all-solid-state symmetric battery, the electronic conductivity of Li3V2(PO4)3 as well as the ionic conductivity of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 should be increased.

As an attempt to improve the electrochemical performance of Li3V2(PO4)3, various metal ion doping [5–8] and synthetic methods [9–13] have been proposed. However, many attempts to dope the parent Li3V2(PO4)3 structure have not succeeded. For example, when a small amount of iron is added as a dopant, olivine LiFePO4 is typically incorporated into Li3V2(PO4)3 as impurity phase [14].

In this study, a spray-drying-assisted carbothermal synthesis method, which is suitable for large-scale production of homogeneous materials composed of spherical particles [9], was applied to isolate a single phase of Feand Al-doped Li3V2(PO4)3. The resulting samples were characterized by XRD. In addition, all-solid-state symmetric Li-ion batteries with Aland Fe-doped monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode/anode were assembled and compared to the all-solid-state symmetric Li-ion batteries with pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode/anode.

The pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 electrode active material was synthesized via a spray-drying-assisted carbothermal reaction. A stoichiometric mixture of the starting materials, LiOH·H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), NH4VO3 (Wako), and NH4H2PO4 (Wako), was dissolved in 200 ml of water and stirred with a rotating speed of 300 rpm at 80 °C for 1 h. Citric acid (10% by weight), which acts as not only a chelating agent but also is a reductive agent, was further added, and then the solution was kept at 120 °C for 1 h under magnetic stirring. In order to prepare homogeneous precursors for a spray-drying-assisted carbothermal reaction, the pH of the solution was ﬁxed between 9 and 12. The solution was spray-dried at a rate of 10 mL min−1 with an inlet temperature of 220 °C and an outlet temperature of 110 °C and further pre-heated at 300 °C for 5 h. The resulting powder was pelletized, heated at 700 °C for 10 h in an argon atmosphere, and cooled to room temperature at a rate of 100 °C/h. The procedures for Aland Fe-doped Li3V2(PO4)3 were the same except for the addition of the stoichiometric ratio of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and FeC2O4·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.

The crystalline Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 solid-state electrolyte was synthesized using stoichiometric ratios of the starting materials, Li2CO3, GeO2 (Shinko Chemical), NH4H2PO4, and Al2O3 (Nippon Light Metal). The mixture was heated at 500 °C for 2 h and ground. It was then heated to 800 °C for 6 h and further sintered at 900 °C for 2 h in the air. This material had strong XRD reﬂections showing that it is well-crystallized. On the other hand, the amorphous phase was also prepared by quenching melted Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (1200 °C) in iced water.

The crystalline samples were identiﬁed by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, RINT-2500 TTR-III, Rigaku; Cu-Kα, 50 kV, 300 mA) in 2θ range of 10–80° at a scan rate of 0.1°/min with a step of 0.02 and reﬁned by the Fullprof Suite reﬁnement program using atomic coordinates of monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 single crystal data [15].

The working electrodes were prepared by ball-milling a mixture of 70 wt.% active materials and 25 wt.% acetylene black. 5 wt.% PTFE binder was then added. Pellets with approximate weight of 30 mg were prepared manually using a mortar and a pestle. The electrode materials in 2032 coin cells were assembled with 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1 by volume) as the electrolyte. The charge and discharge performances of the electrode were evaluated using a half cell with Li counter electrode at a rate of 7.5 mA g−1 in the voltage ranges of 3.0 and 4.5 V as a cathode, and 3.0 and 1.5 V as an anode, respectively. The symmetric batteries were also evaluated at a rate of 7.5 mA g−1 in the voltage range of 0 and 3.0 V.

The crystalline Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 was pressed at 20 MPa into a pellet and heated at 840 °C for 2 h to prepare a NASICON-type solidstate electrolyte. The electrodes for all-solid-state symmetric batteries were prepared using a mixture of electrode active materials (49 wt.%), amorphous Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (49 wt.%), and vapor-grown carbon ﬁber (VGCF, Showa Denko; 2 wt.%). This mixture (97 wt.%) was then mixed with BL-S polyvinyl alkyl acetyl alcohol (BL-S, Sekisui Chemical Co.; 3 wt.%) and 2, 2, 4-trimethyl-2, 4-pentanediol monoisobutyrate (CS-12, Chisso Corp.) to make a paste. This paste was screen-printed on both sides of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 pellet. Then, it was hot-pressed at 600 °C for 2 h in Ar atmosphere and coated with Pt for the electrical conductivity measurement.

The morphology of the pristine and cation-doped Li3V2(PO4)3 samples and cross-sectional images of LAGP pellets was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrical conductivity of the samples was evaluated using powder resistivity measuring system (Mitsubishi Chemical Analytech, Japan). The resistivity measuring system is equipped with high precision pressure gauge directly attached to a teﬂon-coated cylindrical holder (model MCP-PD522), allowing measurements under various pressures taking into account the sample thickness, its volume and density under given pressure. Measured volume resistivities are calculated in accordance with the following equation; where ρv is the volume resistance, R is the resistance measured by applying Ohm's law, C is Resistivity Correction Factor, and t is sample thickness. The measurement of a powder sample is achieved by pressing the pellet of the measured powder under various pressures below 60 MPa. The resistivity correction factors were obtained by the power plot between resistance versus pressure and the electrical conductivity shown in Table 1 was calculated as the inverse of the volume resistance.

The structural modiﬁcation of isotypic structures from monoclinic to orthorhombic systems has been reported in mixed-metallic systems such as Li2TiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr) [16], Li3− 2x(Sc1− xMx)2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Zr, Sn, Hf) [17], and Li3− 2x(V1− xZrx)2(PO4)3 (x ≥ 0.05) [3]. However, the powder diffraction patterns of the Aland Fe-doped Li3V2(PO4)3 were identiﬁed not as Pbcn or Pbca orthorhombic, but as P21/c monoclinic phases (Fig. 1).

The background of XRD proﬁle was ﬁtted with linear interpolation between a set of 82 points with reﬁnable heights, and the peak shape was reﬁned with the convolution of a pseudo-Voigt function. The atomic fractional coordinates obtained from single crystal data were adopted for the reﬁned structures [15]. To treat negative atomic displacement parameters of the pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 sample that may be attributable to the obtained bulky spray-dried powders, atomic distance restraints and absorption parameters were introduced. The reﬁnements were carried out simultaneously until satisfactory R-factors were obtained (Rwp = 6.47%, RB = 3.48% for pristine Li3V2(PO4)3, Rwp = 4.97%, RB = 1.66% for Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, and Rwp = 3.33%, RB = 1.81% for Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3), as illustrated in Fig. 2. Bond-valence-sum calculations were in good agreement with classical valence of +III for V, Al, and Fe. The difference Fourier map indicated that possible Li sites other than the three initially assigned independent sites were located either on negative levels or relatively too close to both O and M atoms, which were barely allowed at the maximum occupancy of less than 20% of Li ions. Therefore, initial Li sites with full occupancies were adopted for the reﬁnement. SEM images of pristine Li3V2(PO4)3, Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3, and Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 3. All prepared samples are composed of spherical particles, ranging from 0.1 μm to 30 μm in diameter, but were not as homogeneous as previously reported spray-dried Li3V2(PO4)3 [9]. This could be attributed to particle agglomeration and destruction of relatively soft spherical particles of the spray-dried precursor, caused by the pelletizing performed prior the carbothermal reduction process.

The initial charge and discharge performances of Li3V2(PO4)3, Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3, and Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3 electrodes against Li are shown in Fig. 4. The electrode performances were measured at a rate of 7.5 mA g− 1 in the range of 3.0 V and 4.5 V as cathode and 3.0 V and 1.5 V as anode, respectively. The initial capacities of undoped Li3V2(PO4)3 were 112.4 mAh g− 1 (charging up to 4.5 V,) and 122.7 mAh g− 1 (discharging down to 1.5 V), respectively. On the other hand, these capacities were improved more than 10% by cation doping as follows; 127.2 mAh g− 1 (charging up to 4.5 V) and 135.6 mAh g−1 (discharging down to 1.5 V) for Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, and 123.8 mAh g−1 (charging up to 4.5 V) and 132 mAh g−1 (discharging down to 1.5 V) for Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3, respectively. The increased speciﬁc capacities of Feand Al-doped Li3V1.9M0.1(PO4)3 could be attributed to the increased electrical conductivity listed in Table 1.

dQ/dV plots of these electrodes are in good agreement with previously reported data [14], having three and four plateaus in the potential window of 3.0–4.5 V (cathode side) and 3.0–1.5 V (anode side) during the charge and discharge reactions. However, no observable peaks for Fe2+/Fe3+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ were found on either proﬁle. It means that heterogeneous incorporation of the iron phosphate phase did not occur in spray-dried monoclinic Li3V2 − xFex(PO4)3 [18] when x b 0.1. Fig. 5 shows the charge/discharge performance of liquid electrolyte symmetric batteries with Li3V2(PO4)3, Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, and Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3 electrodes (cathode/anode weight balance 1:1) in the voltage range of 0–3.0 V at a rate of 7.5 mA g−1. The initial discharge capacity for Li3V2(PO4)3, Li3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, and Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3 symmetric batteries were 112.5 mAh g−1, 127.2 mAh g−1, and 130.4 mAh g−1, respectively. The same electrode materials were also tested even in all-solid-state conﬁguration with LAGP electrolyte as explained in the experimental section. The cross-sectional SEM images of the all-solid state batteries are shown in Fig. 6. The initial all-solid-state pellet with an average thickness of 0.8 mm is reduced to ca. 0.65 mm after the hot-pressing process. These hot-pressed all-solid-state symmetric batteries exhibited the following initial discharge capacities: 103.3 mAh g−1 for Li3V2(PO4)3, 107.6 mAh g−1 for Fe-doped Li3V2(PO4)3, and 105.6 mAh g−1 for Aldoped Li3V2(PO4)3. Although the positive effect in the rechargeable capacity by Al and Fe substitutional doping was conﬁrmed even in all-solid state batteries, it is clearly seen in Fig. 7 that even at the low current rate of 7.5 mA g−1, the all-solid state batteries suffer large polarization and somewhat unstable cycle life. The ionic conductivity of the LAGP has been known as ca. 2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 [19]. The electronic conductivity of the LAGP solid electrolyte is much less than the ionic conductivity. So, the bulk resistance of the LAGP pellets with 0.06 mm in thickness and 2 cm2 in cross section is estimated above 125 Ω (~0.06 cm ÷ 2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 ÷ 2 cm2). When the low current of 10 μA cm−2 (7.5 mA g−1) is applied in this solid electrolyte, the polarization due to the bulk resistance of the LAGP pellet is calculated to be 2.5 mV or more. Despite such low theoretical IR drop value, the large polarization observed in all-solid-state symmetric batteries with LAGP solid electrolyte suggest that the interfacial resistance between electrodes and solid-state electrolyte is more than 2 order of magnitude larger than the bulk resistance of the solid electrolyte.

Li3V2(PO4)3 and its Feand Al-doped derivatives Li3V1.9M0.1(PO4)3, were synthesized via a spray-drying assisted carbothermal reaction. All samples are impurity-free monoclinic phases owing to the spray-drying carbothermal assisted synthetic route. Li3V2(PO4)3 and its doped derivatives were tested in symmetric batteries with either liquid electrolyte, 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1: 1 in volume), or solid-state electrolyte, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, respectively. The speciﬁc capacities of all-solid-state symmetric batteries, Li3V1.9M0.1(PO4)3/ Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3/Li3V1.9M0.1(PO4)3, were improved by Fe and Al doping, having ﬁrst discharge capacities of 107.6 mAh g−1 and 105.6 mAh g−1 in the voltage range of 0–3.0 V at a rate of 7.5 mA g−1, in comparison with 103.3 mAh g−1 of Li3V2(PO4)3. Therefore, the feasibility of all-solid state symmetric batteries using either pure or doped Li3V2(PO4)3 samples was conﬁrmed. If the interfacial resistance can be reduced more by new thin ﬁlm assemble technique such as pulsed laser deposition in the future, the better charge/discharge performances of the all solid-state symmetric battery will be realized even at higher current density.
