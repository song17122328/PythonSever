Electrophoretic deposition method was applied to prepare some solid-electrolyte thick-films of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (x = 2, 3; NASICON) and Na5DySi4O12 (NDSO) on Au-coated alumina substrates. With the ethanol-based medium, the deposition process was investigated under constant voltage mode. The concentration of the suspension and applied voltage were optimized with respect to the rate of deposition and quality of the deposit. The NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) -based solid-state ionic conductor thick-film as a host ceramic with a guest Cu+ ion has been produced as a noble phosphor thick-film by using an electrochemical ion doping method. The photoluminescence (PL) device of the NASICON:Cu+ film showed good photo-luminescent peaks near 450-500nm depending on the host materials.

Sodium super ionic conductors with an NASICON-type structure (Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12: x = 2, 3, or Na5DySi4O12) are well known to show high ionic conductivity at lower temperature and relatively high chemical stability. Thus, the NASICON has been proposed for the applications for all-solid-state electrochemical cells such as gas sensors, ion sensors, and Na-S batteries. Thin- and thick- film materials of the solid electrolyte are very promising in the fields of chemical sensors or display devices for the advantages in their performance, miniaturization, and accumulation. Especially, a solid-state photoluminescence (PL) device was demonstrated by the use of solid electrolyte thick-film [1]. So far, dry process of R.F. sputtering or laser deposition methods as well as wet chemical processes of sol-gel or screen printing methods have been investigated for the NASICON thin- or thick- films, however they still have some disadvantages in terms of cost and ease of handing for chemicals. On the other hand, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique has been demonstrated to be a useful and simple deposition method among the various ceramic coating techniques [2-6]. Major advantages of the electrophoretic technique are versatility, low-cost, reproducibility, and the possibility of unusual and irregularly shaped coatings. This study deals with the conditions of the EPD for preparing NASICON-based solid electrolyte thick-films and the properties of the films, and then the Na+ ion conductor (NASICON) thick-film was applied as a host material for a unique photoluminescence device in which a guest Cu+ ion was electrochemically introduced.

Solid electrolyte Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (x = 2, 3) and Na5DySi4O12 powders were synthesized by a sol-gel method using P2O5, Si(OC2H5)4, C2H5ONa, Na2SiO3.9H2O, or Dy(NO3) 2.6H2O. Mixtures of the solutions were kept at 70-75°C to evaporate the solvent and dried at 110-120°C to form xerogel powders. The xerogel powders were ground and calcined at 1000°C for 3-6h, to form the NASICON or NDSO powders [7,8].

All powders were ball-milled before the EPD. The fine solid electrolyte powders were suspended in alcohol (EtOH, IPA: isopropylalchol) at 4.5 wt%. EPD forming was performed by applying a constant DC voltage up to 60 V/cm within 20 min. The electrodes used in this study were Au-coated alumina substrate and Pt-plate as working and counter electrodes, respectively. The obtained deposit was dried and finally sintered at 750-1000°C.

Cu+ ion doping for NASICON-thick film was performed electrochemically in 0.01M CuCl2 aqueous solution. NASICON thick-films, Pt-plate, SCE were used as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. -60 A or -0.1V(vs. SCE) for 30 min were applied for ion exchange. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD: JDX-3500K, JEOL Ltd.) using CuK1 radiation. Morphology and thickness of the powders and films were determined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM: JSM-6320F, JEOL Ltd.). Particle size distribution of the powder in the suspension was measured with laser diffraction particle size analyzer (Shimadzu: Sold-2000A). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature using a luminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 254 nm.

Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of NASICONs (a) Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (X=2), (b) Na4Zr2Si3O12(X=3) (Na3Zr2Si3PO12) and (c) NDSO (Na5DySi4O12) powders synthesized by the sol-gel method. It was found that almost-single phase hexagonal Na3Zr2Si3PO12 powder was synthesized with this method at a calcination temperature as low as 1000°C. Other samples also showed almost-single-phase hexagonal patterns. Laser diffraction particle size analysis revealed that the NASICON (Na4Zr2Si3O12) powder as calcined at 1000 ºC consists of relatively large-sized particles in the average size of around 10m as shown in Fig. 2 (a). While, after ball milling in ethanol for 8h, the NASICON (Na4Zr2Si3O12) powder became drastically finer with the average size less than 1m, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Other powers showed almost same effects. The former large NASICON powders could not be used for EPD process in the thick-film preparation, while the latter fine powers were to be applied for the EPD.

The variation of the deposit weight of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 thick-films during the EPD synthesis was investigated. Figure 3 (a) and (b) shows the dependence on applied voltage at constant time(5min) and the deposition time at constant applied voltage(+5V), respectively. The deposit weight increased almost linearly between 0 and 20 V/cm and saturated at >25 V/cm. The deposit weight at constant +5V increased with deposition time. Several mg/cm2 deposit NASICON thick-film could be easily obtained with the EPD +5V within 10 min. Homogeneous Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (X=2) and Na4Zr2Si3O12(X=3) thick-films could be obtained as anode deposition in the EPD at +5V as applied voltage for 3 - 5 min. While, the most homogeneous NDSO (Na5DySi4O12) thick-film was obtained at the cathode deposition in the case of –20V and 5min in isopropylalchol solvent. Figure 4 shows the XRD pattern of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (X = 2) and Na5DySi4O12 thick-film prepared by the EPD method after sintered at 1000°C for 3h. It was found that the almost single phase hexagonal Na3Zr2Si3PO12 and Na5DySi4O12 thick-film were observed.

Cu+ ion doping for Na+ site in NASICON thick-films could be performed electrochemically in 0.01M CuCl2 aqueous solution, as the NASICON-films have relatively high Na+ ion conductivity at room temperature. NASICON thick-films, Pt-plate, SCE were used as working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. EPMA analysis revealed that the Cu segregation at the surface of the NASICON films was observed for ion exchanged at constant voltage mode, such as -0.1V(vs. SCE) for 30 min. While the homogeneous Cu ion exchange with Na ion could be performed by the constant current mode, such as -60 A for 30-60 min, for the electrochemical ion exchange. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12: Cu+ thick-film excited at 254nm of ultraviolet ray shows a relatively strong green luminescence as shown Fig. 5. The photoluminescence spectrum of the film showed sharp peaks near 470nm and 500nm, which could be connected as the Cu+ monomer and the Cu+-Cu+ dimer transitions, respectively.
