Nasicon-type phosphates have been studied extensively in the context of various ﬁelds of solid state chemistry: fast alkali ion conduction ~Goodenough et al., 1976!, low thermal expansion ceramics ~Rodrigo et al., 1989; Rodrigo and Alamo, 1991!, luminescence ~Le Polles et al., 1988!, etc. Nasicon type phosphates can be expressed by the general formula M1(M2) 3A2(PO4) 3 . The structure consists of a three dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra and AO6 octahedra sharing corners, with the M1 and M2 sites being cavities in the framework. These cavities can be empty, partly, or fully occupied. In this paper we present data on the synthesis and crystallochemistry of a new phosphate, Na4CrNi(PO4) 3 , which is of the Nasicon-type.
Na4CrNi(PO4) 3 orthophosphate powder was prepared from acid solutions of NiO ~I!, Na2CO3 ~II! and aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3) 3.9H2O(II), and (NH4) 2HPO4 ~IV!. A slow addition of ~IV! in the (I)1(II)1(III) mixture ~with stirring! at room temperature was done. After drying at about 100 °C, the resulting amorphous powder was progressively heated for 48 h with intermittent grinding, to 200 °C, 400 °C, 600 °C, and ﬁnally to 750 °C. The ﬁnal dark-green product was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction using CuKa radiation. Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Philips PW 1710 ~u–u! diffractometer. The data were callibrated using Si as an internal standard.
