Compounds Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 and Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − x(PO4)3 (0 < х ≤ 0.35) solid solution were prepared by two variants of the sol–gel method using inorganic and organic reagents and were characterized  using  X-ray  diffraction  and  IR  spectroscopy.  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3,  a  compound  with  an NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) structure, is formed at 600°С and is stable up to 950°C. Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 has dimorphism; its low-temperature phase having the Sc2(WO4)3 (SW) structure was prepared at 650°С, and the hightemperature NZP phase, at 1200°С. Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − x(PO4)3 solid solution crystallizes in an SW-type structure; it is thermally unstable at temperatures above 900°С. The thermal stability of samples decays as x rises. The numbers of the stretching and bending vibrations in an   ion in the IR spectra of NZP and SW orthophosphates agree with factor-group analysis for space group R3 and P21/n. Structure refinement was carried out for the low-temperature Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phase (space group P21/n, a = 8.861(3) Å, b = 8.869(2) Å, c = 12.561(3) Å, β = 89.51(2)°) and for the solid solution. The basis of the structures is a framework built of corner-sharing tetrahedra PO4 and octahedra ZrO6 or (Mn,Zr)O6. The framework interstices are occupied by cations Mn2+ in tetrahedral oxygen coordination. A comparative crystal-chemical analysis of the morphotropic series of M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphates (M stands for a metal in the oxidation state +2) elucidated a relationship between structural features.

Phosphates  of  formula  unit  M0.5E2(PO4)3  (where M stands for a metal in the oxidation state +2; E = Ti or Zr) belong to the NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP, NASICON) and Sc2(WO4)3 (SW) structural types [1, 2]. In both structures the basis is the framework {[E2(PO4)3]p−}3∞ built  of  columns  of  octahedral-tetrahedral  moieties EO6  and  PO4.  The  interstices  in  both  structures  are occupied by cations of elements in the oxidation state +2.  Extensive  cationic  isomorphism  of  extraframework cations in NZP and SW type structures and an option  of  isomorphic  substitutions  in  frameworkforming octahedra and tetrahedra determine the large extents  of  the  crystallization  fields  of  compounds M0.5E2(PO4)3 and their base solid solutions.

The M0.5Ti2(PO4)3 phosphates whose framework is built on the titanium basis (titanium having a smaller size  than  zirconium),  crystallize  in  NZP  structure (Table  1).  The  M0.5Zr2(PO4)3  phosphates  with  large

M2+ ions (Cd, Pb, Sr, or Ba) crystallize in the NZP structural type, those with smaller M2+ ions sizes crystallize  in  SW  structural  type.  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  has dimorphism and exists as SW and NZP phases. The reported values of the monoclinic-to-tetragonal transition temperature [16, 29] are considerably differing from one another (900−1400°С). The structure of the low-temperature Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phase has not been solved.

The M0.5E2(PO4)3 compounds have high chemical, thermal,  and  radiation  stability  and  low  thermal expansion [4, 15, 26, 30, 31], and they can be prepared by solid-phase chemical methods or by precipitation from aqueous solutions (sol–gel or hydrothermal synthesis).  The  incorporation  of  3d  ions  (in  particular, Mn) into such phosphates made it possible to manufacture  promising  phosphors  and  catalysts  for  dehydrogenation and dehydration of alcohols, isomerization  of  alkanes,  and  their  selective  oxidation  [7,  18, 31–35].

The Mn0.5 + 2xE2 − x(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr) samples with x = 0, 0.10, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.60, 0.75, and 1.0 were prepared  by  the  sol–gel  method  followed  by  heat treatment. The initial reagents for the synthesis were chemically  pure  grade  chemicals:  Mn(CH3COO)2  · 4H2O, TiOCl2 (prepared from TiCl3 via oxidation in air  by  hydrochloric  acid  +  nitric  acid  mixture), ZrOCl2 · 8H2O, and H3PO4. Stoichiometric amounts of  1 М  aqueous  solutions  of  manganese  acetate  and titanium  or  zirconium  oxychloride  were  poured together under constant stirring at room temperature. Then, orthophosphoric acid solution was added under stirring,  also  in  agreement  with  the  stoichiometry. Reaction mixtures were dried at 90°C and then heattreated under air at 600–1100°C for 24 h at every step. Stepwise  heating  was  alternated  with  dispersion  for homogenization  of  mixtures.  The  Pechini  citrate method, another version of the sol–gel process, was also used to prepare phosphates. The organic reagents used were citric acid (monohydrate, a chemically pure grade sample) and ethylene glycol (a pure for analysis grade  sample),  taken  in  an  excess  for  stable  chelate complexes  to  be  formed.  To  a  citric  acid  solution, solutions of manganese and zirconium (titanium) salts were added, then ammonium dihydrophosphate solution and ethylene glycol were. The resulting samples were  dried,  dispersed,  and  stepwise  annealed  at  90, 130, 350, and 600−950°С. The Pechini method provided a uniform distribution of ions over the polymeric gel and made it possible to reduce the temperature at which  single-phase  products  can  be  obtained  compared  to  the  sol–gel  process  where  organic  reagents are not used. The thus-prepared samples were white polycrystalline powders.

The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  samples  were recorded  on  a  Shimadzu  XRD-6000  diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å, 2θ = 10°–60°). X-ray powder  diffraction  was  used  to  determine  the  phase composition of samples in the course of their preparation after every isothermal anneal step and to monitor their  phase  composition.  The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns were indexed by structural analogy using crystallographic data for compounds described in the literature. The unit cell parameters of the prepared phosphates were refined by the least-squares method.

The  chemical  composition  and  homogeneity  of phosphates were monitored using a JEOL JSM-7600F scanning electron microscope equipped with a thermal  field  emission  electron  gun  (Schottky  cathode). The microscope was equipped with a microanalytical system (an OXFORD X-Max 80 (Premium) energydispersive spectrometer with a silicon-drift semiconductor detector). The error in elemental compositions was within 2 at %.

The  X-ray  diffraction  spectra  of  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (x =  0)  and  MnZr1.75(PO4)3  (x  =  0.25)  samples  for structural  studies  were  recorded  in  the  range  2θ  = 10°–110° with a 0.02° scan step and an exposure time per point of 16 s. X-ray diffraction patterns were processed and phosphate structures were refined by the Rietveld  method  [36]  in  software  RIETAN-97  [37]. Peak profiles were fitted by the modified pseudo-Voigt function  (Mod-TCH  pV  [38]).  The  model  used  for phosphate structure refinement was the LiZr2(AsO4)3 atomic coordinates [39].

The  functional  composition  of  samples  was  verified by IR-spectroscopic studies. IR absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR-8400S FT-IR spectrometer in the wavenumber range 400–1400 cm–1.

When phase formation in Mn0.5 + 2хE2 – xP3O12 (E = Ti, Zr) was studied, the samples in the course of synthesis  were  isothermally  annealed  at  600,  700,  800, and 900°C. The exposure time at every temperature was 24 h. At the end of every step, some samples were rapidly  air-quenched  and  then  analyzed,  while  the others continued to be heated up.

Single-phase Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 is formed at 650°C. As the temperature rises, the crystallinity of the desired phase  improves  to  reach  the  maximal  value  at 800−850°С.  Above  900°C  the  temperature-induced phase  transition  occurs  in  manganese  zirconium phosphate  from  the  monoclinic  to  rhombohedral structure, accompanied by a partial decomposition of the desired product. A rise in temperature to 1200°C and a long-term heat treatment of the sample at this temperature  yielded  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  with  the  NZP structure (space group R3, a = 8.85(1) Å, c = 21.80(5) Å, V = 1478(4) Å3, Z = 6). The structure of the high-temperature  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  phase  was  refined  by  the Rietveld method previously [18].

The samples of prepared individual phosphates and solid solutions were homogeneous as probed by electron microscopy; their chemical compositions according to microprobe analyses corresponded to theoretical  values.  Figure  3  shows  a  micrograph  of Mn1.0Zr1.75(PO4)3 (Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − x(PO4)3, x = 0.25) by the way of example. The image implies that the grain sizes  are  differentiated  and  range  from  10  to  100  μm. Microprobe data showed a homogeneous grain composition;  chemical  analysis  corresponded  to  the  formula unit Mn1.00(2)Zr1.75(3)P3.0(1)O12.

The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  Mn0.5  +  2хZr2  −  x (PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.35) solid solution samples, which are crystallized  in  the  SW  structural  type,  feature  a smooth  shift  of  diffraction  peaks  with  a  systematic change  in  their  relative  intensities  in  response  to increasing х (Fig. 4). The unit cell parameters а, b, с, and β of Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − x(PO4)3 solid solutions as func-tions  of  х  are  fitted  by  the  following  equations:  a  = 8.859  –  0.04x  (±0.003  Å),  b  =  8.959  +  0.0531x (±0.006 Å), c = 12.526 + 0.0366x (±0.005 Å), and β = 89.79 – 0.0405x (±0.05°). The crystal-chemical formula of the solid solution, where different crystallo-graphic positions are occupied by manganese cations, with great probability will be the following: Mn0.5 +  x [MnxZr2  −  x(PO4)3]3∞,  where  [MnxZr2  −  x(PO4)3]3∞ stands for the framework in which Mn and Zr occupy positions with CN = 6 and Mn0.5 + x stands for extraframework positions partially occupied by Mn (CN = 4). The  solid  solution  is  thermally  unstable  at  temperatures  above  900°С;  the  thermal  stability  of  samples decreases with rising x.

A  comprehensive  study  of  phase  formation  in Mn0.5 +  2хTi2  –  xP3O12  showed  that  the  double  phosphate  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3  (x  =  0),  as  probed  by  X-ray powder diffraction, is formed at 600°С, crystallizes in rhombohedral system (space group R3, a = 8.513(1) Å, c = 21.008(1) Å, V = 1318.5(4) Å3, Z = 6), belongs to the NZP structural type, and is stable up to 950°C. The  Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3  structure  was  determined  by X-ray structural analysis of hydrothermally prepared single-crystals [9]. Solid solution Mn0.5 + 2хTi2 – x(PO4)3 is not  formed  because  of  considerable  differences between  the  ionic  radii  of  Ti4+  (0.61  Å)  and  Mn2+ (0.83 Å). The results of X-ray powder diffraction studies of the prepared Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − xP3O12 samples indicate that their phase compositions depend appreciably on  the  synthetic  method,  heat  treatment,  and  the manganese  content  of  the  phosphate.  The  Pechini citrate method enabled us to reduce the temperature at which  single-phase  products  can  be  obtained  compared to the sol–gel process without organic reagents. Figure 1 exemplifies the strongest reflection intensities of phases in Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − xP3O12 samples prepared by  the  Pechini  method  at  650°C.  In  the  range  x  = 0−0.35, the conditions are for Mn0.5 + 2хZr2 − x(PO4)3 solid solution with the SW structure to be formed. The 0.5 ≤ х ≤ 1 samples were mixtures of phases (Fig. 1).

The  IR  spectra  of  individual  phosphates  and  the solid  solutions  have  a  pattern  typical  of  orthophosphates with NZP and SW structures with space group R3 and P21/n, respectively (Fig. 5). Due to the differing  degrees  of  distortion  of  PO4  tetrahedra  in  the structures of these phosphates, the IR regions of their vibrational  spectra  differ  from  one  another  in  the numbers  and  types  of  bands  in  the  stretching  and bending ranges.

In rhombohedral phosphates (space group R3), the selection rules for IR spectra allow six bands of each asymmetric  stretching  vibrations  ν3  and  asymmetric bending vibrations ν4, two bands of symmetric stretching vibrations ν1, and four bands of symmetric bending vibrations ν2. In the IR spectra of Mn0.5E2(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr) compounds (Fig. 5, spectra 1 and 2), four or five allowed bands appear in the region of vibrations ν3. The symmetric stretching vibrations ν1 appear as
two bands in the range 990−940 cm−1. Of the six
allowed bands ν4, all the six are observed in the spectra. The vibrations ν2, detectable by the instrument, appear as two bands.

The symmetric stretching vibrations ν1 appear as two  bands  in  the  range  990−940  cm−1.  Of  the  six allowed bands ν4, all the six are observed in the spectra.  The  vibrations ν2,  detectable  by  the  instrument, appear as two bands.

In  the  IR  spectra  of  Mn0.5  +  2хZr2  −  x(PO4)3  solid solutions (Fig. 5, spectra 3 and 4), the selection rules allow nine of each of the asymmetric stretching vibrations ν3 and the asymmetric bending vibrations ν4 of the  Р−О  bond  in    three  bands  of  symmetric stretching  vibrations  ν1,  and  six  bands  of  symmetric bending  vibrations  ν2  of  this  ion.  The  bands  in  the range 1260−1010 cm–1 were assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibrations ν3 in the PO4 ion. The high wavenumber  values  (1258−1215  cm–1)  are  explained by the fact that, with the large angle POE (E = Ti, Zr) in the structures, the electron density of the polarized E4+ ion, which has a small size and a large charge, is partially located at the P−O bond, and this leads to higher values of the force constants of this bond. The bands in the range 970−920 cm–1 were assigned to the symmetric stretching vibrations ν1. The bands in the range  670−550  cm–1  correspond  to  the  asymmetric bending  vibrations  ν4  of  the  Р−О  bond,  and  the ~430-cm–1 bands correspond to the symmetric bending vibrations ν2 of the Р−О bond in PO4.

In order to verify the structures of the phosphate Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  and  Mn0.5  +  xMnxZr2  −  x(PO4)3  solid solution with x = 0.25 studied in this work, we carried out the Rietveld refinement of their structures at room temperature.  The  experimental  details,  unit  cell parameters, and selected structure refinement details are compiled in Table 2. Figure 6 shows the measured, calculated, bar, and difference X-ray diffraction patterns for (≡Mn0.75Mn0.25Zr1.75(PO4)3).  The Mn1.0Zr1.75(PO4)3  atomic  coordinates,  displacement  parameters,  and occupancy factors for basal atoms of the phosphates are listed in Table 3.

The monoclinic Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mn1.0Zr1.75(PO4)3 phases belong to the SW structural type. A fragment of the Mn0.75Mn0.25Zr1.75(PO4)3 structure is shown in Fig. 7. The basis of the MnZr1.75(PO4)3 and Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 structures  framework {Mn0.25Zr1.75(PO4)3}3∞ and {[Zr2(PO4)3]−}3∞, respectively,  built  by  linking  of  octahedra  (Mn,Zr)O6  or ZrO6  and  tetrahedra  PO4.  Each  octahedron  shares corners  with  six  tetrahedra  PO4,  which  are,  in  turn, each linked with four octahedra. Two (Mn,Zr) or Zr octahedra and three phosphorus-occupied tetrahedra share their corners to form a characteristic fragment of the framework, namely, a “lantern.” These groups are packed into zigzag ribbons. Mn2+ ions are arranged in framework cavities between the edges of two octahedra, Mn2+ ions are arranged with a tetrahedral oxygen coordination  (Fig.  7).  In  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4),  the  zirco-nium  atoms  are  arranged  in  a  distorted  octahedral oxygen surrounding and are disordered over two positions. The Zr–O bond lengths in two independent Zr octahedra are distributed in the ranges 1.75−2.42 and 1.85−2.21 Å, have values typical of six-coordinate zirconium, and the average Zr−O distances in coordination  polyhedra  are  2.04  and  2.08  Å.  In MnZr1.75(PO4)3,  the  Mn(Zr)−O  distances  in  mixed octahedra (Mn,Zr)O6 have a greater scatter compared to  those  in  the  zirconium–oxygen  octahedra  in Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3: 1.69−2.43 and 1.81−2.24 Å; the average  Mn(Zr)−O  distances  in  coordination  polyhedra are close to each other (2.04 and 2.06 Å). The ratios of bond  lengths  and  bond  angles  in  tetrahedra  PO4  in both phosphates are typical of this anion. The tetrahedra  are  distorted;  the  average  P−O  bond  lengths  in PO4 polyhedra fall within the range 1.60−1.72 Å. The oxygen surrounding of manganese in extraframework positions may be described as four-coordination: the Mn−O  distances  to  the  four  nearest-neighboring atoms  O  fall  within  the  range  1.97−2.85  Å  in Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and 1.60−2.52 Å in MnZr1.75(PO4)3. The  prepared  Mn0.5E2(PO4)3  (E  =  Ti,  Zr)  compounds and Mn0.5 + xMnxZr2 − x(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.35)solid solution, with their structural similarity (the lantern crystal chemical groups remain unchanged), differ from each other by the way in which manganese cations are positioned in framework cavities: the former belong to space group P21/n and Mn occupies tet-rahedral  cavities  in  the  structure,  while  the  latter belong to space group R3 and Mn prefers to enter an octahedral surrounding.

Manganese  zirconium  phosphate,  which  has  two polymorphs,  falls  at  the  morphotropic  transition boundary in this series. The Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3 polymorphism  arises  from  the  easy  deformability  of  oxygen surrounding and the instability of Mn2+ coordination, a sufficient flexibility of the construct of corner-sharing Zr and P coordination polyhedra, and the ability of a crystal to more uniformly distribute the stresses arising at large atomic oscillation amplitudes, among various  bonds.  The  phase  transition  is  accompanied  by framework built of corner-sharing tetrahedra PO4 and octahedra ZrO6 or (Mn,Zr)O6. The effects of various structure-forming  factors  on  structurally  related  but symmetrically  different  M0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compounds have been discussed.

In the zirconium-phosphate M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 morphotropic  series,  the  decisive  structure-forming  factor  in  the portion of the series with small cations M2+ (compared to Zr4+ ions, which are involved in {[Zr2(PO4)3]−}3∞ framework formation), is the octahedral-tetrahedral framework, which is adaptable to a small cation; in the portion of the series with large cations (Cd−Ba), the geometric factor is decisive for atomic arrangement: the arrangement  of  Zr4+  cations  compared  to  the  less charged and large ions M2+ leads to the “expanding” effect of large MO6 octahedra on the structure geometry.

Phase  formation  has  been  studied  in  systems Mn0.5 + 2xE2 −  x(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr). Manganese titanium  (NZP)  and  manganese  zirconium  (SW  lowtemperature phase and NZP high-temperature phase) double  phosphates  and  Mn0.5  +  x[MnxZr2  −  x(PO4)3] (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.35) solid solution with the SW structure have been synthesized. The structure has been refined for the  low-temperature  Mn0.5Zr2(PO4)3  phase  and  the solid solution where manganese atoms occupy framework positions (CNMn = 6) and extraframework positions (CNMn = 4). The basis of the studied phosphate structures has been shown to be a three-dimensional framework built of corner-sharing tetrahedra PO4 and octahedra ZrO6 or (Mn,Zr)O6. The effects of various structure-forming factors on structurally related but symmetrically different M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compounds have been discussed.
