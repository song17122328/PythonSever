An open framework  type new material  LixCo2(Mo04)3 [0<x<3]  possessing NASICON  structure was identified as positive electrode material for  use in  3V class lithium batteries.  The new material  was synthesized in its non-lithiated  phase  employing a metal/organic  precursor method using a soft-combustion  approach. We report here on the structural and  electrochemical Lf insertion/extraction properties of the resultant product. XRD revealed a  single phase Co2(MoGt)3 powders and the annealed powders were found  to contain ultrafine  spherical grains. The redox behavior of the new material was demonstrated in lithium  containing  cells  using the conventional  wet cell  configuration  under  Li+ aprotic  organic  electrolyte environment. The material offered a discharge capacity of ~ 110 mAh/g between  3.5V and 1.5V during the first cycle and ~ 50% of the initial capacity was retained at the  end of 20* cycle. 
Research in the area of new electrode materials for rechargeable systems is rapidly  developing  world  wide  to  compete  with  the  materials  being  used  in  the  present  day lithium-ion batteries.  As a part of this work, there is a continuous growth in a  sector composed  of polyanion based positive electrode materials.  During the past  few  years  these  materials  have gained  much  exploration  as promising  candidates  for  use  as  positive  electrodes  in  rechargeable  lithium-ion  batteries.  Polyanion  structures  made  up  of  corner  shared  MC>6 [M=  transition  metal]  octahedra  and  (XO4)11" [X=S, P, W etc.] tetrahedra were reported to reversibly intercalate lithium  into  their  host  structures  [1-5].  Molybdates  of  trivalent  metal  ions  M2(X04)3  [M=Fe]  were  and  electrochemically  [6,7].  All  these  polyanion-containing  materials  belong  to  the  NASICON family  with a open framework  structure. 
Non  lithiated  Fe2(X04)3  (X=  Mo,  W  or  S)  was  found  to  crystallize  in  a  monoclinic  form  and  upon  inserting  lithium,  the  material  transformed  to  an  orthorhombic structure.  Reversibility between the end member compositions was  reported  for  two  lithium  insertion  per  formula  unit.  Insertion  of  more  than  two  lithium  into  Fe2(XC>4)3 was found  to cause  framework  disproportionation  leading  to  [3,5,8],  Li3V2(P04)3  [9,10],  Li2FeM'(PO)3  (M' Ti,  V)  [2,11]  were  also  reported  to  accommodate  reversible  electrochemical  lithium  insertion/extraction  in the  3V  potential  region  vs.  Li+/Li  as well as high lithium diffusion  rates. Progress in the polyanion  family  leads to a  new  direction  for  advanced  battery  materials  to  be  used  in  future  lithium-ion  batteries. 
In  the  context  of  identifying  new  NASICON  type  polyanion  materials,  recently, we discovered lithium removal/insertion  properties of lithiated phases of  nickel  molybdate Li2Ni2(Mo04)3  [12]  and  cobalt  molybdate   Li2Co2(Mo04)3  [13,14]  in  the high  voltage  regime  (>4V)  and  lithium  insertion/removal  behavior  of non lithiated  phase of Ni2(MoC>4)3 [15]  in the low voltage  regime  (3V) for  the  first  time.  We  have  also  discovered  yet  another  new  material  Co2(MoC>4)3  and  investigated  both  structural  and  electrochemical  characteristics  of  this  new  material.  This  paper  presents  the  synthesis  associated  with  physical  and  electrochemical properties of framework  type Co2(MoC>4)3. 
Co2(Mo04)3  was  synthesized  following  a  low  temperature  soft-combustion  procedure  using  glycine  as  a  combustion  fuel,  the  details  of  which  were  previously  reported  by  us  [16].  Required  amounts  of  cobalt  nitrate  and  hexaammonium  heptamolybdate  were  dissolved  in  deionised  water  and  then  mixed  with  an  aqueous  solution  of  glycine.  The  obtained  blue  colored  solution  was  heated at around  100  C until  a dark blue  colored paste-like  substance  (precursor)  was formed  and further  heated at about 250  C.  Upon  continuing  the  process  of  heating,  to  an  exothermic  decomposition  resulting  in  the  as-prepared  final  product.  This  product  was  annealed at 600  C and 700  C in ambient air to obtain the desired crystalline phase  ofCo2(Mo04)3. 
Structural  investigations  were made using  a JEOL  (model JDX  8030)  X-ray  diffractometer  using CuKa  radiation  (e=1.5406  A). The  diffraction  patterns  were  recorded at room temperature in the range  10  -60  (2>) in steps of 0.2  product  was  analyzed  for  the  grain  size  and  morphology  features  by  means  of  SEM [JEOL  (modeUSM6301F)]. 
Both potentiostatic  and galvanostatic electrochemical techniques were used to  examine the  repeated  lithium  insertion/extraction  properties  of  Co2(Mo04)3. The  basic  electrochemical  system  (BAS, Perkin  Elmer,  PARC  model,  USA) equipped  with PowerCV®  software  was used to conduct  the  slow  scan  cyclic  voltammetry  (SSCV)  experiment  in  a  Teflon  made  two-electrode  cell.  Constant  current  discharge/charge  tests  were  performed  with  the  aid  of  a  multichannel  Arbin  battery  tester  (Arbin  instruments  BT2000,  USA)  equipped  with  MITSPRO  software. 
The X-ray diffraction  pattern of Co2(Mo04)3 annealed at 600°C and 700°C  for  4h is shown in Fig.  1. The  diffractograms  reveal  the refinement  of peak  positions  and sharpness of the diffraction  peaks. Moreover, growth in the peak intensity and  increased  crystallinity  are also evident upon increasing the annealing  temperature  from  600°C  to  700°C.  These  features  usually  indicate  the  role  of  annealing  temperature  on the  structure  of the material  and the formation  of well  crystalline  structure  which  would  facilitate  easy  insertion/extraction  of  Li+  in  the  host  structure  during  repeated  cycling. No obvious  difference  was noticed  in the  peak  positions  of  the  patterns  recorded  for  the  sample  annealed  at  two  different  temperatures. 
The  grain  size  distribution  and  morphology  of  the  synthesized  Co2(Mo04)3  powder  annealed  at  600°C  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  It  is  clear  from  fig.  2  that  Co2(Mo04)3 powders  contain  ultrafine  nanosized  spherical  grains. The  spherical  grains  are  connected  with  one  another  with  almost uniform  particle  size  and  the  pore free distribution of the grains is evident. 
The  new  material  was  examined  for  Li* insertion/extraction  properties  both  on  the  qualitative  and  quantitative  basis  under  potentiostatic  (constant  voltage)  and  galvanostatic  (constant  current)  conditions.  
The  slow  scan  cyclic  voltammogram  of  the  new  material  LixCo2(Mo04)3  [0<x<3] vs. Li/Li+ is shown  in Fig. 3 [scan rate = 0.1  mV/s; discharge  cut off  =  1.5V;  charge  cut  off  =  3.5V]. The  excellent  electrochemical  reversibility  of  the  new  material  is  evident  from  the  CV  profiles.  The  profiles  clearly  exhibit  sharp  redox  peaks  corresponding  to  two  transition  metal  ions  namely,  cobalt  (3+)  and  molybdenum (6+). 
During  the  initial cathodic  scan from  OCV (3.4V),  the  first reduction peak  observed  at  ~2.6V  corresponds  to  Co3+/Co  +  transition.  The  second  reduction  process occurred  at about 2.2V  is due to Mo6+/Mo4+ activity  which  represents  the  two-electron  transfer.  These  two  observations  are  consistent  with  two  discharge  plateaus  obtained  in  the  galvanostatic  discharge/charge  test  (Fig.4).  The  first  plateau  represents  Co3+ reduction  and  the  second  one  could  be  associated  with  reduction of  Mo  +to Mo  +.  During the first anodic scan from  1.5 V (minimum cut  off voltage), oxidation  of Mo4+ back  to  6+  state  appeared  in  the  form  of  a weak  current profile  at about 2.65V. Co2+ to Co3+ change was clearly visible  as a sharp  oxidation peak at about 2.8V. 
The  first  discharge  process  of  Li+  insertion  began  at  3.4V(OCV)  and  only  negligible  amount  of  Li+  was  inserted  into  the  new  polyanion  material  until  the  potential  decreased  to 2.7V  from  where the  discharge  curve  exhibited  two  plateaus  centered  at  approximately  2.6V  and  2.2V  respectively.  These  observations  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  reduction  peaks  found  in  the  CV  studies.  During  the  first  discharge, ~ 2.4  Li+ per  formula  unit  could  be  inserted  down  to  1.5 V  leading  to  Li2.4Co2(Mo04)3.  This  corresponds  to  a  discharge  capacity  of  -110  mAh/g.  During the  first  charge  after  discharge,  1.7  Li+  could  be  extracted  up  to  3.5V  with  a  charge  capacity  of  -75  mAh/g.  Based  on  the  amount  of  charge  extraction,  the  practical  stoichiometry  of  the  material  in  the  charged  state  could  be  written  as  Lio.7Co2(Mo04)3. 
Materials  such  as Fe2(Mo04),, Fe2(W04)3  and Fe2(S04)3  [1,2,6,7]  were  found  to  undergo  a  phase  transformation  from  monoclinic  to  orthorhombic  and  vice  versa  during  the  process  of  reversible  lithium  insertion  into  their  host  structures.  As  Co2(Mo04)3  lithium  insertion/extraction  in  Co2(Mo04)3  follows  the  electrochemical  reaction  with  a  presumed  phase  transformation  as  occurred  in  its  analogous  Fe2(X04)3  is  given  below.
In  the  subsequent  discharge,  2  Li  per  formula  unit  could  be  inserted  with  a  discharge  capacity  of 90 mAh/g  and  in the  following  charge, the practical  capacity  was  73  mAh/g  with  an  extraction  of  1.6  Li+.  The  similarity  of  discharge/charge  curves  in the  extended  cycling  characteristics  proved  that the  structural  stability  of  the  material  is  retained  during  repeated  insertion/extraction  of  Li+.  It  is  also  observed that the material  delivered 72 mAh/g discharge  capacity  in the fifth  cycle  which  is 65% of the  initial  capacity. The  obtained  capacity  decreased  to  59  mAh/g  in  the  tenth  cycle,  which  is  54%  of  the  initial  value.  The  material  still  offered  50  mAh/g  capacity  in  the  twentieth  cycle  which  is  roughly  50%  that  of  the  capacity  obtained  in the  first  cycle (figure  not  shown). 
The  above  findings  show  that  the  new  material  possesses  low  voltage  (3V)  profile  and  the  material  may  be  of  interest  to  further  explore  its  suitability  by  improving  its electrochemical  performance. 
A  new  framework  type  Co2(Mo04)3  was  synthesized  by  means  of  a  low  temperature  soft-combustion  technique  and  the  structural  properties  of  the  new  material  were  analyzed  by  XRD  and  SEM  studies.  Presence  of  single  phase  Co2(Mo04)3  was  evidenced  from  XRD  and  SEM  analysis  confirmed  nanometer  sized  spherical  grains.  SSCV  and  Galvanostatic  cycle  test  demonstrated  the  electrochemical  reversible  insertion/extraction  of  Li+  over  the  potential  range  of  3.5V   1.5V.  The  material  delivered  a  first  discharge  capacity  of  110  mAh/g  and  extended  galvanostatic  cycling  test  revealed  that  the  material  was  able  to  retain  -50%  of the  initial  capacity  in the  20th  cycle. Further  work  is intended  to  improve  the capacity retention of the new material during prolonged cycling and the results  will be reported elsewhere.
