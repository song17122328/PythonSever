Li+ conducting crystalline and glassy materials have been intensively studied with a view of replacing currently used liquid electrolytes in the next generation of portable power sources, the so-called all-solid-state batteries. It is believed that they might offer higher energy density and improved safety than currently used lithium-ion batteries, but their commercialization is hindered by several important factors. Key issue is still insufficient ambient temperature conductivity from 10−5 to 10−3 S/cm, while 10−2 S/cm is rather required [1]. Much work has been carried out on the lithium ion conductors with formula NASICON-type rhombohedral LiM2(PO4)3, where M = Ti, Ge, Hf, Zr, Sn [2]. The compound Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (denoted as LATP) with x = 0.3 presents the most favourable characteristics for fast ionic migration [3], which results in the highest bulk ionic conductivity among all oxide-based inorganic lithium electrolytes reaching 3.4 · 10−3 S/cm [4]. However, the total electrical properties are heavily impeded by high grain boundary resistance of 10−5 up to 10−6 S/cm [5,6]. LATP ceramics have been synthesised using several techniques, e.g. solid state reaction followed by sintering [7,4,3], ball-milling [8,9], solgel [10–12], co-precipitation [13] or crystallization of glass [14,15]. The latter approach, glass-ceramic route, requires preparing the glassy/structure of general amorphous analogue of intended composition and submitting it to controlled crystallization at a moderate temperature. In comparison to standard sintering method, the precipitation of LATP phase from glass is reputed to be responsible for further conductivity increase due to the porosity reduction and homogeneous microstructure which could be effectively controlled by appropriate heat treatment [16]. Several studies investigating the crystallization process in the Li2O–Al2O3–TiO2–P2O5 system have shown that with a careful crystallization control, a maximum conductivity of 10−3 S/cm can be obtained [17,18]. However, the precipitation of the main LATP phase is often corrupted by the formation of undesirable phases which hinder the migration of Li+ ions.To overcome this inconvenience, H. Chen et al. [19] proposed to add to the melt boron oxide, B2O3, a good glass former with a low melting point. They concluded that this modification improved the glass-forming tendency and promoted the precipitation of the LATP phase leading to a high conductivity value of 1.3 · 10−3 S/cm for a glass 14Li2O · 6Al2O3 · 3B2O3 · 38TiO2 · 39P2O5 crystallized at 900 °C for 12 h. The present work relates to the processing as well as thermal, structural and electrical characterization of glasses and glass-ceramics in the Li2O–Al2O3–B2O3–TiO2–P2O5 system. Three compositions of precursor glasses were chosen in which Al3+ content was fixed at 0.3 mol% while B3+ content varied from 0 to 0.3 mol%.
