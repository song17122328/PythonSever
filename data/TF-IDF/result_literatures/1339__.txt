The major difﬁculty in the development of ambient rechargeable sodium ion battery is the severe shortage of advanced sodium storage materials. NASICON-type Fe2(MoO4)3 has been identiﬁed as a potential candidate for sodium or lithium storage due to the cheap, non-toxic of iron and its open three dimensions framework. Manthiram and Goodenough ﬁrstly reported lithium insertion into Fe2(MoO4)3 [1]. Shirakawa et al. investigated the changes in electronic structure upon electrochemical lithium insertion into Fe2(MoO4)3 using X-ray absorption spectroscopy [2]. Nadiri et al. [3] and Bruce et al. [4] reported electrochemically and/or chemically sodium intercalation and deintercalation of Fe2(MoO4)3, respectively. In contrast of the single-step lithium insertion mechanism [1,2], two-step sodium insertion mechanism [3] into this compound were observed. It was found that 1.6 to 2 Na+ per formula unit (p.f.u.) could be reversibly injected into and removed from Fe2(MoO4)3. Nevertheless, these studies are still limited by the slow sodium insertion into Fe2(MoO4)3, which originates from the nature of two-phase reactions [4] and its low electric conductivity [5]. In order to overcome these limitations, a possible strategy to design electrodes with different morphologies and nanostructures commonly used in lithium ion batteries [6] is proposed. This method can dramatically shorten the ion diffusion and electron-transfer paths in the electrodes and enable improved electrochemical properties, such as larger capacities and better rate cyclic stabilities. Thus, it is reasonable to expect a better electrochemical performance of nanostructured Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode than its bulk counterpart. To our best knowledge, there are no available report on the cyclic stability of Fe2(MoO4)3 electrodes for sodium ion battery up to now. In this work,

Monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 powder was synthesized by a precipitation method [3,4]. (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was dissolved in water and acidiﬁed by nitric acid, into which stoichiometric amount of Fe(NO3)3 solution was slowly added under continuous stirring. The precipitate was then aged, ﬁltered, washed and calcinated at 600 °C to form the yellowish-green product. The as-prepared powders were pressed into targets for sputtering. Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlms were synthesized by a radio-frequency magnetron sputtering method. Stainless steel and Al were chosen as substrates of the electrodes for X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, respectively. Before the sputtering, the background vacuum of the chamber was evacuated below 5×10−4 Pa using a turbo-molecular pump and a mechanical pump. Argon and oxygen gas (pure 99.99%) with a ratio of 5:1 was continuously purged into the chamber while their total pressure was controlled at 2.5 Pa. The thickness of the as-deposited Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm was controlled by the typical deposition times 40 min after 5 min pre-sputtering and was measured to be about 300 nm by a proﬁlometer (Tencor Alpha-Step 200). The weight of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm was estimated by subtracting the original substrate weight from the total weight of the deposited thin ﬁlms with the substrate, which were all measured by an electrobalance (BP 211D, Sartorius).

For the electrochemical measurements, three-electrode cells were constructed using the ﬁlm as a working electrode and two sodium sheets as a counter electrode and a reference electrode, respectively. The electrolyte was consisted of 1 M NaClO4 (Aldrich) in a nonaqueous

solution of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with a volume ratio of 1:1 (Merck). The cells were assembled in an Ar ﬁlled glove box. Galavanostatic cycling measurements were carried out with a Land CT2001A battery testing system. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests were performed on a CHI660A electrochemical working station (CHI instruments, TN). XRD and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) measurements were carried out on a Rigata/max-C diffractometer using Cu–K radiation and a transmission electron microscope at 160 kV accelerating voltage (JEOL 2010 TEM), respectively. The morphologies of Fe2(MoO4)3 powder and thin ﬁlm are recorded by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Cambridge S-360). X-ray absorption

spectroscopy at the Mo and Fe K-edge of the samples were recorded at room temperature in transmission mode using ion chambers or in the ﬂuorescent mode with silicon drift ﬂuorescence detector at beamline BL14W1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. The station was operated with a Si(111) double crystal monochromater. During the measurements, the synchrotron was operated at energy of 3.5 GeV and a current between 150 and 210 mA. The photon energy calibrated with the ﬁrst inﬂection point of Mo and Fe K-edge in Mo and Fe foil, respectively.

XRD patterns of the as-prepared Fe2(MoO4)3 powder and thin ﬁlm are shown in Fig. 1(a). Standard XRD pattern from JCPDS ﬁle 32‐0552 is also included for reference. It can be observed that most of the peaks in both patterns can be well indexed to the reﬂections of monoclinic structure of Fe2(MoO4)3 with space group P21, apart from one marked with asterisk in the pattern of thin ﬁlm can be assigned to the diffraction of stainless steel substrate. These results suggest that a monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm could be prepared by radiofrequency magnetron sputtering of Fe2(MoO4)3 target. However, the thin ﬁlm exhibits different morphologies and nanostructures compared to the bulk material. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the as-prepared powders consist of very large particles in several micrometers. The as-sputtered thin ﬁlm is very smooth and is composed of grains of several hundred nanometers. These nano-sized grains in the thin ﬁlm are compactly packed.

Na storage behavior and cyclic performance of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm electrode were investigated by galvanostatic cycling measurements. Fig. 2(a) shows the ﬁrst ten charge/discharge proﬁles of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm/Na cell at a current rate of 1 C. The open circuit voltage (OCV) of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm/Na cell is 2.78 V. Two plateaus around 2.65 and 2.52 V are observed in each discharge proﬁle. The charge voltage proﬁles are nearly reversible with two plateaus around 2.56 and 2.69 V. The shapes of the cycling curves are similar as those observed in previous study [3]. The 1st, 2nd and 3th discharge capacities of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm are about 94, 91 and 90 mAh g−1, corresponding to about 2.0 Na+ p.f.u. In previous study, 1.6 Na+ p.f.u. was electrochemically inserted [3]. However, more than 2 Na+ p.f.u. can be chemically injected into Fe2(MoO4)3 [4]. The improved capacities of the thin ﬁlm electrode should be related to its nanostructure. The small voltage polarization between

the charge and discharge proﬁles of about 0.05 V is good for practical application. The corresponding speciﬁc capacities as a function of cycle number at 1 C are shown in Fig. 2(b). The cyclic performance is acceptable. The 1st charge capacity of thin ﬁlm electrode is 94 mAh g−1. The ﬁrst coulombic efﬁciency is about 98.2%, and the subsequent coulombic efﬁciencies can be kept around 100%. After the 100th cycles, a discharge capacity of 76 mAh g−1 is still obtained. The galvanostatic cycling from a Fe2(MoO4)3 powder electrode at 0.1 C is also included for comparison. The discharge capacity of the powder electrode decays rapidly. Although the powder electrode exhibits a discharge capacity of 83 mAh g−1 in the ﬁrst cycle, only around 25 mAh g−1 remains after 30 cycles under a low current rate of 0.1 C. Apparently, nanostructured thin ﬁlm electrode shows a larger capacity and better cyclic stability than the powder electrode. CV curves of the thin ﬁlm electrode between 1.5 and 3.5 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 2(c). Two cathodic current peaks at 2.62 and 2.50 V are observed in the ﬁrst reduction process and shifted to 2.64 V and 2.53 V in the subsequent ones. During all oxidation processes, there are two corresponding anodic peaks at 2.56 and 2.71 V. The intensities of peaks are well maintained in all subsequent cycles. These results are in a good agreement with the galvanostatic cycling proﬁles and indicate a reversible two-step electrochemical reaction mechanism of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm.

In order to understand the electrochemical reaction mechanism of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm with sodium, XAS and SAED measurements were carried out to determine the composition and structure changes during the electrochemical sodiation and desodiation of Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm. Fig. 3(a) shows the variation of Fe K-edge XAS for Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm electrodes at different states. For the initial thin ﬁlm, Fe K-edge absorption energy is observed at 7125.7 eV, which could be assigned to that of Fe2(MoO4)3 [2]. After the sodium ion is intercalated, the shape of the XANES spectrum of Fe K-edge is

different from that of the initial thin ﬁlm, and Fe K-edge absorption energy at 7120.8 eV is almost the same as that of Li2Fe2(MoO4)3 [2]. The Fe K-edge absorption energy shifted toward low energy of 5.1 eV, implying the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ during the electrochemical reaction of Fe2(MoO4)3 with Na. When charging the cell to 4.0 V, Fe K-edge absorption energy is close to that of the initial thin ﬁlm, conﬁrming the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the charge process. In addition, there are the same Mo K-edge absorption energies for the initial thin ﬁlm, discharging to 1.5 V and charging to 4.0 V (not shown). They can be assigned to be Mo6+. These results are similar to the XAS study for the lithium insertion into this compound [2], indicating that the electrochemical processes are primarily related to reductions and oxidations of iron ions and barely inﬂuence on electronic structure around molybdenum ions.

When the thin ﬁlm electrode was discharged to 1.5 V, there is no any diffraction peak in its XRD pattern, which might be due to the size of sodiated product less than X-ray coherence length (6 nm), and it could not be identiﬁed by XRD techniques. The nanocrystalline structure of the electrode was further revealed by SAED. As shown in Fig. 3(b1), several bright rings made up of discrete spots are related to the nanocrystalline nature of the materials. These concentric rings are unambiguously indexed to the diffractions of Na2Fe2(MoO4)3 phase (JCPDS 44‐0376). The SAED pattern after the thin ﬁlm electrode was recharged to 4.0 V (shown in Fig. 3(b2)) is made up of some discrete spots that are indexed to nanocrystalline Fe2(MoO4)3 (JCPDS 72‐0935). According to XAS and SAED data, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of thin ﬁlm Fe2(MoO4)3 with sodium can be expressed as follows:

The ﬁrst step occurs in the initial discharge process. It is an irreversible reaction with structure changes and produces nanosized Na2Fe2(MoO4)3. The subsequent cycling processes involve the second step which is the oxidation/reduction reaction between nanocrystalline Fe2(MoO4)3 and Na2Fe2(MoO4)3. This mechanism can well explain the high reversible capacity of 91 mAh g−1 in the galvanostatic cycling for thin ﬁlm electrode. The reason why Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm

has better cycling performance than the powder electrode should be related to its lower resistance. The thickness of a typical nanostructured thin-ﬁlm electrode here is about 300 nm, which could signiﬁcantly reduce the transportation and diffusion length of ions and electrons, thereby remarkably enhancing the kinetics of sodium storage. An in situ synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction study will be carried out to obtain more information on the structural variations of Fe2(MoO4)3 electrode during electrochemical processes in further work.

Overall, this work veriﬁes the possibility of sodium storage in nanostructured Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlm. It should be expected such material with other nanostructures have great potentials as promising candidates for sodium ion battery.

Monoclinic NASICON-type Fe2(MoO4)3 thin ﬁlms have been fabricated by sputtering powder target and tested as positive electrode materials for sodium ion battery. The thin ﬁlm electrodes exhibit high reversible capacities of around 91 mAh g−1. XAS directly conﬁrms that deintercalation/intercalation reactions of Na ions from/ into monoclinic NASICON structure proceeds while Fe2+/Fe3+ redox. The intercalation of Na ions into Fe2(MoO4)3 leads to the formation of nanocrystalline Na2Fe2(MoO4)3.
