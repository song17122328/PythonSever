Lithium solid electrolyte with NASICON structure in the form of Li1+2xAlxTi2-xSixP3-xO12 solid solution has been prepared by high temperature solid state reaction using low cost kaolin as the starting material.
The crystal structure of the solid solution was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction.
The AC impedance measurements indicate that ionic conductivity increased by more than one order of magnitude when a small amount of Al3+ and Si4+ ions were incorporated into the LiTi2(PO4)3 crystal structure.
The significant improvement on ionic conductivity can be attributed to the increased interstitial Li+ ions in the crystal structure.
The highest ionic conductivity was found in Li1.2Al0.1Ti1.9Si0.1P2.9O12: 8.3 x 10-5 S·cm-1 at room temperature (21°C) and 1.5 x 10-3 S·cm-1 at 100°C.
Lithium solid electrolyte with NASICON structure in the form of Li1+2xAlxTi2-xSixP3-xO12 solid solution can be prepared using low cost kaolin as the starting material.
Substitutions of Ti4+ ions with Al3+ ions and P5+ ions with Si4+ ions in the LiTi2(PO4)3 structure significantly increase ionic conductivity.
The enhanced conductivity is attributed to the combined effect of increasing Li+ ion concentration and decreasing activation energy.
Using kaolin as the starting material instead of pure oxides (Al2O3 and SiO2) improves powder sintering, resulting in reduced grain boundary resistance and higher ionic conductivity.
