The new scandium/aluminium co-doped NASICON phases Li1 + xAlyScx − yTi2 − x(PO4)3 (x 00.3, y 0 0,0.1,0.2,0.3) were prepared by mechanical milling followed by annealing of the mixtures at 950 °C. X-ray diffraction of all samples showed the formation of NASICON structure with space group R-3c along with a minor impurity. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray data was performed to identify the structural variation. Doping with Sc3+ caused elongation of aand caxes for all the compounds when compared with undoped LiTi2(PO4)3. The compound Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 showed a maximum of a08.5504(7), c020.986(3) Å at room temperature and exhibited highest coefficient of thermal expansion. The highest ionic conduc−1 was observed for Li1.3Sc0.3tivity (σ), 7.28×10 Ti1.7(PO4)3, two orders of magnitude higher than for the undoped phase.

conductor as the solid electrolyte. Compared to the significant and successful efforts on glassy lithium ionic conductors that led to materials suitable for all-solid-state lithium battery, little effort has been devoted into material developments concerning crystalline lithium ionic conductors during the last decade. On the other hand, crystalline ionic conductors have a number of advantages in conductivity and stability over glassy or polymer systems, i.e. crystalline copper and silver ionic conductors show extremely high conductivities even at room temperature, but no comparable “superionic” lithium solid electrolytes have been identified so far. Materials design of crystalline ionic conductors are based on certain structural criteria: (a) mobile ions should have a suitable size for conduction pathways in the lattice, (b) there should be disorder in the mobile ion sublattice, and (c) highly polarizable mobile ion and counterion sublattices are preferable. “Lithium superionic conductor” LISICON [Li14Zn(GeO4)4] is an example of a material which was designed using the above criteria. Many compounds with the same type of framework have been reported in the literature (see, e.g. [1–3]) and a wide range of solid solutions formed by aliovalent substitutions (introducing interstitial lithium ions or vacancies) led to high ionic conductivities at elevated temperatures. The conductivity values at room −6 S/cm for Li3.6Si0.6P0.4O4, for example) temperature (≈10 are however still by far lower than those of copper and silver ionic conductors.

In order to further enhance the ionic conductivity of these materials, glass ceramics have been explored which for Li2O-Al2O3-GeO2-P2O5 result in Li+ ion conductivities of −4 S/cm at room temperature [4, 5]. The high ionic about 10 conductivity of such glass ceramics was ascribed to the interface region between glassy and crystalline phases [6]. The high cation mobility and thermal stability of NASICON double phosphates allow us to consider them as

potential materials for use in electrochemical devices. LiTi2(PO4)3 with NASICON structure is built of two TiO6 octahedra linked via shared oxygen atoms with three PO4 tetrahedra. Doping by M 0 Al, Sc, Y, Fe, or Cr has been shown to be effective in enhancing Li+ ion transport in the NASICON-type phases Li1+xMxTi2−x(PO4)3. The influence of substituting Ti4+ to Sc3+ or Al3+ on structure and electric properties of the host compound LiTi2(PO4)3 provided was discussed in [7]. The lattice parameters and conductivity of rhombohedral Li1+xScx(or)AlxTi2−x(PO4)3 (where x00–0.3) depend on stoichiometric factor x; the maximum overall ionic conductivity at room temperature was found to be σ07×10

In this work we aim at the preparation of Li1+xAlyScx −yTi2−x(PO4)3 (x00.3, y00, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) crystalline compounds and understanding the link between the variations in structure variation of lattice parameters and ionic conductivity combining the experimental study with simple bond valence models of changes in the lithium ion transport pathways induced by the studied dopants.

Sample preparation and properties characterization

Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LA3T), Li1.3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LA2ST), Li 1 . 3Al 0 . 1Sc 0 . 2Ti 1 . 7(PO 4) 3 (LAS2T) and Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LS3T) polycrystalline electrolytes were prepared using analytical grade Li2CO3, NH4H2PO4, TiO2, Sc2O3, Al(OH)3 as starting materials. The starting materials were mechanically milled using an 85-ml zirconium bowl with 25 balls of 10 mm ø for 5 h at a speed of 300 rpm. The mixtures were heated in a platinum crucible at 950 °C for 18 h to remove all the volatile products and cooled to room temperature with natural cooling rate. The obtained samples were ground manually into fine powder. The samples were then characterized using X-ray powder diffractometry operated with Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical X’Pert PRO) equipped with a fast linear detector (X’Celerator). XRD data were collected in the 2θ range 10–100° with a nominal scan rate of 160 s/step and a step size of 0.017° in the temperature range of 30 °C to 350 °C. Rietveld refinements of XRD powder patterns are performed with the Generalized Structure Analysis System by Larson and von Dreele [8] along with the graphical user interface EXPGUI. Structure data from published neutron diffraction measurements by Alami et al. [9] for LiTi2(PO4)3 was used as the starting point of the refinement. Ionic conductivity measurements of the final samples different temperatures were carried out by impedance spectroscopy (Schlumberger Solartron SI1260) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz using sputtered gold (500 Å thick) as electrodes. At each temperature, the samples were kept for 20 min for thermal equilibration. The bulk resistance Rb was

determined from fitting an equivalent circuit consisting of Cb, Rb and a Warburg element to the impedance data. SEM photographs are collected for the same sample pellets used for the ionic conductivity study to clarify their morphology (JEOL JSM-6700F). In order to understand the transport mechanism of mobile ions in these systems bond valence (BV) calculations were applied to LiTi2(PO4)3. A brief outlook of the BV approach is given below; for more details, the reader is referred to our previous publications [10–17].

are widely used in crystal chemistry to identify equilibrium atomic sites as regions within a structure, where the bond valence (BV) sum of the atom approximately equals its oxidation state. In the case of Lithium solid electrolytes, the empirical BV parameters (R0 01.17 Å, b 00.516 Å [11]) permit to identify low energy interstitial sites as sites, where the interactions with all neighbouring oxygen anions yields approximately the BV sum 1. While bond valences, sLi-O, and hence the BV sum mismatch |ΔV| are mostly expressed in arbitrary “valence units”, they may—as we have shown recently—[14–17] be linked to an absolute energy scale by expressing the bond valence as a Morsetype interaction energy, E, given by:   E ¼ D0 ¼ D0 s2

here, srel 0 s/smin, where smin represents the BV for the equilibrium distance, Rmin. Rmin as well as the bond breaking energy D0 are estimated from the tabulated BV parameters and the typical coordination number of the cation, NC [15]. Note that the equilibrium distance Rmin is thus in general different from R0, the distance corresponding to a bond valence value of s01.

The modelling of pathways for mobile Li+ as regions of low site energy E(Li) (or of low BV sum mismatch, |ΔV(Li)|) connecting equilibrium and interstitial sites has been shown to provide a simple and reliable way of identifying transport pathways in local structure models, provided that the local structure model captures the essential structural features [17]. As described more in detail in our previous reports [13, 15], pathways for Li+ can be visualized as regions enclosed by isosurfaces of constant E(Li) based on a grid of E(Li) values with a resolution<0.1 Å covering the unit cell. The threshold value of E(Li), for which the E(Li) isosurfaces form a continuous migration pathway (that includes both occupied and vacant Li sites), allows for a rough estimate of the activation energy for the Li+ ion transport process.

X-ray diffraction patterns of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, Li1.3Al0.2 Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3, Li1.3Al0.1 Sc0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3, Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 showed crystalline nature of samples with R-3c space group, commonly known as NASICON phase. In the subsequent description we generally refer to the hexagonal setting of this space group. Diffraction patterns for the Li1. 3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3 sample showed a low intensity peak indicating the possibility of a minor secondary phase matching with TiP2O7. Matching of the peak positions for all these compounds with the reported NASICON structure for + LiTi2(PO4)3 indicates the successful doping of Sc3 +. As example, Figs. 1 and 2 show the Rietveld and Al3 refinements of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 and Li1.3Al0.2Sc0.1Ti1.7(PO4)3. The parameters resulting from the Rietveld refinements for the compounds under study are summarized and compared with undoped LiTi2(PO4)3 in Table 1. A 15 % replacement of Ti4+ (ionic radius 0.605 Å) by Al3+ (ionic radius 0.535 Å) reduced the volume of unit cell, when compared with LiTi2(PO4)3, whereas doping with Sc3+ (ionic radius 0.745 Å) increased the volume of the cell. Figure 3 shows the variation of lattice parameters and volume with temperature. Lattice parameter c-axis and volume V show increase monotonically till 350 °C (see Fig. 3b and c), but the a-axis showed non-linear expansion. The coefficient of thermal expansion is more for Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.3(PO4)3. Figure 4 shows as a representative example the dense morphology of the Li1.3Sc0.1Al0.2Ti1.7(PO4)3 sample consisting of an irregular orientation of isometric crystals of sizes ranging from 0.2– 3 μm.

Nyquist plots are obtained from impedance spectroscopy at selected temperatures and are fitted with equivalent circuit to determine the bulk resistance. The Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the conductivity (σ) for all the compounds under investigation, as derived from these impedance measurements, is summarized in the graph of Fig. 5. The activation energy (Ea) of Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 is 0.26 eV and is lowest among the compounds prepared

−4 (see with room temperature ionic conductivity 7.28×10 Table 2). The inset in Fig. 5 highlights that the variation of room temperature conductivity with the co-doping of Sc3+ is non-linear: compositions containing both dopants exhibit a lower conductivity than what could be expected from the interpolation of the two limiting single dopant cases. The detailed origin of such a mixed dopant effect will require further studies.

Figure 6 visualizes the structure of Li1Ti2(PO4)3, interstitial Li sites and the Li+ ion transport pathways as calculated using our BV approach. The LiTi2(PO4)3 structure is built of two TiO6 octahedra linked via shared oxygen atoms with three PO4 tetrahedra. In the ordered undoped structure, the Li ions fully occupy the regular I1 sites on the inversion centre octahedrally coordinated by 6 O atoms. The Li transport pathways connect two I1 sites via an interstitial site I2

(0.36, 0.36, 0.25). The alternation of these two types of sites along the conduction channels forms a three-dimensional network over which rapid ion transport occurs via an interstitial mechanism. An analogous transport mechanism is observed in the case of the doped compounds, except that the sites that were “interstitial” sites I, the undoped compound are now partly occupied in the doped Li-richer compounds.

As the concentration of Sc3+ increases, unit cell volume and ionic conductivity increased. This experimental finding harmonizes to the variation of Li site energies along the respective Li ion migration pathways derived from bond valence models for the compounds with different codopants (see Fig. 7). The lattice expansion associated to a replacement of the small dopant ion Al3+, by the isovalent larger dopant Sc3+ reduces both the activation energy for reaching the interstitial site and the site energy of this

interstitial. The activation energies calculated from the energy variation along these paths are semi-quantitatively in line with the experimental values (cf. Table 2). The high cation mobility and thermal stability of NASICON double phosphates allow us to regard them as potential materials for use in electrochemical devices. Obviously, the increase in unit cell volume due to the doping with the large Scandium ion facilitates Li+ ion motion via increasing the free volume and—as already suggested by Bykov et al. [18]—widens oxygen windows, the critical bottlenecks for Li ion migration. Conductivity variations observed in this work are qualitatively in line with previous report, yet the conductivity values are lower than the values from an earlier report [19].

Li1+xAlyScx−yTi2−x(PO4)3 (x00.3, y00,0.1,0.2,0.3) NASICON compounds were prepared by mechanical milling followed by annealing of the samples. Among the investigated samples Li1.3Sc0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 with NASICON type structure −4 S/cm) and lowest showed highest ionic conductivity (~10 activation energy 0.26 eV and has high thermal coefficient of expansion. BVanalysis showed that in all these structures the Li ions fully occupy the regular I1 sites on the inversion centre coordinated by six oxygen atoms and partially occupy the I2 site that is a vacant interstitial site in the undoped Li1Ti2(PO4)3. The Li transport pathways connect two I1 sites via the I2 site. The alternation of these two types of sites along the conduction channels forms a three-dimensional network over which rapid ion transport occurs. While doping by the slightly smaller Al3+ essentially affects the concentration of interstitials, doping with Sc3+ expands the structure and thereby lowers the site energy of the I2 sites and the energy barriers along the path between

“interstitial” and regular Li sites. For the co-doped samples, the conductivity enhancement varies non-linearly with the volume expansion: a significant enhancement in conductivity is only achieved when the unit cell volume is increased to values beyond the volume of the undoped Li1Ti2(PO4)3.
