Rare-earth (Ce3+or Eu3+) or alkali-earth metal (Mn2+) doped Na3Al2(PO4)3 phosphor powder were prepared by a combustion method. Regardless of the dopants, the Na3Al2(PO4)3 was shown to crystallize as hexagonal (rhombohedral) NASICON phase with spheroidal micron sized particles based upon X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data. As conﬁrmed by thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) data, the powders were stable at high temperatures up to 900 ◦C. A broad UV emission (with maximum at 328 nm) associated with the 5d→ 4f transition of Ce3+ was observed from Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+ while Mn2+ and Eu3+ doping showed stable green and red photoluminescence emission at 515 and 615 nm, respectively. For different molar concentrations of rareearth/alkali-earth metal dopants, the PL intensity was shown to increase to a certain concentration before quenching occurred at higher concentrations. The structure and optical properties of these phosphors were evaluated.

Phosphate compounds are known as multifunctional materials. In particular, orthophosphate have been extensively investigated due to their structural diversity. Phosphate are used as elements of optical devices, ﬂuorescent lamps, plasma panel display, super ionic conductors (NASICON) and matrices for long time storage of many radioactive substances waste, etc. [1–5]. Recently, it has been found that NASICON also has luminescence characteristics and there are limited reports on this effect in the literature [6–8]. NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor) is a name of compounds has a three-dimensional framework structure and possesses a high Na ionic conductivity [9]. NASICON compounds are characterized by an anionic framework of PO4 or SiO4 tetrahedral linked by shared oxygen ions to octahedral frame [10]. These properties make it suitable for use in electrochemical devices [11]. Beside this to investigate the luminescent mechanism of NASICON, He et al. [6] reported the PL properties of un-doped and doped-NASICON materials. Hirayama et al. [7] and Masui et al. [12] reported Eu2+ emission in A0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) phosphors with the NASICON structure. Mouline et al. [13] reported the copper(I) and manganese(II) luminescence in NASICON-type structure CuI 0.25Zr2(PO4)3, which crystallizes in the rhombohedral (hexagonal cell) system with the efﬁcient energy transfer from Cu+ → Mn2+ site. Chukova et al. [14] reported the possibility of incorporation of the f-elements impurities rare-earth elements (Dy, Sm, Nd) into NASICON matrix of the phosphates. Traditionally, rare-earths doped phosphate phosphors with general formulas such as MLnP2O7 [15], M3Ln(PO4)2 [16], and MLn(PO3)4 [17] (M, alkali metal; Ln, rare-earth metal) were prepared by the solid state reaction method, which demands longer reaction times and higher annealing temperatures. Today, low temperature methods such as hydrothermal microwave [18], co-precipitation [19,20], sol–gel [21,22] and combustion [23] are used to prepare these phosphors. These methods are relatively cost-effective, quick and can be easily exploited to prepare phosphors with enhanced optical properties. In this study, the low cost combustion method was used to prepare sodium aluminium triphosphate (Na3Al2(PO4)3) doped with rare-earth (Ce3+ or Eu3+) or alkali-earth metal (Mn2+) ion activators. Na3Al2(PO4)3 belongs to a family of triphosphate materials that +(Me3+)2(Me5+O4)3, can be represented by a general formula Me3 where Me+ = Na, Li, Ag or K; Me3+ = Ga, Cr, Fe, Al, Sc or In; and Me5+ = As or P [24]. Both amorphous [25,26] and crystalline [27,28] Na3Al2(PO4)3 structure have been reported. Na3Al2(PO4)3 can crystallize in a NASICON (sodium super ionic conductor)-like or garnet-like structure. The Na3Al2(PO4)3 synthesized in this study resembles the low pressure NASICON-like polymorph with rhombohedral (hexagonal) reported in Ref. [27]. This polymorph was doped with different molar concentrations Ce3+, Eu3+ or Mn2+ to make phosphors that might be used in light emitting devices of different types including ionizing radiation detectors (Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+), ﬂuorescent lamps, light emitting diodes and plasma display panels (PDP) (Na3Al2(PO4)3:Mn2+ and Na3Al2(PO4)3:Eu3+).

The Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+/Eu3+/Mn2+ phosphors were prepared via the combustion method. The starting AR grade materials with 99.99% purity used for the preparation were sodium nitrate (NaNO3), aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2(PO4)), europium nitrate Eu(NO3)3, cerium nitrate Ce(NO3)3, and manganese acetate ((CH3COO)2Mnx·4H2O). Urea (NH2CONH2) and ammonium nitrate NH4NO3 were, respectively, used as fuel and ﬂux for the synthesis. Appropriate amounts of in metrological proportions these were taken stoichiometrically, were homogenized thoroughly and were ground using a mortar and pestle for 30 min. The mixture was stirred for about 30 min, then heated rapidly at ∼600 ◦C, underwent dehydration followed by decomposition generating combustible gases. The volatile and/or combustible gases such as N2, H2O and nascent O2 escaped from a ﬁring container leaving behind voluminous foaming ﬁne powder occupying the entire volume of the container. The basic combustion reaction for the formation of Na3Al2(PO4)3 can be described by the following equation:

The dopant concentrations were varied between 0.5 and 5 mol% for Ce3+, 0.2 and 2 mol% for Eu3+ and 5 and 15 mol% for Mn2+.

Several complementary techniques were used to characterize the prepared samples. The crystalline structure was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) using PAN Analytical X’pert Pro XRD diffractometer (Cu K˛ radiation) at a scanning step of 0.01◦, and counting time of 20 s in the 2 range of 10–80◦. The morphology of the powders was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a JEOL JSM 6380A microscope and the powders were sputter coated with platinum to minimize charging. The photoluminescence measurement (excitation and emission) was recorded in the Shimadzu RF5301PC spectroﬂuorophotometer ﬁtted with a sensitive photomultiplier tube. This spectroﬂuorophotometer provides corrected emission and excitation spectra in the 220–400 and 300–700 nm ranges, respectively, with spectral slit width of 1.5 nm. The same amount of sample (2 mg) was used for each measurement. Thermal analysis was performed with PerkinElmer thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The spectra were recorded in the atmosphere of argon between 30 and 900 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦C min−1.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns from un-doped Na3Al2(PO4)3 powder. The patterns were matched with hexagonal (rhombohedral) symmetry of Na3Al2(PO4)3 referenced in JCPDS card No. 31-1265. These patterns are consistent with the ball and stick model of the rhombohedral NASICON structure of Na3Al2(PO4)3 proposed by Shrivastava et al. [29]. Based upon ionic radii, Ce3+/Eu3+ [30] and Mn2+ are expected to substitute Al3+ in the lattice resulting in six and four coordination sites, respectively to bind up with PO4. Similar framework structures were reported in Refs. [30,31]. XRD crystallography data of Na3Al2(PO4)3 lattices are listed in Table 1. The experimental values of d-spacing compare reasonably well with theoretical values as shown in Table 2. For more profound structural elucidation of Na3Al2(PO4)3 the reader is referred to the literature cited [27,29]. The SEM images in Fig. 2 show that the particles were spheroidal in shape and the average particle size was estimated to be 0.1–0.4 ␮m in diameter.

The TGA (solid line) and DTA (dashed line) curves of Na3Al2(PO4)3 host lattice are presented in Fig. 3. The TGA data show that the weight loss occurred in three steps which include the exothermic effect. The ﬁrst signiﬁcant weight loss occurred at 200 ◦C and it can be attributed to evaporation of 3–4 wt% residual moisture or solvent. The second loss at ∼500 ◦C may be due to evaporation of moisture absorbed during the thermal treatment of the gel at 600 ◦C. The exothermic heat ﬂow peaks at 600 and 800 ◦C may be due to the increase in crystallinity as a minor impurity phase vanishes at high temperatures. The DTA curve shows that endothermic effects were observed at 50 and 300 ◦C. These peaks may be associated with the detectable change in weight loss. The dehydration decreased slowly and the endothermic curve appeared to be linear after 300 ◦C suggesting that the phosphor was stable and there was no further weight loss up to 900 ◦C. The total weight loss was nearly 5%, which shows that this phosphor was thermally stable and did not decomposing over the 30–900 ◦C temperature range.

Photoluminescence excitation (1) and emission (2) spectra of Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+ powder phosphor are shown in Fig. 4. The emission spectra were measured for the different Ce3+ concentrations as indicated. The emission spectrum (excited at 242 nm) has a maximum at 328 nm and a shoulder at 350 nm due to the crystal ﬁeld splitting of the 4f ground state. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4, the emission occurs from the lowest component of the 5d conﬁguration to the two-crystal ﬁeld split levels (2F5/2 and 2F7/2) of the 4f ground state. The PL excitation at 242 nm in spectrum (1) is for the 328 nm UV emission. The PL emission intensity was shown to increase with concentration from 0.5 to 2 mol% of Ce3+ and quenching occurred at 5 mol% of Ce3+ as shown in Fig. 5. This decrease in the PL intensity is due to concentration quenching effects. The observed Ce3+ emission in this phosphor can be used in scintillators according to an energy transfer process explained by Lempicki et al. [32] and Wojtowicz et al. [33,34]. According to this process, Ce3+ captures primary excitation energy (hv) and becomes Ce4+. After capturing a free electron (ec) from the conduction band, Ce4+ will be converted to an excited Ce3+ ion or (Ce3+)*. Relaxation to the ground state will be accompanied by emission of the scintillation photon hv. This process can be summarized as follows: Ce3+ + h 4) → Ce4+ Ce4+ + ec → (Ce3+ (Ce3+.

Figs. 6 and 7 represent the PL excitation and emission spectra of Na3Al2(PO4)3:Eu3+ powder phosphors, respectively. The emission spectra are from the different Eu3+ concentrations as indicated. The PL excitation spectrum is broad and maximizes at 243 nm. This excitation can be ascribed to the Eu3+ → O2− charge transfer transition. This transition should be followed by nonradiatiave relaxation to the 5DJ (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .) levels and then radiative transitions from the 5D0 to 7FJ levels of the ground state. The PL emission spectrum of Fig. 7 consists of major line emission at 615 nm and minor emission at 593 nm which can be ascribed to the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions of Eu3+, respectively. The inset of Fig. 7 is a simpliﬁed energy level diagram showing non-radiative transitions from charge transfer states followed by radiative transitions from the 5D0 to the ground state. A plot of maximum PL intensity versus concentration in Fig. 8 shows that the intensity increased with concentration from 0.5 to 1 mol% of Eu3+and it decreased slightly when the concentration was increased to 2 mol%. The fact that the excitation wavelength ( 5)exc = 243 nm) of the Na3Al2(PO4)3:Eu3+ is similar to the discharge wavelength of the ﬂuorescent mercury lamp suggests that this material can be used as a lamp phosphor. Fig. 9 shows the PL excitation (1) and emission (2) spectra from Na3Al2(PO4)3:Mn2+ powder phosphors. The emission spectra obtained from different Mn2+ concentrations, as indicated. Stable green emission was observed at 515 nm when the powder was excited at 288 nm. This emission can be ascribed to the 4T1 → 6A1 transition of the Mn2+ ion shown in inset of Fig. 9. A visible emission from Mn2+ ion may vary from green to orangered [35,36] depending on the site occupied by the ion in a host matrix. The green emission is often obtained at 512 nm when Mn2+ occupies a site which is considerably larger than its radius [37]. A plot of maximum PL intensity versus concentration in Fig. 10 shows that the intensity increased with concentration from 5 to 15 mol% of Mn2+and it decreased slightly when the concentration was increased to 15 mol%. Photoluminescence application of Na3Al2(PO4)3:Mn2+ phosphate is strongly more promising at shorter wavelengths than that of the existing ZnS:Mn EL displays. Which should be a candidate to realize the advanced all solid state extremely reliable and colour displays for multi-media use.

The present data shows that Na3Al2(PO4)3, Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+, Na3Al2(PO4)3:Mn2+ and Na3Al2(PO4)3:Eu3+ phosphors can be easily prepared by the combustion method. The XRD data conﬁrmed the formation of crystalline Na3Al2(PO4)3 host lattice having hexagonal (rhombohedral) symmetry NASICON-type with spheroidal particles of 0.1–0.4 ␮m size. TG/DTA results show the phosphor was stable at higher temperature of up to 900 ◦C. The matrix was shown to be chemically stable and seems to be suitable for hosting rare-earths or alkali-earth metal ions for preparation of phosphors. The PL data suggest that dominant Na3Al2(PO4)3:Ce3+ may be used in scintillators (ionizing radiation), while Na3Al2(PO4)3:Eu3+ and Na3Al2(PO4)3:Mn2+ may be used in phosphor lamps, PDP and solid state lighting devices.
