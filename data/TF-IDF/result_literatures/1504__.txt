Carbon coated Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode material was prepared by a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) assisted sol–gel method. PVA was used both as the gelating agent and the carbon source. XRD analysis showed that the material was well crystallized. The particle size of the material was ranged between 200 and 500 nm. HRTEM revealed that the material was covered by a uniform surface carbon layer with a thickness of 80 Å. The existence of surface carbon layer was further conﬁrmed by Raman scattering. The electrochemical properties of the material were investigated by charge–discharge cycling, CV and EIS techniques. The material showed good cycling performance, which had a reversible discharge capacity of 100 mAh g−1 when cycled at 1 C rate. The apparent Li+ diffusion coefﬁcients of the material ranged between 9.5× 10−10 and 0.9× 10−10 cm2 s−1, which were larger than those of olivine LiFePO4. The large lithium diffusion coefﬁcient of Li3V2(PO4)3 has been attributed to its special NASICON-type structure.

Polyanion phosphate materials including LiCoPO4 [1], LiFePO4 [2], LiMnPO4 [3] and Li3V2(PO4)3 [4–7] have been intensively studied as alternative cathode materials to LiCoO2 for lithium ion batteries. Among these materials, monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 has the largest theoretical capacity, which is 197 mAh g−1 based on all of the three Li+ ions extracted from the material lattice. This process occurs in the potential window of 3.0–4.8 V vs. Li/Li+. However, extraction of the third Li+ ion is kinetically difﬁcult due to the much lower electronic/ionic conductivity of the end-member of V2(PO4)3 [5]. Therefore, for practical uses Li3V2(PO4)3 is usually cycled in 3.0–4.3 V vs. Li/Li+. Two-thirds of the Li+ ions can be reversibly extracted/inserted in this potential window, giving rise to a theoretical capacity of 133 mAh g−1.

Monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 has a NASICON-type structure. This structure enables Li+ ions to transport in a three-dimensional pathway, which leads to fast Li+ diffusion. However, as most of polyanion cathode materials, the separated [VO6] octahedra in Li3V2(PO4)3 also reduces the electronic conductivity of the material [5], which has been an intrinsic drawback to its practical applications. In order to increase the electronic conductivity, it is a common practice to prepare carbon coated materials. A thin carbon layer can provide a path for electrons without blocking access for Li+ ions. The effectiveness of surface carbon depends on the type and amount of the carbon source used. Carbon coated Li3V2(PO4)3 have been prepared using various carbon sources, which include citric acid, starch, PVDF [8], glucose, humic acid, carbon [9] and PEG [10]. In this study, we introduced a simple sol–gel method to prepare carbon coated Li3V2(PO4)3 using poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) as the carbon source. PVA is known as an aliphatic polymer with a carbon chain backbone with hydroxyl groups attached to methane carbons. The hydroxyl groups can interact with metal ions. This interaction and the random arrangement of polymer chain enhance the mixing of metal ions. Therefore, the precursor can form a homogeneous single phase with precise stoichiometry at low temperatures in a relatively short time. LiFePO4/C [11] and LiTi2(PO4)3/C [12] composites prepared using PVA have shown high initial discharge capacities and good rate capability. We expect that the carbon coated Li3V2(PO4)3 prepared by this method will show satisfactory electrochemical performance.

For the preparation of carbon coated Li3V2(PO4)3, Li2CO3 (Bicr, >99.0%), NH4H2PO4 (Bicr, >99.0%) and NH4VO3 (Scrri, >99.5%) were used as the starting materials. PVA-2000 (Aldrich) was employed both as the gelating agent and the carbon source. First, stoichiometric Li2CO3, NH4H2PO4 and NH4VO3 powders were mixed intimately and dissolved in deionized water. Then, 5 wt.% of PVA-2000 was added to the above solution. This solution was constantly stirred at 80 ◦C for 6 h, and then dried at 120 ◦C to get a homogeneous precursor. The precursor was pressed into tablet and then heat treated at 750 ◦C for 4 h in N2 atmosphere. The product was removed from the furnace after cooling to room temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on an SDTA851E thermoanalyzer using a heating rate of 10 ◦C min−1. The crystal structure of the material was studied by X-ray diffraction on a Rigaku AXS D8 diffractometer with Cu K␣ radiation. The diffraction data was recorded in the 2 range of 10–60◦ with a scan rate of 2◦ min−1. Raman scattering spectroscopy was recorded on a Renishaw invia Raman microscope with Ar-ion laser excitation ( 3) = 514.5 nm). The morphology of the material was studied with a JSM-6700F scanning electron microscope (SEM). The microstructure of the material was analyzed on a JEM-2100F highresolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) operated with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The particle size distribution was examined by dynamic light-scattering particle size analyzer (Malvern, Zetasizer Nano ZS). The electronic conductivity of the material was measured on a Keithley 2400 Source Meter by the van der Pauw method. The sample was pressed into tablet with diameter of 8 mm and thickness of 2 mm under 15 MPa, followed by heat treatment at 200 ◦C for 1 h. Both surfaces of the tablet were covered by silver paste which served as the current collector.

Electrochemical experiments were carried out using a twoelectrode coin battery. A metallic lithium foil was served as the anode electrode. The cathode electrode was prepared by blending 75 wt.% of active material, 10 wt.% of acetylene black and 15 wt.% of poly-vinylideneﬂuoride binder (PVDF). The electrolyte was 1 mol L−1 lithium hexaﬂuorophosphate (LiPF6) dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (EC:DMC = 1:1, by v/v ratio). Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was performed on a Land® automatic battery tester in the potential window of 3.0–4.3 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were studied on a ZAHNER®-IM6e electrochemical workstation. The CV measurement was performed in the potential window of 3.0–4.3 V using different scan rates from 0.1 to 0.4 mV s−1. The impedance data were recorded in an ac voltage of 5 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz.

Fig. 1 shows the TGA curve of the precursor material which was heated between 25 and 900 ◦C under N2 ﬂow. The weight loss before 220 ◦C is attributed to the evaporation of water and ammonia from the precursor. The TGA plot between 220 and 530 ◦C ﬁt well with that of the pyrolysis process of PVA in previous reports [13]. The observance of multiple weight loss steps is attributed to the continuous elimination of H and O, causing higher and higher carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) ratios in the pyrolysis residue. Brieﬂy, the weight loss in the temperature region of 220–300 ◦C is accompanied by a rapid chain-stripping elimination of water. In this region, one could observe melting of the precursor which caused the precursor to foam or intumesce. The weight loss between 300 and 400 ◦C is attributed to a set of complex reactions including Diels-Alder reaction, intramolecular crystallization and radical reactions et al. After the pyrolysis reaction, the C/H ratio of the residue increased from 0.50 in the original PVA to 1.00 in the 400 ◦C residue. When the precursor was heat treated between 400 and 530 ◦C, carbonization reaction took place leading to the formation of polycrystalline carbon. With further heating, another slight weight loss about 2 wt.% is observed between 530 and 710 ◦C. This could be due to the transformation of V5+ ions to V3+ ions under the reductive effects of carbon, accompanied by the release of carbon oxides. The TGA curve becomes ﬂat above 710 ◦C, indicating the completion of the entire reaction.

Fig. 2 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the asprepared material. The intense diffraction peaks indicates a good crystallinity of the material. The material can be indexed well on the basis of monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 with space group of P21/n. The Miller indexes are added in the XRD pattern. The lattice parameters of the material are calculated to be a = 8.618(1) Å, b = 8.604(3) Å, c = 12.057(7) Å, ˇ = 90.54(4)◦ and V = 899.13(3) Å3, which are consistent with the previous reports [4,5]. The mean coherent domain size of the material is about 50 nm estimated by the Scherrer’s formula using the JADE 6.5 Program which taking account of all the major diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern [14]. The typical (0 0 2) diffraction line of crystallized graphite carbon, which should appear at 2 ≈ 26◦, is not observed from the XRD pattern. This provides evidence that the residual carbon in the material is in amorphous state.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM image (Fig. 3a) and the particle size distribution pattern (Fig. 3b) of the material. It can be seen that the material is consisted of crystalline particles. Most of the particles are distributed in the range of 200–500 nm. The average particle size is measured to be 320 nm. Some of the particles are agglomerated to form larger secondary particles. Fig. 4 shows the HRTEM image of an individual Li3V2(PO4)3 particle, from which a surface ﬁlm could be clearly seen. This surface ﬁlm could be divided into two sections. The ﬁrst section with a thickness of 60 Å is attributed to the surface carbon layer, while the second section with a thickness of 20 Å could be regarded as the interface region between the Li3V2(PO4)3 body and the surface carbon. In the body part of the particle, the clear lattice fringes with interplannar distance of 5.4 Å is in accordance with the d-spacing of the (1 1 1) planes of Li3V2(PO4)3. No lattice fringes are observed from the surface carbon layer, indicating its amorphous nature. In order to determine the amount of residual carbon in the material, TGA analysis was carried out by heating the material under O2 ﬂow. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1, the abrupt weight loss between 450 and 600 ◦C is attributed to the reaction of residual carbon with oxygen, indicating that the residual carbon in the material is 3.1 wt.%. In addition, the residual carbon was also measured from gravimetric analysis after dissolution of the material in a hydrochloric solution. This gives a result of 3.5 wt.%, which ﬁt well with the TGA analysis. Since carbon has much higher electronic conductivity (10−2 to 103 S cm−1) [15] than Li3V2(PO4)3 (2.4× 10−7 S cm−1) [6], the surface carbon layer on Li3V2(PO4)3 particles signiﬁcantly improves the electronic conductivity of Li3V2(PO4)3 to 2.3× 10−3 S cm−1, which is four orders of magnitude higher than pure Li3V2(PO4)3.

Raman scattering has been used to study the surface properties of the material. The penetration depth for carbon with Ar-ion laser is approximate 30 nm [16]. This is much thicker than the carbon ﬁlm deposited on the Li3V2(PO4)3 particles in case of an uniform distribution, so that any screening effect of carbon on the Li3V2(PO4)3 spectrum is not expected. However, carbon is a very strong photon scatter. Therefore, the collected Raman signals should basically represent the scattering of surface carbon. Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectrum of the material. There are no obvious Raman peaks near 600 cm−1. This conﬁrms the absence of any hydrogenated carbon (C-H) in the material [17], indicating a complete pyrolysis of PVA during material preparation. There are two weak Raman bands at 990 and 1065 cm−1, which correspond to the symmetrical stretching vibrations of the PO4 groups in Li3V2(PO4)3 [18]. The Raman spectrum is dominated by two intense broad bands at 1596 and 1358 cm−1, which can be ﬁtted by four Gaussian curves as shown in Fig. 5. In these Gaussians, the structure at 1584 cm−1 mainly corresponds to the G line associated with the E2g zone-center mode of crystalline graphite, and the broad band at 1377 cm−1 is assigned to the D line associated with the disorder-allowed zone-edge modes of graphite [19]. The intensity ratio of the D and G lines, ID/IG, can be used to analyze the fraction of graphite-like carbon in the material. In this study, the ID/IG value of the D/G lines is 0.98, which is similar to those of LiFePO4/C composites prepared by different carbon sources [20]. This indicates that the fraction of graphite-like carbon in the residual carbon is about 50%. However, this result does not mean that there are long-range-ordering graphite domains in the residual carbon. Actually, the graphite crystallites in the residual carbon are very small and arrange in a disordered manner [19]. For this reason, it is hardly to detect any graphite crystallites from X-ray diffraction.

Fig. 6 displays the charge–discharge potential proﬁles of the material between 3.0 and 4.3 V. The material shows three potential plateaus, which are located at ∼3.6, 3.7 and 4.1 V, respectively. These potential plateaus are attributed to the two-phase transitions of Li3V2(PO4)3 during electrochemical reaction. The material exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 129, 123 and 117 mAh g−1 when cycled at the C/10, C/2 and 1C rates, which correspond to 98%, 93% and 89% of its theoretical capacity, respectively, based on the removal of two Li+ ions. Fig. 7 shows the rate dependent cycling performance of the material. The material exhibits satisfying capacity retention. The 1C rate capacity after 80 cycles is about 100 mAh g−1. In addition, the columbic efﬁciency of the material is close to 100% during the whole cycling, highlighting good electrochemical reversibility. Fig. 8 shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the Li3V2(PO4)3 electrode after 50 cycles. It can be seen that the material still keeps its monoclinic structure, without any signiﬁcant impurity phases. The lattice parameters of the material after 50 cycles are a = 8.581(9) Å, b = 8.603(2) Å, c = 12.039(5) Å, ˇ = 90.154(3)◦ and V = 889.25(9) Å3. There is a slight decrease about 1% in the unit cell volume with respect to the as-prepared material. Such phenomena may originate from a minor irreversible Li+ intercalation after long-term cycling, which results in a nonstoichiometric composition of Li3− 4)V2(PO4)3. The decrease in the unit cell volume is also correlated with the capacity fading of the material.

Fig. 9 displays the CV curves of the material at varies scan rates in the potential window of 3.0–4.3 V. The CV curves are composed of three redox couples which are labeled as a/a 6), b/b 6) and c/c 6), respectively. These redox couples are assigned to the extraction/insertion of the Li+ ions in the 5-fold coordinated Li (3) and 4-fold coordinated Li (1) sites, respectively [5]. Since only two Li+ ions are removed, all of the three current peaks are assigned to the V3+/V4+ redox couple. As evident in Fig. 9, as the scan rate increases, the cathodic and anodic peaks move to lower and higher potentials, respectively, with the increase of the peak current. The electrode polarization, i.e., the potential gap between redox couples, becomes larger and larger from the couple a/a 6) to b/b 6) then to c/c 6). For instance, the electrode polarization increases from 0.12 to 0.13 V and ﬁnally to 0.14 V at the scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. This indicates that the electrochemical kinetics of the material becomes more and more difﬁcult with Li+ extraction. The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient of Li+ ions, DLi, can be calculated from the CV measurements. In the case of semiinﬁnite and ﬁnite diffusion, the peak current Ip can be expressed by the equation, Ref [21]:where n is the number of electrons per species reaction, for Li+ ions it is 1; S is the active surface area of the electrode which is 10 mm2 in this work; C is the concentration of Li+ ions in the cathode electrode, for instance, C = 1.11× 10−2 mol cm−3 at the peak-c where the chemical composition of the active material is Li1.5V2(PO4)3; Ip is the peak current in the unit of A; and v is the scan rate in the unit of V s−1.

At very slow scan rates Li+ ions accumulate in the bulk of the electrode and in this case Ip varies linearly with v1/2. Based on this, one can calculate the DLi values using Eq. (1). However, it is noticed from Fig. 9 that the peak-a and -b tend to merge each other with the increasing of scan rate. This could be due to the effect of electrochemical hysteresis as suggested by West et al. [22]. Therefore, using CV technique it is difﬁcult to obtain reliable DLi values of the peak-a and -b. In this work, we select the peak-c and -c 6), which are single peaks in the CV curve, to calculate the DLi values. As shown in Fig. 10, Ip is indeed proportional to v1/2 conﬁrming a diffusion-controlled behavior. From the slope of the linear ﬁt, we have calculated the DLi values at the peak-c and -c 6) to be 1.51× 10−10 and 0.88× 10−10 cm2 s−1, respectively. The DLi values at these redox peaks are very close, indicating good electrochemical reversibility of the Li3V2(PO4)3 material.

Fig. 11 shows the Nyquist plots of the material at different state of charge (SOC), i.e., x = 0.4, 0.7 and 1.2 in Li3−xV2(PO4)3, respectively. These SOCs approximately correspond to the peak-a, -b and -c in the CV curves. As seen in the ﬁgure, an intercept at the Zreal axis in high frequency corresponds to the ohmic resistance (Re) of the battery, which contains the resistance of electrolyte, separator, electrode, etc. The depressed semicircle in the middle frequency range is attributed to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the double layer capacitance. The inclined line in the low frequency region represents the Warburg impedance (Zw), which is associated with the Li+ ion diffusion in the Li3−xV2(PO4)3 particles. The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient of Li+, DLi, can be calculated by EIS technique. There are two well known models to calculate the DLi values from EIS data, which include, Ref. [23]:

It is obvious that Eq. (2) is not suitable for the case of Li3V2(PO4)3 because the titration potential curve of Li3V2(PO4)3 is very ﬂat, which makes dE/dı close to zero. Therefore, in this study we use Eq. (3) to calculate the DLi values. In this equation, R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, F the Faraday constant; and  4) is the Warburg factor which obeys the following relationship: Zreal = Re + Rct +  4)ω−1/2(4) Fig. 12 displays the linear ﬁtting of Zreal vs. ω−1/2, from which the slope  4) can be obtained. Using this  4) value it is possible to calculate the lithium diffusion coefﬁcients of the material. The results showed that the DLi values at different SOCs are 9.5× 10−10 cm2 s−1 (x = 0.4), 2.3× 10−10 cm2 s−1 (x = 0.7) and 0.9× 10−10 cm2 s−1 (x = 1.2), respectively. The DLi value at x = 1.2 is consistent with that calculated by CV analysis. In addition, the decrease of DLi values indicates that the electrochemical kinetics becomes more and more difﬁcult with Li+ extraction.

It is noticed that both Li3V2(PO4)3 and LiFePO4 phosphates undergo two-phase transformations during electrochemical process. However, the apparent diffusion coefﬁcients of Li3V2(PO4)3 are larger than those of olivine LiFePO4, which have been reported to be in the range of 10−13 to 10−18 cm2 s−1 obtained by several groups using different techniques [25–28]. This indicates that Li3V2(PO4)3 could be a very promising cathode material for highpower lithium ion batteries. The large lithium diffusion coefﬁcient of Li3V2(PO4)3 is closely related to its special NASICON-type structure. In this structure, the Li+ ions can be “freely” transported in a three-dimensional pathway. In addition, the “V2(PO4)3” framework can be perfectly reserved during Li+ extraction [5]. The phase transformations are mainly due to the Li+ re-ordering in different sites, not to changes in lattice framework. This fundamentally facilitates the two-phase transformations of the material, which leads to fast Li+ diffusion.

We successfully prepared Li3V2(PO4)3 cathode material using a simple PVA assisted sol–gel method. The material was covered by a uniform thin surface carbon layer, which increased the electronic conductivity of Li3V2(PO4)3 by four orders of magnitude. The material exhibited high speciﬁc capacity, stable capacity retention and good rate cyclability. The lithium diffusion coefﬁcients of Li3V2(PO4)3 were larger than those of olivine LiFePO4, which makes it very promising for high-power lithium ion batteries.
