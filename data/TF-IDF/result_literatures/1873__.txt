Open framework phosphates containing transitions elements are of particular interest because of their high chemical activity and thermal stability. The chemical activity of these compounds is a result of the ability of transition metals to realize more than one oxidation state, which facilitates reversible oxidation redox reactions. Structures of these phosphates are generally based on complex frameworks built of BO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra.
Recently, a particular interest was taken in the phosphate with Nasicon-type materials especially those containing, within the framework, elements ~e.g., Ti, Fe, Nb, Sn,...! which can have more than one oxidation state ~Rodriguo and Alamo, 1991; Padhi et al., 1997; Ayyappan et al., 2000; Aatiq et al., 2001!. Up to now, neither intensities nor observed or calculated 2uvalues are given for materials with general formula AFeTi(PO4) 3 ~A5Ca, Cd!. Therefore, the present study deals with the synthesis and structural determination, using Rietveld reﬁnement of the X-ray diffraction ~XRD! patterns of the two AFeTi(PO4) 3 ~A5Ca, Cd! Nasicon phases. Note that CaFeTi(PO4) 3 are already signalized in the literature but detailed structural determination studies have not been reported; The other, CdFeTi(PO4) 3 , is a newly synthesized phase.
Syntheses of AFeTi(PO4) 3 ~A5Ca, Cd! were carried out using conventional solid-state reaction techniques. Powder crystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of oxides TiO2 , Fe2O3 , carbonates CaCO3 or CdCO3 and NH4H2PO4 in stoichiometric proportions. The mixture was heated progressively with intermittent grinding at 200 °C ~16 h!, 600 °C ~12 h!, 800 °C ~16 h!, and 1000 °C ~48 h! in air. The products of reaction were characterized by XRD at room temperature with a Bruker D8 advance ~u–2u! diffractometer; (CuKa) radiation ~40 KV, 40 mA!; divergence slit of 1° and antiscatter slit of 1°. The data were collected in the 10–90° by steps of 0.02°~2u!, with a constant counting time of 20 s by step.
The reﬁnement of the structure by the Rietveld method was performed using the Fullprof program ~Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1997!.
XRD powder data of the two AFeTi(PO4) 3 (A5Ca, Cd! phases indicated that they were highly crystalline and isostructural with NaZr2(PO4) 3 Nasicon-type structure ~Hagman and Kierkegaard, 1968!. Therefore, the following structural reﬁnements were based upon this assumption.
In a ﬁrst step, all cadmium ions in CdFeTi(PO4) 3 were supposed to occupy the M1 sites and Fe~Ti! within the Nasicon framework. 
This reﬁnement seems to be appropriate as shown by the good agreement between experimental and calculated intensity data ~Figure 3!. In a second step, and in order to conﬁrm the last cationic distributions, two separate hypotheses of reﬁnements were veriﬁed: ~i! all Fe atoms in M1 positions, ~ii! all Ti atoms in M1 sites. In both cases, negative values of displacement parameters for Fe and Ti in M1 sites @Biso(Fe) M1525 Å 2; Biso(Ti) M1525.4 Å 2], and large values for cations within the framework @Biso(Cd/Ti) 511(1) Å 2; Biso(Cd/Fe)513(1) Å 2], were obtained. Note, for example, that the Bragg reliability factors values are a Diffraction lines with I obs,1 are omitted.
The localization of Cd21, in M1 sites of CdFeTi(PO4) 3 , has been proved from X-ray diffraction data. In the case of CaFeTi(PO4) 3 , XRD data cannot unambiguously distinguish between Ca21 and Ti41 cations but analysis of Ca–O and Fe~Ti!–O distances permits to conclude about cationic distribution. The present example of structural analysis shows how the overall set of distance values, found after reﬁnements, and calculated bond valence sums ~BVS! can give effective support for structural determination when it is difﬁcult to distinguish, from XRD data, between adjacent elements in the periodic table.
