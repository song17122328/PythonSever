J We report the synthesis and optimization of NASICON-type carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 by solid-state approach. Adipic acid (AA) is used as the source material for the synthesis of monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 is optimized at a precalcination temperature of 300 °C for 4 h and 900 °C for 8 h under Ar ﬂow to yield a single phase. Powder characterizations such as thermogravimetric–differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and particle size distribution are conducted, and the results are presented. The AA concentration is varied according to the total metal ion composition in the compound (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M). Electrochemical Liinsertion properties are evaluated in half-cell conﬁgurations between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 at room temperature. Compared with the lower AA concentrations, Li/Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.15 M AA) cell exhibited discharge capacities of 178 and 147 mAh g-1 for the 1st and 50th cycles, respectively, and a capacity retention of 83 % after 50 cycles, which is 11 % higher than that of the native compound. Li/Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.15 M AA) showed better rate performances and delivered

Recently, Na? superionic conductor (NASICON)-type insertion hosts have attracted attention as prospective electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) comprising the general molecular formula of AxM2(XO4)3, where A = Na or Li; M = Ti, V, Fe and X = P, S, Mo, W, As [1–5]. In the crystal structure of NASICON framework materials, the MO6 octahedral units share all their corners with XO4 tetrahedra. However, the XO4 tetrahedral units share all three corners with MO6 octahedra. This enables the generation of interstitial and conduction channels along the c-axis direction, in which alkali metal ions (Na? or Li?) can occupy the interstitial position. Further, the arrangement of such MO6 octahedral units enables inferior electronic-conducting proﬁles, which nevertheless provide ﬂat charge–discharge curves that are mainly ascribed to the inductive effect of polyanion groups present in it. Based on the choice of transition metal ion and its oxidation state, the NASICON-type materials are classiﬁed into anodic and cathodic applications for LIBs. For example, LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3 are prospective 2.6 V vs. Li-insertion anode materials for LIBs [4]. The phosphate polyanion framework Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has been considered as *2.8 V vs. Li anode material for LIBs. The redox potential has

been substantially varied not only because of transition metal cations, but also because of the polyanionic group. In Li3Fe2(XO4)3, where X = As, P, Mo, and S, the Fe2?/3? redox couple showed a reduction potential of *2.6, *2.9, *3, and *3.6 V vs. Li for Li3Fe2(AsO4)3, Li3Fe2(PO4)3, Li3Fe2(MoO4)3 , and Li3Fe2(SO4)3 phases, respectively [1, 6, 7].

As a NASICON-type compound, Li3V2(PO4)3 is getting much more attention than other polyanion framework materials because of the multiple oxidation states of transition metal vanadium [1, 3]. Li3V2(PO4)3 can be used as both anode and cathode for LIBs, for example, the reduction of V3? to V2? can be effectively utilized as *1.7 V vs. Li-insertion anode material by two-phase reaction with a theoretical capacity of 132 mAh g-1 [8]. At the same time, the V3?/4? redox couple can be exploited around *4 V vs. Li by two-phase reaction and subsequent partial oxidation of V4? to V5? at *4.6 V vs. Li with a theoretical capacity of 197 mAh g-1 for complete removal of 3 mol of lithium. However, extracting the 3 mol of lithium is too complicated in conventional solutions, since the thermodynamic stability of the electrolyte solution is up to 4.6 V vs. Li only [9]. Moreover, during discharge, it forms a solid-solution instead of two-phase reaction for insertion of 2 mol of lithium, and this leads to a severe structural change that induces capacity fading during cycling. Further, the intrinsic conductivity and vanadium dissolution are other barriers for attaining the theoretical capacity of the Li3V2(PO4)3 cathodes. Hence, an attempt has been made to synthesize and optimize the Li3V2(PO4)3 by conventional solid-state approach.

In-situ carbon coating has also been adopted to improve the electronic-conducting properties of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase by using adipic acid (AA). The presence of a carbon layer is expected to prevent the direct reactivity with the electrolyte solution and thereby improve cell performance. The following precursors have been utilized in the fabrication of in-situ carbon coating to improve the electrochemical performance of monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3: glucose [10–13], starch [11], polyvinylideneﬂuoride (PVDF) [11], stearic acid [14], polystyrene [15], citric acid [11, 16, 17], sucrose [18], maltose [19] humic acid [18], oxalic acid [13, 19], polyethylene glycol [20], and phenolic resin [21]. Moreover, V-site dopings such as Ti4?, Zr4?, Fe3?, Al3?, Cr3?, Sc3?, Y3?, Ce3?, Mg2?, Mn2? , and Co2? were also carried out along with carbon coating to improve the electrochemical performance by stabilizing the structure during high-voltage cycling [22–24].

On the basis of this research background, AA was chosen as source material for carbon, and its concentration was varied according to the total metal ion composition present in the Li3V2(PO4)3 compound. The effective role of AA in the synthesis of other polyanion framework

materials has already been described in our previous articles [25–34]. Comprehensive electrochemical studies were carried out for Li3V2(PO4)3, and the experimental results are described in detail.

A conventional solid-state approach was adopted to synthesize the Li3V2(PO4)3 by tuning three experimental parameters: precalcination temperature, ﬁnal sintering temperature, and carbon coating. High-purity Li2CO3 (Wako, Japan), V2O5 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), (NH4)2HPO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and AA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used as starting materials. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, V2O5 , and (NH4)2HPO4 were ﬁnely ground in an agate mortar and calcined at two different temperatures, i.e., 300 and 400 °C, for 4 h in air atmosphere using a box furnace for the decomposition of hydroxyl and ammonium moieties. The intermediate was ground again to form a pellet and ﬁred at from 800 to 950 °C for 8 h under Ar ﬂow to yield phase-pure Li3V2(PO4)3. The same procedure was repeated for synthesizing carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 by varying the AA concentration.

Thermal studies were conducted using thermogravithermal analysis (TG–DTA) using a metric–differential thermal analyzer system (STA 1640, Stanton Redcroft Inc., UK) with a thin Pt plate as the sample holder. The powder was heated at 5 °C min-1 and cooled at 10 °C min-1. The structural properties of the synthesized Li3V2(PO4)3 phases were analyzed by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rint 1000, Rigaku, Japan) equipped with CuKa radiation. The morphological features of the powders were analyzed by ﬁeld emission–scanning electron microscopy (FE–SEM, S4700, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI, Philips, Netherlands). The particle size distribution was analyzed using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) system (DLS-7000(AL), Otsuka Electronics, Japan). The CR 2032 coin-cell was used to study the electrochemical properties of Li3V2(PO4)3 in two-electrode assembly. The test electrodes were prepared by weighing an accurate amount of active material (Li3V2(PO4)3, 20 mg), 3 mg of Ketzen black, and 3 mg of conductive binder (Teﬂonized acetylene black, TAB-2). The composite was formulated and pressed up on a 200 mm2 stainless steel mesh, which served as the current collector. The electrodes were dried at 160 °C for 4 h in a vacuum oven before conducting cell assembly under Ar-ﬁlled glove box. The test cells were constructed with a composite cathode and metallic lithium anode, separated by a porous polypropylene ﬁlm (Celgard 3401, USA). The electrolyte solution consisting of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate : dimethyl carbonate (1:1 by vol.) was obtained from Techno

Semichem Co., Ltd., Korea. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were conducted by two-electrode setup using a Bio-Logic electrochemical work station (SP-150, Biologic, France), in which metallic lithium acts as both working and counter electrodes. Galvanostatic cycling studies were carried out between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li with different current densities in ambient temperature conditions.

Figure 1 presents the TG–DTA traces of the precursor used for synthesizing a Li3V2(PO4)3 phase under Ar environment. The TGA curve can be broadly divided into three regions: *40–200, 200–600 °C, and beyond 600 °C. The loss (*2 %) and ﬁrst region shows minimum weight mainly corresponds to the removal of moisture during sample loading. However, the second region exhibited a weight loss of about 26 % that was attributed to the decomposition of Li2CO3 (Li2CO3 ? Li2O ? CO2) and ammonium moieties. Apart from the decomposition of the starting materials, nucleation growth takes place to form Li3V2(PO4)3 phase. The third region in both TGA and DTA loss until clearly reveals the absence of any weight 1,000 °C. This TG–DTA study demonstrates that the NASICON-type monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 phase could be prepared beyond 600 °C under an inert atmosphere by solid-state approach.

From the broader decomposition region between 200 and 600 °C clearly shown in the TG–DTA curve, we attempted to study the effect of precalcination temperature during the synthesis of Li3V2(PO4)3. The Li3V2(PO4)3 phase was pre-calcined at temperatures, namely 300 and 400 °C, for 4 h and subsequently sintered for various temperatures from 800 to 950 °C for 8 h. The

precalcination was carried out under normal air atmosphere and the ﬁnal heat treatment was conducted under Ar ﬂow. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase synthesized at 300 °C for 4 h with subsequent ﬁnal calcinations. In the XRD pattern, the material prepared at 800 and 850 °C does not exhibit any characteristic peaks, which is indicative of incomplete Li3V2(PO4)3 formation. At 900 °C, the XRD pattern clearly shows the formation of phase-pure Li3V2(PO4)3 without any impurity traces. However, the XRD patterns clearly showed the suppression of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase when the temperature exceeds 900 °C (minor intensity peaks around * 14 and 16 and reduction in the intensity of the rest of the reﬂections). This indicates the inﬂuence of nucleation growth, which occurred at precalcination temperature. Figure 3 illustrates the XRD patterns of Li3V2(PO4)3 pre-calcined at 400 °C for 4 h and subsequently sintered at high temperatures from 850 to 950 °C. Similar to the above case, the phase formation is not completed at 850 °C and impurities such as Li3PO4 and LiVP2O7 are evident. In contrast to the precalcination at 300 °C for 4 h, 900 and 950 °C sintered powders show the characteristic reﬂections with increase in characteristic peak intensities, which conﬁrms the formation of Li3V2(PO4)3 phase. Moreover, variation in intensities of calcination temperature provides the inﬂuence of precalcination temperature (300 and 400 °C) during the formation of singlephase Li3V2(PO4)3 powders.

The morphologic features of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phases synthesized in the above conditions are presented in Fig. 4. The powders prepared at 900 °C clearly show a particulate morphology, irrespective of the precalcination temperature

(Fig. 4a, c). When the sintering temperature is increased to 950 °C, highly aggregated particulate morphology is evident in Fig. 4b, d. Only this kind of aggregation was expected because the material was sintered at high temperature with a relatively longer duration of 8 h. In general, particulate morphology is preferential for the formulation of good electrodes. Hence, better electrochemical properties are expected for the samples sintered at 900 °C in both cases. In order to establish an appropriate synthesis condition to yield high-performance Li3V2(PO4)3 material, test electrodes were formulated, and studies were conducted in half-cell conﬁgurations (Li/Li3V2(PO4)3).

In this study, the inﬂuence of electrochemical performance of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase materials synthesized at various precalcination and sintering temperatures was tested between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 at room temperature. The galvanostatic charge–discharge curves of Li/Li3V2(PO4)3 are given in Fig. 5. The cell displayed initial discharge capacities of 158 and 156 mAh g-1 for the material pre-calcined at 300 °C and subsequently ﬁred at 900 and 950 °C, respectively, compared to 156 and 151 mAh g-1, for that precalcined at 400 °C and sintered at 900 and 950 °C, respectively. The maximum theoretical capacity of the phases was limited to * 77–80 %. A detailed description of this kind of behavior is presented below. Moreover, the differences in the initial discharge capacities between the four samples were negligible, and it is too difﬁcult to predict the best-performing material at this point. Hence, the cycling studies were extended for a few more cycles to locate the appropriate synthesis conditions for attaining high-performance NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3, and the cycling performances of those half-cells are presented in

Fig. 6. All four Li3V2(PO4)3 phases clearly experienced capacity fade during cycling. On the other hand, Li3V2(PO4)3 prepared at 300 °C pre-calcined and subsequently heat treated at 900 °C showed better cycling proﬁles than those under the other synthesis conditions. As a consequence, a precalcination temperature of 300 °C for 4 h and a sintering temperature of 900 °C for 8 h were chosen for further studies to optimize the use of carboncoated Li3V2(PO4)3 particulates with AA as a carbon source.

Figure 7 displays the XRD patterns of the Li3V2(PO4)3 powders with various concentrations of AA (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M) relative to the total metal ion composition in the phase. All the prepared phases exhibited well-deﬁned reﬂections, which is indicative of the highly crystalline nature of the materials synthesized. No impurity phases were noted in the observed patterns after the inclusion of different molar concentrations of AA for carbon coating. This suggested that the amount of carbon precursor/carbon was too small to induce the formation of impurities like V2O3. The observed satellite peaks were indexed according to the monoclinic structure with a P21/n space group and were consistent with the literature (JCPDS No.: 80-1515). As described earlier, Li3V2(PO4)3 is composed of a threedimensional arrangement of VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing oxygen vertices. Each VO6 octahedral unit is surrounded by six PO4 tetrahedral units and, similarly, each tetrahedral unit is surrounded by four VO6 octahedral units. This kind of linkage forms a three-dimensional network, and the alkali cation, Li, is located in the cavities within the framework. Three fourfold crystallographic positions exist for the lithium atoms, leading to 12 lithium positions within the unit-cell. Further, the strong covalent bond between P–O necessitated thermal stability for NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3 materials in both the lithiated and the monoclinic Li3V2(PO4)3 phase is expected to exhibit an improved electrochemical performance after the carbonization of AA.

DLS experiments were conducted to study the inﬂuence of AA concentration during the synthesis of Li3V2(PO4)3 phase. The same number of Li3V2(PO4)3 phase materials was dispersed in absolute ethanol and sonicated before the experiment was conducted. Figure 8 presents the DLS results of Li3V2(PO4)3 phases with different molar concentrations of (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M against total metal ion composition in the compound) AA, pre-calcined and calcined at 300 and 900 °C. As expected, there is no obvious difference between the particles sizes among all the AA concentrations. However, the higher AA concentration (0.15 M) showed the dominant particle size distribution with a range of * 150–200 nm. The AA concentration used in the present study was too small to suppress the particle

growth. In addition to the AA concentration, the high ﬁnal calcination temperature of 900 °C for the longer duration of 8 h cannot be ruled out as the cause of the growth of such particles.

To analyze the surface features of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phases, SEM images were recorded and are presented in

Li3V2(PO4)3 powders exhibited a smooth particulate morphology, whereas the carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.15 M AA) showed weak aggregation with rough morphology. To ensure that the carbon layer over the Li3V2(PO4)3 particles was retained during the carbonization of AA in the synthesis procedure, a high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was conducted. The resulting HR-TEM micrograph (Fig. 9c) clearly reveals a thin layer of carbon (*3 nm) on the surface of the particles, which we believe improves the conducting proﬁles of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase and thereby

facilitates the extraction of more lithium with minimum of capacity fade.

The electrochemical performances of pristine and carboncoated Li3V2(PO4)3 were evaluated in half-cell conﬁgurations between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li at current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 at room temperature. Galvanostatic charge– discharge curves of the half-cell results are presented in Fig. 10. The test cells displayed initial discharge capacities of 153, 151, 159, and 178 mAh g-1 for 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15 M concentrations of AA, respectively, to the total metal ion composition in the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase. In all the four cases, the ﬁrst charge capacity exceeds the theoretical capacity (197 mAh g-1) of Li3V2(PO4)3 for the removal of 3 mol of lithium, which was mainly attributed to the decomposition of the electrolyte solution, apart from the complete removal of three lithium ions to form the 4?/5?(PO4)3 phase. The thermodynamic conventional V2 carbonate-based solutions are stable only up to * 4.6 V (vs. Li) [9]. Pristine and carbon-coated (0.05 AA) Li3V2(PO4)3 showed almost the same ﬁrst discharge capacity (* 2.3 mol of lithium), which indicates an insufﬁcient carbon presence (i.e., AA concentration) to improve the conducting proﬁles and subsequently extract 3 mol of lithium. When the concentration was increased to 0.1 M, slightly more lithium (* 2.4 mol) could be extracted from the lattice. This improvement was mainly attributed to the improved electronic conductivity of NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3. A further increase in AA concentration to 0.15 M improved the lithium extraction to * 2.7 mol per formula unit. For this concentration, * 0.38 wt% carbon content is estimated by

elemental analysis. However, we did not attempt to increase the AA concentration beyond 0.15 M, since an excessive presence of organic precursor has a detrimental effect on the electrode materials prospect.

We have previously reported that an increase in the AA concentration raises the carbon content in the resultant

Li3V2(PO4)3 phase, which in turn dilutes the presence of active materials and hence reduces the volumetric capacity [32]. Moreover, high-temperature synthesis for a prolonged time leads to possible carbothermal reduction reactions and subsequent formation of impurity phases along with the native phase. the Li3V2(PO4)3 phases undergo multiple Li-extraction/insertion steps during electrochemical cycling. In the charging process, the removal of 1 mol lithium occurs according to the two-phase reaction in two steps: * 3.6 V vs. Li (Li2.5V2 3?/ 4?(PO4)3), and * 3.7 V vs. Li (Li2V2 3?/4?(PO4)3). The second lithium is removed at * 4.1 V vs. Li to form 4?(PO4)3, which preserves the monoclinic symmetry Li1V2 of the lattice [35]. Further, a well-deﬁned and long plateau has been observed at * 4.1 V vs. Li, which is indicative of a bi-phase reaction and corresponds to the V3?/4? redox couple. The ﬁnal lithium is extracted at * 4.55 V vs. Li to form a de-lithiated (Li0V2(PO4)3) phase, in which V is in a mixed valance state of V4? and V5?. Conversely, during the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase exhibits the discharge process, unusually than Li-extraction (In the charging process, Liions are extracted by a two-phase reaction, whereas during discharge, Li-ions are inserted by single-phase reaction). A monotonous discharge curve is observed for the re-inser(Li0V2(PO4)3 ? tion of Li2V2(PO4)3), which clearly reveals the formation of solidsolution behavior [35, 36]. However, the re-insertion of the other lithium induces a two-phase reaction in a two-step process at * 3.55 V vs. Li (Li2V2(PO4)3 ? (Li2.5V2(PO4)3 ? Li2.5V2(PO4)3) and * 3.6 V vs. Li Li3V2(PO4)3). the researchers are not interested in extracting the third lithium ion to retain the two-phase reaction mechanism (the upper cut-off potential was restricted to 4.3 V vs. Li) in charging processes

involving compromised discharge capacity. The challenging task with Li3V2(PO4)3 is to extract the third lithium ion and subsequently improve the cell cycleability.

The cycling proﬁles of pristine and carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 powders in half-cell conﬁgurations up to 50 cycles are illustrated in Fig. 11. All the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase materials experienced capacity fade during cycling. Among the various AA concentrations, the Li3V2(PO4)3 phase comprising 0.15 M exhibited a better cycling proﬁle. After 50 cycles, the cells displayed discharge capacities of 110, 103, 116, and 147 mAh g-1 for 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M AA concentrations, respectively. Capacity retention of 72, 68, 73, and 83 % of the initial discharge capacity was maintained after 50 cycles for 0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 M AA concentrations, respectively. The observed capacity retentions are superior to those of other source materials such as citric acid, glucose, PVDF, and starch, the cells of which exhibited discharge capacities of 144, 135, 130, and 131 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles, respectively [11], compared to * 148 mAh g-1 for the carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.15 M AA) after 50 cycles. Similarly, cells with double carbon sources such as oxalic acid and glucose displayed a capacity retention of 139 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles [13]. The improved performance of the Li3V2(PO4)3 phases examined in this study was mainly attributed to the appropriate synthesis conditions and, more importantly, the use of AA as a carbon precursor. We have previously investigated the implications of AA as a source material for other polyanion hosts such as LiFePO4 [28–30], Li2FeSiO4 [27], Li2MnSiO4 [26, 31–34], and LiMnBO3 [25] and found excellent improvements in the electrochemical performance. Although capacity fading has been attributed to several reasons in addition to electrolyte decomposition, vanadium dissolution in the electrolyte solution during high-voltage charging is the prime factor [37]. At higher concentrations, the presence of a carbon layer certainly prevents a direct reaction with the electrolyte and provides better cell cycleability.

To evaluate the inﬂuence of carbon under high currents, a duplicate cell was fabricated to study the rate performance at room temperature for conﬁguration between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li. The rate performances of carbon-coated (0.15 M AA) and pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 are presented in Fig. 12. The carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 cell showed discharge capacities of 173, 165, 150, 132, 105, and 76 mAh g-1 at rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, and 12 C, respectively, compared to only 155, 148, 141, 87, 51, and 31 mAh g-1, respectively, for the pristine material under the same testing conditions. The discharge capacity decreased with increasing current rate, which was attributed to the reduced participation of the active material, i.e., only the surface of the active material participated in the reaction [38]. The improved performance of the carbon-20 Cycle number

coated Li3V2(PO4)3 compared with the pristine phase was expected due to the role of the carbon layer over the particulates in providing the necessary conducting pathways for faster electron transport under such high current rates. CV is an excellent tool to investigate electrochemical reactions, particularly in electrode materials for LIBs. The CV traces of Li/carbon-coated (0.15 M AA) and pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 were recorded between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1, and the results are presented in Fig. 13. The CV signatures were recorded in standard twoelectrode conﬁguration, in which metallic lithium acts as both the counter and reference electrode. The test cell showed an open circuit potential of * 3 V vs. Li for both

carbon-coated and pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 powders, and the test cell was ﬁrst charged to extract the Li-ions. In the anodic sweep, the cell showed two well-deﬁned and sharp oxidation potentials of * 3.65 and * 3.73 V vs. Li, which corresponded to the removal of 1 mol lithium (oxidation of 1 mol V3? into V4?). At *4.14 V vs. Li, the test cell showed another sharp oxidation peak corresponding to the removal of 1 mol of lithium ions (complete oxidation of V3? into V4?). However, the broad oxidation potential at * 4.48 V vs. Li correlates to the removal of the third lithium ion from the Li3V2(PO4)3 lattice to form the Li0V2(PO4)3 phase. The well-deﬁned sharp oxidation potential evident during the anodic scan is ascribed to the two-phase reaction mechanism, whereas the broader peak potential corresponds to the solid-solution behavior. In the cathodic scan, the reduction potential at * 3.94 V vs. Li with a broader peak indicates the insertion of 2 mol of lithium with solid-solution behavior. The sharp peak potentials at *3.58 and 3.49 V vs. Li are ascribed to the insertion of 1 mol of lithium by two-step process according to the bi-phase mechanism. An obvious difference in the Li-kinetic properties is also clearly apparent: the carboncoated Li3V2(PO4)3 phase shows well-deﬁned peaks during both anodic scans, whereas pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 shows sluggish behavior. These improved Likinetic properties of carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 are due to the better electronic conducting-properties of the electrode, which allows the faster transportation of electrons, thereby enabling facile diffusion of Li-ions. The observed CV traces are consistent with the galvanostatic charge–discharge proﬁles and complement the reaction mechanism described above.

To establish the effect of AA concentration/carbon content on the electronic-conducting proﬁles, EIS was conducted, and the results are presented in Fig. 14. EIS spectroscopy was conducted in a two-electrode coin-cell the Li3V2(PO4)3 powders showed a conﬁguration. All ° semicircle followed by a vertical tail inclined at 45 . In general, the appearance of a high-frequency semicircle is attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface ﬁlm and/or contact the medium-frequency region is assigned to the charge-transfer impedance across the electrode/electrolyte interface, and a vertical tail at a line inclined 45 to the real axis corresponds to the lithium diffusion kinetics known as the Warburg tail [39]. The diameter of the semicircles in the medium-frequency region is decreased with the increasing AA concentration, indicating that increasing the AA concentration (or carbon content) drastically enhances the electronic-conducting proﬁles by reducing the charge-transfer resistance. This improvement in electronic-conductivity proﬁle was well reﬂected in the electrochemical Li-insertion/extraction, rate performance and CV measurements, when

compared to pristine Li3V2(PO4)3 phase. The EIS study clearly veriﬁed the improvement of conducting proﬁles with the increasing AA concentration.

High-performance carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 was prepared by conventional solid-state approach under the optimized conditions of precalcination at 300 °C for 4 h and sintering at 900 °C for 8 h in an Ar atmosphere. AA was used as the source material for carbon, and its

concentration was varied according to the total metal ion composition in the NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3. The obtained phases were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and particle size distributions. The electrochemical properties were evaluated in half-cell conﬁgurations between 3 and 4.8 V vs. Li at the current density of 0.1 mA cm-2. A half-cell with Li/carbon-coated Li3V2(PO4)3 (0.15 M AA) delivered discharge capacities of 178 and 143 mAh g-1 for the 1st and 60th cycles, respectively. The carbon presence improved the cycling proﬁles, which exhibited a capacity retention of 80 % after 60 cycles. CV and EIS were also conducted to validate the reaction mechanism and conductivity proﬁles, respectively. To summarize, the results of the present study results clearly demonstrated that AA can be effectively used to improve the electrochemical performance of the NASICON-type Li3V2(PO4)3 for the removal of 3 mol of lithium.
