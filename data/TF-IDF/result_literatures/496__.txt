M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 nanophosphors with M = Ca or Ba were prepared by a two-steps process including the use of a sol-gel process under basic conditions followed by treatment in a N2/H2 reducing atmosphere. Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample were also obtained by treatment in a N2 flow. The corresponding M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 nanocomposites were synthetized by treatment with tetraortoethylsilicate (TEOS). The effects of calcium by barium substitution on the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were carriedout by using an OXFORD INCA instrument. In addition, magnetic behavior, photoluminescence emission spectra and Commission International de I′Eclairage (CIE) of these phosphors were analyzed by magnetic susceptibility measurements and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, respectively. XRD patterns of synthesized samples can be indexed according to a rhombohedral symmetry of space group R-3 with Z = 6, compatible with a NASICON-type structure. FTIR spectra of the covered samples show some bands attributed to Si-O bending vibration and additional characteristics of vibration modes of PO43- units. Nanoparticles covered by a silica shell were found in TEM micrographs of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 whose thickness depends on its reaction time with TEOS. Magnetic measurements confirm the state oxidation of europium ions in the all luminescent cores. PL measurements show a variation of the emission intensity related to both the replacement of calcium by barium and the different thicknesses of the silica shell. M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 luminescent nanocomposites with M = Ca or Ba were obtained from the corresponding M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 cores covered with silica by the Stöber method. Previously, cores were obtained by a sol-gel process followed by a treatment under N2/H2 or N2 flow. Both, cores and nanocomposites samples show a high luminescent emission in the blue-green region depending on the barium and calcium presence.

The study of phosphors and, particularly, the solid-state lighting (SSL) based on rare earth-doped orthophosphate has become a subject of great interest because of their potential applications to a wide variety of optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaic applications and white light generation via Hg-free lamps [1], [2], [3], [4]. At present, the light provided by these materials has become a promising alternative to conventional incandescent and fluorescent lamps for illumination [5]. The optical properties of these materials are usually originated from complicated interactions between host lattice, activators and defects, being of essential importance the contribution of the host network on the optical properties [5], [6], [7]. These luminescent materials offer a high light yield with low energy consumption [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].

Some studies have determined that Eu2+-activated orthophosphates are useful for visible and UV radiation sources as well as for white LEDs devices [6], [7]. These studies have also found that under UV excitation the emission spectrum of Eu2+ cations is centered in the blue range of the visible spectrum. This emission is generally attributed to 4f65d1–4f7 electronic transitions [6], [7]. However, various factors such as site symmetry, the nature of the coordinating anions, the coordination number and the nature of the next nearest cation neighbours have an influence on the position of the 4f-5d states. For these reasons, a further investigation on the f-d transitions of the rare-earth ions in the different host lattices was necessary.

The NASICON-type structure of orthophosphates M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 with M = Ca2+, Sr2+ y Ba2+ shows suitable advantages for the activated luminescent material containing Eu2+. These advantages include high thermal stability, long distances between M2+ ions and adjustable chemical composition. NASICON-type phosphate materials have been the focus of attention due to their excellent electrochemical performance and versatile structure, so they have been widely investigated as ionic conductors [14], [15] or low thermal expansion ceramics [16], [17], however few reports are focused on their optical properties [6], [18], [19], [20]. In relation to its optical properties, other authors have described that these depend not only on the specific host lattice and on the environment of the activator ions, but also on the size, shape and organization of the constituent phosphor particles. [7], [21], [22], so it has been proved that the variation of the luminescent signal is dependent on its morphology, since the particle size affects the intensity of luminescence, being high in bigger particles or, referring to its structure, micro-belts nanophosphors have a higher intensity than nanofiber phosphors [5], [6], [7].

With the aim of obtaining lanthanide-doped M0.5−xEuxZr2(PO4)3 nanophosphors with high quantum yields for use in certain applications, different synthesis methods including solid state reactions [22], [23], co-precipitation methods [24], [25] or sol-gel process [6], [7] have been developed over the years. Unfortunately, in the first two cases the requirement of high temperature treatments leads to an increase of the particle size which also results in the obtaining of agglomerated powders. Contrary, the development of new sol-gel processes currently enables the synthesis of non-agglomerated nanoparticles with more uniform morphologies using relatively low (to mild) temperatures. Such processes have been already been tested by the authors of this present manuscript for the synthesis of compounds with other stoichiometry and doped with different rare earth ions [26], [27], [28], [29].

It should be noted that, in some circumstances during the synthesis stage, the luminescent nanoparticles, can develop defects on their surface, which can affect their luminescent properties (via non radiant energy loss), reducing the quantum efficiency of the synthesized nanophosphors. Occasionally, core-shell structures have been used to correct the problem caused by defects present on the surface of luminescent nanoparticles [30], [31]. Silica has been widely used as an efficient coating due to its high chemical stability, optical transparency, easily controllable shell thickness, low cytotoxicity and biocompatibility [31], [32]. Moreover, silica covering will provide chemical stability to the phosphor nucleus, protecting it from oxidation and thus reducing the mentioned loss of emission [33]. In this frame, the aim of the present work is to describe the synthesis of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 samples, with M = Ca or Ba, by a sol-gel process under basic conditions and through the subsequent use of the Stöber method. In a comparative way, the effects of the partial calcium substitution by barium ions and the different synthesis conditions used to obtain the two calcium samples on the crystal structure, powder morphology, optical and magnetic properties have been assessed.

M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 with M = Ca or Ba samples were synthesized by sol-gel process. In addition, M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 composites were prepared by Stöber method in order to obtain an homogeneous shell around the luminescent nanoparticles.

M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples with M = Ca or Ba were synthesized by a two-step process including the use of a sol-gel process under basic conditions, followed by a treatment in a N2/H2 reducing atmosphere to stabilize the 2 + oxidation state of europium. In addition, for comparison purposes, Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample was prepared as previously describe, but under a N2 flow. In this sample, it is expected that europium presents a mixed oxidation state (2 + and 3 +).

For these preparations, calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O, (99%, Sigma Aldrich)), barium nitrate (Ba(NO3)2 (99,5%, Strem Chemical)), europium nitrate (Eu(NO3)2·6H2O, (99,9%, Strem Chemical)), zirconium acetylacetonate (Zr(CH2COCH2COCH3)4, (for synthesis, Merck)) and ammonium phosphate (NH4H2PO4, (> 98%, Sigma Aldrich)) were employed as starting precursors. In addition, citric acid (C6H8O7 (CA) (99.5% Panreac)) and ethylene glycol (C2H6O2 (EG) (99%, Sigma Aldrich)) were used as chelating and polymeric agents, respectively. Stoichiometric amounts of each reagent were dissolved in distilled water. pH value of the resulting solutions was initially adjusted to 2 by the addition of citric acid solution, prepared according to a molar ratio Σ[CA]/Σ[metal atoms] = 2 and then, the pH value was adjusted to 10 by NH3 addition (25% Sigma Aldrich). Ethylene glycol with a molar ratio Σ[AC]/Σ[EG] = 1 was slowly added on the solutions to generate weak interactions between particles during crystallization to produce gels. These gels were aged for 4 days and dried at 423 K for 24 h to obtain the corresponding precursor powders. These precursors were treated at 898 K for 24 h to completely remove organic matter.

In a second step, to achieve the reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+, the precursor powder of Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 composition was treated at 1023 K during 12 h under a N2/H2 (90:10) reducing atmosphere. Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 composition samples were prepared in two different ways: 1) the sample was treated as described to the barium sample; and 2) the sample was treated at both same temperature and time, but under N2 atmosphere. In all cases, black color powders were obtained. The synthesized samples are namely as Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 (treated in N2 atmosphere), Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 (both treated in N2/H2 atmosphere).

The synthesized M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 powders were covered with silica (SiO2) by the Stöber method [34]. 0.025 g of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 powders were dispersed in 50 mL of distilled water, 150 mL of ethanol and 5 mL of ammonia (32%) assisted by a sonicator during 5 min. The addition was performed at a constant speed to obtain a narrow distribution of the particle size. Then, 1 mL of TEOS (synthesis, Merck) was added slowly under magnetic stirring and the reaction was carried out during 3 h in order to analyze the effects of the TEOS reaction time in the microstructure and final properties. The resulting white powders were collected by centrifugation and, then, washed twice with a deionized water/ethanol solution. The synthesized samples are namely as Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1@SiO2, Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2@SiO2, and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2. In the absence of shell in the sample the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2, subsequently, another equivalent sample was prepared by increasing the reaction time of the luminescent barium core with TEOS to 9 h. The synthesized sample is named as the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2_9.

The structural characterization of the synthetized samples was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) employing an X´Pert-MPD Phylips difractometer with Cu Kα radiation. Step scan of 0.04° (2θ) in the range 10–70° with a counting time of 1 s for each step were employed for data collection. Powder diffraction data were refined by the Rietveld method using the FullProf software [35] and a Thompson–Cox–Hastings function to describe the peak shape. The possible association of nanophosphors with silica was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra recorded on an IR-Prestige-21 Fourier Transform spectrometer, with a frequency range resolution of 4 cm−1. All FTIR spectra were measured on the 4000–400 cm−1 region for samples dispersed in KBr pellets. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEOL 2100 F transmission electron microscope, operating at 200 kV and equipped with a field emission electron gun providing a point resolution of 0.19 nm. Samples were prepared by placing a drop of a dilute n-butanol dispersion of nanoparticles onto a 300 mesh carbon coated copper grid. The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility under an applied magnetic field of 1 kOe was measured in the (2−300) K range using a Quantum Design XLSQUID magnetometer. Optical properties of the samples were assessed by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The samples were performed using an excitation source Spectraphysics consisting in an unfocussed pulsed laser beam Spectraphysics of about 100 fs time duration at a workrepetition rate of 1 kHz and centered at 333 nm.

Fig. 1 shows a comparison of XRD patterns of synthesized M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples with M = Ca or Ba. In all cases, the observed diffraction maxima can be indexed according to a rhombohedral symmetry of space group R-3 with Z = 6 [JCPDS file 00-033-0321and 00-034-0095], compatible with a NASICON-type structure. No secondary peaks have been observed within the sensitivity of the experimental system used, which indicates the purity of the obtained samples. In addition, higher diffraction maxima signal were found in the XRD pattern of the Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples. This result could be indicating that the treatment in N2/H2 reducing atmosphere favors the crystallinity of the samples.

Lattice parameters and cell volumes of all the synthesized samples calculated with Chekcell software [36] are shown in Table 1. The obtained lattice parameters values are in agreement with those previously reported [7] for powders prepared by sol-gel and subsequent treatment in reducing atmosphere. Slightly higher lattice parameters were obtained for the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample. For the Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples, the parameters obtained were very similar, although slightly longer to the sample treated under N2/H2 atmosphere. The differences obtained for Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples are in good agreement with the corresponding Shannon radii [37] of M2+ cations, all in the environment of six coordination of the NASICON-type structure (r (Ca2+)) = 1.00 Å; r (Ba2+) = 1.36 Å (r (Eu2+) = 1.17 Å).

The average crystallite size was estimated from the most intense reflections observed in the XRD patterns: (1 0 4), (1 1 0), (1 1 3) and (1 1 6) by the Scherrer equation [38]. As can be seen in Table 1, the average crystallite sizes range between 58 and 85 nm. A larger crystallite size is found in Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3, Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 samples. This result confirms that the treatment in a N2/H2 reducing atmosphere favors the crystallinity of the samples, since a smaller crystal size is found in the calcium sample treated in an N2 atmosphere. Particles on the nano scale are obtained in all cases. In addition, calcium by barium substitution leads to a powder formed by larger particles.

X-ray diffraction data were refined by the Rietveld method according to a NASICON type structure, where calcium and barium atoms were distributed in the 3a (0, 0, 0) and 3b (0, 0, 0.5) special sites, zirconium were located at 6c (0, 0, z) positions and phosphorus and oxygen at 18 f (x, y, z) sites. All refinements were carried considering that the calcium or barium and europium atoms were randomly located in the 3a and 3b sites with an occupation rate of 90% and 10%, respectively, in agreement with structural studies carried out by Hirayama et al. [18]. The atomic positions, refined R-factors M-O and bond distances are shown in Table 2, Table 3. The R-factors and the observed, calculated and difference XRD patterns obtained in these refinements (Fig. 2) are good agreement with the model proposed.

Refined M-O bond distances are in good agreement with those obtained from the sum of the corresponding Shannon ionic radii [37]. Regarding the (Ca/Ba)/Eu (3a site)-O and (Ca/Ba)/Eu (3b site)-O bond distances, larger (Ca/Ba)/Eu (3b site)-O distance is always found as compared with the corresponding ((Ca/Ba)/Eu (3a site)-O) distance, especially in the calcium samples. These results are similar to those published in a previous work [7]. In addition, larger (3a site)-O and (3b site)-O bond lengths are also found for the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample compared with the calcium samples, in good agreement with Shannon's ionic radii [37]. It is noted that these bond distances are measured along the c-axis of the structure and, therefore, larger bond distances lead to greater c parameter, so these results are in agreement with the cell parameters calculated from the corresponding XRD patterns (see Table 2).

A perspective of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 structure along the ac plane is shown in Fig. 3. [ZrO6] octahedral sharing corners with six isolated [PO4] tetrahedral can be observed while in the interstitial sites calcium or barium and europium atoms are randomly distributed in the M1 and M2 positions.

Comparative FTIR spectra of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 and M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 4. The obtained spectra are similar in terms of the band positions. Several absorption bands can be appreciated in the 4000–400 cm−1 range. The observed band peaked at 3500 cm−1 can be attributed to the OH bending vibration [39] of water adsorbed in the KBr used in the elaboration of the pellets. In FTIR spectra of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 the absorption bands in the range 1185–1020 cm−1 and 989–982 cm−1 was ascribed to υ3 asymmetrical and υ1symmetrical stretching vibrations of PO43- unit, respectively. The bands centered between 643 and 552 cm−1 are attributed to δ(O–P–O) bending [23], [24]. Some differences can be seen in the FTIR spectra of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 samples. The adsorption bands between 802 and 794 cm−1 can be assigned to Si-O bending vibration modes [40], [41]. In addition, the increase in the intensity of the absorption bands between 460 and 467 cm−1 can be justified by the overlap of the rocking vibration modes of the Si-O bonds which appear at 458 cm−1 [40], [41]. These bands are not seen in the FITR spectrum of the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 sample, which seems to indicate the absence of silica in the environment of the barium-europium luminescent core. On the other hand, the bands corresponding to the vibration of Si-O-Si (1100 cm−1) stretching modes and to the O-Si-O (1220 cm−1) silica bonds [42], which would also indicate the presence of SiO2 in the prepared samples, are not observed because these bands are coincident with those corresponding to the modes asymmetrical stretching vibrations of PO43- unit. Silica presence is evident in the spectra of Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1@SiO2 and Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2@SiO2 samples (see Fig. 4), since adsorption bands assigned to the rocking vibration modes of the Si-O bonds can be clearly observed at 460 and 466 cm−1. In the spectrum of the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 sample does not observed. This phenomenon is again evident in the spectrum of the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2_9 sample, obtained by increasing the reaction time of the luminescent core with TEOS (see adsorption band at 460 cm−1).

Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 show TEM images of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 and M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 samples. Nanoparticles agglomerated with an average particle size of 55 nm which are covered by an amorphous layer of silica of 19 nm thickness is observed in Fig. 5b. Moreover, nanoparticles of 71 nm average particle size covered by an amorphous layer of 20 nm can be appreciate in Fig. 6b. In both cases, nanoparticles are shown whose size is in good agreement with the values determined by the Scherrer equation [38] from the XRD patterns (Fig. 1). On the other hand, particles agglomerated with an average particle size of 74 nm can be appreciated in Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample (Fig. 7a), again in concordance with the size calculated from Sherrer formula [38]. TEM image of Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 sample (Fig. 7b) shows again nanoparticles agglomerates and the silica shell presence is not detected. This evidence is in good agreement with the FTIR of this sample (see Fig. 4). The increase of the reaction time of Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 core with TEOS generates the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2_9 sample (Fig. 7c), which does show aggregates nanoparticles surrounded by a homogeneous silica layer of 36 nm of thickness. The increase of the reaction time extends the thickness of the shell. These results have been previously reported in covered nanophosphors, but with other stoichiometry [30].

As an example, EDS microanalysis carried out in different areas of the images for the M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 and M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 samples are exhibit in Fig. 8.

Obtained spectra are exhibit in Fig. 8. In the analysis corresponding to the cores, the expected compositions for the samples were observed. Moreover, the silica presence can be clearly appreciated in the covered samples analysis.

Fig. 9 shows the variation of the inverse magnetic susceptibility with temperature for all M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 synthetized samples with M = Ca or Ba. A linear behavior is appreciable in the temperature range between 80 and 300 K for the Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples (see Fig. 9a). The calculated effective magnetic moment is 6.9 µB and 6.03 µB, respectively. In the first case, this moment is practically equivalent to the Eu2+ ion isolated in the 4f7 configuration (7 μB) [7] and significantly different to the Eu3+ ion (3.4 µB) [43]. These results confirm the presence of Eu2+ ion in the calcium sample and a certain proportion of Eu3+ ions in the barium sample. These results show that the N2:H2 reducing atmosphere has allowed the total reduction of the oxidation state of europium from 3 + to 2 + in the calcium sample but not in the barium sample. Considering the relations: μ2exp = x1μ2Eu3+ + x2μ2Eu2+ and x = x1 + x2 [46], the percentage of Eu3+ and Eu2+ ions has been calculated. The calculations made show an Eu2+/Eu3+ ratio of 0.66/0.34 in the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample, which indicates that the use of a N2/H2 reducing atmosphere in these synthesis has reached a reduction around of 70%, far from the 97% obtained in the case of Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 sample. For Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 sample, it is clearly observed (Fig. 9) the presence of a more complex behavior, directly related with the presence of a great amount of related to the non-reduction of Eu3+ ions. At higher temperatures, a characteristic Curie–Weiss paramagnet behavior can be observed while between 75 and 25 K a rise in magnetic susceptibility that tends to decreases it becomes clear. The first observed trend is in accordance with the presence in the sample of Eu2+ ions [7], while the second, which is in good agreement with the results described by Aitasalo et al. [44] also denotes the existence of a large percentage of Eu3+ ions.

Fig. 10 shows PL spectra of of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 and M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 samples. Calculated color coordinates are also included in the corresponding figures. As can be observed, the spectral distribution of the emission is very similar in the Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples and their corresponding nanocomposites. A broad and asymmetric band is observed peaked at about 490 and 440 nm, respectively. The displacement broadband towards shorter wavelengths can be justified by consideration of Shannon ion radii of the divalent cations in a six coordination environment of oxygen [r (Ca2+) = 1.00 Å and r (Ba2+) = 1.35 Å] [37], which originates in a longer (Ba/Eu)-O bond distance in relation to (Ca/Eu)-O. A minor splitting of energy levels by effect of crystalline field occurs with the increase of Eu-O bond distance [18]. In the PL spectra of Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 sample (Fig. 10a), sharp PL emission lines corresponding to Eu3+ 4–4f intraionic transitions were not found, supporting a complete reduction of the europium ions in good agreement with magnetic study discussed above. Unlike, for the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples it is possible to notice the existence subtle of narrower peaks at 593 and 613 nm (see Fig. 10b) which can be assigned to the 5D1–7F3 and 5D0–7F2, transitions of Eu3+ ions. This result evidences a non-complete reduction o of Eu3 + to Eu2+ ions in this sample, which appear much more marked in the PL spectra of the sample t Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 (see Fig. 10c), where can be observed narrower peaks between 570 and 700 nm assigned to the 5D0–7FJ (J = 1–4) transitions of Eu3+, being 5D0–7F2 dominant. This result has also been confirmed from the magnetic measurements.

Previous PL investigations reveal that the Eu2+ emission consists of two bands attributed to the existence of two different luminescence centers, which can be associated to the M1 and M2 positions of the NASICON-type structure present in the investigated samples [7]. The obtained results indicate, according to the refinement of XRD data, that Eu2+ or Eu2+ ions occupy two different positions in the lattice or two equivalent positions but with different oxygen coordination in the synthesized samples.

By consideration of the PL spectra of M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 samples (Fig. 10), can be observed that the amorphous silica covering (of the order of 20 nm as identified in TEM images) improved the emission intensity in a high percentage. This effect is much more marked in the PL spectra of Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 @SiO2 in relation to Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2@SiO2, indicating that this sample is a better phosphor emitter. These results can be explained taking into account that the surface defects present in the nanoparticles of the synthesized samples provide non-radiative recombination channels for electrons and holes, which leads to a reduced photoluminescence quantum yield. The covering with a homogeneous silica shell decreases these defects.

In the PL spectrum of Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1@SiO2_9h sample (Fig. 10c), a notable reduction of luminescent emission can be observed, so it is possible to think that the increase of the thickness of the silica shell (36 nm) and the presence of silanol groups in the silica can act as luminescence quenchers [30], [45].

Fig. 10 also shows the obtained calculated CIE chromaticity coordinates of the samples prepared. The samples Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2 and Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2@SiO2 show blue-green emission located at (0.243, 0.380), irrespectively of the covered or uncovered sample. However, in the samples Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 and Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1@SiO2 the calculated CIE chromaticity coordinates are located at (0.288, 0.250) and (0.281, 0.229), respectively, showing how the shell slightly shifts the emission towards the blue. This same phenomenon is observed in the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 _9h samples where CIE coordinates are located at (0.205, 0.130) and (0.196, 0.117). However, regardless of these nearby emission, it is possible to concluded that all the investigated nanophosphors can be efficiently excited by near-UV light, indicating that the phosphors are promising green or blue phosphors candidate for LEDs. The results suggest that the prepared phosphors exhibit great potential for use as single-phase full-color phosphor, in combination with yellow light phosphors, for near ultraviolet white light emitting diodes (NUV WLEDs).

M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 nanophosphors and their corresponding silica nanocomposites were obtained. The investigated luminescent cores were synthesized by a sol-gel method and subsequently treated in a N2 or N2/H2 reducing atmosphere in order to stabilize the 2 + oxidation state of the europium cation. XRD patterns of the cores samples show diffraction maxima compatibles with a NASICON-type structure. Several absorption bands attributed to PO43- unit were found in the FTIR spectra of the M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples. The presence of silica has been shown in the spectra of all nanocomposites except for the one in the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 sample. TEM images of the M0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 samples reveals nanoparticles of average size crystallite of 55, 71 y 74 nm for Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2, Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples, respectively and a homogeneous silica covering in the nanocomposites. This shell is not evident in the Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3@SiO2 sample The thickness of the silica shell is the same in samples treated during 3 h with TEOS and increases when the reaction with TEOS takes place over 9 h. Magnetic measurements reveals that that only for the Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 sample treated in a N2/H2 reducing atmosphere, a total reduction of Eu3+ and Eu2+ is achieved. In the other two luminescent cores, the coexistence of Eu2+ and Eu3+ cations is detected. Broad emission bands was observed in the PL spectra of Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_2, assignable to the 4f-5d transitions of the Eu2+ ions. In addition, some sharp emission lines were found in the spectra corresponding to Ca0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3_1 and Ba0.45Eu0.05Zr2(PO4)3 samples attributed to the 4–4f intraionic transitions of Eu3+ ions. The covering with a homogeneous silica shell decrease the surface defects of luminescent cores, leading to an enhance of the PL intensity and increasing their utility in different luminescent devices because exhibit great potential for use as single-phase full-color phosphor, in combination with yellow light phosphors, for near ultraviolet white light emitting diodes (NUV WLEDs).
