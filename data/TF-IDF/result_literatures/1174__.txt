Ionic conductivity of double vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 with the NASICON structure is studied by the method of impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 5 to 5 × 105 Hz and in the temperature range of 300–827 K. The vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 is prepared in the form of fine crystalline powder by solid 2) state synthesis from V2O5, Sc2O3, and AgNO3 at 1173 K. The conductivity of Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 ceramic samples σ = 8 × 10–3 S/cm (at 563 K). The σ vs. T curve demonstrates an anomaly at 563–623 K which corresponds to thermal effects in this temperature range. The values of enthalpy of ion transport activation are  ΔH = 0.40 ± 0.05 eV (T < 563 K) and ΔH = 0.30 ± 0.05 eV (T > 623 K). The ionic conductivity of Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 is due to Ag+ ions localized in channels of the framework structure of the NASICON type.

Compounds  with  the  framework  structure  of  the NASICON  type  (Na3Zr2Si2PO12  [1,  2],  space  group )  are  solid  electrolytes  with  respect  to  single 2) 3R c charged  cations  (Li+,  Na+,  Ag+,  K+,  Rb+,  Cu+,  H+) and are considered as promising materials for various electrochemical devices. Compounds of this type can undergo  various  homo 2)  and  heterogeneous  substitu 2) tions  in  the  cationic  sublattice  with  retention  of  the NASICON structural type. The family of solid elec 2) trolytes  of  the  NASICON  type  includes  sodium– scandium  double  phosphate  Na3Sc2(PO4)3  [3–5] which exhibits the high Na+ ionic conductivity. Dou 2) ble phosphate Ag3Sc2(PO4)3 conductive with respect to Ag+ ions was prepared from Na3Sc2(PO4)3 by the ion 2) exchange method [6, 7].

In  framework  structures,  the  ionic  conductivity depends on the ratio of the mobile ion size to the con 2) duction  channel  width.  The  ion  Ag+  with  the  ionic radius  of  0.115  nm  and  the  coordination  number CN =  6  [8]  occupies  the  intermediate  position between  small  cations  Li+  (0.076  nm)  and  Na+ (0.102 nm) and large cations K+ (0.138 nm) and Rb+ (0.152 nm). The electronic structure of the silver atom (Ag 4d105s1) differs from that of alkali metals (Na 3s1, K 4s1). Recently [9], a vanadate analogous of silver– scandium double phosphate, Ag3Sc2(VO4)3, was pre 2) pared  in  which  the  radius  of  vanadium  cations  V5+ (0.0355 nm for CN = 4 in the same scale of radii) is almost double radius of P5+ cations (0.017 nm).

This work is aimed at studying the ionic conduc 2) tivity of double vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 and compar 2) ing its transport characteristics with analogous prop 2) erties  of  silver 2)containing  double  phosphates  of  the NASICON type.

Double vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 in the form of fine crystalline power was prepared by two 2)step solid 2)state synthesis  from  V2O5,  Sc2O3  and  AgNO3  in  air  at 1173 K [9]. The results of powder diffractometry (dif 2) fractometer  Rigaku  D/MAX  2500)  suggest  that  the product of the solid 2)state reaction represents a trigo 2) nal  (rhombohedral)  phase  Ag3Sc2(VO4)3  of  the NASICON  type  with  unit  cell  parameters  a  = 0.9411(1), с = 2.2794(1) nm.

According  to  the  data  of  electron  paramagnetic resonance (spectrometer Varian E 112), the content of paramagnetic  centers  in  the  silver 2)scandium  double vanadate does not exceed 10–2%, which points to the absence of any substantial amounts of vanadium ions in degrees of oxidation other than 5+.

Studying the thermal behavior of Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 by the  DTA  methods  (thermoanalyzer  Netzsch  STA 449C,  sample  mass  10–20  mg)  revealed  irreversible thermal effects with hysteresis at 645 K (endothermic effect,  heating)  and  573  K  (exothermic  effect,  cool 2) ing) and also at 1026 K (endothermic effect, heating) and  973  K  (exothermic  effect,  cooling).  The  tested phase melted with decomposition at 1233 K.

Electrophysical  measurements  of  Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 were carried out on ceramic pellets with the diameter of 11 mm and the thickness of 2 mm. Ceramics was prepared  by  pressing  (pressure  4.5  × 108  Pa)  of  fine powder followed by annealing at 973–1073 K for 5 h. The relative density of ceramics amounted to 90% of that found in X 2)ray measurements.

The conductivity σ was determined from frequency dependences of impedance in the frequency range from 5  Hz  to  500  kHz  (impedance  meter  Tesla  BM 2)507). The  relative  error  of  impedance  measurements  was less  than  5%.  Graphite  paste  Dag 2)580  served  as  the electrodes.  Electrophysical  measurements  were  car 2) ried  out  in  vacuum  of  ∼10–1  Pa  in  the  temperature range of 300–827 K.

The  value  σ  was  determined  by  extrapolating  the impedance  plot  to  the  active  resistance  axis  with allowance made for the sample geometry (Fig. 1). The electrode polarization observed at low frequencies in the  impedance  spectrum  of  the  C|Ag3Sc2(VO4)3|C electrochemical  cell  with  irreversible  electrodes pointed to the ionic nature of conductivity of vanadate tested.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of  σ for Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 crystals. The  σ vs. T curve demon 2) strates a ~4 2)fold jump of σ in the temperature range of 563–623  K,  which  agrees  with  thermal  effects observed in this temperature range. The σ vs. T curve has two regions and each  σ vs. T dependence can be described by the Arrhenius 2)like equation, where A is the pre 2)exponential factor of conductivity and ΔH is the enthalpy of ionic transport activation.

In the low 2)temperature region, the enthalpy ΔH is 0.40  ±  0.05  eV,  σ  values  are  1.2  × 10–5  and  8  × 10 ⎯3 S/cm at 300 and 563 K, respectively. The σ value (at 563 K) found for Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 is close to σ values in the range from 2 × 10–2 to 3 × 10–2 S/cm (at 573 K) reported  for  Ag3Sc2(PO4)3  ceramics  (table).  In  the high 2)temperature  region,  the  enthalpy  ΔH  decreases down  to  0.30  ± 0.05  eV  and  the  ionic  conductivity reaches 0.08 S/cm at 827 K.

The framework of the silver–scandium double van 2) adate  is  formed  by  scandium–oxygen  octahedrons [ScO6]  and  vanadium–oxygen  tetrahedrons  [VO4] connected  by  common  vertices.  Silver  cations  that compensate  the  negative  charge  of  the  framework {[Sc2(VO4)3]3–}∞  are  localized  in  channels  running through the framework. They are responsible for ion transport in Ag3Sc2(VO4)3 crystals, as in isostructural compounds  Ag3Zr2Si2PO12  ) 4 3 (M III =  Sc3+,  Fe3+,  Cr3+)  [6,  7,  10],  ) 4 3 (M IV = Zr4+, Ti4+) [1, 11–13].

Thus, we have obtained a ionic conductor with the Ag3Sc2(VO4)3  composition  and  characterized  it  as  a new representative of the NASICON structural type. Its cationic conductivity values correspond to σ values of silver–scandium and silver–titanium double phos 2) phates  (table).  After  the  phase  transformation,  the cationic  conductivity  of  Ag3Sc2(VO4)3  increases ~4 2)fold to reach 8  × 10–2 S/cm at 827 K. Vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3  exhibits  a  gentle  temperature  depen 2) dence:  the  total  decrease  in  cationic  conductivity  in the temperature range of 530 K is less than four orders of  magnitude  with  allowance  made  for  the  phase transformation.

Modifications  of  ion 2)conducting  properties  of crystalline matrices by heterovalent isomorphous sub 2) stitutions are widely used in solid state ionics. For sil 2) ver 2)containing  double  phosphates  of  the  NASICON type  it  was  found  that  heterovalent  substitutions  of Nb5+  for  Sc3+  in  Ag3Sc2(PO3)4  [14],  Ta5+ for  Al3+  in Ag3Al2(PO3)4 [13], and Nb5+, Sc3+, Fe3+, Ga3+ for Ti4+ in AgTi2(PO3)4 [11, 12] improved their ionic conduc 2) tivity. Later, it seems interesting to study the effect of heterovalent substitutions on the Ag+ 2)ion transport in the double vanadate Ag3Sc2(VO4)3.
