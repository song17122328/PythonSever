A potassium titanium phosphate, KTi2(PO4)3, and two types of hydrated titanium phosphates, α-Ti(HPO4)2·H2O and γ-Ti(PO4)(H2PO4)·2H2O, were prepared by hydrothermal reaction using a layered lepidocrocite-type titanate as a starting compound. When layered lepidocrocitetype K0.7(Li,Ti)2O4 (Lss; Ohtsuka Chemical Co., Ltd.) was used at a reaction temperature of 180° C, KTi2(PO4)3 was obtained. The crystal structure of KTi2(PO4)3 was a NASICON-like rhombohedral one with a low thermal expansion coeﬃcient. The thermal expansion coeﬃcient of KTi2(PO4)3 was determined using synchrotron X-ray powder diﬀraction data (SRXD), and the thermal expansion coeﬃcients for the a-axis, c-axis and unit cell volume were −2.82 x 10−6, 7.16 × 10−6 and 1.49 × 10−6 K−1, respectively. Two types of layered titanium phosphates, αTi(HPO4)2·H2O and γ-Ti(PO4)(H2PO4)·2H2O, were prepared by hydrothermal reaction using protonated titanate (Lss-H) derived from lepidocrocite-type potassium titanate (Lss) by the ion-exchange reaction.

Hydrothermal or solvothermal reaction is an attractive synthesis method for inorganic compounds or inorganicorganic complexes, particularly new compounds. We have reported hydrothermal synthesis and crystal structure analysis for new zirconium phosphates and new bismuth oxides [1]. A variety of bismuthates were synthesized by low-temperature hydrothermal reactions using a hydrate sodium bismuthate, NaBiO3·nH2O [2–24]. These bismuthates had never been prepared by hightemperature solid-state reaction. As for zirconium phosphates, seven types of zirconium phosphates were obtained by hydrothermal reaction using a hydrate zirconium oxychloride, ZrOCl2·8H2O [25–29]. The structural features of these zirconium phosphates can be described as one-, twoor three-dimensional structures built up by corner-sharing of ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. Both bismuthates and zirconium phosphates with a variety of crystal structures were obtainable from only one kind of starting compound, and this capability is one of the attractive aspects of hydrothermal synthesis. For this work, we chose a layered lepidocrocite-type titanate as one of the starting compounds for hydrothermal synthesis, in which alkaline ions in the interlayer are ionexchangeable [30,31]. Hydrothermal reaction with this starting compound in H3PO4 solution produced KTi2 (PO4)3, and by using the protonated titanate derived α-Ti from lepidocrocite-type potassium titanate, (HPO4)2·H2O and γ-Ti(PO4)(H2PO4)·2H2O were obtained. Potassium titanium phosphate, has a NASICON-like rhombohedral structure [32], and this structural type is adopted in AM2(PO4)3 (A; Na, K, M; Ti, Zr). It was reported that some of these exhibited a low thermal expansion coeﬃcient [33–35], but, the thermal expansion coeﬃcient of KTi2(PO4)3 has not yet been reported. On the other hand, layered titanium phosphates [36], α-Ti(HPO4)2·H2O and γ-Ti(PO4)(H2PO4)·2H2O, have the same crystal structures of α-Zr(HPO4)2·H2O [37] and γ-Zr(PO4)(H2PO4)·2H2O [38], respectively, and various synthetic methods have been reported for both layered titanium phosphates [39–42]. This paper describes a new synthetic route to both layered titanium phosphates using a lepidocrocite-type potassium titanate.

KTi2(PO4)3 was prepared by hydrothermal reaction of Lss (2 g) in H3PO4 (85%) + H2O solution (10 + 20 mL) at 180° C for 24 h and in a higher concentration of H3PO4 α-

Ti(HPO4)2·H2O coexisted as well as KTi2(PO4)3. Figure 1 shows SEM image of the sample prepared at 180°C for 96 h. Cubic like-shaped particles with a size of ~1 μm are observed. The Rietveld reﬁnement using synchrotron powder X-ray diﬀraction data (SXRD) from 300 to 373 K led to Rwp = 9.21 ~ 9.57% and Rp = 7.24 ~ 7.69% in the assumption with the previously published crystallographic data (Space Group R-3c (#167)). Figure 2 shows the Rietveld reﬁnement pattern of SXRD at 300 K. The R-factors and the lattice parameters are summarized in Table 1. The temperature dependences of the a-axis, c-axis and unit cell volume are shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the crystal structure of KTi2(PO4)3. The length of the a-axis decreases with temperature, while that of the c-axis and the unit cell volume increase with temperature. The thermal expansion coeﬃcients for the a-axis, c-axis and unit cell volume were calculated as −2.82 x 10−6, 7.16 × 10−6 and 1.49 × 10−6 K−1, respectively. These values are compared with the other compounds, as listed in Table 2. Among alkaline metal phosphates, AM2(PO4)3 (A:Na, K; M:Ti, Zr) KTi2(PO4)3

It was reported that α-TiP and γ-TiP were prepared by hydrothermal reaction or reﬂux in H3PO4 solution using TiO2 or amorphous titanium phosphate which was obtained from TiCl4 and H3PO4 [39–41]. γ-TiP was obtained under reaction conditions of higher reaction temperature and higher concentrated H3PO4 solution. We successfully reproduced the formation of both phases under hydrothermal conditions. In order to clarify the formation mechanism for two modiﬁcations (α-TiP and γTiP), the time dependences of the products were checked by hydrothermal reaction at 240°C as shown in Figure 7. The 1 h product was α-TiP alone even at 240°C, but, γ-TiP coexisted with α-TiP in the 6 h and 17 h products. Finally, the single phase of γ-TiP was obtained at a reaction time of 20 h. This result indicated that γ-TiP was crystallized via α-TiP at 220 ~ 240°C. The diﬀerences between the crystal structures of α-TiP and γ-TiP are the number (n) of interlayer water and the coordination environment of PO4 tetrahedron; n is 1 and 2 for α-TiP and γ-TiP, respectively, and α-TiP has HPO4 alone, while γ-TiP has both PO4 and H2PO4. It is considered that these structural diﬀerences govern the synthesis conditions and that crystallization of γ-TiP is necessary to α-TiP as an intermediate phase with a higher reaction temperature. This work clariﬁed that a protonated titanate with a lepidocrocite-type structure was available as a starting compound for the synthesis of

A hydrothermal reaction using a layered lepidocrocitetype titanate produced a potassium titanium phosphate, KTi2(PO4)3, and two types of hydrated titanium phosphates, α-TiP, and γ-TiP. KTi2(PO4)3 had a NASICON-like rhombohedral structure with a low thermal expansion coeﬃcient with a-axis, c-axis and unit cell volumes, of −2.82 x 10−6, 7.16 × 10−6 and 1.49 × 10−6 K−1, respectively.
