Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with a NASICON type structure is a promising electrode material to develop symmetric Na ion full cells with operating voltage of ~1.8 V. However, poor electronic conductivity and structural degradation during electrochemical cycles adversely affects its electrochemical performance. In this study we report about the superior electrochemical performance of novel NVP@C/RGO composite electrode material in which NVP is co- doped with Kþ and Mg2þ. K-ions that selectively replace the immobile Na-ions in NVP unit cells facilitate Na-ion diffusion by increasing the unit cell volume and improve its structural stability. Whereas Mg-ions replace the V- ions which give rise to improved electronic conductivity by formation of mixed oxidation state of V (V3þ and V4þ). We demonstrate that such bulk modiﬁcation of NVP based electrodes in addition to surface modiﬁcation by carbon and RGO enhances its rate capability and cycling stability. Further, we demonstrate a symmetric full cell using doped-NVP@C/RGO composite electrodes which delivers a speciﬁc capacity of 52.1 mAhg 1 with excellent capacity retention of 95% even after 500 cycles at a rate as high as 10C with power density of 937.8 W kg 1.
Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) is an attractive alternative to the lithium ion batteries which offers several commercial advantages, including lower costs and improved safety characteristics [1]. However, the practical use of SIBs is primarily hindered by the poor transport kinetics of Naþ ions and large cell volume change of the electrode during the electrochemical process. This deﬁciencies of SIBs arise from the larger ionic radius (1.02 Å) and higher mass (22.99 g mol􀀁 1) of Naþ ions compared to Liþ ions () [2,3]. To address these deﬁciencies of SIBs, in the recent years there has been a huge resurgence in materials research for new sodium ion anode and cathode materials with an open framework structure (e.g. layered sodium transition metal oxides, NASICON compounds etc.) which facilitate the transport kinetics .
Amongst various NASICON compounds, Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) which offer large interstitial spaces for fast diffusion of Naþ ions, an impressive reversible gravimetric speciﬁc energy density of 400 Wh kg 1 and 90 Wh kg 1 as cathode and anode respectively has attracted signiﬁcant interest [8]. NVP offers moderate two operating potentials of 3.4 V and 1.6 V (vs. Naþ/Na), relating to V3þ/V4þ and V3þ/V2þ redox couples respectively which indicates that this material can be used both as cathode and anode in a symmetric full cell with an operating voltage of ~1.8 V. However the intrinsic poor electronic conductivity of NVP leads to its poor rate performance [9]. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant volume change (>8%) due to the Naþ ion insertion/extraction during the elec-trochemical charge-discharge process [10–12] often causes structural degradation of NVP which leads to capacity fading [13–15]. The major strategies attempted to improve the electrical conductivity of NVP have been (i) incorporation of carbonaceous conducting material on the surface [16,17], downsizing of the NVP particles [18,19]. The carbon coating on the surface aids to improve the electronic conductivity of NVP, whereas reduction of particle size helps to improve the ionic conductivity through shortening the diffusion path of the Na-ions. Although the rate performance could be enhanced by such approach [20], the achieved electrochemical property of NVP especially at high current rate remained insufﬁcient for practical applications. Doping of NVP with aliovalent ions to modify the bulk phase conductivity has also been attempted to improve its electrochemical performance [21–23]. Recently it has been demonstrated that incorporation of Mg2þ at the V3þ-site in NVP leads to a discharge capacity of ~115.2 mAhg 1 at a high current rate of 1C due to increased electronic conductivity [24]. However, at a higher discharge rate of 10C the capacity reduced to 94 mAhg􀀁 1 and the cyclic reversibility worsened [24] indicating possible structural degradation. Lim et al. reported that the structural stability of NVP enhances by doping with Kþ which replaces only the immobile Naþ at the pillar positions [25]. Further, the larger Kþ (ionic radius 1.38 Å) leads to an expansion of the Na-ion channel which facilitates diffusion of the Naþ during charging and discharging [25]. It is therefore expected that bulk modiﬁcation of NVP by simultaneously doping with an iso-valent large cation at the immobile Na-site and an aliovalent ion at the V-site would be an effective strategy to improve its electrochemical performance at high current rate.
In this study, we report the electrochemical performance of Kþ and Mg2þ co-doped NVP@C/RGO based composites both as cathode and anode. We demonstrate the signiﬁcant enhancement in the electrode performance in comparison to the undoped NVP@C/RGO based com-posites. Further, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time a symmetric full cell made of Kþ and Mg2þ co-doped NVP based electrodes. The symmetric full cell exhibited a capacity 52.1 mAhg􀀁 1 at a current rate of as high as 10C and retained ~95% of its capacity even after 500 cycles. 
A composite of carbon coated Na3-xKxV2-yMgy (PO4)3 (x,y = 0.09,0.07 respectively) and reduced graphene oxide (NVPMK@C/RGO), was synthesized by hydrothermal method using Na2CO3 (99.5%), K2CO3 (99%), (VO(C5H7O2)2) (97%), NH4H2PO4 (98%), and Mg(CH3COO)2 (99%) (Sigma Aldrich) as starting materials. Stoichiometric ratios of the precursors were dissolved in 40 ml of deionized water followed by dropwise addition of 6 ml polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG). The resultant green colour solution was stirred overnight at room temperature to obtain a homogenous mixture which was transferred to a Teﬂon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out at 180 􀀃C for 40 h in a mufﬂe furnace. The green jelly-like product was then mixed with 10 mg of synthesized reduced graphene oxide (RGO, details of the synthesis can be found in the supporting information) suspended in 3 ml DI water under vigorous magnetic stirring and dried on a hot plate at 80 C. The mixture was then ground and annealed in Ar atmosphere at 800 C for 8 h to obtain NVPMK@C/RGO composite with ~7% carbon content. As a control sample, NVP@C/RGO was prepared using the same method without adding the K and Mg precursors. 
The structure of the composites was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (Bruker D2 diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα equipped with copper anode). Their lattice parameters have been esti-mated by Rietveld analysis using FullProf software [26]. The morphology of the samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Carl Zeiss, Germany), and high resolution trans-mission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEM, 2100F, Japan). The Raman spectra were taken by a Laser micro-Raman spectrometer (T64000, Jobin Yvon Horiba, France) equipped with 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser. 
The electrochemical properties were studied by assembly of 2032 coin cells in a glove box ﬁlled with ultra pure argon gas. The active electrode was prepared by mixing 8:1:1 wt ratio of active material, carbon black and PVDF in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent respectively on an Al foil. Then the working electrode was dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at 120 C. The mass loading of the active material was ~2.0 mg cm􀀁 2. At ﬁrst the composite electrodes have been tested for their electrochemical properties in half cell conﬁguration using so-dium metal as the counter electrode. 1 M solution of NaClO4 in pro-pylene carbonate (PC) was used as electrolyte, and glass ﬁber (GF/C) (Whatman) was used as the separator. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was performed using an automated battery tester (BST8-MA, MTI Corporation, USA) in the voltage range between 2.5 and 4 V for cathode and 1–2.5 V for anode at different current densities. A poten-tiostat–galvanostat system (Series G750, Gamry Inc. USA) and allied electrochemical analysis software (PHE 200 and EIS 300) were used for cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.
ig. 1a displays the XRD patterns for the NVP@C/RGO and  NVPMK@C/RGO composites which have been indexed to the R-3c space group in the framework of a rhombohedral NASICON structure (ICDD 01-078-7289) [27] (Fig. 1b) [28]. The X-ray diffraction analysis clearly shows phase pure compounds conﬁrming that the low amounts of Kþ and Mg2þ do not lead to any alteration of the crystal structure of NVP or to the formation of any impurity phases. The lattice parameters obtained from Rietveld analysis (Figure S2 (a) and (b)) are summarized in Table S1, S2 and S3. It is to be noted that the x-ray diffractograms of the samples have been recorded without any internal standard samples which led to the reported error in the estimated lattice parameters originating from sample displacement and instrument calibration. 
Fig. 2a–b display representative SEM images of NVP@C/RGO and NVPMK@C/RGO composites respectively. While NVP nano-particles in the NVP@C/RGO do not exhibit any deﬁnite shape, NVPMK exhibits particles with smooth surface. The ﬂaky structure in both the samples resembles RGO. Grain reﬁnement and growth in NVPMK could be attributed to the incorporation of Mg2þ and Kþ dopants which has been reported earlier for BaxSr1-xTiO3 ceramic powders [31]. Precise infor-mation about the morphology could be obtained from TEM images (Fig. 2c–d). Both the samples clearly exhibit highly transparent RGO sheets which encapsulate the NVP@C and NVPMK@C particles. The RGO sheets form an effective conductive network to improve the surface electronic conductivity of the composites. For NVP@C/RGO agglomer-ated NVP particles are entrapped in RGO (Fig. 2c) whereas very smooth surfaced oval shaped NVPMK particles encapsulated in RGO framework are observed in Fig. 2d. Fig. 2e exhibits room temperature Raman spectra for both NVP@C/RGO and NVPMK@C/RGO. Two peaks at 1350 cm 1 (D band) and 1600 cm 1 (G band) indicate the presence of graphitized and disordered carbon in the composites [32]. The D band vs G band intensity ratios (ID/IG) for both the samples were found to be ~0.96 signifying that the coating predominantly contains graphitized carbon. Fig. 2f exhibits a representative high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the NVPMK@C/RGO composite which clearly reveals a thin layer of amorphous carbon coating of thickness ~4 nm on the NVPMK particle. The carbon coating on NVP and NVPMK particles results from the decomposition of PEG. The lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.28 nm correspond to the (116) plane of the rhombohedral NVPMK [18]. 
Fig. 3a and b represent the initial charge-discharge proﬁle of NVP@C/RGO and NVPMK@C/RGO electrodes vs. Naþ/Na at 1C rate in the voltage range of 2.5–4V (cathodic region) and 1–2.5V (anodic re-gion) respectively. It is noted that the discharge capacity of NVP@C/ RGO in the cathodic region is 113.3 mAhg􀀁 1 at 1C rate which is ~96% of the theoretical capacity (117.6 mAhg􀀁 1), whereas at the same current rate NVPMK@C/RGO yielded >99% of the theoretical capacity (116.6 mAhg􀀁 1). Similarly the initial discharge capacities at 1C rate enhanced from 42 mAhg􀀁 1 for NVP@C/RGO to 46.6 mAhg􀀁 1 for NVPMK@C/RGO in the voltage range of 1.0–2.5 V. Over the entire scanned voltage region the difference between the charge and discharge plateau was found to be smaller in case of the NVPMK@C/RGO electrode. Fig. 3c exhibits the derivative capacity-voltage (dQ/dV) plots of NVP@C/RGO and NVPMK@C/RGO over the entire voltage range of 1.0–4.0 V. Two sets of redox peaks near 1.4 V(corresponding to V2þ/V3þ redox couple) and 3.5 V (corresponding to V3+/V4+redox couple) are observed for both the samples. Clearly, the voltage difference between the oxidation and the reduction peaks is signiﬁcantly smaller in case of NVPMK@C/RGO which agrees well with cyclic voltametry measurements (not shown). This indicates signiﬁcant enhancement in reversibility of the electrode reaction in case of NVPMK@C/RGO compared to NVP@C/RGO. Fig. 3d shows the rate capabilities of NVP@C/RGO and NVPMK@C/RGO dur-ing charging and discharging in both cathodic and anodic regions of voltage as the C rate increases from 1C to 10C. The discharge capacities of the NVP@C/RGO decreased severely with an increase in the C rate (at 10C, 67% for the cathode and 0.7% for anode compared to that at 1C) in comparison to NVPMK@C/RGO (at 10C, 93.8% for the cathode and 72.7% for anode compared to that at 1C) as summarized in Table 1. Upon recycling back to 1C, speciﬁc capacity retention for NVPMK@C/ RGO was found to be superior compared to NVP@C/RGO (Table 1). Our observations clearly 
Let us discuss the role of the two different dopant ions in improving the electrochemical properties of NVP. The charge and discharge of NVP as cathode and anode involve the following redox reactions involving extraction and insertion of Na-ions in the material.
It is to be noted that in case of NVPMK, Kþ and Mg2þ do not take part in the electrochemical redox reaction [22,25]. Incorporation of Mg-ions in NVP that substitute V3þ, gives rise to V4þ to maintain the charge balance. This results in an increase in the electronic conductivity of the electrode composite which facilitates the charge transfer process [22,24, 30]. Improvement of electrode kinetics in NVPMK@C/RGO has been conﬁrmed by EIS measurements (Figure S5). The charge transfer resis-tance estimated from the equivalent circuit analysis was found to be signiﬁcantly lower for NVPMK@C/RGO (27Ω) compared to NVP@C/RGO (~277.8Ω). Additionally, possible formation of local de-fects in the crystal structure due to Mg2þ doping that increases the electronic conductivity and particle size modiﬁcation due to dopant incorporation that increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte can also accelerate the charge transfer process [22]. On the other hand Kþ as pillar ions stabilize the NVP unit cell against severe structural change originating from repeated Naþ extraction and inser-tion [25]. For example, after 200 discharge cycles in the voltage range of 2.5–4 V unit cell volume shrinkage of ~1.9% was observed in case of NVPMK, which is much smaller compared to ~3.2% observed in case of NVP (not shown). Additionally, K-ions modify the intrinsic NASICON structure to yield an enlarged lattice volume that provides a large space for the Naþ diffusion pathway. This consequently gives rise to facile Na-diffusion in the structure [25]. The diffusion coefﬁcient (DþNa) esti-mated from the Warburg plot (Figure S6a and b) was found to be two orders of magnitude higher for NVPMK@C/RGO (2 􀀄 10􀀁 13 cm2s􀀁 1) compared to NVP@C/RGO (4.8 􀀄 10􀀁 15 cm2s􀀁 1). The advantage of Mg and K dual doping in NVP to improve its electrochemical performance in comparison to single dopant incorporation has been illustrated in Figure S7 (a) and (b) in the supporting information.  The redox reactions depicted in equations (1) and (2) suggest that it is feasible to fabricate a symmetric full cell with an output voltage of 1.8 V (~3.4–1.6 V) using NVP based composite both as anode and cathode. It is reported that in case of NVP based symmetric full cells the cell performance is limited by the slow kinetics of the anode [33]. The re-action of the full symmetric cells can be written as:   
In the literature we found mass loading of electrodes as 1.5–3 mg cm􀀁 2 for full cell fabrication [8,22,24]. In the present study anode and cathode mass loading was taken as 3 mg cm􀀁 2 and 1.5 mg cm􀀁 2 respectively to fabricate a symmetric full cell NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO and its electrochemical perfor-mance has been compared with a symmetric full cell made of NVP@C/RGO. Fig. 4a compares the initial charge and discharge cycle of the symmetric full cells at 1C rate. NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO yields speciﬁc discharge capacity of 76.8 mAhg􀀁 1 which is higher than the speciﬁc capacity offered by NVP@C/RGO//NVP@C/RGO cell (50 mAhg􀀁 1). This is in agreement with the superior electrochemical per-formance of the NVPMK@C/RGO as cathode and anode as observed in the half cell conﬁguration. Electrochemical performance of the  NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO has been further investigated. Fig. 4b shows its rate performance at different current rates i.e. 0.2C, 0.4C, 1C, 2C, 4C and 10C giving discharge capacities 83.95 mAhg respectively which recovered to 80.3 mAhg 1 when the current density was returned to 0.2C rate. The nominal loss of speciﬁc capacity suggests against any major structural degradation even after going through very high current rate. Fig. 4c. shows the cyclability of NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO symmetric full cell for 500 cycles at 10C rate. The discharge capacity of 49 mAhg􀀁 1 obtained after 500 cycles corresponds to excellent capacity retention of ~95% with coulombic efﬁciency~100%. Rate performance and cyclic stability of the NVPMK based full cell have been found to be superior in comparison to the NVP based symmetric cells reported in the recent past (Table T5 in the supporting information).
NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO symmetric full cell offers an en-ergy density of 93.78 Wh kg􀀁 1 considering the weight of cathode ma-terials only. Fig. 4d represents the Ragone plot of NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO symmetric full cell with compari-son to NVP based symmetrical full cells reported recently in the litera-ture [33–35]. Interestingly, in all these reports, based on the mass of cathode, energy densities of the full cells have been estimated at different power densities. To make an effective comparison with these published results, it is prudent to estimate the energy density of these full cells in cathode limited condition. A high energy density of 147.75 Wh kg􀀁 1 was achieved at low power density 29.55 W kg􀀁 1 with char-ge/discharge time 5 h and a reasonable energy density 93.78 Wh kg􀀁 1 has been achieved at a high power of 937.8 W kg􀀁 1 for charge/discharge time 6 min only. The performance of the NVPMK@C/RGO//NVPMK@C/RGO symmetric full cell is superior to the recently published NVP@C@rGO//NVP@C@rGO [33], NVP//NVP [34], NVP/expanded graphite//NVP/expanded graphite [35] full cells.
In summary, we report on the electrochemical performance enhancement of NVP@C/RGO composites by doping simultaneously with K and Mg at Na and V-site respectively. The composites have been prepared by hydrothermal method. At the current rate as high as 10C, NVPMK@C/RGO exhibits initial discharge capacities of 109.4 mAhg- 1 (3.4V) and 33.9 mAhg􀀁 1 (1.6V) which is much superior compared to the discharge capacities of 76.2 mAhg􀀁 1 (3.4V) and 0.3 mAhg􀀁 1 (1.6V) exhibited by NVP@C/RGO. The combination of bulk modiﬁcation by doping with Kþ and Mg2þ and surface modiﬁcations by carbon and RGO provided the structural stability and improved electrical conductivity of NVP enhancing its overall electrochemical performance. NVPMK@C/ RGO exhibited an excellent full cell capacity of 52.1 mAhg􀀁 1 at 10C rate and an energy density of 93.78 Wh kg􀀁 1. The cell was able to retain 95% of its initial capacity even after 500 cycles. These ﬁndings can provide guiding the rational design for realization of ultrafast SIBs with long cycle life.
