All-solid-state phosphate symmetric cells using Li3V2(PO4)3 for both the positive and negative electrodes with the phosphate Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 as the solid electrolyte were proposed. Amorphous Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5 (PO4)3 was added into the electrode to increase the interface area between the active materials and the electrolyte. Any other phases were not formed at the electrode/electrolyte interface even after hot pressing at 600 °C. The discharge capacity was 92 mAh g− 1 at 22 µA cm− 2 at 80 °C, and 38 mAh g− 1 at 25 °C, respectively. Symmetric cell conﬁguration leads to simplify the fabrication process for all-solid-state batteries and will reduce manufacturing costs.

Li-ion batteries have been widely used in a wide variety of portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptop computers. Due to their high energy densities, Li-ion batteries have been considered as possible power sources in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and electric vehicles. However, before Li-ion batteries can be used in high-power applications, their performance still needs to be improved with regard to battery cycle life, rate capability, production cost, and safety. Safety issues must be addressed to make Li-ion batteries suitable as reliable power sources. Commercially available Li-ion batteries generally use graphitic carbon as the negative electrode material, lithium 3dtransition metal oxides such as LiCoO2 as the positive electrode material, and non-aqueous organic solvents containing Li salts as the electrolyte solution. To improve the safety of Li-ion batteries, the thermal stability of the electrodes and electrolytes needs to be enhanced by suppressing these exothermic reactions. LixCoO2 is easy to release oxygen gas at elevated temperature, which could react with organic electrolytes exothermally [1,2]. Such oxygen release could be suppressed by using oxyanionic positive electrodes such as phosphates, in which oxygen atoms are strongly combined by covalent bond to phosphorous atoms [3]. In addition, an incombustible solid electrolyte can be used in place of an organic liquid electrolyte. All-solid-state rechargeable Li-ion batteries consisting of oxyanion compounds would introduce all of these safety enhancements. A number of studies have reported on all-solid-state Liion batteries using phosphate glass such as Li1 + x + yAlxTi2 − xSiyP3 − yO12 and 80Li2S·20P2S5 [4–11]. However, oxides still keep on being used as electrodes in the solid-state Li-ion batteries; Inda et al. reported that Li4/3Ti5/3O4/Li1 + x + yAlxTi2 − xSiyP3 − yO12/LiCoO2 cell gave a discharge capacity of 150 mA hg− 1 at 1/12 C rate at 60 °C [6]. Sakuda et al. reported that In/80Li2S·20P2S5 glass ceramic/LiCoO2 showed a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g− 1 at 1.3 mA cm− 2 at room temperatures [10]. In this work, phosphates were used as both the electrodes and electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries; speciﬁcally, Li3V2(PO4)3 and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 were used for the electrodes and solid electrolyte, respectively. Li1 + xAlxM2 − x(PO4)3(M=Ti, Ge) with NASICON-type structure has been known as a fast Li-ion conductor [4,12–18]. A Li-ion conductivity of 2.4× 10− 4 S cm− 1 was obtained for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5 (PO4)3 at room temperatures [13]. Li3V2(PO4)3 as a positive and negative electrode also has a NASICON-type structure [19,20]. The insertion and extraction reactions of Li ions at Li3V2(PO4)3 electrodes proceed at around 4.1 and 1.7 V, accompanied by the redox reactions of V+ 4/V+ 3 and V+ 3/V+ 2, respectively [20]. Since both the negative and positive electrodes are comprised of the same active material of Li3V2(PO4)3, such symmetric cell has some unique advantages; 1) it can be discharged down to 0 V, 2) the cell volume change can be compensated by the opposite behavior of the positive and negative electrode, 3) the process cost of the coating electrode can be reduced. In addition, the electrodes and electrolyte used in this paper have the same NASICON structure and they consist of a three-dimensional network of PO4 tetrahedron and MO6 (M=V, Al and Ge) octahedron, and share oxygen vertices [21–26]. Hence, we expected that the mechanical and electrical contact at the Li3V2(PO4)3 electrode/ Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolyte interface in this all-NASICON symmetric cell may be improved by common PO4 tetrahedra cornersharing network.

The active material of Li3V2(PO4)3 and the solid electrolyte of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 were synthesized according to previous reports [13,15,27]. Li3V2(PO4)3 was made from a mixture of Li2CO3 (Honjo Chemical Co.), V2O3 (Shinko Chemical) and NH4H2PO4 (Taihei Chemical Industrial) at a stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was heated at 400 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere in an electric furnace. The powder was ground, and heated at 850 °C for 51 h under an Ar atmosphere. The crystalline Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 was made from a mixture of Li2CO3, GeO2 (Shinko Chemical), NH4H2PO4 and Al2O3 (Nippon Light Metal) at a stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was heated at 500 °C for 2 h in air using an electric furnace. The powder was ground, and heated at 800 °C followed by sintering at 900 °C for 2 h in air. To prepare amorphous Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, the crystalline powder was placed in a Pt crucible and heated in a furnace at 1200 °C for 1 h in air. The melted Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 was quenched in ice water, still in the Pt dish. The obtained materials were identiﬁed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku RINT2100HLR/PC) with Cu-Kα radiation.

The electrochemical properties of Li3V2(PO4)3 electrodes were investigated in a liquid electrolyte using coin-type cells. The electrodes were fabricated by pressing a mixture of Li3V2(PO4)3 (70 wt.%), acetylene black (25 wt.%) (AB, Denki Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha), and binder (5 wt.%) (Polyﬂon TFEF-103, Daikin Industry) into pellets with a diameter of 10 mm. The pellets were dried at 130 °C overnight in a vacuum. The liquid electrolyte used was 1 mol dm− 3 LiPF6 EC+ DMC, 1:1 in vol. (Tomiyama Pure Chemical Industries). A Li foil and polypropylene separator (3501, Celgard LLC) were used as the counter electrode and separator, respectively. The cells were assembled in an Ar-ﬁlled glove box with a dew point below −70 °C. The charge and discharge measurements (BTS-2004, Nagano) were carried out between 1.8 and 4.3 V, and between 1.0 and 3.7 V in quasi open circuit voltage (QOCV) mode; the circuit was opened for 0.4 h after charging (discharging) at 0.2 mA cm− 2 for 0.4 h at 25 °C. This sequence was conducted repeatedly in the same manner to reach the given cutoff voltage.

The solid electrolyte was prepared by pressing crystalline Li1.5Al0.5 Ge1.5(PO4)3 powder at 49 MPa into a pellet with a diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 1 mm. The pellet was heated at 840 °C for 2 h in air. The electrode was made from Li3V2(PO4)3 (49 wt.%), amorphous Li1.5Al0.5 Ge1.5(PO4)3 (49 wt.%), and vapor-grown carbon ﬁber (2 wt.%) (VGCF, Showa Denko). To increase the interface area between active materials of Li3V2(PO4)3 and the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolyte, we used not crystallized but amorphous Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3, which was added to the Li3V2(PO4)3 powder. The mixture (97 wt.%) was added to BL-S (polyvinyl alkyl acetal alcohol (3 wt.%) (BL-S, Sekisui Chemical) and 2,2,4-trimethyl-2,4-pentanediol mono isobutyrate (CS-12, Chisso Corp.). The slurry was screen-printed on both sides of the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5 (PO4)3 pellets, and then was heated at 600 °C for 40 h by hot pressing in Ar. Fractured cross-sections of the resultant pellets were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the thickness of the electrode. The surface of the pellet was analyzed by XRD. The pellets were sealed in a coin-type cell after drying at 130 °C overnight in a vacuum. Charge and discharge measurements were performed at current densities of 2, 11, and 22 µA cm− 2 (corresponding to 1/110, 1/20, and 1/10 C rates, respectively) between 0 and 2.4 V at 25 and 80 °C in a constant-current/constant-voltage mode; the charging was carried out at constant currents to the cutoff voltage, and then the cell was kept at that voltage until the current decreased to 0.2 µA cm− 2.

Fig. 1 shows two couples of charge and discharge curves for an Li3V2 (PO4)3/1 mol dm− 3 LiPF6 EC+DMC/Li cell. One was initially charged from the open circuit voltage (OCV) up to 4.3 V, and then discharged down to 1.8 V. Three plateaus were observed at around 3.6, 3.7, and 4.1 V, which are associated with the insertion and extraction reactions of Li+ accompanied by the redox reactions of V3+/V4+ [19,20]. The other was initially discharged from OCV down to 1.7 V, and then charged up to 3.6 V. The plateau around 1.8 V is due to the insertion and extraction reactions of Li+ accompanied by the redox reactions of V3+/ V2+ [19,20]. These results indicate that the V3+/V4+ and V3+/V2+ redox reactions at about 4 and 2 V can be used as positive and negative electrodes in a symmetric cell, respectively. Moreover, the reversible capacity at voltages above 3.5 V was twice as large as that obtained at below 2 V and the irreversible capacity for the redox reactions of V2+/ V3+ was larger than that for V3+/V4+. Hence, the active materials for negative electrodes were set at twice amount for positive electrodes to equilibrate the reversible capacity of both electrodes in all-solid-state symmetric cells.

From XRD results, no other phases were observed at the interface between Li3V2(PO4)3 and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 after hot pressing the all-solid-state symmetric cells (not shown here).

Fig. 2 shows the charge and discharge curves of the capacity balanced all-solid-state symmetric cells. The charge and discharge measurements were carried out at temperatures of (a) 25 °C and (b) 80 °C. The capacity was evaluated based on the weight of the Li3V2 (PO4)3 in the positive electrodes (about 1.9 mg), which was determined by the difference in weight before and after screen-printing the positive electrodes. The thickness of the negative electrode was evaluated from SEM to be 20 µm. The discharge capacities were 42, 38, and 38 mAh g− 1 for 2, 11, and 22 µA cm− 2 at 25 °C, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2a. The working voltage during discharging was about 1.7 V. This behavior likely resulted from anodic reactions at about 3.6 and 3.7 V at the positive electrode and cathodic reactions at around 1.7 V at the negative electrode, which are shown in Fig. 1. On the other hand, the discharge capacities at 80 °C (Fig. 2b) were much larger than those obtained at 25 °C: namely, 104, 101, and 92 mAh g− 1 at 2, 11, and 22 µA cm− 2, respectively. In the charging curves, a monotonous increase in the voltage was seen at around 2.1 V at 80 °C, but hardly observed at 25 °C. This charge capacity would be caused by the anodic reactions at about 4.1 V and cathodic reactions at 1.7 V, as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, the discharge capacity at 80 °C was mainly obtained around 2.0 V, which was higher than that obtained at 25 °C. These results suggest the very large internal resistance of the cell at 25 °C. In fact, the charge and discharge capacity of about 40 mAh g− 1 obtained at 25 °C was smaller than the theoretical capacity due to the insertion and extraction reactions of one molar Li+ at LixV2(PO4)3; hence, the reversible reactions in the high potential region at about 4.1 V, which are shown in Fig. 1, was not available in the all-solid-state symmetric cell, as shown in Fig. 2a. In addition, the charging current rapidly decreased when the cell was kept at the cutoff voltage of 2.4 V at the end of charging at 25 °C; as a result, no ﬂat plateau was observed at that voltage, as shown in Fig. 2a. These results suggest that the symmetric cell could work well at a higher temperature than 80 °C.

All-solid-state cell symmetric using the two redox reactions at around 2 and 4 V of Li3V2(PO4)3 electrodes were prepared. The solid electrolyte was the phosphate Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. No other phases were formed at the interface between the Li3V2(PO4)3 electrodes and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 electrolyte after hot pressing at 600 °C. The working voltages of the symmetric cells were about 1.7 and 2.0 V at 25 and 80 °C, respectively. The discharge capacity of 104 mAh g− 1 was obtained at 2 µA cm− 2 at 80 °C and 42 mAh g− 1 at 25 °C. The internal resistance of the cell was very large at 25 °C; a higher voltage and larger capacity were shown at 80 °C. Although the capacity of the present symmetric cell seems to be rather small for practical application, the key concept of the all-NASICON-type phosphate symmetric cell could lead to the reduction of the manufacturing costs and the simpliﬁcation of the fabrication process for all-solid-state batteries. Therefore, the present results should inspire intensive studies on new active materials which show large capacities at low and high potentials.
