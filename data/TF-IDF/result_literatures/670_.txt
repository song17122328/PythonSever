The local structure of LiFePO4 powders has been investigated using Fe K-edgeExtended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) Spectroscopy data.
The synthesis of LFPpowders was carried out using two different sol-gel methods.
The raw materials for Fe sourcewere ironstone and commercial precursor of FeCl2Â·4H2O.
Synthesis using natural materialsproduced two phases, namely LiFePO4 olivine and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 nasicon, whereas that using acommercial product produced a single phase of LiFePO4 olivine.
The EXAFS data for bothsamples were collected at Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), Thailand.
Fitting of themodel on the experimental curve provided parameters that can be interpreted as the distancebetween Fe as the absorber and the nearest atoms on the LFP materials.
The EXAFS dataanalysis has shown that synthesis of LFPs using different Fe sources gives slightly differentnearest-neighbor distances, namely Fe-O of 0.21% - 0.23%, Fe-P of 0.14% - 0.16%, Fe-Fe of0.12% for both samples, respectively.
The result of LFP synthesis using natural materials has two phases namely LiFePO4 olivineand Li3Fe2(PO4)3 nasicon and for LFP synthesis using commercial materials have a single phase that isLiFePO4 olivine.
Analysis of their local structures using EXAFS data resulted in acceptable fittingswith an R-factor value of less than 0.02. Both materials have almost the same peak shape and intensitywhich implies that their local structures are similar.
