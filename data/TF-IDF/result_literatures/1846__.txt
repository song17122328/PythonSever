The development of electrochemical promotion necessitates new solid electrolytes with improved ionic conduction at lower temperatures. Among them, Na Super Ionic Conductor (NaSICon), i.e. Na3Zr2Si2PO12, is a promising Na+ conducting electrolyte. The Pt/NaSICon system was evaluated for the electrochemical promotion of propene combustion both with large excess of oxygen (for volatile organic contaminants, VOCs, abatement) and near the stoichiometry (for energy production).
Catalytic combustion of hydrocarbons is a non-polluting means of heat generation and may also be used to destroy volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) present at trace level in large oxygen amounts. During the last decade, the Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC) appeared as a powerful promotion tool for hydrocarbon oxidation. EPOC, also called Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA), was observed for a wide range of reactions in the presence of metals such as Pt, Pd, Rh. . . or of oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2. The solid electrolytes used were O2  conductors like YSZ (Y2O3stabilised ZrO2) [1–4] or CeO2 [5], Na+ conductors like hUAl2O3[6,7] or Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [8], H+ conductors like CaZr0.9In0.1O3 d [9,10] or Nafion [11], F conductors like CaF2 [12] and mixed electronic/ionic conductors. EPOC is based on the control, by an applied potential, of the work function resulting from electrochemical pumping of ions between a solid electrolyte and the surface of a porous catalyst.
The development of EPOC for VOCs combustion depends on new solid electrolytes with improved ionic conduction at lower temperatures. Among them, Na Super is a Ionic Conductor promising Na+ conducting electrolyte, with a good thermal stability, an improved water resistance compared to hUAl2O3 and a high conductivity at low temperatures. Petrolekas et al. [8] have already used the Pt/NaSICon system in order to promote ethylene oxidation between 330 and 440 8C. Recently [13], we have shown that electrochemical promotion may strongly enhance the catalytic activity and the selectivity to N2 of Pt/NaSICon systems used for the NO reduction by propene under leanburn condition. Negative overpotentials, leading to a Na supply to Pt surface, increased the selectivity to N2 from 41% to 61%. These results were obtained below 300 8C, a temperature compatible with the treatment of automotive exhausts.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the electrochemical promotion of propene combustion on Pt/ NaSICon both with a large oxygen excess (for VOCs abatement) and near the stoichiometry (for energy production). Catalytic activity measurements reported here were obtained at 300 8C, but temperatures as low as 120 8C were also investigated. In-situ cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique has been used in order to elucidate the origin of the electrochemical promotion.
NaSICon (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) was prepared by the sol–gel method as previously described [14] and samples of high density were obtained by isostatic pressing and sintering at 1000 8C. A Pt catalyst porous film was deposited from a paste (Engelhard-Clal 6926) on the one side of the NaSICon pellet (17 mm in diameter and 1.1 mm thick) and acted as the working electrode. Gold counter and reference electrodes (form paste, Engelhard-Clal no. A1644) were deposited onto the opposite sides of the electrolyte disc and annealed at 800 8C from 1 h in air. Gold was selected because it does not exhibit any significant activity in propene combustion under our operating conditions. A schematic drawing of the electrochemical cell is shown in Fig. 1. 
The working and counter electrodes are deposited in a symmetrical back-toback configuration in order to insure a good distribution of current lines. The reference electrode was deposited close to the counter electrode, but at a distance (3 mm) sufficient to avoid any electrical perturbation. The Pt paste was calcinated in air at 800 C.
Catalytic activity measurement was performed as reported earlier [15]. The reaction medium was a mixture of C3H6 (0.04%), O2 (0.2% or 8%) and helium (vector gas). Prior to catalytic activity measurements, samples were pre-treated in H2 at 300 8C for 1 h in order to reduce platinum and to reach a reference state. The overall gas  1. The reactants and flow was kept constant at 11.6 L h products were analyzed by an on-line micro gas-chromatograph (VARIAN CP2003). Carbon monoxide was never detected, according to our 10 ppm lower detection limit. The three electrodes, W (Working electrode/catalyst), R (Reference) and CE (Counter-Electrode) were connected to a potentiostat–galvanostat Voltalab 80 (Radiometer Ana-lytical). 
From DVWR= 0.2 V/Au, ratio reaches a constant value, corresponding to a strong promotional effect with qCO2 =3. These results are in good agreement with those reported by Petrolekas et al. [8] for the combustion of ethylene on Pt/NaSICon at 430 8C. These authors also reported that the optimal value of sodium coverage was hNa*=0.04, which is quite close of our results. It is noteworthy that the promotional effect is observed for very low amounts of sodium, compared to the results obtained using a conventional chemical doping of the support [15]. Cyclic voltammogramms were recorded at 200 8C at 10 mV/s between VWR= 1 and +1 V. Results are shown in Fig. 3. One can consider that the reproducibility between the cycles is quite good. We observed two peaks, a broad cathodic one centred on  700 mV/Au and an anodic one centred on +330 mV/Au. The area of each peak corresponds to a quantity of charge passed between the working and counter electrodes (noted Q+ and Q  for the anodic and cathodic peak, respectively). 
The main aim of this study being VOCs abatement, investigation was first carried out with a large oxygen excess, i.e. C3H6/O2: 0.04%/8.3%. Before catalytic measurements, a positive overpotential of +1 V was applied in order to remove sodium from the Pt surface. The catalytic activity measurements presented here were carried out at 300 8C. The rate enhancement ratio variation vs. the applied overpotential and sodium coverage is presented in Fig. 2a. The top scale of this figure provides an estimate of the sodium coverage, denoted hNa*. These values were calculated from the following relationship which derivates from the Helmholtz equation [8,16]: hNa4 ¼   0:033  DVWR ð6Þ This calculation is based on the assumption that hNa*=0 at VWR 
The Pt catalytic activity strongly decreases when hNa*N0.03 but, from DVWR= 0.2 V, the rate enhancement ratio reaches a minimum value (qCO2 =0.8) and then remains constant when the Na coverage increases. Previous studies carried out by Kaloyannis et al. [2] and by Vernoux et al. [4] on Pt/YSZ systems indicated that, at OCV and near the O2/ C3H6 stoichiometric ratio, the Pt surface is predominantly covered by propene or by propene-derived carbonaceous species. Under these conditions, applying a negative overpotential to the Pt electrode enhances propene oxidation rate by increasing the coverage of electron-acceptor species such as oxygen, leading to an electrophilic NEMCA effect. The results presented in Fig. 2a do not follow the same trend. This can be explained by considering that, under large excess of oxygen, the Pt surface is not predominantly covered by propene at OCV and then negative overpotentials cannot be beneficial. 
The slight activity decrease observed for negative overpotentials may be attributed to a partial Pt surface contamination by electrochemically pumped Na+ ions.
Fig. 2b reports the effect of the overpotential on the rate enhancement ratio for a reactive mixture near the stoichiometry, C3H6/O2: 0.04%/0.2%. The propene conversion at 300 8C for a sodium-free Pt surface, i.e. for DVWR +1 V, is 5.2% instead of 29% under oxygen-rich condition. This observation confirms that propene is much strongly adsorbed on Pt than oxygen, and then oxygen excess is necessary to obtain a high propene conversion as we reported in a previous study [4]. The variation of the open-circuit voltage confirms this assumption since it decreases from +200 mV/Au under oxygen-rich conditions to  130 mV/Au under stoichiometric ones. This decrease is attributed to a drop of the oxygen thermodynamic activity on Pt. Under near-stoichiometric conditions, the effect of the is opposite to that observed under Na coverage on Pt oxygen-rich medium. the propene conversion increases with the Na coverage. The Pt catalytic activity passes through a maximum at DVWR= 0.2 V, which corresponds to hNa*=0.0363. 
At the propene conversion is multiplied by a factor of 3.5, increasing from 5.2% to 18.2%. The promotional index PNa is equal to 62, which is the highest value of PNa observed in this study.
Electrochemical promotion of propene oxidation on Pt/ NaSICon, a Na+ conductor follows the same basic rules that on Pt/YSZ, an O2  conductor. Near the C3H6/O2 stoichiometric ratio, a strong promotional effect is observed for negative overpotential (electrophilic NEMCA effect with qCO2 =3) attributed to the coverage increase of electronacceptor oxygen species. When oxygen is in large excess, such a promotional effect is no longer observed, as reported earlier by Petrolekas et al. [8]. Characterization by cyclic voltammetry gives precious information on the Pt/NaSICon system, and suggests the intervention of Na2CO3 or NaHCO3 species.
