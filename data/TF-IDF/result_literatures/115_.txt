In solid-state battery (SSB) system, undesirable electrode – electrolyte interfacial reactions lead to a significant performance degradation. Herein, we performed a systematic study on the chemical stabilities between Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) solid electrolyte and various cathode materials at their adhesion temperatures of 500 – 900 oC. Quantitative analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data using Rietveld refinement revealed that Li-concentration disparity between LATP and oxide cathode materials (e.g., layered- and spinel-phases) is the root-cause of phase degradation at high temperature. For example, Li migration from oxide cathodes to LATP produces multiple secondary phases including LiMPO4 olivine. In contrast, LiFePO4 cathode severely reacted with LATP at low temperature (T < 500 oC) and produced an Fe-rich NASICON phase (e.g., Li3M2(PO4)3). The on-set temperature of the phase decomposition varies with chemical compositions and crystal phases of cathodes. Increasing the cathode/electrolyte adhesion temperature offers a trade-off between the specific capacity and cycle life, as exemplified by the LiCoO2 (LCO) + LATP composite cathodes.  The results in this study offer a fundamental understanding of the LATP/cathode reaction mechanism, which will serve as guidance for designing interfaces and controlling the fabrication processes of SSB cells. 
Energy storage devices have gained a great importance with the emergence of electric vehicles (EVs). Higher demands of energy storage have triggered the development of advanced battery devices which overcome the current threshold in terms of safety, energy density, and power density. Among the advanced battery devices, solid-state batteries (SSB) have been extensively studied as an alternative energy storage system, where solid electrolytes replace liquid electrolytes that have been used for conventional Li-ion batteries. By eliminating the flammable liquid electrolyte, the SSB can offer improved safety. In addition, the SSB can significantly increase energy densities of the cells by using Li metal as an anode.1,2
Despite such merits of SSB, there are still many technical challenges. One major obstacle is a poor solid-solid contact between an electrode and solid electrolyte material.3–5 Unlike with liquid electrolytes, we need to carefully design and manufacture good ceramic electrolyte – cathode interfaces during the cell fabrication processes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Since cathode/solid electrolyte powders have poor mechanical properties and contact area (see, Fig. 1(a)), SSBs are typically sintered at elevated temperatures, which involves a grain-growth and consequent increase in contact area between the cathode and electrolyte (see, Fig. 1(b)). Failure to provide good interfaces results in a large cell impedance and subsequent cell failure. For example, oxide-based solid electrolytes often require sintering at T > 600 oC for a good adhesion with cathodes.3 The sintering process at high temperature, however, can cause another problem; elemental interdiffusion between cathode and electrolyte materials producing unwanted phases at their interface. For example, Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 reacts with conventional cathode materials and produces secondary phases at interfaces.6 The secondary phases often deliver poor transport properties and degrade the performance of SSB cells. Therefore, it is important to find optimal combinations of cathode – electrolyte chemistry and their adhesion temperatures in order to suppress such unwanted reactions during the SSB fabrications.
In this study, we explored the chemical compatibility between the LATP electrolytes and representative cathodes that have been widely adopted in conventional Li-ion batteries. For example, Fig. 2 shows three different types of crystal phases including layered LiMO2, spinel LiM2O4, and olivine LiMPO4  (M = transition metals). LiCoO2 (LCO) was commercialized in the early 1990s because of an easy manufacturing process and good electrochemical properties. LiNiO2 (LNO) can deliver 70%) during cycling, though it suffers from Li/Ni cation mixing and poor cycle life due to structural instability.7 LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 (NMC) has been developed to solve these issues by substituting Mn and Co for Ni. NMC was successfully commercialized for electric vehicle applications.8–10 Spinel structure is a thermodynamically stable phase and the element Mn is relatively more abundant than Ni and Co.11,12 In particular, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) has attracted interest due to its high redox potential at around 4.7 Vvs.Li associated with the Ni2+/4+ redox reaction. In LNMO, Mn only plays a structural stabilizer role in the system and thereby can avoid the Jahn-Teller effect arising due to a production of Mn3+.13,14 Olivine LiFePO4 (LFP) has been commercialized due to its low cost, environmental friendliness, and stable interfaces with liquid electrolyte based on good structural and electrochemical stabilities of the phosphate.
Among the ceramic solid electrolytes, NASICON Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP) has attracted interest because of its high Li-ionic conductivity of 10-3 S/cm at room-temperature and excellent chemical stability in contact with moisture and air.17–21 M. Monchak et al. 17 have confirmed that the three-dimensional lithium diffusion pathways along with Li1 (6b) and Li3 (36f) sites in LATP enable fast lithium diffusion. These properties will be appropriate as a solid electrolyte for SSBs.
In literature there have been individual studies that examined the stabilities of different cathodes in contact with LATP solid electrolyte. Kato et al. 22 reported the surface spectroscopy and electrochemical properties of thin-film LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 in contact with LATP. According to the paper, the cathode was deposited using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on the LATP sheet, of which interfacial reaction products were not quantitatively analyzed. Yoshinari et al. 23 adopted sulfide was used as the solid electrolyte. Miara et al. 24reported the phase stability of high-voltage spinel cathodes with LATP evaluated at 600, 700, and 800oC. However, they have focused only on spinel cathode materials, and it is difficult to find the relationship between the cathode decompositions and electrochemical properties. In this regard, we investigated the phase stabilities of the LATP with various cathode materials (LCO, LNO, NMC, LNMO, LFP) at adhesion temperature in the range of 500 – 900 oC. By performing a structural analysis using the Rietveld refinement from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, we have investigated the reaction mechanisms between cathode materials and LATP electrolyte. Finally, we discussed the phase stability – performance relationship in solid-state half-cells.
The solid electrolyte Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) powder was prepared using a sol-gel method.25 Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and titanium (IV) butoxide (Ti(C4H9O)4) were dissolved in ethylene glycol (C2H6O2). Under stirring conditions, aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4), and citric acid (C6H8O7) were added to the solution. The solution was then heated at 170 ℃ until viscous gel was formed. The resulting gel was calcined at 300 ℃, followed by sintering at 850 ℃ for 5 h to produce the LATP powders. 
LiCoO2 (LCO) was synthesized by a solid-state method. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H2O) and cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) powders were mixed and heated at 800 ℃ for 5 h in air. LiNiO2 (LNO) was also synthesized by the solid-state method. Lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H2O) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) powder were mixed and heated at 800 ℃ for 5 h in air. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) was prepared by the sol-gel method. Lithium chloride (LiCl), nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O), and manganese chloride tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O) were selected as starting materials. They were dissolved in ethanol and citric acid was added as the chelating agent. The solution was stirred at 200 ℃ until the gel was formed. The resulting gel was calcined at 400 ℃ for 3 h and sintered at 800 ℃ for 12 h, followed by annealing at 700 ℃ for 2 h in air. Commercial LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode powders were used in this study. 
High-temperature chemical stability between LATP  and various cathode materials (e.g., LCO, LNO, NMC, LNMO,or LFP) was tested by grinding the LATP and cathode powder mixtures with 1:1 wt. ratio, followed by heating them at 500 – 900 oC for 2 h in air. After the heat treatment, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns for powder samples were obtained using Rigaku SmartLab XRD (Cu Kα radiation). The crystal phases of each sample were further characterized by Rietveld refinement analysis of the XRD data using GSAS-II software.
Electrochemical properties of  solid-state battery half-cells were measure from CR2032 coin cells. A composite containing cathode powder (70 wt.%), LATP powder (20 wt.%) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF, 10 wt.%) binder was mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form a slurry. Then, the slurry was screen printed on one side of the LATP pellets and dried in oven. The cathode-coated LATP pellets were heated at 500 – 900 oC for 2 h in air. Coin half-cells consist of cathode│LATP│liquid electrolyte (separator)│Li-metal. We applied a single drop of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC (1/1 wt. ratio) liquid electrolyte to a piece of separator (Celgard 2500) that was placed between LATP pellet and Li. The assembled coin cells were cycled in a galvanostatic mode using a 0.01 C-rate at room temperature.
The chemical reactivity between the LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode with a layered structure (S.G. R3m) and NASICON-type Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP; S.G. R3c) was evaluated after heating their composite over a temperature range of 500 – 900 oC in air. Figs. 3(a)-(c) show XRD data and Rietveld refinement profiles from the samples heat-treated at 500, 700, and 900 oC. Fig. 3(a) shows that the LCO + LATP mixture maintains its pristine phases after heating at 500 oC for 2 h. Here, AlPO4 readily forms during the synthesis of LATP materials and it is difficult to eliminate as reported in literature.27 The content of AlPO4 is negligible (less than 0.01wt.% at 500oC), and it did not comprise a meaningful weight fraction at the elevated temperature. After heating at 700 oC for 2 h, (003) peak (~ 18.9o 2Ɵ) belonging to the LCO layered structure decreases noticeably in a manner indicative of its phase decomposition. As a result, XRD reveals the formation of secondary phases which can be indexed as Co3O4 (S.G. Fd3m), Li3PO4 (S.G. Pmnb), and LiCoPO4 (S.G. Pnma). Among them, the Co3O4 phase is dominant, revealing reflections at 19, 31.3, 36.9, 38.6 and 44.8o. After heating at 900 oC for 2 h, the mixture fully transforms into LiCoPO4, Co3O4, Li3PO4, and Rutile-TiO2 (S.G.: P42/mnm).
Based on the Rietveld refinement analysis of XRD patterns, Fig. 3(d) displays the changes in weight fractions of individual phases depending on the heating temperatures. The weight fractions of some minor phases, such as AlPO4 and Li3PO4, were found to be negligible and are omitted for simplicity. The “Initial” state refers to a simple blending of LCO and LATP pristine powders without heat-treatment. The data reveals that LCO fraction decreases significantly with increasing temperature in a range of 500 – 800oC. Meantime, the fraction of Co3O4 phase increases with temperature and becomes dominant (~ 50 wt.%) at 800 oC. This result suggests that Li loss from LCO accelerates with increases in temperature. At T > 700oC, the fraction of the LATP phase decreases and the fraction of the LiCoPO4 phase increases with temperature, which suggests that the Co3O4 phase reacts with LATP and forms LiCoPO4. The LiCoPO4 becomes dominant at 900oC, and there is a significant amount of the TiO2 phase in the composite due to the decomposition of LATP.  
Table 1 summarizes the chemical reactions occurring in the LCO + LATP composite at various temperatures according to the results from the Rietveld refinement. Where α is an arbitrary value to compensate Li loss from the decomposition, the symbols M (1-4) indicate the transition metal elements such as Co, Al, and Ti. We adopted these symbols because interdiffusions between transition metals are thermodynamically favorable. For example, although we simply described the layered Li𝑀(1)O2 phase as LiCoO2 in Fig. 3d, it is highly probable to produce Li(Co1-x-yAlxTiy)O2 solid solution after heating at high temperatures. We used all these variables to calibrate the chemical equations. However, it should be noted that the equations in Table 1 do not reflect thermodynamic equilibrium reactions due to a short sintering time (i.e., 2 h).
Based on the general trend observed from Fig. 3d and Table 1, we can propose following reaction mechanisms between LCO and LATP: (1) Li diffusion from LCO to LATP occurs due to the disparity of Li concentrations (e.g., 51.63 M for LCO and 10.72 M for LATP as shown in Fig. 2); (2) M3O4 (M = mainly Co) forms as a decomposition product; (3) M3O4 further reacts with Li cation and PO4 anions from LATP, then produces the LiMPO4 phase. 
We further examined the impact of chemical reactivities between LCO and LATP on solid-state battery performances. Since the focus of this study lies in the cathode/electrolyte interface stability, we adopted hybrid cell designs where a minimal amount of liquid electrolyte (one drop) was applied to a separator between LATP and metallic Li. In the solid-state cells, cathodes consisting of 77.8 wt.% of LCO and 22.2 wt.% of LATP were screen-printed onto LATP pellets, followed by heating them at 650 oC or 700 oC for 2 h. Fig. 4(a) exhibits charge and discharge curves of the cells. The initial discharge capacities of the cells were 107 and 42 mAh/g, respectively, for 650 oC and 700 oC attachment. The capacity fading of the cathode corresponds to the degradation of the LiCoO2 phase with increasing heating temperature. For example, calculated capacity from the LCO + LATP cathodes will be ~ 46 mAh/g after heating at 700 oC based on the reaction mechanism in Table 1. The LCO + LATP cathode attached at 650 oC shows reasonable initial capacity, although its capacity is little lower than pristine LCO (c.a., ~ 150 mAh/g).28 However, cycle life of the LCO + LATP cathodes is improved by increasing temperature from 650 oC to 700 oC. This trend can be explained by better grain connection at 700 oC that maintains stable LCO/LATP interfaces during repeated battery cycling. The results suggest that further systematic optimization will be necessary for cell performances at the temperature range of 650 – 700 oC.
We also examined chemical reactivities of LATP against other layered cathode materials. Since Ni-rich LiNi1-xMnx/2Cox/2O2 has been widely adopted for EVs, we selected LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) and LiNiO2 (LNO) in this study. Figs. 5a-d show the Rietveld refinement profiles of the NMC + LATP mixture after heating over a temperature range of 500 – 900oC for 2 h. Fig. 5e plots the changes in weight fractions of individual phases depending on the heating temperatures. 
Figure 6 shows the Rietveld refinement profiles and the resulting phase fractions of LNO + LATP mixtures after heating at a temperature range of 500 – 900oC for 2 h. At the intermediate temperature of 700 oC (see Fig. 6b), XRD reveals a noticeable amount of the NiO phase (S.G. Fm3m) which becomes a major phase at 800 oC. Similar to the case of LCO and NMC cathodes in contact with LATP, the olivine LiNiPO4 phase (S.G. Pnma) is dominant at 900 oC while having rutile TiO2 phase in the XRD pattern as a result of LATP decompositions.
Table 3 summarizes the chemical reactions occurring in the LNO + LATP composite at various temperatures. In these chemical equations, the compounds Li𝑀(1)O2, Li1.4+α𝑀2(2)(PO4)3, 𝑀(3)O, and Li𝑀(4)PO4 have the same phases with LiNiO2, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, NiO, and LiNiPO4, respectively. The M(1-4) can represent multiple elements such as Ni, Al, and Ti. The LNO shares similar reaction mechanisms with those of LCO and NMC: (1) Li diffusion from LNO to LATP occurs due to the disparity of Li concentrations (e.g., 48.72 M for LCO and  10.72 M for LATP as shown in Fig. 3); (2) NiO and TiO2 form as decomposition products; (3) NiO further reacts with PO4 anions from LATP and produces LiMPO4.
From these results, we can compare the weight fractions of layered oxide materials in the LATP + cathode mixtures after heat-treatments. At a given temperature, the fraction of cathode materials is well represented by a following sequence: LNO > NMC > LCO. The onset temperature for the rapid cathode degradation also increases from LCO (at T < 600 oC) to NMC (~ 600oC) to LNO (~ 700 oC). This trend suggests that the Ni-rich cathode retains improved chemical resistance against LATP, which can be explained by the decreasing Li-concentration disparity with Ni contents in layered oxides (see Fig. 2). 
The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode material with a spinel structure (S.G. Fd3m) has attracted great interest due to its high operating voltage (c.a. 4.7 V vs. Li). Therefore, we studied its high-temperature chemical stability against LATP using the same method as the previous section. As shown in Fig. 7(a), LNMO and LATP maintained their individual phases without forming noticeable amounts of secondary phases after heating at 700 oC for 2 h. At 800 oC, however, the LNMO and LATP mixture completely transforms to the M3O4 phase with a cubic-spinel structure (S.G. Fd3m; where M is considered as Mn), LiTiOPO4 (S.G. Pnma), and Rutile-TiO2 (S.G. P42/mnm). A further increase in temperature to 900 oC leads to the formation of LiMPO4 with an olivine structure and various secondary phases. The overall trend of the reaction mechanism between the LNMO and LATP resembles that of the layered material shown in the previous section. It is notable that the LNMO and LATP mixture does not produce the Li3PO4 phase but produces the LiTiOPO4 phase. This could be explained by the Li concentration of LNMO spinel phases (24.34 mole/L), which is lower than those of layered cathode materials (~50 mole/L), as shown in Fig. 2. Based on the Rietveld refinement results, the chemical reaction equations which vary depending on temperature are described in Table 4. The M (1-5) can comprise multiple elements such as Ni, Mn, Al, and Ti. 
Figure 8 shows the electrochemical properties of LNMO + LATP cathodes (77.8 : 22.2 wt.%) attached at 600 oC and 700 oC for 2 h onto the LATP solid electrolyte in the cells. The LNMO + LATP cathode attached at 600 oC shows a voltage plateau at ~ 4.7 Vvs. Li which is attributed to Ni2+/4+ redox in the LNMO cathode.11,12 On the other hand, the 700 oC attached cathode has an increasing slope at ~ 4.7 Vvs. Li and capacity at ~ 4 V vs. Li associated with Mn3+/4+ redox. In addition, the lattice parameter of the spinel phase in the composite cathode increases from 8.1723 Å (pristine LNMO) to 8.2306 Å after heating at 700oC for 2 h. In the earlier study, we reported an increase in lattice parameters and voltage slope and  a decrease in specific capacity as the characteristics of Ti-substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5-xTixO4, which forms a solid-solution in disordered spinel lattices (S.G. Fd3m) at a wide range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.29,30 Earlier work by Miara et al. 24 also reported that LNMO and LATP are compatible after heating at 600 oC, which is similar to this work. However, our combined structural and electrochemical characterization data additionally revealed that Ti in LATP migrates and reacts with LNMO to form the LiNi0.5Mn1.5-xTixO4 while maintaining the spinel phase, which consequently leads to significant capacity fading of the cathode. 
In this section, we report the chemical stability of LiFePO4 (LFP) with the olivine structure (S.G. Pnma) in contact with LATP in the temperature range of 500 – 900 oC in air. The structural transition behavior of the LFP + LATP mixture is completely different from that of oxide cathodes. Figure 9(a) shows that a major portion of LFP was transformed into the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (S.G. P21/n) phase in contact with LATP after heating at 500 oC for 2 h. While increasing temperature, the weight fraction of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase increases and that of LATP decreases. Based on the refinement results, their chemical reaction mechanisms are approximated in Table 5. Here, Li𝑀(1)PO4,Li1.4+α𝑀(2)(PO4)3, and Li3𝑀2(3)(PO4)3 compounds, respectively, correspond to LiFePO4, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phases. The M (1-3) can comprise multiple elements, such as Fe, Al, and Ti. However, we simply denoted this as Li3Fe2(PO4)3 for simplicity. The results show that LFP reacts with LATP to produce the Fe-rich NASICON phase (i.e., Li3Fe2(PO4)3) at below 500 oC. Since this reaction mechanism remains the same in a temperature range of 600 – 900 oC, Table 5 only describes the representative mechanism observed at 900 oC. Unfortunately,  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has more electrochemically insulating properties than those of LFP,31 which makes it difficult to use for cathodes in all solid-electrolyte cells. 
Table 5. Phase evolution of LiFePO4 and Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 composite (1:1 wt. ratio / 2.42:1 molar ratio) after heating at 500 – 900 oC for 2 h in air.
This study performs systematic investigation of the chemical reactivity between LATP and various cathode materials with layered, spinel, and olivine crystal structures, specifically focusing on the impact of heating temperatures on cathode/electrolyte adhesion. Characterization of crystal phases using Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns revealed the evolution of cathode and electrolyte phases with temperatures. For the layered and spinel cathode materials, Li diffusion due to a disparity of Li concentration (i.e., higher Li concentration of cathodes) leads to the degradation of the cathode phase at relatively low temperatures. Increasing the cathode/electrolyte adhesion temperature offers a trade-off between the specific capacity and cycle life, as exemplified by the LCO + LATP composite cathodes. In contrast, LFP reacts severely with LATP at low temperature (T < 500 oC) and produces NASICON Li3M2(PO4)3 (M = Fe and others) that remains as a thermodynamically stable phase at high temperatures in contact with the LATP. This behavior may stem from the enthalpies of formation of phosphates, which are lower than those of oxides and require relatively low temperatures for phase evolution. Based on the Rietveld refinement data, we described the chemical reaction equations between LATP and various cathodes under different adhesion temperatures. 
The results in this study offer a fundamental understanding of LATP/cathode reaction mechanisms, which will serve as guidance for controlling cathode/electrolyte interfaces and deciding processing parameters for solid-state battery device fabrication. This study, however, needs further development in another aspect. For example, the morphological impact on phase stability will offer helpful insight into the future direction of the study. Since we have focused on the fundamental reaction mechanisms between cathode/electrolyte materials, all the ingredients were intentionally ground to minimize the impact due to the morphologies. The study of the morphological effect on the reaction mechanisms will be our next target in the future.
