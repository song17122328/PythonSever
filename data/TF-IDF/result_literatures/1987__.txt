Research for materials that would provide lighter batteries with higher energy density is the consequence of increasing consumer demands on numerous portable technologies (computers, cell phones, etc.). For the last five years, a new generation of positive electrode materials based on 3-D phosphate opened-frameworks that reversibly insert lithium was proposed, following the pioneering works of Padhi et al.1,2 These materials take advantage of a relatively high lithium ion mobility and benefit from the inductive effect generated by the polyanionic groups, which increase the operating voltage in comparison with simple oxides.3-5 In this context, much attention was given to phosphates6,7 and sulfates8,9 of iron or vanadium. Good reversibility was demonstrated for the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple in cheap and nontoxic iron-containing materials such as Fe2(SO4)3 (3.6 V), LiFePO4 (3.45 V), and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (2.8 V).
Only very little is known so far of the behavior of Ti4+-containing polyanionic materials toward lithium insertion, besides the early works of Delmas in the late 1980s10,11 on NASICON A1+xTi2(PO4)3 (A ) Li, Na) and recent contributions from the same group.12 Despite the low intrinsic electronic conductivity of these 3-D phosphates, which was pointed out by Delmas10,11 as a major drawback for possible applications, they still deserve attention in light of progress that has been communicated recently on how to make them work efficiently at high current densities through “smart” conductive carbon coating.13-15 The slightly lighter molecular weight of titanium as compared to that of iron induces a higher theoretical specific capacity than for iron isostructural materials: 138 mAh/g for Li1+xTi2(PO4)3, and 128 mAh/g for Li3Fe2(PO4)3. Additionally, titanium is also environmentally benign, as its derivative compounds are usually easy to prepare.
Many authors reported the excellent reversibility of the Ti4+/3+ redox couple in simple oxides, such as the spinel Li[Li1/3Ti5/3]O4, for instance. Below is the summary of the redox behavior of simple TiIV oxides already reported in the literature.
As shown in Figure 1a, only 0.5 lithium, instead of one in theory (Ti4+ to Ti3+) can be reversibly inserted into the cubic close-packed arrangement of anatase TiO2 (in agreement with the literature16,17) with significant polarization. GITT shows that the position of the Ti4+/3+
At the same voltage vs Li+/Li, and following an insertion mechanism similar to that for Li4+xTi5O12, the normal spinel Li[CrTi]O4 25 can insert one lithium ion per titanium element (0.5 lithium inserted per transition metal) (Figure 1d). The complete reduction of the TiIV to TiIII is achieved without contribution of CrIII to the redox process. Note that the isotypic Li[FeTi]O4 26 only inserts 0.5 lithium per two transition elements and that only iron is reduced.
It appears then, as already documented in the literature, that a few TiIV oxides show excellent reversibility
For the layered material Li2TiO3 ,20 we observed no possible lithium insertion. This may be easily understood as all the octahedral interstices of the oxygen close-packed arrangement are already filled with lithium and titanium.
We decided to embark on the preparation and electrochemical study of many titanium phosphates, sulfates, and silicates with the objectives of (1) identifying new alternative materials with attractive properties, (2) studying how the crystal structure and the nature of the (XO4)ngroups would affect the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox potential, and (3) relating their electrochemical behavior to structural changes that occur on cycling. We present an investigation of electrochemical lithium or sodium insertion in TiSO5, LiTiPO5, Li2TiSiO5, TiP2O7, LiTi2(PO4)3, and NaTi2(PO4)3, compared with titanium oxides such as TiO2 (anatase), LiTiCrO4 (spinel), Li4Ti5O12 (spinel), and Li2Ti3O7 (ramsdellite). Particular attention will be given to AxTi2(PO4)3 (A ) Li, Na) and LixTiP2O7 compositions that were investigated by various electrochemical cycling modes (galvanostatic or potentiostatic), in situ X-ray diffraction, and chemical lithiation.
Most of the polycrystalline materials were synthesized by solid-state reaction using TiO2 anatase (Prolabo) as precursor, or by a sol-gel chemistry route in the case of TiP2O7, described in the appropriate sections of this paper. The morphology of the powders was controlled by scanning electron microscopy (FEG XL30), transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM12100 kV), and BET27 measurements.
Lattice parameters were determined first by full pattern matching of X-ray diffraction data. The crystal structures were determined from Rietveld refinement using the WinPLOTR/ Fullprof suite,28 from X-ray diffraction data recorded on a Bruker D5000 diffractometer (CuKR1 radiation) and neutron diffraction data collected on the D20 line of ILL Grenoble, France. Table 1 summarizes the crystallographic parameters of the studied materials.
The compositions were tested as positive electrodes in Swagelok type cells assembled in an argon filled drybox. These homemade batteries were configured as Li metal/Whatman GF/D borosilicate glass fiber sheet saturated with a 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 in weight) positive electrode cells. The composite positive electrodes were prepared by mixing the active material (AM) with 16.67 wt % of carbon Super P either in an agate mortar or in a ball-miller (SP, MMM Carbon, Belgium) to improve electronic contacts. Lithium insertion/extraction was monitored with a Mac-Pile automatic cycling/data recording system (Biologic SA, Claix, France) operating in galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) or potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) modes. A VMP device was also used for the signature curves recorded for LixTiP2O7 and Li1+xTi2(PO4)3.
Electrochemically driven structural changes were followed by in situ X-ray diffraction for Li1+xTiPO5 (0 e x e 0.8), LixTiSO5 (0 e x e 0.8), LixTiP2O7 (0 e x e 1), Li1+xTi2(PO4)3 (0 e x e 2), and LixNaTi2(PO4)3 (0 e x e 1.8). The cell used was that previously described elsewhere29 with a plastic film of the positive electrode material deposited behind a beryllium window, which acted as the positive current collector. The preparation of the plastic films was done as previously reported for the plastic PLiON (Bellcore) technology30 to which was added a preliminary ball-milling step of 30 min (SPEC ballmiller) to favor electrical contacts between the AM and carbon SP (83.3% of AM). The film contained 70 parts of the latter and 18 parts of dibutylphthalate (DBP) dispersed in 12 parts of (poly) vinylidene-hexafluoropropylene (PVdF-HFP) (Kynar FLEX, Elf Atochem NA). 
Once assembled, the cell was mounted on a Scintag diffractometer (Cu KR radiation) operating in ı/2ı Bragg-Brentano geometry or on a D8-Bruker diffractometer (CoKR radiation, PSD counter) operating in ı/ı geometry. The cell was connected to a Mac-Pile system operating in GITT mode: 1 h of charge or discharge at C/10 regime interrupted by relaxing periods of 1-1.5 h during which the X-ray diffraction patterns were collected.
Chemical lithiations of TiP2O7, LiTi2(PO4)3, and NaTi2(PO4)3 were performed using a slight excess of n-BuLi (1.6 M) (reducing agent), previously diluted in a solution of hexanes. The reactions were maintained under constant stirring at ambient temperature in a flask kept in an argon filled glovebox for a period of 5-7 days, and washed several times with hexanes before drying under vacuum. Because of the moisture sensitivity of these lithiated phases, the XRD data were recorded using the same airtight cell as that used for the in situ studies. Chemical analysis performed at the Service Central d’Analyse du CNRS (Vernaison, France) concluded to formulas of Li0.85Ti2P2O7 and Li3.00Ti2(PO4)3 and Li2.00NaTi2(PO4)3.
Insertion into TiSO5, LiTiPO5, and Li2TiSiO5. Oxotitanium materials, expressed by the general formula LixTiXO5 (X ) S, P, and Si; x ) 0, 1, and 2, respectively) were investigated. This family of compositions, with the same Ti/X ratio, was chosen to provide comparative data on how the Ti4+/Ti3+ couple would be shifted by the inductive effect of S, P, and Si on the Ti-O bond.
TiSO5 was prepared by dehydration at 673 K of commercial TiSO5 226)nH2O (ALFA) with n  25) 5.5 as deduced from TGA. TiSO5 can also be synthesized from titanium dioxide and sulfuric acid,31 which, depending on the concentration, time, and temperature of reaction, leads to a highly hydrated TiSO5 226)nH2O solid that dehydrates to TiSO5 226)H2O and then to TiSO5. LiTiPO5 and Li2TiSiO5 were obtained at 1173 and 1373 K, respectively, from intimately mixed precursors LiH2PO4 (Aldrich, 99%), anatase TiO2, LiOH 226)H2O (Aldrich, min. 99%) SiO2 (PROLABO). Attempts to prepare compositions in the solid solution Li1+xTiP1-xSixO5 failed. This may be due to the fact that LiTiPO5 and Li2TiSiO5 do not crystallize in the same space group although their crystal structures are very closely related. The high temperature needed to proceed to the reaction of the SiO2 precursor results in decomposing LiTiPO5 into TiP2O7, LiTi2(PO4)3, and other unknown compounds.
Whereas a standard electrode preparation was sufficient for a satisfactory electrochemical cycling of the oxides described in section 3a, the fabrication of optimized LixTiXO5/carbon SP electrodes required a ballmilling process to ensure good electronic contact.15 The active material (AM) and carbon SP were mixed in the ratio 200 mg/40 mg (16.67% of carbon) for 30 min in a SPEX ball-miller that produces energetic shocks between particles and a stainless ball of  24)4 g inside a 40mL container. The general features of the electrochemical insertion of lithium into the three materials are summarized in the GITT data of Figure 3.
Li2TiSiO5 does not insert more than 0.15 lithium ion per structural formula, even under the most gentle cycling conditions, down to 1 V vs Li+/Li (Figure 3a). In Li2TiSiO5, all the tunnels along the chains of TiO6 octahedra are already filled with lithium, contrary to LiTiPO5, which in turn reversibly inserts more than 0.6 lithium at 1.50V vs Li+/Li (Figure 3b). For Li1+xTiPO5, the overvoltage between the reduction (Red1) and the oxidation (Ox1) peaks is small under slow cycling rate with intermittent relax. Note though that only 0.5 Li ion could be inserted galvanostatically down to 1 V under a C/20 regime without relax period. Insertion in LiTiPO5 is therefore kinetically limited by the difficulty in reaching the “lithium-stuffed” composition Li2TiPO5. The reaction is mostly reversible, as shown by the comparison between the areas of the Red1 and Ox1 peaks and the similar operating voltage on reduction and oxidation. 
Note that the operating equilibrium voltage (1.50 V) is not higher than that for the simple oxides. In situ XRD showed no displacement of the diffraction peaks of the pristine LiTiPO5, which progressively vanished on discharge. The XRD pattern of the second growing phase is poorly defined, its main features being three broad diffraction peaks at d ) 3.315 Å (most intense), d ) 3.015 Å, and d ) 2.370 Å. After x  24) 0.6 lithium inserted, very strong kinetic limitations witnessed by the important polarization of the cell prevent the total reduction of LiTiPO5 into Li2TiPO5.
These limitations and the small operating voltage of the cell diminish the interest of such material as an electrode in Li batteries.
The GITT data of lithium insertion into the third member of the TiXO5 series we investigated, namely TiSO5, are presented in Figure 3c. Although this compound adopts a crystal structure slightly different from those of Li2TiSiO5 and LiTiPO5 it is not too surprising to observe that the operating voltage of the LixTiSO5/ Li cell is significantly higher than for Li1+xTiPO5. This is once again a clear signature of the inductive effect in polyanionic structures, stronger when generated by 3groups. As SO4 for LixFe2(XO4)3 and LixVXO5 compositions, the sulfate groups weaken considerably the covalency of the M-O bonds and thus increase the value of the Mn+/M(n-1)+ redox couple vs Li+/Li. This is easily monitored experimentally for isotypic structures, but more difficult to address when different crystal structures have to be compared. As mentioned by Gaubicher,32 the overall inductive effect is weaker in MXO5-type structures (M connected to 4 XO4 groups) than in NASICON ones (M connected to 6 XO4 groups). 
For this reason, as will be demontrated later, the operating voltage of Ti4+/Ti3+
The system Li/LixTiSO5 is reversible on subsequent oxidation, as the XRD pattern of the pristine phase is mostly recovered after a full cycle, although the global intensity is slightly reduced. Under these in situ cycling conditions, we did not observe the large irreversibility ( 24)0.2 lithium) that resulted from a discharge down to 1 V vs Li+/Li. At low voltage, electrode degradation presumably results from departure of sulfate groups within the electrolyte. At this point, although the inductive effect of the SO4 groups is beneficial to higher operating voltages compared to phosphates and oxides, it also induces weaker Ti-O bonds and thus weakens the structural stability of the electrode over cycling. As will be mentioned later (section 4. Discussion), better capacity retention was obtained when adjusting the operating voltage window between 3.7 and 1.3 V vs Li+/ Li. Corresponding galvanostatic voltage-composition curves, with several cutoff limits are presented in Figure 6. 
Interestingly, the internal impedance of the Li/LixTiSO5 system decreases during cycling, which accounts for the good capacity retention from the second cycle to further cycles when the lower cutoff voltage is maintained above 1.2-1.3V vs Li+/Li.
We tried to prepare this new LiTiP2O7 composition by chemical reduction of TiP2O7 with n-BuLi, and, from chemical analysis, a solid of global composition Li0.85TiP2O7 was obtained. A neutron diffraction pattern was collected at ILL at Grenoble (France) using an airtight cell made of vanadium to protect the material from air. Figure 9 retraces the full-pattern matching refinement of this pattern, which is compared to that of the pristine material. It shows that the lithiated phase we obtained was a mixture of B and C-type phases but we did not succeed in refining the atomic positions by the Rietveld method in these two separate phases. The average composition Li0.85TiP2O7 found by chemical analysis corresponds to a mixture of 24% of LixTiP2O7 (x  24) 0.500.65) and 76% of LixTiP2O7 (x  24) 0.85-1). Note that the cell parameters are slightly different between the neutron data obtained on an intermediate lithiated phase and those found from the in situ experiment.
Moreover, the in situ data reveal the good reversibility of the system as the XRD pattern of the pristine material TiP2O7 is recovered at the end of the first oxidation. This is a common feature to many polyanionic framework structures built on phosphate groups that Fifteen years ago, Delmas10,11 was the first to show the possible lithium or sodium insertion into LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3, respectively, according to a two-phase mechanism between the pristine materials ATi2(PO4)3 (A ) Li or Na) and the end members A3Ti2(PO4)3 into which titanium is at the oxidation state +III. At this early stage of investigation, lithium was thought to occupy the M2 site of the NASICON structure in Li3Ti2(PO4)3, while the M1 site was empty. This accounted for the remarkable increase in the c/a ratio, when going from LiTi2(PO4)3 to Li3Ti2(PO4)3, due to stronger electrostatic repulsions between [Ti2(PO4)3] lanterns along [001] when the M1 site, located halfway between two lanterns, is emptied. 
Recently, the determination of the crystal structure of the isostructural compound Li3Fe2(PO4)3,42 obtained by ion exchange from the parent Na3Fe2(PO4)3, showed that the correct space group was R-3 rather than R-3c (presence of (101), (003), and (303) reflections), and that lithium was indeed located into a set of tetrahedral sites, labeled M3, shifted by  24)0.8 Å along [001] from the M2 position. The possibility of lithium location into such a site had been previously mentioned by Boireau et al.43 who determined the crystal structure of Li3.5Cu0.5Ti2(PO4)3. Even more recently,12 Delmas’ group discovered, from a careful investigation coupling solid-state Li NMR and powder neutron diffraction, that the situation is even more complex. In Li3Ti2(PO4)3 lithium is distributed on two similar tetrahedral sites, M3¢ and M3¢ ¢ , occupied in the ratio 2/3 and 1/3, respectively12 (Figure 11b).
As previously reported by Delmas10 and Aatiq,12 LiTi2(PO4)3 may reversibly insert two lithium ions, operating on the Ti4+/Ti3+ at 2.48 V vs Li+/Li, according to a twophase mechanism between LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3. As shown in Figure 12a, and contrary to the electrochemical data of ref 1212, our electrode preparation (ballmilling with carbon) allowed the almost complete reversible insertion of lithium with extremely small cell polarization for more than 80% of the insertion range, also expressed by the narrow potential gap between the Ox 1 and Red 1 peaks of the PITT derivative curve (inset of Figure 12a).
The observation of two distinct redox steps on discharge #2 supports this mechanism. The mixture y LiTi2(PO4)3 + (1 y) NaTi2(PO4)3, which was reached after the first oxidation, inserts lithium at two redox potentials of 2.38 and 2.47 V vs Li+/Li, i.e., to reach a final composition at the end of discharge #2 of  24)y Li3Ti2(PO4)3 + (1 y) Li2NaTi2(PO4)3. As ion exchange Na+ T Li+ continues to proceed, the global composition of the electrode tends to lower contents of sodium, which is witnessed by the incremental capacity plots in the inset of Figure 14: the areas of the reduction and oxidation peaks at 2.40 V (NaTi2(PO4)3 Li2NaTi2(PO4)3) decrease for the benefit of those at 2.50 V (Li3Ti2(PO4)3 LiTi2(PO4)3). Note that we verified that significant ion exchange between Li+ from the electrolyte and Na+ from NaTi2(PO4)3 occurred by immersing the solid for several days in a large volume of LiPF6 in EC/DMC.
Finally, Figure 16 reports the cycling curve of the LiTi2(PO4)3 electrode, with the signature curve in the inset, similarly to what was obtained for TiP2O7 (Figure 10). This demonstrates once again the very nice stability of the NASICON framework toward reversible lithium insertion. Despite a lower voltage, LiTi2(PO4)3 presents slightly higher specific capacity and capacity retention upon increasing cycling rate than TiP2O7. For instance, at a regime of 2C, about 77% of the initial capacity was delivered, which is almost 100 mAh/g.
Several workers, as Padhi et al., showed that the potential of the redox couples of the transition metal elements (i.e., Ti4+/Ti3+) in polyanionic structures are affected by both the nature and the amount of the surrounding polyanionic groups. In the present case, XO4 groups generate higher ionicity in Ti-O bonds due to the relocation of the electrons from the antibonding level of the 3d-element to the acceptor levels of the polyanion. Thus, potential difference between the Fermi level of lithium and the empty antibonding levels of titanium increases compared to that of simple oxides, which results in a higher operating voltage of the electrochemical cell.
From this study we can provide a wide comparison of average voltages vs Li+/Li for the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple in titanium oxides, phosphates, silicates, and sulfates. Within the phosphate compositions, the potential raises from 1.5 to 2.6 V vs Li+/Li from LiTiPO5 (Ti/P ) 1) to TiP2O7 (Ti/P ) 0.5), respectively. The average potential of the NASICON materials (LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3, i.e., Ti/P ) 2/3), is located around 2.4-2.5 V vs Li+/Li. LiTiPO5 shows a much smaller insertion voltage than the other phosphates. This may be explained by the polyhedral environment of the TiO6 octahedra. In LiTiPO5, each TiO6 octahedron is surrounded by 4 PO4 tetrahedra only and 2 TiO6 octahedra, whereas 6 PO4 tetrahedra surround one TiO6 octahedron in TiP2O7 and ATi2(PO4)3 (A ) Li, Na). Structural limitations due to the limited interstitial space left available in LiTiPO5 are also at the origin of the difficulty in inserting more lithium. 
LixTiSO5 showed an operating voltage vs Li+/Li significantly bigger than for Li1+xTiPO5 due to the stronger inductive effect of SO4 groups compared to that of PO4 groups.
