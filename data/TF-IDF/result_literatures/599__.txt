NASICON-structured Li1+xZr2-xLax(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.2) solid electrolytes are prepared by sol-gel method. The influence of substitution of La3+ for Zr4+ on the ionic conductivity, morphology, and structure of the parent compound LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) is investigated. Rietveld refinement of powder x-ray diffraction data reveals that the La3+ substitution stabilizes the LZP in the highly conducting rhombohedral Rc phase at room temperature. La3+ substituted LZP display enhanced ionic conductivity, showing the highest ionic conductivity of 0.72 × 10−4 S/cm at room temperature for the composition Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3. The improvement in conductivity of LZP with another aliovalent substituent, Mg2+, whose ionic radii is similar to Zr4+ (0.72 Å) is also investigated. Further, the activation energy decreases from 0.53 eV for the parent LZP to 0.42 eV for x = 0.1 La3+ substituted LZP. Lithium-ion transference number obtained by direct current polarization for Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 is 0.99, confirming the high ionic conducting nature of the solid electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry recorded for Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 shows electrochemical stability window up to ∼4.0 V vs. Li. In particular, La3+ substituted NASICON-type LZP (x = 0.1) exhibits good chemical and structural stability after exposing to air, water, Li metal, acidic and basic solutions.

Next generation rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are being developed in the direction to realize superior energy & power densities, economical and enhanced safety than the existing battery technologies [[1], [2], [3]]. Under these directions, significant efforts are taken in developing rechargeable solid-state and hybrid Li-air batteries. High lithium-ion conductivity is a pre-requisite for the solid electrolyte used in solid-state Li-ion and hybrid Li-air batteries [[3], [4], [5]]. Although several groups have reported broad range of inorganic solid electrolytes, the development of solid electrolyte membranes with good ionic conductivity and chemical stability in aqueous solutions (as in the case of hybrid Li-air batteries) having wide pH range is challenging [6,7]. Of various inorganic solid electrolytes reported, NASICON structured LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Ge, and Zr) have drawn significant interest owing to their considerably high ionic conductivity. NASICON-type materials have rigid framework consisting of corner sharing PO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra forming a 3D network with interstitial tunnels in which Li-ions can hop easily [8,9]. Aliovalent substituted-LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiGe2(PO4)3 solid electrolytes exhibit impressive ionic conductivity (>10−4 S/cm) [10,11]. However, the Ti4+ and Ge4+ ions in these materials are getting reduced against lithium metal or lithiated graphite anode, which limits their application in lithium batteries [12]. On the other hand, LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) are stable against Li-metal and lithiated graphite due to highly stable Zr4+. However, LZP displays relatively poor ionic conductivity (10−5 - 10−8 S/cm) at room temperature (RT). LZP prepared at 1200 °C shows structural transition from Triclinic (c) to Rhombohedral (Rc) phase above 310 K [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. The Rhombohedral and Triclinic phases exhibit lithium ion conductivity of 10−5 and 10−8 S/cm at RT, respectively [13,19]. High ionic conductivity is the most important property for solid-electrolytes in rechargeable battery technologies. The ionic conductivity in the range of ∼10−5 S/cm is sufficient for the solid electrolytes to be used thin film micro-batteries since the device current densities are very low [20]. On the other hand, solid electrolyte having relatively high ionic conductivity (∼10−3 S/cm) is required in order to be employed in practical solid state lithium ion and hybrid lithium-air batteries. Ionic conductivities of LZP electrolytes are reported to be enhanced considerably by substitution of aliovalent cation [[21], [22], [23]]. Substitution of Zr4+ cations in LZP with ions of different radii and valence states tunes the hopping tunnel size for Li+ ions, leading to enhanced Li ion mobility.

Herein, we report the influence of substitution of La3+ (ionic radii: 1.032 Å) for Zr4+ (ionic radii: 0.72 Å), in LZP on the lithium ion conductivity, morphology, structural aspects, and chemical stability.

LiZr2-xMx(PO4)3 [M = La3+& Mg2+for Zr4+; x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2] compounds were synthesized via sol-gel method using Citric acid as a chelating agent. All precursors such as LiCOOCH3, La2O3/MgCOOCH3, ZrO2, and NH4H2PO4 were dispersed in an aqueous citric acid solution in stochiometric ratio except LiCOOCH3(10% excess). To this solution, ethylene glycol having molar ratio of 1:1 to citric acid was added and stirred for 12 h at 80 °C. The premixed final solution was kept at 180 °C for 10 h for gelation. The gel obtained was then heat treated at 500 °C and 1000 °C for 6 h (heating/cooling rate: 5 °C/min) with intermediate grindings to obtain white powder. The white powders obtained were pressed at 200 MPa into cylindrical pellets with 2–3 mm thick and 10 mm diameter. Pellets buried in mother powder were then sintered at 1200–1400 °C for 18 h in air at a heating/cooling rate of 3 °C/min to obtain the solid electrolytes.

X-ray diffraction patterns for sintered pellets were obtained using Bruker-D8 advance eco diffractometer. Rietveld refinement using Topas 3.0 software was carried out for the XRD analysis. The relative densities of the pellets were estimated from the pellet dimensions and weight. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, model JEOL JSM-6700F) was used to analysis the microstructure of the pellet. For conductivity measurements, the either side of pellet's surface was sputtered with gold. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for Au/pellet/Au symmetric cells were carried out using VMP3 (Bio-logic). The AC frequency used was in range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz and the AC amplitude was 500 mV. EIS measurements were performed between 30 °C and 120 °C ± 1 °C. Prior to impedance measurements, the pellets were equilibrated at the designated temperatures for at least 15 min. Li/pellet/Au cells were used for cyclic voltammetry measurements. Solid electrolyte pellets coated with gold on either side of its surface was used for the determination of lithium-ion transference number by direct current polarization method. Chemical stability tests for the aliovalent ion substituted solid electrolytes were carried out against air, water, Li metal, acidic and basic solutions.

Fig. 1(a) shows XRD patterns recorded for Li1+xZr2-xLax(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2). These materials were sintered at 1280 °C for 18 h. The diffractograms obtained confirms NASICON structured rhombohedral (Rc) phase for all the materials. No additional Bragg peaks belong to triclinic phase is seen in the XRD diffractograms. However, when x > 0.2, impurity peaks due to unknown phase appeared. The unknown impurity peaks disappeared when the sample with x = 0.3 was sintered at a higher temperature of 1380 °C for 18 h and are not included in this study. This suggests that the pure rhombohedral phase formation temperature increases with increasing La3+ substitution to x = 0.3 (x > 0.2).

Fig. 1(b) displays the effect of lanthanum content on the lattice constants of Li1+xZr2-xLax(PO4)3 (LZLaP). A gradual increment in the lattice constants (a & c) and cell volume (V) with increase in x is seen. The difference in ionic radii between Zr4+ (0.72 Å) and La3+ (1.032 Å) cations is attributed to the increase in lattice parameters. This corroborates with the literature report stating that substitution of Zr4+ by larger cation in the NASICON structure would result in an expansion of unit cells [24]. Rietveld refinement patterns for compositions Li1+xZr2-xLax(PO4)3; x = 0 & 0.1 are presented in Fig. 2. During structural refinement, the occupancy of La3+ and Zr4+ were presumed to take up random positions in the octahedral site. Nominal compositions of La3+ and Zr4+ were used for fixing their occupancies.

Rietveld refinement for the XRD diffractograms of LZLaP having different compositions (a & b, x = 0 & 1); Enlarged view of these diffractograms in the 2θ region of 18° to 21° is shown in Fig. (b) and (d), respectively. Solid line - calculated data (red); open circles - observed data (blue); green line - difference in the refinement, and vertical bars - Bragg positions of rhombohedral phase. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)

Analyses of Rietveld refinement of XRD data show that all the four compounds (x = 0–0.2) possess pure rhombohedral structure and no traces of triclinic phase. Further, the extended 2θ region of the compositions x = 0 and 0.1 of Fig. 2(b) and (d) confirms that there are no Bragg peaks which belongs triclinic phase. It is reported that the rhombohedral phase is stable above 60 °C [16]. However, the Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern of pristine LZP (x = 0) reveals that the rhombohedral phase is stable at RT without aliovalent substitution which is consistent with some of the earlier reports [14,25]. Further, the structural phase transition in LZP is owing to the dislocation of Li1 and Li2 from tetrahedral. Replacing the smaller cation Zr4+ (0.72 Å) by larger aliovalent cation La3+(1.032 Å) could facilitate in increasing Li+ for charge compensation as well as the distribution of Li1 in symmetry-equivalent M′ site by the level of distortion of MO6 octahedra [16,17].

There have been many papers where synthesis of the pure rhombohedral phase of LiZr2(PO4)3 (LZP) is reported to be unsuccessful [18,21,26]. For instance, Xie et al. [21] mention instability of NASICON-type phase formation for pure LZP even after heating at 1200 °C for 38 h. Our own earlier attempts of synthesizing LZP via a sol-gel route invariably resulted in some amount of triclinic phase even after heating the sample at 1250 °C [18]. However, recently El-Shinawi et al. [25] reported the formation of a pure rhombohedral phase of LZP via a sol-gel process upon heating at 1200 °C for 6 h. It was also reported that using the phosphorous precursor 5% less than the nominal stoichiometry resulted in higher purity of rhombohedral LZP phase [25]. In the present work, we have achieved similar results by utilizing NH4H2PO4. One tentative explanation could be related to the degree of disorder in the LZP system prepared via different precursors. It is well known that LZP synthesized at high temperature undergoes a triclinic to rhombohedral phase transition at ∼60 °C. Preparation of a given compound through different synthesis methods and using different precursors could result in drastically different defects arrangement (usually via nature of intermediate phases during synthesis, shape and size effects). In the case of LZP, increase in such disorder could shift the phase transition temperature below room temperature as well as make the phase transition more diffused; and thus, favoring appearance of the higher symmetry rhombohedral phase at room temperature. However, we really don't have a conclusive proof of such changes in defect structure and it is beyond the focus of the present investigation.

A cross-sectional FESEM image for sintered pellets of La-substituted LZP (LZLaP) for various values of x is presented in Fig. 3. Morphology with noticeable pores is seen in Fig. 3(a) for LZP. This pellet was sintered at 1280 °C (dwelling time: 18 h) and estimated to have a density of ∼86%. There is a considerable degree of increment in average grain size as well as decrease in pores thereby significant improvement in the relative density was observed upon substitution of La3+ for Zr4+. FESEM images of Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 pellet shows highly interfused grains without any tangible pores. For Li1.2Zr1.8La0.2(PO4)3 sintered at 1280 °C (dwelling time: 18 h), the grain boundaries are significantly evident (marked with red colored arrow) than the other samples though which is not apparent in XRD pattern. The relative density of pellet initially increases from 86% to 95% on doping (for the x = 0 to 1), but decreases to 94% when x = 2. Presence of larger grain boundaries could be responsible for the slight reduction in relative density for x = 0.2 [21]. Similar densification is reported in NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 compounds [22]. Further, we observe inter-grain microcracking in La3+ substituted LZP samples and such microcracks have been reported to be caused when the parent metal ion is substituted with larger size ions [27]. Since the microcracks cause reduced ionic conductivity, it is presumed that the formation of these cracks can be suppressed by reducing the grain size, which in turn can be achieved by controlling the sintering temperature, holding time, and ramping rates [28]. Further, a lower grain size is preferred as it would result in lower density of microcracks. Larger grain size means more anisotropic thermal expansion induced strain and increased microcracks. Doping might affect the anisotropic thermal expansion of LZP unit cell and such anisotropic thermal strain of unit cells in NASICON-type compounds is supposedly responsible for the microcracks; during cooling, lattice parameter c shrink much rapidly than lattice parameter a resulting in micro-cracks extending to many grains. In the field of ceramic processing, lithium is known to promote the grain growth [29,30]. Under these lines, the reason for grain growth and better densification results in excess lithium in the lattice structure owing to charge compensation of trivalent substitution (La3+) for Zr4+. Beyond x = 0.1 substitution, the grain growth was enormous that resulted in inter-grain microcracks. Thus the presence of such microcracks was responsible for the slight reduction in the relative density and lower ionic conductivity.

Typical Nyquist impedance plots for LZLaP (for x = 0–0.2) measured at 30 °C are shown in Fig. 4. Capacitance values of 10−11 to 10−10 F estimated from the impedance curves suggests that the bulk of samples is responsible for the high frequency semicircle. The characteristic inclined line obtained at lower frequencies is ascribed to Li ion diffusion towards ion-blocking electrodes [7,21,31,32]. The grain and grain boundary conductivities were unable to be deconvoluted from the single depressed semicircular curve obtained for all solid electrolytes and the total ionic conductivity was estimated from the total resistance RB (which includes both grain and grain boundary contribution to the DC resistance of the sample) obtained from the equivalent circuit modeling of complex impedance data as shown in Fig. 4(a). QB and RB represents the constant phase element and total resistance and of the bulk samples and QELE represents the constant phase element of the gold electrode-sample interface.

The bulk conductivity is calculated from the RB and sample dimensions by using the equation, σ =   (where t and A: thickness and surface area of the sample, respectively). The total conductivity values at 30 °C for all the compositions of LZLaP (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) are provided in Table 1. LZP (x = 0) compound exhibits bulk conductivity of 8.73 × 10−7 S/cm at 30 °C. For La3+ incorporated LZP, the bulk conductivity increases to 7.23 × 10−5 S/cm for x = 0.1 and decreases to 4.47 × 10−5 S/cm for x = 0.2 at 30 °C (RT).

Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependences of bulk conductivity and activation energy of LZLaP solid electrolytes with various x values. The temperature dependences of conductivity plot between ln(σ) vs.1000/T was fitted and adheres a linear relationship with temperature as shown in Fig. 5(a); where σo represents pre-exponential factor, Ea represents activation energy per charge carrier, T is absolute temperature, and k is Boltzmann's constant. The values of activation energy (Ea) are estimated using linear fitting of the temperature dependent conductivity results, and the Ea values are listed in Table 1. Fig. 5(b) represents the trend in Ea and RT conductivity of ceramics as a function of La3+content. With the increase in La3+ content, the Ea value initially decreases (0.53 eV for x = 0.0 to 0.42 eV for x = 0.1), but then increases (0.44 eV for x = 0.2). As such, highest ionic conductivity (7.23 × 10−5 S/cm) was obtained for 0.1 mole La3+ substitution. However, it deceases with further increase in La3+ content to x = 0.2. It is reported that the lithium mobility is relatively high in rhombohedral phase of NASICON structured LZP [9,16]. Therefore, the enhanced room temperature conductivity in La3+ incorporated solid electrolytes is ascribed to rhombohedral crystal symmetry, increased lithium charge carrier concentration and higher densification of the compounds.

Substitution of trivalent La3+ for tetravalent Zr4+ introduces one extra Li+ in the unit cell and thus an improved ionic conductivity is anticipated in LZLaP (for x = 0.1). Further, the change in grain boundaries causes a small drop in the ionic conductivity when x = 0.2 as seen in Fig. 3, Fig. 5 [21]. The improved densification upon La3+ incorporation in the lattices and isolation of rhombohedral phase is thus indeed facilitates Li+ mobility within/between the grains. To appraise the improved ionic conductivity due to larger cation La3+ (1.032 Å) substitution for Zr4+ (0.72 Å) in LZP, the aliovalent cation Mg2+ (with similar ionic radii that of Zr4+ (0.72 Å)) substituted Li1+2xZr2-xMgx(PO4)3(x = 0–0.2) (LZMgP) solid electrolytes were prepared by sol-gel method. The XRD patterns confer to rhombohedral (Rc) phase for all the compositions of LZMgP as shown in Fig. S1. The activation energies (Ea) are estimated using linear fitting of the temperature dependence conductivity results. Fig. S2 represents the trend in Ea and RT conductivity of solid electrolytes on varying the Mg2+content. With the increase in Mg2+ content from x = 0.0 to 0.2, Ea decreases from 0.53 eV for x = 0 to 0.44 eV for x = 0.1 and slightly increases to 0.47 eV for x = 0.2. Similarly upon increasing the Mg2+ content to x = 0.1, the RT conductivity increases gradually to maximum values of 4.42 × 10−5 S/cm and it decreases with further increase in Mg2+ content to x = 0.2 which is consistent with trend observed in La3+ substituted LZP samples. However, the room temperature conductivity of Mg2+ substituted (similar ionic radii that of Zr4+) LZMgP (x = 0.1) is approximately three times lower than that of La3+ substituted (larger ionic radii than Zr4+) LZLaP (x = 0.1) sample. Hence, the presence of such larger ionic radii aliovalent cation into the crystal lattice is believed to provide favourable hopping tunnel size for enhanced Li ion mobility.

The electrical conductivity of Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 was calculated from the current obtained by appling a DC voltage of 500 mV as shown in Fig. 6. Initially, there is a rapid decay of the direct current, which attains steady state over time. The measured current over time reaches steady-state is only because of electrons and holes as Au electrodes coated on either side of the pellet block Li ions [33,34]. The electronic conductivity was calculated to be ∼10−8 S/cm (cf. ionic conductivity is ∼10−5 S/cm) and the transference number is close to 1. This demonstrates the ionic conducting nature of the La3+ substituted LZP.

In order to evaluate the electrochemical stability for Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3, cyclic voltammetry was performed in the cell configuration of Li/Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3/Au. The cyclic voltammograms recorded for the cells at different anodic cut-off potentials are shown in Fig. 7. The voltammograms reveal that the Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 has electrochemical stability up to ∼ 4.0 V vs. Li and starts showing additional degradation peaks when scanned up to 5.0 V. Peaks appearing at the cathodic potentials due to the formation of Au-Li alloy and Li stripping from the alloy [35] validate the Li ion conducting nature of Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 at room temperature.

To understand the chemical and structrual stability of LZLaP (x = 0.1), chemical ageing test was performed under air, water, lithium, acidic and basic conditions. Fig. 8 shows XRD patterns of LZLaP (x = 0.1) pellets recorded after treating with air, lithium, and water for various time periods. It reveals that the structure of the La3+ substituted LZP is highly stable after treating with air, lithium and water for a considerable time.

Fig. 9(a) and (b) displays the XRD patterns of LZLaP (x = 0.1) pellets recorded after treating with acidic and basic solutions for about one month time. There is no significant change in the XRD peak positions of the LZLaP (x = 0.1) pellets in both extreme pH conditions are observed, except evolution of unknown peaks at 13° and 28° for the pellet treated with 5 M and 10 M HCl. This proves the high stability of LZLaP towards air, water, lithium, acidic and basic solutions. The development of solid electrolyte with good chemical and structural stability is crucial for applications like aqueous Li-air batteries where the solid electrolyte membrane has to encounter rapid pH shift.

In summary, NASICON structured Li1+xZr2-xLax(PO4)3(x = 0–0.2) solid electrolytes are successfully synthesized via sol-gel route. XRD patterns of the solid electrolytes show stabilization of pure rhombohedral Rc phase for both LZP and La3+ substituted LZP at room temperature. An enhancement in room temperature ionic conductivity from 8.73 × 10−7 S/cm for LZLaP (x = 0) to 0.723 × 10−4 S/cm for LZLaP (x = 0.1) is observed. DC polarization measurement proves that the transference number of solid electrolytes is close to 1 and the electrolytes are ion conductors with negligible electronic conductivity. The cyclic voltammetry data reveal that the LZLaP (x = 0.1) exhibits an electrochemical stability window of up to ∼ 4.0 V vs. Li. Most importantly, LZLaP (x = 0.1) exhibit excellent chemical and structrual stability and retains the rhombohedral Rc phase of NASICON structure after treating with air, water, lithium, acidic and basic environments. These results demonstrate that LZLaP (x = 0.1) can be a potential candidate as the solid electrolyte for hybrid Li-air and solid-state Li-ion batteries.
