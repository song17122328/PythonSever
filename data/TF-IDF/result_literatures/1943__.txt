The crystal structures of NASICON compositions Z2TiM(PO4)3 (Z ) Na, Li; M ) Cr, Fe) were investigated through powder neutron diffraction on the beam lines D1A ( 236) ) 1.9104 Å) and D2B ( 236) ) 1.5924 Å) at ILL, Grenoble, France. Na2TiCr(PO4)3 and Na2TiFe(PO4)3 are isostructural. They crystallize in the space group R3hc, with the sodium ions being located in the M1 ( 244)  24) 1) and M2 sites ( 244)  24) 1/3). NASICON Li1.6Na0.4TiCr(PO4)3 and Li1.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 were prepared through ion exchange from the sodium analogues. They crystallize in the space group R3h, with the lithium ions being located in the M3 tetrahedral site. The remaining, unexchanged, sodium ions are still located on the M1 site. Electrochemical insertion of sodium or lithium into these structures was followed through slow intermittent titration techniques coupled with in situ X-ray diffraction. 
We show that for both Na2+xTiM(PO4)3 and Li1.6+xNa0.4TiM(PO4)3 (0 e x e 1 for M ) Cr, 0 e x e 2 for M ) Fe), the insertion proceeds through a single-phase mechanism.
Since the works of Padhi et al.,1-7 3-D open framenworks built on polyanions such as tetrahedral XO4 groups (X ) P, Mo, W, S) are considered as possible alternatives for a new generation of positive electrodes for lithium batteries. Among these 3-D structures, NASICON compositions were extensively studied for their structural stability and fast ion conduction; as solid electrolytes in the early days, as chemical sensors, or more recently as insertion electrodes.
Phase purities and lattice parameters determinations were carefully monitored by X-ray diffraction on either a Philips PW1710 diffractometer (Cu KR radiation, ı-2ı geometry, back monochromator) or a D8 Bruker diffractometer (Co KR radiation, ı-ı geometry, back monochromator). The experimental X-ray diffractograms are gathered in Figure 1. A list of lattice parameters and space groups of the four materials investigated is given in Table 1. The crystal structures were determined from neutron powder diffraction patterns recorded at 300 K on the high-resolution powder diffractometers D1A and D2B at ILL, Grenoble, France. Data collection with high direct space resolution ( 236) ) 1.9104 and 1.5924 Å, Qmax ) 6.5 Å-1 and 7.8 Å-1, respectively) allowed a precise determination of the nuclear crystal structures. 
The program Fullprof15 was used for structure refinements by using the Rietveld method.16 For in situ X-ray diffraction, a Swagelok-type cell similar to the one described elsewhere17 was horizontally mounted on the D8 Bruker diffractometer (Co KR radiation, ı-ı geometry, PSD counter).
Electrochemical lithium and sodium insertions were undertaken in standard Swagelok cell configuration with a lithium or sodium foil as the negative electrode and the active materials (AM) as positive electrode. The separator used was a Whatman GF/D borosilicate glass fiber sheet saturated with a 1 mol/L LiPF6 electrolyte solution in EC/DMC (1:1 in weight), or 1 mol/L NaClO4 in PC. For optimal electrochemical activity, the AM powders were initially mixed with Super P carbon (MMM Carbon, Belgium) by ball-milling in a SPEX 8000 mixer that generates energetic shocks between particles (250 mg of AM + 50 mg of SP, stainless steel ball of 4 g, 30 min). A “MacPile” automatic cycling/data recording system (Biologic SA, Claix, France) operating either in galvanostatic or potentiostatic mode, was used for the data collecting. Standard electrode investigation was conducted at a galvanostatic regime of C/10 (one electron exchanged in 10 h). 
Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements consisted of 30-min charges or discharges at C/20 rate with open circuit periods of 30 min. Potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) measurements were conducted using potential steps of 10 mV limited by a minimum current equivalent to a C/300 regime. For in situ X-ray diffraction, GITT charge and discharge were conducted at a C/10 regime interrupted every hour by relax periods during which each pattern was recorded.
Figure 4 gathers the values of the c/a ratio for an extensive series of NASICON compositions ZxMM¢ (PO4)3 containing various amounts (x) of lithium or sodium (TiNb(PO4)3, ZTi2(PO4)3, ZFeNb(PO4)3, Z2TiCr(PO4)3, Z2TiFe(PO4)3, Z3Fe2(PO4)3, Z3FeCr(PO4)3, and Z3Cr2(PO4)3, Z ) Li, Na; 0 e x e 3). The c/a ratio is strongly correlated to the occupancy of the M1 site by lithium or sodium.20 As c increases, a decreases through a relaxation phenomenon, when M1 is emptied.
Electrochemical activity toward lithium or sodium insertion is observed for the four compositions of this study (Li2TiM(PO4)3 and Na2TiM(PO4)3 (M ) Fe, Cr)), thanks to the presence of Ti4+ and Fe3+, which can be reduced into Ti3+ and Fe2+. With no surprise, only one electron per formula unit could be exchanged for the mixed Ti/Cr materials as a direct consequence of the electrochemical inactivity of chromium in the range of potentials we studied (3.4-2.0 V vs Li+/Li, 3.1-1.7 V vs Na+/Na). On the contrary, both Ti/Fe materials exchanged two electrons per formula unit.
To account for these observations, it is interesting to recall the extensive literature on NASICON compositions that had been investigated in the 1980s and for which sodium distribution over various interstitial sites within the framework was a major parameter to be related with ionic conductivity. For instance, the compositions Na1+xZr2-xLx(PO4)3 (L ) Cr, In, Yb; 0 e x e 2)27 and Na1+xZr2-x/2Mgx/2(PO4)3 (0 e x e 2)28 were studied in detail by Delmas. Note that the amount (1 + x) of sodium was fixed by substituting given amounts of Zr4+ by L3+ or Mg2+, and not by electrochemical insertion.
It is well-established that the value of the a-parameter is strongly correlated to the following: the size of the M and M¢ cations of the [MM¢ (PO4)3] framework, as MO6 and M¢ O6 octahedra form some sort of ribbons in the (a, b) plane, and the amount of alkaline ions inside these ribbons (M2 sites).
Even better established is that the value of the c-parameter is strongly correlated to the occupation rate of the M1 site (located halfway between [MM¢ (PO4)3] units along [001]), the “positive” charge on M and M¢ , and their size.
During lithium insertion, both LTFP and LTCP show a decrease in the a-parameter (-0.17% and -0.29%, respectively), whereas c strongly increases (+3.60% and +2.37%, respectively). This is clearly illustrated in Figure 8 by the large shift of the (116) peak around 3738 2ı(°). As a result, the c/a ratio increased by +3.77% for LTFP and by +2.70% for LTCP. From the considerations given above, we propose that the anisotropic elongation of the LTFP and LTCP cells along [001] during Li insertion might be induced by a progressive transfer of the 0.4 remaining sodium from the M1 to the M2 sites, by the increase of transition metal ionic radii as x increases, and by the progressive filling of the M3 site by lithium, as for Li3+xFe2(PO4)3.29 The much weaker variation of a (decrease) is probably accounted for by a relaxation phenomenon of the framework.
The end-member, reduced composition Li3.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 was also prepared from the parent Li1.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 by chemical lithiation with n-butyllithium, in hexane solution. After a 7-day immersion under magnetic stirring, the powder was washed 4 2) in clean hexane solutions, and dried under vacuum for several hours. Because of air and moisture sensitivity, the obtained Li3.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 powder was kept in an argon-filled drybox. An X-ray diffraction pattern was collected for 4.5 h, with the sample being placed within the same cell as for the in situ experiments. The XRD pattern is provided in Figure 13 and compared with that obtained during the in situ experiment. The Bragg positions corresponding to an a ) 8.363(1) Å; c ) 22.882(3) Å (V ) 1386(1) Å3) unit-cell in the R3h space group are also drawn. Both data are very consistent.
The complete structural study of B-Li3.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3 through powder neutron diffraction is scheduled for the near future and will probably allow determination of the exact location of Li (and remaining Na) ions within the interstitial space of the NASICON framework.
During sodium insertion, however, both NTFP and NTCP show a large increase in the a-parameter by +4.56 and +2.07% (shift of the (211) peak around 37 2ı(°) in Figure 11), whereas c smoothly decreases by -1.86 and  24)0%, respectively. Consequently, the c/a ratio decreases by -6.14% for NTFP and by -1.94% for NTCP. The strong increase in the a-parameter would be attributed to the filling of the M2 sites, added to the increase in the ionic radii. This is consistent with the results of Tillement on NaxZrFe(PO4)3 (2 e x e 3),30 into which zirconium is not electrochemically active and iron is reduced to Fe2+.
We presented the crystal structures of NASICON Na2TiM(PO4)3 (R3hc) and Li1.6Na0.4TiM(PO4)3 (R3h) (M ) Fe, Cr) from neutron diffraction experiments. The [TiM(PO4)3] units are similar, and the main changes are nested in the alkaline ions distributions among three possible sites. This study also demonstrates the exceptional stability of the NASICON framework toward reversible insertion/extraction of sodium or lithium, particularly true when x is between x ) 2 and x ) 4 in ZxMM¢ (PO4)3. Remarkably, the four compositions of this study all show very small polarization during charge or discharge and full theoretical capacity is reached experimentally. This capacity is small in the case of Crcontaining ZxTiCr(PO4)3 (2 e x e 3) as Cr3+ is not reduced, whereas the capacity observed for ZxTiFe(PO4)3 (2 e x e 4) is twice as important.
