Crystal structures from two new phosphates Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) and Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II) have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Compound (I) crystallizes in a rhombohedral system (S. G: R-3c, Z = 6, a = 8.7350(9) ˚A, c = 21.643(4) ˚A, R1 = 0.041, wR2 = 0.120). Compound (II) crystallizes in a monoclinic system (S. G: C2/c, Z = 4, a = 11.729(7) ˚A, b = 12.433(5) ˚A, c = 6.431(2) ˚A, ˇ = 113.66(4)◦, R1 = 0.043, wR2 = 0.111). The three-dimensional structure of (I) is closely related to the Nasicon structural type, consisting of corner sharing [(Ni/Fe)O6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra forming [NiFe(PO4)3]4+ units which align in chains along the c-axis. The Na+ cations ﬁll up trigonal antiprismatic sites within these chains. The crystal structure of (II) belongs to the alluaudite type. Its open framework results from [Ni2O10] units of edge-sharing [NiO6] octahedra, which alternate with [FeO6] octahedra that form inﬁnite chains. Coordination of these chains yields two distinct tunnels in which site Na+.

The magnetization data of compound (I) reveal antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions by the onset of deviations from a Curie–Weiss behaviour at low temperature as conﬁrmed by Mössbauer measurements performed at 4.2 K. The corresponding temperature dependence of the reciprocal susceptibility  2)−1 follows a typical Curie–Weiss behaviour for T > 105 K. A canted AFM state is proposed for compound (II) below 46 K with a ﬁeld-induced magnetic transition at H≈ 19 kOe, revealed in the hysteresis loop measured at 5 K. This transition is most probably associated with a spin-ﬂop transition.

Inorganic phosphates cover a large class of diverse materials whose applications include: catalysts, solid electrolytes for batteries [1–7], linear and non-linear optical components [8–11] and laser materials [12,13]. However, the study of phosphates has become more popular particularly after the development of the compounds containing [A2(XO4)3] fragments in the underlying framework. Common structure types are Garnet, Nasicon, Alluaudite, [Sc2(WO4)3] and Langbeinite (Figs. 1–4). In general, these structures have the same type of framework, but with different types of holes, cavities, tunnels for cations accommodation. Physical and chemical properties of all these types of compounds depend strongly on their crystal structure. Nasicon and Alluaudite structure types of interest for this study and therefore described in more detail.

The basic structure of these compounds was ﬁrst described by Hagman and Kierkegaard [14]. These phosphates have been widely studied in many ﬁelds, because of their various properties such as conductivity, low expansion coefﬁcients and catalytic activity [15–19]. They have fascinated much awareness in recent past, as they facilitate a large scope for preparing number of materials with variation in their constituent metal ions and composition [20–24]. These materials have the general formula BpAnA 5) m(PO4)3 where B is a monovalent cation Na+, Ag+, Cu+, H+, H3O+, NH4 +, or a divalent one such as Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Cu2+, while A and A 5) can be ﬁlled with tri-, tetraor pentavalent transition metal ions. Thus the structure can be tailored by substituting at B, A, and/or A 5) sites which gives rise to a large number of compounds for comparative studies. The crystal structure consists of a three-dimensional network built up from corners sharing of [PO4] tetrahedra and [AO6] ([A 5)O6]) octahedra. Every apex of [AO6] octahedron belongs to one [PO4] tetrahedron. The two distinct interstitial voids generated within the network are known as M(1) and M(2) sites. The M(1) site is a trigonally distorted octahedron formed by the triangular faces of two [AO6] octahedra along the c-axis of the hexagonal cell. The M(2) sites are located in the large cavities and have an eight-fold coordination. There is one atom on a M(1) site per three atoms on a M(2) site according to the formula unit M(1)xM(2)yAn(PO4)3 with 0≤ x≤ 1 and 0≤ y≤ 3. Most of the members of Nasicon type compounds so far known in the literature are described in rhombohedral R ¯3c, R ¯3 or R32 space groups with typical unit cell dimensions a ∼8 ˚A and c ∼22 ˚A, but cell distortions leading to a monoclinic symmetry have been also reported [25,26].

The alluaudite-type compounds have been extensively studied in the context of corrosion inhibition [27], passivation of metal surfaces [28], and heterogeneous catalysis [29]. The crystal structure was ﬁrst described by Moore [30] who studied a single crystal of Na0.625Li0.025Ca0.125Mn1.125Mg0.05Fe1.975(PO4)3 from the Buranga pegmatite originating from Rwanda. The crystal structure of this compound was assigned to a monoclinic system with C2/c space group and a general structural formula X(2)X(1)M(1)M(2)2(PO4)3 (Z = 4), where X are large cation polyhedral, M are distorted octahedral, and P the tetrahedral centers [30]. The cations are distributed among the different crystallographic sites in dependence on their ionic radii. Accordingly, the large X(2) site contains Na and vacancies; X(1) contains Na, Mn, and Ca; M(1) contains Mn and Fe2+; and the small M(2) site hosts Fe3+, Fe2+, Mn, Mg, and Li. Because Mn dominates on the M(1) site, and Fe2+ and Fe3+ dominate on the M(2) site, Moore proposed thus the ideal formula Na2MnFe2+Fe3+(PO4)3, from which the majority of natural alluaudites can be derived [30]. The structure of alluaudite consists of kinked chains of edge-sharing octahedra stacked parallel to (1 0 1). These chains are formed by a succession of M(2) octahedral pairs linked by highly distorted M(1) octahedra. Equivalent chains are connected in the b direction by phosphates groups to form sheets oriented perpendicular to [0 1 0]. These interconnected sheets produce tunnels parallel to the c-axis, which contain the distorted cubic X(1) site and the four-coordinated X(2) site. Over the past decade, many arsenates, molybdates, phosphates, tungstates and vanadates, with the Alluaudite structure have been synthesized. The structural investigations of these synthetic compounds showed the existence of new crystallographic sites localized in the channels of the structure, on positions which are different from those of X(1) and X(2). In order to take these new crystallographic sites into account, Hatert et al. [31] proposed the new general formula [A(2)A(2) 5)][A(1)A(1) 5)A(1) 5) 5) 2]M(1)M(2)2(PO4)3 for alluaudite-type compounds. In this formula, A(1) and A(2) 5) correspond to X(1) and X(2), respectively.

There are different ways to prepare new kinetically stable solid compounds at low temperature. The most common techniques are hydrothermal synthesis and chemical vapour transport or the use of molten salts (or ﬂux growth) to dissolve reactants at relatively low temperature. In the present paper, we report hereby on the synthesis, using a ﬂux method, of two new monophosphates [Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) and Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II)] in the ternary system Na3PO4–Ni3(PO4)2–FePO4. Their crystallographic structure are described in detail and their magnetic and hyperﬁne interaction properties are also reported.

The crystals grown used in the present study were obtained in a synthesis aiming at the hypothetic diphosphate “Na3Ni2Fe(PO4)2(P2O7)” in ﬂux of sodium dimolybdate Na2Mo2O7. A starting mixture of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Ni(NO3)2·3H2O, (NH4)2HPO4, Na2CO3 and MoO3 was mixed in the appropriate proportions to obtain the nominal composition and then ground. The mixture was placed in a platinum crucible and then subjected to several steps of heat treatment. Firstly, the mixture was heated at 200 ◦C for 6 h and then at 500 ◦C for 24 h to decompose H2O, NH3 and CO2. Single crystals were prepared by melting the resulting powder at 1150± 20 ◦C for 15 h and then cooled down progressively to 500 ◦C at rate of 3 ◦C/h and faster after switching off the furnace to reach room temperature. A mixture of yellow and yellow-green crystals was obtained.

Brown single crystals with dimension 0.40 mm× 0.18 mm× 0.08 mm for Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) and 0.20 mm3 × 0.25 mm3 × 0.15 mm3 for Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II) were selected. The data for both crystals were recorded at room temperature on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur (TM) diffractometer, operating at 40 kV and 30 mA and with a graphite monochromator (Mo–K␣ radiation,  6) = 0.71073 ˚A). The cell parameters were reﬁned from the complete data sets. Absorption corrections were computed by the Gaussian method taking into consideration the shape and the size of the crystals.

Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) crystallizes in rhombohedral symmetry with the following lattice parameters a = 8.7350(9) ˚A and c = 21.643(4) ˚A in the hexagonal setting. A ﬁrst reﬁnement in space group R3 converged to a satisfactory model with R1 = 0.0521, but a check of these structural data with the program ADDSYM immediately allowed to identify additional symmetry elements, thus conﬁrming the R− 3c (167) space group. Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II) crystallizes in monoclinic symmetry with the lattice parameters a = 11.729(7) ˚A, b = 12.433(5) ˚A, c = 6.431(2) ˚A and ˇ = 113.66(4)◦. The systematic absences h + k = 2n + 1, l = 2n + 1 and h = 2n + 1 for h 0 l and k = 2n + 1 for 0 k 0 are consistent with the C2/c (1 5) space group.

Experimental details, reﬁnement parameters and crystal data for both compounds are summarized in Table 1.

Both structures were solved by the heavy atom method. The full matrix leastsquares reﬁnements of the atomic parameters were performed on the F-values weighted by 1/ 4)(F)2 using the SHELX-97 suite [32,33] in the WinGX framework [34]. They lead to R1 = 0.041 and Rw = 0.120 for Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) and to R1 = 0.043 and 0.111 for Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II). Atomic coordinates in both compounds are reported in Tables 2 and 3. Further details of the crystals structure investigations are reported elsewhere [35].

The magnetization was measured with a DMS 1660 vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) in a magnetic ﬁeld up to 13.5 kOe. The sample was ﬁrst cooled down to 105 K under an applied ﬁeld of 13.5 kOe, and then the measurements were performed when warming the sample up to 303 K under the same magnetic ﬁeld. The VSM was calibrated using pure nickel (Ms = 54.9 emu/g).

Compound (I) crystallizes in the trigonal system R-3c, it belongs to the Nasicon family. Table 4 compares the parameters of Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) with those of Na4AA 5)(PO4)3 (AA 5) = CrMg, CrCo, NiFe, TiNa, ZrNa). Fig. 5a and b shows the variation of the crystallographic parameters of these Nasicon-type phosphates in which the sum of the A and A 5) cations charges on the octahedral site is +5. The linear variations of these parameters versus the mean A cation radius (rAA  5) ) are consistent with the atomic distribution for the Na4NiFe(PO4)3 structure in which the Ni2+ and Fe3+cations occupy the A sites randomly. Fig. 5a and b shows that both the ah and ch parameters increase when rAA “cations radius” increases. As the M(1) and M(2) sites are fully occupied by Na(1), we conclude that the ah and ch parameters are functions of the An+ ion size, ch parameter also increases with the strength of the Na+ (M(1))– An+ electrostatic repulsion.

Ni/Fe distribution. The distribution of Ni/Fe atoms is discussed in more detail. The structure is based on a three-dimensional framework of [PO4] tetrahedra and [(Fe/Ni)O6] octahedra sharing corners (Fig. 6). Fe3+ and Ni2+ ions occupy statistically the 12c sites. Ni/Fe atoms are displaced from the center of the octahedron due to the Na+–Fe3+/Ni2+ repulsions. The O(1) and O(2) sites play distinct roles. Indeed, O(2) constitutes the octahedral M(1) cavity between adjacent Fe/Ni(PO4)3 lantern units along [0 0 1], while O(1) constitutes the empty “internal” cavity located between the two [FeO6] octahedra of the Fe/Ni(PO4)3 lantern unit (Fig. 6). Consequently the Fe3+/Ni2+–O(2) distance is 2.053(3) ˚A, neighboring the sodium Na(1), is slightly greater than the Fe3+/Ni2+–O(1) distance 1.955(3) ˚A (Table 5). On the other hand, the Fe3+–Fe3+ distance through the Na(1) site along [0 0 1] increases from 6.414(3) ˚A in Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) to 6.487 ˚A in  7)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The average Fe3+/Ni2+–O distances 2.002 ˚A are slightly smaller than the values calculated from the ionic radii (2.075 ˚A) [42]. The O–(Fe3+/Ni2+)–O angles vary between 83.35(12)◦ and 169.48(15)◦. The angles implying the shortest bonds are superior to those involving the longest ones as a consequence of the O–O repulsions which are stronger for O(1)–O(1) than for O(1)–O(2) and O(2)–O(2). The Fe3+/Ni2+–Fe3+/Ni2+ distance within the lantern unit along [0 0 1] (4.406(5) ˚A) is lower to the Fe3+–Fe3+ distance in  7)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (4.417(2) ˚A) [43], due to the cationic repulsions between ions on 12c sites. These repulsions are stronger in Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (charge of iron is 3) than in Na4NiFe(PO4)3 (I) (mean charge of Fe3+/Ni2+ = 2.5). are phosclose (1.508(2)–1.541(2) ˚A)] phates in Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3 respectively] 2(PO4)3, [36,43]. O–P–O angles vary from 106.11(8) to 112.11(8) [(106.9(3)–112.1(3) ˚A)] in Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3.

Na+ cations occupy partially the M(1) and M(2) sites. The Na(1) atoms occupy the center of the M(1) site. Na(1)–O(2) distance (2.463(2) ˚A (Table 5) is close to 2.40(2(5) ˚A in Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3, which in turn is close to the calculated one (2.42 ˚A) from the ionic radii [42] (2.500(1) ˚A in  7)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3). The Na(2) atoms, located in the M(2) site, are surrounded by eight oxygen atoms, the Na(2)–O distances vary from 2.390(3) to 2.855(5) ˚A induces close values for the Na(2)–O distances for Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3 and  7)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3, respectively.

The general structure of Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 is isostructural to the alluaudite-type. A perspective view of this structure along the [0 0 1] direction is illustrated in Fig. 7. The open framework is built up from a complex arrangement of [NiO6] and [FeO6] octahedral and [PO4] tetrahedra. The essential building units of the structure are Ni2O10 units resulting from two edge-sharing [NiO6] octahedra. Neighbouring [Ni2O10] are connected by the [FeO6] octahedra through edge-sharing that form inﬁnite chains with a stacking sequence of Ni–Ni–Fe and passing through the unit cell in the direction [1 0 ¯1]. Linkage of these chains being ensured by the [PO4] tetrahedra via corners and the resulting three-dimensional framework delimits two kinds of tunnels in the [0 0 1] direction. These tunnels are occupied by the Na+ ions.

Ni2+ is coordinated to six oxygen ions, every [NiO6] polyhedron is connected to another [NiO6] by common edge (O(3)–O(3)) and form a binuclear unit [Ni2O10] (Fig. 8) with Ni–Ni distance of 3.105 ˚A. The other corners O(1), O(2), O(4) and O(5) are connected to [PO4] tetrahedra. The angle O(3)–Ni–O(3) is 85.07(15)◦ and the Ni–O distances range from 1.952(4) ˚A to 2.143(4) ˚A (Table 6). This dispersion evidences a fair distortion of the [NiO6] octahedron due to the edge-sharing.

The iron coordination has a very distorted octahedral geometry, as evidenced by the Fe–O bond distances between 2.112(4) and 2.150(4) ˚A. The O–Fe–O bond angles vary between 74.88(14)◦ and 164.78(15)◦ (Table 6). This distortion is probably due to the rigidity of [PO4] units surrounding the Fe atom.

There are two crystallographically distinct sites, occupied by P5+ cations, both tetrahedrally coordinated. P–O bond distances for each [PO4] tetrahedron range from 1.527(4) to 1.560(4) ˚A and O–P–O bond angles range from 104.1(3) to 113.3(2)◦. These results are in a good agreement with those usually observed in anhydrous monophosphates [44,45]. The [P(1)O4] tetrahedron connects two chains by sharing each pair of its oxygen O(1) and O(5) with one chain. The [P(2)O4] tetrahedron links three adjacent chains and thus two of its oxygen atoms belong to the same chain.

The three-dimensional framework of (II) leads to two types of tunnels at x = 1/2; y = 0 and x = 0; y = 0 which are occupied by the sodium atoms Na(1) and Na(2), respectively. Taking into account cation – oxygen distances below 3.0 ˚A, the Na(1) and Na(2) sites are both surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. Their environments approximate a very distorted rhombohedron and a very distorted cube, respectively. Each of the [Na(1)O8] and [Na(2)O8] polyhedra form inﬁnite chains stacked parallel to the [0 0 1] direction by facesharing.

The crystal structure of Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 is closely related to the alluaudite type structure of the mixed valent iron phosphates: Na2FeII 2FeIII(PO4)3 [36], with one main difference being the presence of separated [Fe2O10] units of edge-sharing [FeO6] octahedra. In terms of the X(2)X(1)M(1)M(2)2(PO4)3 general formula of the alluaudite, the M(1) and M(2) environments have both an octahedral geometry. These octahedra share their edges with each other to form inﬁnite chains running along the [1 0 1] direction. In the structure of Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 (II), the M(2) site is occupied by Ni while M(1) contains only Fe atoms. The chains characterizing the alluaudite structure are then built up from [Ni2O10] units alterning with [FeO6] octahedra.

Fig. 9 shows the temperature dependence of the inverse magnetic susceptibility  2)−1 and the corresponding magnetization measured at H = 13.5 kOe for Na4FeNi(PO4)3. The ␹−1(T) curve obeys a Curie–Weiss law down to 100 K, with negative T-intercept, namely the Weiss constant p = –16 K indicating antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. Such interactions can be expected for the underlying crystal structure, in which Fe3+ and Ni2+ ions occupy statistically the 12c sites and the [(Fe/Ni)O6] octahedra could be coupled via a superexchange mechanism through O–P–O bridges from [PO4] tetrahedral, resulting in magnetic ordering as conﬁrmed by Mössbauer spectroscopy discussed below. The room temperature Mössbauer spectrum of Na4FeNi(PO4)3 (Fig. 10a) was ﬁtted with one Lorentz-type symmetric quadrupole doublet, in agreement with the existence of one crystallographic Fe site. Note that the intensity of each doublet was constrained to be equal as well as the width of the peaks (I,  8) ). The isomer shifts (ı) clearly indicate the high-spin state of Fe3+ ions in an octahedral oxygen crystal ﬁeld, typically close to 0.48 mm/s for Fe3+ in sixfold coordination as reported by Menil [46]. The observed value of 0.42 mm/s is in agreement with highly ionic Fe–O bonds due to the inductive effect by the phosphate polyanions as established by Gleitzer [47]. The quadrupole splitting  8) = 0.27 mm/s reﬂects a highly distorted octahedral conﬁguration of Fe3+. The Mössbauer spectrum of Na4NiFe(PO4)3 measured at 4.2 K is shown in Fig. 10b. It has been ﬁtted with four magnetic sextets of equal relative areas and widths of peaks. The hyperﬁne ﬁelds are rather similar (56.0 and 54.4 T) and typical for a high-spin Fe3+ ion close to saturation. The value of the isomer shifts (0.54 mm/s) is in agreement with the second-order Doppler shift. These results conﬁrm the expected antiferromagnetic ground state due to superexchange coupling between Fe(Ni) ions.

The results of magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range from 1.7 to 350 K are plotted in Fig. 11. In the range 50–300 K, the inverse magnetic susceptibility follows (r = 0.9999) the Curie–Weiss law  2)−1 = 9.5(1) + 0.05(1)T, C being 20 cm3K/mol. The ﬁtted parameters together with the measured effective magnetic moments ( 9)effexp) = (8C)1/2 is 12.64  9)B, even higher than the spin-only contributions from Ni2+ (3d8) and Fe3+(3d5) [ 9)effcal = 11.56  9)B]. The magnetic behaviour for Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 presents interesting features. Fig. 12 shows the corresponding temperature dependence of the magnetization M(T) measured at 100 Oe revealing a ferromagnetic component below the Curie temperature of about Tc = 46 K as clearly determined from the temperature derivative of magnetization. However, the magnetization above Tc does not vanish but shows a progressive decrease. The corresponding reciprocal susceptibility  2)−1 as a function of temperature above Tc is displayed in Fig. 11. The  2)−1 data can be essentially attributed to a Curie–Weiss behaviour ( 2)−1 = (1/C)(T–p), although some weak magnetic order persists above Tc as indicated by the curvature of  2)−1 versus T.A hysteresis loop M(H) at 5 K (up to 55 kOe) is shown in Fig. 13a. The observed remnant magnetization and the coercivity Hc = 1.5 kOe support the existence of a FM phase (see Fig. 13b). The large slope in the highﬁeld region reveals that only small components of the magnetic moments are ferromagnetically aligned. This means either weak ferromagnetism in a canted antiferromagnetic structure of ferrimagnetism. A careful inspection of M(H) curve indicates a change in the slope with ﬁeld, most pronounced in the ﬁeld-derivative of magnetization (∂M/∂H)T as shown in Fig. 13b. A ﬁeld-induced transition might be indicated from the reﬂection point at about 30 kOe in (∂M/∂H)T and would be compatible with a canted AFM state as reported for other phosphate-based systems [48,49].

Crystals from two new monophosphates have been prepared using a ﬂux method. Their crystal structures have been determined. Na4NiFe(PO4)3 is characterized by a 3D framework, Ni2+ and Fe3+ occupy statistically the same crystallographic site, magnetically coupled by supersuperexchange via O–P–O bridges from [PO4] orthophosphate groups. In the allaudite-type phosphate Na2Ni2Fe(PO4)3 [NiO6] and [FeO6] octahedral share edges to form trimers in the structure. The magnetic properties have been discussed, based on magnetization studies and Mössbauer spectroscopy.
