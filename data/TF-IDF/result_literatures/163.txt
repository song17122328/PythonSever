Na super ion conductor (NASICON) Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) is considered to be one of the most promising solid electrolytes for solid-state sodium batteries. However, low ionic conductivity is one of the main challenges for its practical application. Herein, we report a novel Mg2+/F- co-assisting strategy to synthesize NZSP solid electrolyte with enhanced ionic conductivity. Mg2+/F co-assisting lead to a significant increase in the particle size and a reduction in the concentration of grain boundary. A dense microstructure is also formed with co-assisting. Consequently, high ionic conductivity of 2.21 mS cm-1 at 300 K, low electronic conductivity of 1.76×10-5 mS cm-1 at 300 K and low activation energy of ~0.27 eV are achieved for the optimized Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte. Finally, a Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 solid-state sodium battery employing Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance. High discharge specific capacity of 71.5 mAh g-1 is displayed at 1 C at 300 K, with 96% retention after 100 cycles. Therefore, this cation/anion co-assisting strategy provides inspiration for the development of other classes of ceramic solid electrolytes for solid-state sodium batteries.
Following the popularity of the lithium-ion batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage, the world is looking toward alternative and cost-effective from renewable sources. Sodium-based batteries are gaining great interest owing to the abundant resource and low-cost of Sodium [1, 2]. Nevertheless, the liquid organic electrolytes presently employed in sodium-ion batteries have some safety issues, such as flammability, leakage and volatilization. Additionally, the application of high-capacity metallic Na as anode is restricted because of dendrite growth. Hence, solid-state sodium batteries employing inorganic solid electrolytes have attracted significant interest in recent years [3-6]. Then a great deal of effort is dedicated to explore solid electrolytes as alternatives to solve the safety issues.
To date, various fast sodium-ion conductors have been developed, such as Na-βˊˊ-Al2O3[7, 8], Na3PS4[9], Na2S-P2S5[10], Na10SnP2S12[11] and NASICON Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0≤x≤3)[12, 13]. Na-βˊˊ-Al2O3 is widely used in high-temperature Na-S batteries. Nonetheless, Na-βˊˊ-Al2O3 is sensitive to moisture[14], and the high-cost of single-phase Na-βˊˊ-Al2O3 also limits its application[7]. Although sulfide based sodium-ion solid electrolytes possess high ionic conductivity and good ductility, most of them are unstable in air[15] and the electrochemical stability windows are narrow [16]. Compared with the above sodium-ion conductors, Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 materials have gained great attractive due to their relative high ionic conductivity and great stability in air atmosphere. Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 materials are first reported by Hong and Goodenough [17, 18]. Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 crystallizes stabilize in rhombohedra structure (R-3c group) except at these compositions (1.8≤x≤2.2) which exhibit a monoclinic symmetry (C2/c group) at low temperature (T<400 K)[19]. High ionic conductivities have been achieved for Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 ceramic in the range of 1.8≤x≤2.2, and the highest ionic conductivity of ~10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature occurs when x=2 (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, NZSP)[13] [20, 21]. Therefore, most researches on optimizing NASICON materials are based on NZSP composition. Attempts have been devoted such as element doping in bulk and adjusting the chemical composition at grain boundary to further increase the ionic conductivity of NZSP solid electrolyte to meet the practical application of solid-state sodium batteries. Recently, alivalent doping in Zr4+ site has been reported to enhance the ionic conductivity of NZSP solid electrolyte by enlarging the bottleneck for sodium ion migration, increasing the additional of sodium ion concentration by charge balance, or decreasing coulomb interactions between sodium ion and surrounding cations[22-25]. Song et al. reported that alkaline earth ions-doped NZSP has a high ionic conductivity of 10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature[26]. Khakpour et al. synthesized Ce4+, Gd3+ and Yb3+-doped NZSP by solid-state reaction, and the highest ionic conductivity of 9.0× 10-4 S cm-1 is reached for Na3Zr1.9Ce0.1Si2PO12 at room temperature [27]. Other ions such as La3+, Sc4+, Mg2+ and Ge4+ also have been doped in NZSP solid electrolyte, and high ionic conductivities up to 10-3 S cm-1 are achieved at room temperature [28-32]. Moreover, a small amount of conductive phase, such as Na3PO4 and Na3La(PO4)2, can also facilitate the improvement of the ionic conductivity[12] [33]. Besides, excellent densification is also an important factor for the enhancement of ionic conductivity. Different sintering technologies are applied to increase the density of NZSP ceramics.A dense NZSP ceramic with high ionic conductivity of 1.4×10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature is achieved by liquid-phase sintering using Na3BO3 additive[34]. Hong′ s group obtain an almost fully dense NZSP ceramic with a high ionic conductivity of 1.8×10-3 S cm-1 at room temperature by employing spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique[35].
In this work, we report a novel cation and anion co-assisting strategy to enhance the ionic conductivity of NZSP solid electrolyte. Mg2+ cation has a lower valence than Zr4+ cation. By increasing the concentration of Na+ carriers to compensate for the positive charge generated by Mg2+ substitution, the ionic conductivity can be improved. In addition, Mg2+ and Zr4+ have the same ionic radius (0.72 Å), which may allow Mg2+ to effectively enter part of the Zr4+ sites. The F- could improve the sintering activity of ceramic materials. By introducing F- into the NASICON-type Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 ceramic solid electrolyte, the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 grains become larger and more densely packed [36, 37]. Mg2+ and F- are selected as cation and anion in this study, respectively. Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte materials are synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction. Effects of Mg2+/F- co-assisting on the microstructure, morphology and electrochemical behaviors of NZSP solid electrolyte are studied. Results indicate that Mg2+/F co-assisting leads to a significant increase in the grain size and a decrease in the concentration of grain boundary. A relatively high dense microstructure is also produced with co-assisting. Meanwhile, a conducting secondary phase of Na4Mg(PO4)2 is formed due to the low solid solubility of Mg2+ in NZSP lattice. Luo et al. reported that Mg-doped Na3PO4 compound is a conducting second phase, and it can improve the grain boundary conductivity of NZSP by decreasing the grain boundary resistance for Na+ transport [33]. Consequently, high ionic conductivity of 2.21 mS cm-1 at 300 K, low electronic conductivity of 1.76× 10-5 mS cm-1 at 300 K, and low activation energy of ~0.27 eV are achieved for the optimized Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte. Moreover, wide electrochemical stability window up to 5.09 V vs. Na+/Na and excellent NZSP-0.10MF/Na interfacial stability with stable cycling for about 100 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 are also obtained. These properties are promising as a solid electrolyte for solid-state sodium batteries. Finally, a Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 solid-state sodium battery employing Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte was assembled. The battery exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 71.5 mAh g-1 at 1 C at 300 K with ~96% retention after 100 cycles.
 Mg2+/F- co-assisted Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP-xMF) with composition of Na3+2xZr2-xMgxSi2PO12 (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30) were synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction method. Since most of fluorine volatilizes during high temperature sintering process, there is no F element in the formula. Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, ZrO2, SiO2, NH4H2PO4 and MgF2 were used as starting materials. All compounds’ powders were milled in ethanol using a planetary ball mill with a rotary speed of 400 rpm for 10 h. The mixed precursors were dried in oven at 80 oC for 12 h, and subsequently these mixtures were calcined at 1150 oC for 6 h in air with a heating rate of 10 oC min-1. The obtained powders were milled for 12 h and pressed at ~120 MPa into green pellets (~10 mm in diameter and ~2 mm in thickness). The pellets covered with raw powders to avoid sodium loss during high temperature sintering were sintered at 1100 oC for 24 h in air with a heating rate of 10 oC min-1.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation in the 2ɵ range from 10 o to 50 o. The microstructures of solid electrolyte pellets were observed by the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Quanta 250). Elemental distribution was detected by energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) equipped on FE-SEM.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out employing a Versatile Multichannel Galvanostat 2/Z (VMP2, Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstation with AC amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 Hz to measure the total conductivity. Both surfaces of the tested pellet were sputtered with Au as ion-blocking electrodes. The electronic conductivity was analyzed by DC polarization with a constant polarization voltage of 2 V. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiment was performed to evaluate the electrochemical stability window of the NZSP solid electrolyte with Au as the working electrode and sodium foil as the counter electrode, at a scanning rate of 0.2 mV s-1. Galvanostatic cycling was performed at 0.5 mA cm-2 using Na/NZSP/Na symmetrical cell to determine the interfacial stability between solid electrolyte and Na meal anode. The symmetric cell was periodically cycled by Na stripping and plating for 20 minutes, respectively.
A solid-state battery using Na metal as anode, NZSP-0.10MF as solid electrolyte, and Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode was assembled as 2032 cell in an argon-filled glove box. To prepare the cathode electrode, Na3V2(PO4)3 powder, acetylene black carbon, poly (vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF) (a mass ratio of 80:10:10) mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), then the slurry was coated on Al foil and dried at 120 oC for 10 h under vacuum to remove the NMP solvent. The Al foil with active material was cut into disks and put on NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte. 10 μL liquid electrolyte (1M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate) was applied to wet the interface between the cathode and NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte. The Na metal with a thickness of 500 μm was attached to the other side of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte as anode by pressing. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of the solid-state sodium battery were conducted in the voltage ranges of 2.3-4.3V vs. Na/Na+ on a LAND CT2001A battery test system (Wuhan, China) at 300 K.
The XRD patterns of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP pellets are displayed in Fig.1. Clearly, the main diffraction peaks of all samples are agreement with a monoclinic NZSP structure (ICDD#: 01-070-0234) with a space group of C2/c. In the meanwhile, Mg-related Na4Mg(PO4)2 secondary phase is identified in Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP ceramic pellets with x≥0.10. And the peak intensities of Na4Mg(PO4)2 secondary phase increase with the x increase, demonstrating that only small amount of Mg2+ is doped into Zr4+ sites due to its low solubility in NZSP lattice, and the remaining Mg2+ forms a new phase. Mg-related Na4Mg(PO4)2 secondary phase is also identified in single Mg-0.10 assisted NZSP pellet (Fig.S1b). Moreover, Fig.S1 further confirm that Mg2+ is not completely doped into Zr4+ sites because of low solid solubility of Mg2+ in NZSP lattice. Mg-related Na3PO4 compounds have been reported as a conductive phase, and small amount of them is beneficial to improve the ionic conductivity by decreasing the grain boundary resistance for Na+ transport [33]. What is more, Fig.S1 also confirms that small amount of Mg2+ occupies Zr4+ site rather than Na+ site. Additionally, ZrO2 secondary phase is identified in all samples, and the peak intensities of ZrO2 show slightly difference. ZrO2 secondary phase always exists in NZSP materials [25, 26, 38], which can lead to a decrease in the grain boundary conductivity. Besides, no F-related phases are detected in Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP (Fig.1) and single F- assisted NZSP (Fig.S1b), implying that F- is doped into NZSP lattice or volatilized during high temperature sintering. In order to further insight into the existence form of fluorine, F1s in the surface and interior of NZSP-0.10MF pellet were detected by high-resolution XPS (Fig.S2). The peak at ~689 eV corresponds to F-Si/P bond [39-41], demonstrating the presence of F- occupying part of the O2- site in NZSP lattice. Meanwhile, obvious differences in the intensities of F1s peaks at ~684 eV, which corresponds to negatively charged F- state, are observed in surface and interior. Additionally, all peak intensities of F1s in surface and interior are extremely weak, indicating that most of fluorine volatilizes during high temperature sintering, and only tiny amount of fluorine exists.
Typical SEM images of the cross sections of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte pellets are shown in Fig. 2a-o. It can be seen that Mg2+/ F- co-assisting does promote the sintering process of the ceramics. All samples exhibit relatively dense microstructures (relative density>90%). The densities of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP pellets are higher than that of bare NZSP pellet (Fig.S4). However, some pores are observed in the samples with too much Mg2+/F- co-addition (Fig.2 h, j, l, and n), which may reduce the densification to some extent and decrease the ionic conductivity. Moreover, significant differences in particle size are observed. The particle size increases with the Mg2+/F- co-addition content increasing to x=0.20 and then slightly decreases with further increasing Mg2+/F- co-addition content. An increase in particle size can effectively reduce the concentration of grain boundary, which is beneficial to enhance the grain boundary conductivity [42, 43]. In order to explain this observation, we further investigate the effects of single Mg2+ and F- on particle size of NZSP solid electrolyte. The Mg2+-assisted NZSP sample shows transgranular morphology (Fig.S5a and b). The grain boundaries are connected to each other tightly. Nevertheless, obvious pores are observed. The particle size of F--assisted NZSP sample increase significantly compared to that of un-assisted NZSP sample (Fig.S5c and d), indicating that F- can effectively promote the grain growth of NZSP particles. Together with the above analysis, it could be concluded that Mg2+/F- co-addition shows synergistic behavior for achieving dense NZSP pellets with large particle size and low concentration of grain boundary. Moreover, the EDX mapping results of NZSP-0.10MF ceramic are shown in Fig. 2p. Mg element exhibits non-uniform distribution, further demonstrating that Mg2+ do not completely substitute Zr4+ sites in NZSP lattice, consisting with the XRD results. EDX also reveals that tiny amount of F- exists. Notably, F- content is weak, further verifying that a large proportion of fluorine volatilizes during high temperature sintering.
To evaluate the electrical conductivity of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP ceramic solid electrolytes, EIS was employed. Fig. 3a shows the impedance spectra of different content of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP ceramics at 300 K. Clearly, all spectra show a high-frequency semicircle and a low-frequency tail. The semicircle represents the total (bulk and grain boundary) resistance, and the tail is attributed to the Na+ transfer resistance between the solid electrolyte and the Au blocking electrode. The lower frequency intercept of the semicircle on the real Z axis gives the total resistance (Rt). The total conductivity can be calculated by σt=L/(Rt·A), where, σt, L, Rt and A are the total conductivity, the thickness, the total resistance and the effective area of the solid electrolyte, respectively.
As shown in Fig.3a, with the Mg2+/F- co-addition content increase to x=0.10, the Rt decreases. However, with further increasing Mg2+/F- co-addition content, the Rt slightly increases. The calculated total conductivities for all samples are shown in Fig.3b. It is found that the total conductivities of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP samples are higher than that of the un-assisted NZSP sample. The total conductivity of NZSP-0.10MF pellet is found to be as high as 2.21 mS cm-1, which is about 5.5 times that of the un-assisted NZSP pellet (0.41 mS cm-1). This highest total conductivity is comparable to that of the high values of previously reported [21, 33, 35]. Moreover, the total conductivity of NZSP-0.10MF is higher than that of single Mg-0.10 assisted NZSP (0.89 mS cm-1) and F-0.20 assisted NZSP (0.95 mS cm-1), as shown in Fig.S6. For the superfine NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte, the enhanced conductivity can be probably ascribed to the following reasons: (i) large particle size leads to low concentration of grain boundary, which will decrease the grain boundary resistance; (ii) small amount of Na4Mg(PO4)2 secondary phase facilitates the Na+ transport along grain boundary through forming a continuous Na+ transport path. Moreover, the partial substitution of Mg2+ in Zr4+ site introduces an increase of Na+ concentration by charge balance, which could lead to an enhancement of bulk conductivity; (iii) excellent densification of NZSP-0.10MF pellet with a high relative density of 98.9% is also a crucial factor for the enhancement of the grain boundary conductivity. The conductivity of polycrystalline NZSP ceramic is mainly controlled by the grain boundary conductivity. Therefore, Mg2+/F- co-assisting mainly improves the total conductivity through improving the grain boundary conductivity.
The Arrhenius plots of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP pellets are shown in Fig.3c. The logarithm of total conductivities of all samples has an excellent linear relationship with the absolute temperature. The activation energy (Ea) is calculated according to σt T=A exp (-Ea/kbT), Where A, kb and T are the pre-exponential parameter, the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. As shown in Fig.3d, the activation energies are 0.3301, 0.3020, 0.2661, 0.2951, 0.3049, 0.2812 and 0.2937 eV for NZSP-xMF with x=0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30, respectively. These results are similar to that of the reported previously[13] [34]. The activation energies of Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolytes are slightly lower than that of un-assisted NZSP solid electrolyte, implying that an easier Na+ conduction path exists in Mg2+/F- co-assisted NZSP solid electrolytes.
Negligible electronic conductivity at operating temperature is required for a solid electrolyte. DC polarization method was carried out to check the contribution of the electronic conductivity to the total conductivity of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte. Fig.4a displays the current dependence of polarization time for NZSP-0.10MF pellet with Au as blocking electrodes. It can be clearly seen that the current reaches steady state with the polarization time increasing. The electronic conductivity can be calculated by σe=(I×L)/(A×U) equation, where σe, I and U are the electronic conductivity, the steady state current and the polarization voltage. A low electronic conductivity of 1.76×10-5 mS cm-1 is calculated, which is about 5 orders of magnitude lower than its total conductivity (2.21 mS cm-1). The result suggests that the electronic conductivity is negligible, and NZSP-0.10MF can be considered as a pure ionic conductor.
Besides the primary property of high ionic conductivity of NZSP solid electrolyte for practical application in solid-state sodium batteries, wide electrochemical stability window is also an essential requirement. The electrochemical stability of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte is evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry employing Au/NZSP-0.10MF/Na cell with a scan rate of 0.2 mV s-1 (Fig.4b). The electrochemical stability window of NZSP-0.10MF is up to 5.09 V vs. Na+/Na, which is wide enough to meet the requirements of most sodium cathodes, and high energy density sodium batteries can be obtained employing high voltage cathodes.
To better assess the electrochemical performance of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte, galvanostatic Na stripping-plating at ±0.5 mA cm-2 in Na/NZSP-0.10MF/Na symmetrical cell was evaluated at 300 K in term of interface stability of solid electrolyte to Na metal anode. In Na symmetric cells, a short circuit event will lead to a sudden, abnormal drop of polarization. As shown in Fig.4c, a stable polarization voltage is maintained throughout the cycling for about 100 h with no sign of short circuiting, indicating an excellent interfacial stability. Therefore, it could enable the use of metallic Na anodes in solid-state sodium batteries employing NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte at 300 K.
Finally, a solid-state sodium battery using Na metal as anode, NZSP-0.10MF as solid electrolyte and Na3V2(PO4)3 as cathode was assembled. The battery is cycled for 50 times at the current density of 0.2 C, then the current density is switched to 1 C, and the battery continues to cycle for 100 times at 300 K. The galvanostatic discharge-charge performances of the Na/NZSP-0.10MF/Na3V2(PO4)3 solid-state battery at 0.2 C and 1 C are shown in Fig.5. Obvious charge/discharge plateaus around 3.4V/3.3V is observed, which corresponds to the reversible transformation of V3+/V4+. Notably, the maximum discharge specific capacity of 95.0 mAh g-1 (81.2% of the theoretical capacity (117 mAh g-1) of Na3V2(PO4)3) within 4 cycles is achieved with a transient activation processes at 0.2 C. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity is retained to 85.7 mAh g-1 (90.2% of the maximum discharge capacity). The discharge specific capacity decreases when the current density is changed to 1 C. 71.5 mAh g-1 is displayed in an initial test at 1 C, and ~96% capacity retention is maintained after 100 cycles. The internal resistance of the battery over cycling at 1C is almost not changed (Fig. S7). Moreover, the Coulombic efficiencies are about 92%-95% and almost 100% (except for the first few cycles) during cycling at 0.2 C and 1 C, respectively. In addition, all the diffraction peaks of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte after cycling are still well indexed to the monoclinic NZSP structure (Fig.S8), indicating that the NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte has a superior stability, and that the crystal structure is not damaged upon cycling. Therefore, the solid-state battery demonstrates good electrochemical stability of NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and Na metal anode. Based on the above analysis, good electrochemical performance of the Na/NZSP-0.10MF/Na3V2(PO4)3 solid-state sodium battery indicates that NZSP-0.10MF with high ionic conductivity can function as effectively as a solid electrolyte in a solid-state sodium battery.
 The NZSP solid electrolyte material was studied to understand the effect of Mg2+/F- co-assisting behavior on the microstructure, morphology and ionic conductivity. It is established that Mg2+/F- co-assisting promotes the grain growth, reduces the concentration of grain boundary, and produces a high dense ceramic microstructure. High ionic conductivity of 2.21 mS cm-1, low electronic conductivity of 1.76×10-5 mS cm-1, and low activation energy of ~0.27 eV are achieved for NZSP-0.10MF solid electrolyte. Moreover, good electrochemical stability up to 5.09 V vs. Na+/Na and excellent NZSP-0.10MF/Na interfacial stability with stable cycling for 100 h at 0.5 mA cm-2 are also achieved. Finally, Na/NZSP-0.10MF/Na3V2(PO4)3 solid-state sodium battery exhibits an excellent cycling performance. High discharge specific capacity of 71.5 mAh g-1 is achieved at 1 C, and ~96% capacity retention is maintained after 100 cycles. This cation/anion co-assisting provides inspiration for further improving the ionic conductivities for other ceramic solid electrolytes in developing solid-state batteries.
