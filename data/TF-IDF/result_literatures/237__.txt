Li-ion superionic conductors play an important role in next-generation energy storage devices. To be applicable,  they  should  meet  a  wide  range  of  specifications  such  as  safety,  efficiency,  affordability,  and  stability.  The  NASICON-type  Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  (LATP)  compound  is  a  well-known  lithium-conductive  solid  electrolyte,  suitable for all-solid-state and redox-flow battery prototypes offers great potential. Yet, despite the high scientific  attention paid to LATP, its stability towards environmental exposure to reactive components such as water,  carbon dioxide, and oxygen is poorly elucidated. Herein we evaluate under controlled conditions the structure  and transport properties of LATP in both air and argon atmosphere to understand the influence of environmental  processing effects over a three-month set of experiments. We demonstrate that LATP ceramics (total conductivity  σt of 4⋅10 0) 4 S cm 0) 1 at room temperature; porosity of 18.5 vol %) degrade drastically showing 76% and 28% of  the σt losses (for ceramics stored in the air and argon correspondingly). Based on experimental and theoretical  approaches, we propose a degradation mechanism supported by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS),  Powder  X-Ray  Diffraction  Analysis  (PXRD),  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM),  Energy-Dispersive  X-Ray  spectroscopy (EDX), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.   

Nowadays,  almost  any  portable  electronic  device  contains  a  rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Even though commercially available  Li-ion batteries have good consumer-oriented characteristics, they still  have several disadvantages which hinder their larger scale adoption  towards transportation and grid scale applications. For instance, such  commercially available batteries can explode during the high temperature  exposure,  overcharge  or  other  mechanisms  due  to  the  short circuiting because of the Li-dendrite growth. All the issues mentioned  are  related mostly to the liquid  form of  a Li-conductive electrolyte.  Therefore,  the  development  of  alternative  solid-state  Li-conductive  electrolytes  has  received  much  current  attention  in  realization  of  development of solid state battery configurations [1].  In this vein, now many are investigating Na-super-ionic-conductive  (NASICON)  materials  that  were  first  described  in  1976  and  were  initially studied as superionic sodium conductors with the basic formula  Na1þxZr2SixP3-xO12  [2,3].  This  structure  is  represented  in  two  main  parts:  a  “skeleton”  that  is  formed  by  the  rigid  [Zr2SixP3-xO12] substructure, and a charge carrier Naþ that can move within the interconnected pathways — interstitial space of the “skeleton” [2].  Later, the list of chemical elements involved into the both “skeleton”  substructure and charge carrier was extended [4–6]. As the result, today  the  NASICON-designation  corresponds  more  to  the  crystal  structure  family rather than the exact chemical composition or charge carrier  nature.  The general formula of NASICON-type materials can be represented  as: A1þδM2(BO4)3  where A — Li [4,7–12]. Na [2–4,13], K [4]; M —  tetravalent  cation  (Zr,  Ti,  Ge,  Hf,  Sn  or  mixture)  [2–4,7–12]  or  its  combination  with  trivalent  cation  (Al,  Fe,  In,  Y,  Ga)  [4,9,10,13]  or  bivalent cation (Sr, Ca, Mg) [4,12]; B  0) P [2–4,7–13] or its combination  with  Si  [4,9].  Therefore,  the  amount  of  a  charge  carrier  A  can  be  modified by changing the overall charge of a “skeleton”.

Thereby, the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 chemical composition was chosen  to be investigated in the current work.  The synthesis of LATPs can be carried out via wide range of methods:  coprecipitation  with  subsequent  calcination,  glass-ceramic  synthesis,  solid-state  synthesis,  etc.  Many  morphological  issues  can  be  solved  through the optimization of synthesis conditions [17–21]. Taking into  account the importance of the chemical composition strict control and  the  possibility  of  thorough  Powder  X-Ray  Diffraction  (PXRD)  based  crystal  structure  analysis  (that  requires  micro-sized  crystallites),  a  solid-state synthesis approach was chosen to be applied in the current  study.  In spite of many LATP-based studies, the amount of thorough investigations that include a combination of both analytical and theoretical approaches is rather limited. In addition to this, the stability of LATP  towards the aging has not been fully detailed and as such many contradictory claims [14,18,21] have been made that leads to misunderstanding. Therefore we designed a set of studies using a full analytical  routine  including  the  structural  (PXRD  and  PXRD-based  Rietveld  refinement), electrochemical (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy  —  EIS), morphological (Scanning Electron Microscopy —  SEM), and  elemental  characterization  (Energy-Dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  —  EDX) to be able to correlate structural and transport properties of LATP  of both pristine samples and aged samples after exposure to ambient  conditions.  In addition  to the  classical analytical characterization,  a  computational Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach is used  to understand and interpret experimental observations. These calculations proved to be useful for investigation of the ion migration mechanisms in solid electrolytes, particularly, the significance of the concerted  motion of ions [22,23], and to estimate the migration barriers for both  vacancy and interstitial migration [24]. Furthermore, our DFT calculations allow us to propose a new low energy lithium position Li(1/2)  involved in the interstitial migration which was not described before  [24]. Therefore, we can expect this work to be important for fundamental aspects of Li-ion conductivity of LATP as well as for applied  implementations to explain its performance as a superionic conductor.  Furthermore, we may expect our study to be useful for the optimization  of LATPs application and storage conditions, which, in its turn, will  likely improve the final outcome.  2. Experimental  2.1. Synthesis 

The reagent-grade Li2CO3, Al(NO3)3⋅nH2O, TiO2, (NH4)H2PO4 were  used. The solid-state synthesis was carried out using the Nabertherm L5/ 12/P330 muffle furnace and the Hydraulic press Platen Press P 300 P/M.  Since, aluminum nitrate Al(NO3)3∙nH2O has variable chemical composition (n), this reagent was preliminarily decomposed to Al2O3 to provide the correct stoichiometry of LATP. The alumina was prepared by a  thermal decomposition of reagent-grade Al(NO3)3⋅nH2O (heating up to  900 �C, holding for 2 h). Fresh Al2O3 was taken out of the hot furnace  (air quenched), cooled naturally, and then mixed with other compounds  in stoichiometric proportions to obtain ca. 5 g of the final Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound. The reagent mixture was thoroughly manually  ground in an agate mortar. Then, the powder obtained was pressed into  pellets (1 cm diameter press-form is; 33 Bar pressure applied on the  working piston). After, pellets were placed in an alumina crucible, which  was subsequently put into the muffle furnace. The solid-state synthesis  was then carried out as follows:   1. Heating  for  2 h  up  to  250 �C  (holding  for  2 h)  with  subsequent  heating for 2 h up to 725 �C (holding for 2 h) and further heating for  1 h  up  to  750 �C  (holding  for  6 h).  Afterwards,  the  sample  was  quenched. The porous chunk obtained was then ground thoroughly  in  agate  mortar.  The  powder  received  was  pressed  into  pellets ~250 mg each (1 cm diameter press-form is; 33 Bar pressure applied  on the working piston);   2. Heating for 2.5 h up to 850 C (holding for 6 h) with subsequent air  quenching. After cooled naturally, all pellets obtained were put into  the argon-filled GloveBox immediately.  Final pellets are ready to be prepared for further EIS, SEM, and EDX.  To implement the powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis ceramic  pellets were ground manually in agate mortar to fine powder. 


The PXRD patterns were registered using the Bruker D8 Advance  (CuKα1,2 radiation; LynXeye XE detector; 2.5� soller slits; 1 mm fixed  divergence slit; 30� min 0) 1 sample holder rotation; 2θ range from 10� to  120�; 2θ step ¼ 0.01�). The PXRD patterns intensities exceed 150 000  counts. Crystal structure of the obtained compounds was refined by the  Rietveld method in the R3c space group using the JANA 2006 software  [25].  The LeBail refinement settings, zero shift, and asymmetry factors  were established by the registration, profile and structural analysis of  the Al2O3 NIST 676a standard [26]. The Al2O3 refinement results are  given in Supplementary, Section 1. As a result, the final LeBail refinement settings were as follows: background — manual in combination  with the Chebyshev polynomial with 5 variables; unit cell dimensions a  and c; profile — Pseudo-Voigt peak-shape function with GW, LY, LX, Lxe;  zero-shift (values of the alumina standard were input and fixed); vertical  shift — Sycos; asymmetry — by divergence with HpS/L (values of the  alumina standard were input and fixed).  The structure refinement parameters were as follows: atomic positions of Al, Ti, P, and O (the starting atomic positions were taken from  Ref. [27]; Al and Ti shared a joint position; Li positions were fixed);  thermal displacement parameters — harmonic anisotropic approximation for Al and Ti, isotropic approximation for P, O, and Li (fixed for the  latter  one).  All  occupancies  were  fixed  on  the  nominal  values.  The  samples that came through the PXRD-based structure refinement will be  further  denoted  as  AirN  and  ArN  for  air and  Ar-stored  samples  respectively, where N is serial number. 

Gold electrodes (30 nm thickness; 8 mm diameter) were sputtered on  both plane faces of the pellet using the magnetron-sputtering machine  Quorum Q150T ES and the 8 mm diameter mask. The EIS results were  registered using a two-electrode cell with copper electrodes. The masks,  impedance cell, and copper electrodes were designed using the FreeCad  software [28] and fabricated through PLA using the Ultimaker 2þ 3D  printer and the HAAS DM-1 CNC Drill/Mill center (Figure A2, Supplementary, Section 2). The project files (in.stl and. step format) of masks,  cell and electrodes used are available at Mendeley Data (https://doi.  org/10.17632/23hkrycsbw.1; please, refer to this article if used).  Impedance studies were carried out at a galvanostat/potentiostat  Metrohm Autolab (frequency range 1 MHz–10 Hz, amplitude 10 mV vs  Root Mean Square (RMS)). For each experiment, at least 5 spectra were  recorded, approximation was carried out using the original Metrohm  Autolab NOVA software. A quality of data was verified using Kramers Kronig Relations (X2 ~ 10 0) 5 10 0) 6). EIS data were recorded in a temperature T range from  0) 160 to þ60 �C. Samples were exposed to low  temperatures using a liquid nitrogen (T was checked by the Testo 735  multichannel  thermometer  with  the  Testo  Type  K  chromel-alumel  thermocouple probe), while the 5–60  �C range was supported by the  TSO-1/80 SPU thermostat.  A relative error in conductivity measurement was estimated to be 6%  for σb and 5% for σgb, σt, and Cgb. A relative error values were estimated  using approach for indirect measurement taking into account error of 

Nova approximation (less than 5%) and errors of direct measurements of  the samples thickness and diameter (Supplementary, Section 3).  Activation  energy  of  conductivity  was  calculated  from  Arrhenius  type plot using the following formula:   σ∙T ¼ σ0∙exp(-Ea/RT)                                                                             Error in the Ea calculation was estimated from graphical data (least  square linear fit — the standard error value for the constant k for a linear  function y ¼ kx þ b which was obtained using the LINEST approximation  in Excel) to be 0.004, 0.02 and 0.01 eV for bulk, grain boundary and  total Ea, correspondingly. 

To analyze the morphology of ceramics obtained, a scanning electron  microscopy (SEM) was carried out using the Jeol JCM 6000 microscope.  To determine the grain size distribution different areas of ceramics were  explored and more than 200 grains were taken into consideration. To  examine the intergranular changes the focused ion beam (FIB) SEM was  carried  out  on  the  FEI  Osiris  microscope  operated  at  200  kV  and  equipped with a super-X detector, followed by the EDX mapping of the  heaviest element — titanium. The Al:Ti ratio was estimated through the  energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) implemented by the scanning electron microscope Jeol JSM-6490LV (W-cathode, operating at 30  kV)  equipped  with  the  EDX  system  INCA  Energyþ (Oxford,  Si-(Li) detector). 

The DFT calculations were performed with the help of the Vienna ab  initio  Simulation  Package  (VASP)  [29]  using  the  PBE  generalized  gradient approximation (GGA) functional [30] and projector augmented  wave (PAW) pseudopotentials [31] to describe core electrons. Plane  wave basis set cutoff was set to 500 eV. The k-points were generated  with a spacing not larger than 0.235 Å 0) 1 along the axes of the reciprocal  unit cells. Minimum energy path (MEP) calculations were performed  using the nudged elastic bands technique (NEB) [32]. All the VASP  calculations were automated with the help of SIMAN package [33].  The orthorhombic simulation cell used in the calculations containing  4 formula units of LTP (i.e. LiTi2(PO4)3 � 4) was obtained by transformation matrix [0 1 0; -1 0 1; 1 -1 1] from the primitive rhombohedral  cell (or [-1 1 1; -3 -3 0; 2 -2 1]/3 from hexagonal cell). Its shape and  volume as well as the ionic positions were relaxed. The final dimensions  of the cell were: 8.68 � 8.65 � 12.26 Å. For the LATP MEP calculation  the cell was duplicated along the orthorhombic c-axis so that its length  became 24.45 Å and it contained a straight diffusion path consisted of  four Li(1) positions. One of the Ti atoms was replaced by Al atom. The  ion positions of the NEB images were relaxed until the maximum force 

The main NASICON phase formation was studied using step-by-step  PXRD phase analysis (Figure A3, Supplementary, Section 4). The sharp  peak shape identifies that the material obtained is well-crystallized and  the crystallites are expected to be microsized. It is seen, that the NASICON phase forms mainly after the first annealing step (with final temperature 750 �C). In addition to the main phase peaks, weak but well resolved reflexes can be distinguished easily (Figure A4, Supplementary, Section 4). These reflexes are attributed to the same main LATP  phase  and  caused  by  the  residual  low-intensity  X-Ray  irradiation,  namely CuKβ  and WLα1  (Figure A4, Supplementary, Section 4) [34].  Therefore, the materials synthesized are pure and contain the target  LATP phase only. 

The experimental,  refined  and  differential  PXRD  patterns  for  all  samples are given  in Supplementary, Section 5 (Figure A5-A9). The  selected  results  of  Rietveld  refinement  are  given  in  Table  1.  The  particular crystallographic data for all samples are presented in Supplementary, Section 5 (Table A1-A5).  The true density (ρtrue, g cm 0) 3) values obtained were used further for  the calculation of ceramics porosity (see Table 1; Supplementary, Section 6).
