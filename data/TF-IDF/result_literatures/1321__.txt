The Li1+xTi2 xFex(PO4)3/C series with 0 # x # 0.4 was prepared by a sol‚Äìgel method. XRD patterns showed a rhombohedral phase and minor contribution of an orthorhombic phase. The local environment of the phosphate structure was analyzed by 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy. The electrochemical lithium insertion revealed two reversible regions for Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ti4+/Ti3+ reactions  1 were recorded as conÔ¨Årmed by 57Fe M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectroscopy. Capacity values as large as 130 mA h g for Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C after 40 cycles. The drastic decrease in capacity observed for LiTi2(PO4)3/C cycled at C/2 was explained in terms of a lower kinetic response at the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interphase.

Transition metal compounds with NASICON-type structures are characterized by an open framework which facilitates the diffusion of host species as alkaline ions.1‚Äì4 Since the Ô¨Årst studies, titanium containing phosphates constituted a family of good ionic conductors clearly envisaged for their application as solid state electrolytes.5‚Äì7

InÔ¨Ånite ribbons of alternating TiO6 and LiO6 octahedra are linked together by PO4 tetrahedra perpendicular to the c direction creating large M2 vacant sites. The M1 sites in the NASICON structures are fully occupied by the alkaline ions. The M2 vacant sites are interconnected allowing a diffusion path for the lithium ions. A complete description of the NASICON structure and the distribution of M1 and M2 sites has been reported elsewhere.1,6 Delmas et al. reported for the Ô¨Årst time the ability of LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3 to insert reversibly lithium and sodium, respectively.8,9 The authors reported a high Ô¨Çexibility of the framework due to the corner sharing of polyhedra. The insertion of lithium to eventually reach the Li3Ti2(PO4)3 phase led to a decrease of the a parameter and an increase of the c parameter as a consequence of the higher ionic radius of Ti3+ than Ti4+.8

Nevertheless, the low electronic conductivity of these phosphate based positive electrode materials hinders their potential applicability. The octahedra containing the transition metal are electronically isolated by the surrounding PO4 tetrahedra. In order to overcome this drawback, the partial substitution of the transition metal and the creation of a Ô¨Ånely dispersed conductive carbon phase have been proposed. A large variety of related titanium phosphates can be prepared by substituting either

lithium or titanium by other elements. Thus, the alkaline ion can be replaced by alkaline earth elements as calcium10 or magnesium11 or transition metals as copper12 or manganese13 preserving the open structures that allow the lithium diffusion. Alternatively, titanium can also be substituted by other transition elements such as Mn, Cr or Fe.14,15 Otherwise, the carbon coating of electrode materials from a citrate precursor has also rendered signiÔ¨Åcant improvements of the electrochemical performance of the lithium cells.16,17

The goal of this work is to examine the effect of the partial iron substitution in LiTi2(PO4)3/C composites. The structure of the resulting phase and the local environment of probe atoms will be evaluated by 31P MAS NMR and 57Fe M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectroscopies and the results will be correlated with the insertion properties of the electrode materials in lithium cells.

Samples with the nominal stoichiometry Li1+xTi2 xFex(PO4)3/C (0 # x # 0.4) were synthesized by a sol‚Äìgel method. For this purpose, stoichiometric amounts of Ni(NO3)3$9H2O (Panreac), LiH2PO4 (Panreac) and NH4H2PO4 (Aldrich) were dissolved in deionized water. Then, an equimolar amount of citric acid was added as a carbon source for the eventual composite. Then, an appropriate volume of titanium isopropoxide was diluted in 40 mL of ethanol and poured into the aqueous solution of the other reagents. The resulting gel was homogenised by an ultrasonic-assisted rheological phase method which has been demonstrated to be useful in the synthesis of LiFePO4.18 For this purpose, an ultrasonic probe (Sonics & Materials) set at 750 W and 20 kHz was immersed in the gel precursor for 2 hours under continuous stirring. The solvent was then evaporated and the solid precursor was recovered and ground. The precursor was eventually annealed in an argon atmosphere at 400 C for 5 hours  to ensure the citrate decomposition and then at 700 C for 10 h.

 1 was applied. The presence of A heating ramp of 3 carbon can be visually identiÔ¨Åed by black colour of the product. The precise carbon content in these transition metal phosphate‚Äì carbon composites was determined by using an Elemental CHNS Eurovector EA 3000 analyser. Mass percentage values lower than 10% were recorded for the studied samples.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer. The samples were scanned (2q degrees) by a step scan mode in which between 10 and 110 0.04 steps each 12 seconds were applied. Unit cell parameters were calculated using Fullprof software. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a PHILIPS CM-10 microscope. 31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance400WB instrument. A 4 mm diameter rotor sample holder was spinned at a 12 kHz rate. An 85% H3PO4 solution was used as a reference. 57Fe M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature on an EG&G constant accelerator spectrometer. All the isomer shifts are given relative to the center of a-Fe. The experimental spectra were Ô¨Åtted to Lorentzian lines by using a least squares based method. The goodness of the Ô¨Åt was controlled by the usual c2 test.

The electrode materials were prepared by mixing the sample with carbon black and PVDF (polyvinylidene Ô¨Çuoride) in 80 : 10 : 10 ratio, respectively. The mixture formed a slurry by adding N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and stirring vigorously in an Ultraturrax miller at 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes. The slurry was pasted onto an aluminum support acting as a current collector and dried at 120 C under vacuum for at least two hours. The electrochemical lithium insertion was monitored by assembling two-electrode Swagelok type cells. A 9 mm lithium pellet was used as a counter electrode and glass Ô¨Åber sheets (GF/A-Whatman) soaked in 1 M LiPF6 (EC:DEC) as a separator. The lithium cells were assembled in a glove box under a controlled argon atmosphere. These cells were cycled at constant current between 1.9 and 3.9 V. The charge and discharge rates were expressed as C/n, where n is the number of hours needed for the reaction with 1 lithium per formula unit at the applied current intensity.

Three-electrode Swagelok type cells were assembled using a lithium disk as a reference electrode for recording the Electrochemical Impedance Spectra (EIS). The cells were cycled up to the end of the discharge and let to relax for at least 12 h to achieve a quasi-equilibrium system. The impedance spectra were recorded on an Autolab PGSTAT12 by perturbing the equilibrium potential with an AC voltage signal of 5 mV which was applied from 100 kHz to 2 mHz.

LiTi2(PO4)3 crystallizes in the rhombohedral system. The XRD pattern of the LiTi2(PO4)3/C sample revealed the presence of a single phase having reÔ¨Çections that were indexable in the R3c space group (Fig. 1). Catti et al. have studied the structural modiÔ¨Åcations induced in the rhombohedral phase when Ti4+ is progressively substituted by Fe3+ and Li+.19 For 0.6 < x < 1.1, a new orthorhombic phase, indexable to the Pbca space group, became prominent. Then, a transition to a second orthorhombic phase (space group Pbna) was detected for x $ 1.1. In fact, the XRD patterns of the Li1+xTi2 xFex(PO4)3/C series evidenced the progressive increase of the contribution of a second phase when

the iron content was increased. This new set of reÔ¨Çections was indexed to the orthorhombic phase of the Pbca space group. This result demonstrated that the rhombohedral to orthorhombic phase transition can be detected even for low iron contents. The contribution of the orthorhombic phase cannot be neglected for x $ 0.3 and will be reÔ¨Çected on the electrochemical properties as described below. Catti et al. reported the increase of the cell volume when the iron content was increased.19 This tendency is interpreted in terms of the larger ionic radius of Fe3+ than that of Ti4+. A similar tendency was observed in our samples mainly based on an increase of the parameter c, while parameter a values remained basically constant (Table 1).

0 and 0.2 are displayed in Fig. 2. Particles with undeÔ¨Åned shape and heterogeneous size of a few hundreds of nanometers are observed. Also, nanometric carbon particles are coating the phosphate compound.

31P MAS NMR spectra were recorded for the whole Li1+xTi2 xFex(PO4)3/C series (Fig. 3). The non-substituted sample is characterized by a large signal at  27.5 ppm ascribable to a diamagnetic phosphate.20 This peak can be correlated with a local environment of phosphorous isotropically surrounded by TiO6 octahedra. Additionally, the asymmetry of the proÔ¨Åle can be assigned to the occurrence of a small contribution to the spectrum at  28.9 ppm. This chemical shift is out of the range attributed to impurities of TiP2O7 (ref. 21) or Li4P2O7.22 Otherwise, a local disorder may arise from the occurrence of Li+ migration to M2 sites23 or the presence of small amounts of Ti3+ as observed in LiTi2(PO4)3 annealed in N2 atmosphere.24 The substitution by iron preserved the asymmetry of the proÔ¨Åle until x ¬º 0.2, then the presence of paramagnetic Fe3+ ions led to an slightly shifted from the initial value  27.5 ppm to  27.4 ppm

between the discharge and charge curves led to oxidation peaks only slightly shifted to high voltages. The early description of the electrochemical behavior of LiTi2(PO4)3 revealed a large polarization ascribable to the low electronic conductivity of the phosphates.8 The beneÔ¨Åt provided by the compositing effect of carbon material created in situ during the carbothermal reaction was also evidenced in that pioneering work. This fact has been widely electrode materials.25‚Äì27

would reveal marked changes in the local environment of phosphorous in agreement with the structural transformation to the orthorhombic phase.

Two-electrode lithium cells were cycled at C/10 to evaluate the characteristic proÔ¨Åles of is substituted by Fe (Fig. 4). The electrochemical reaction with lithium occurs mainly in two speciÔ¨Åc voltage regions located at 2.8 and 2.45 V during the discharge process. The low polarization

Lithium insertion into Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 has been extensively reported.13,28 In this compound, half of the M1 sites are occupied by Mn2+ ions, which lead to a voltage plateau close to 2.8 V, having an extension that matches well with the insertion of 0.5 Li+ per formula unit.13 Then, the excess Li+ occupies M2 sites and a voltage plateau is observed at ca. 2.5 V. In contrast, the LiTi2(PO4)3 stoichiometry clearly indicates that the M1 sites are fully occupied by lithium and the incoming ions should occupy M2 sites. It would justify the absence of the 2.8 V signal during the cell discharge of this compound.14 The occurrence of a small signal at this voltage for our LiTi2(PO4)3 sample would involve some lithium disorder between M1 and M2 sites which provides a small population of M1 vacant sites to be reversibly occupied by the incoming lithium ions.

View Article OnlineTo shed some light on the mechanism of the electrochemical lithium insertion, 57Fe M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra of partially discharged Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C electrodes were recorded in the transmission mode at room temperature (Fig. 6). The original compound is characterized by a doublet signal at an isomer  1 and a quadrupole splitting value of shift of 0.353 mm s  1. This isomer shift value conÔ¨Årmed the presence of 0.961 mm s Fe3+. However, the quadrupole splitting value is higher than that of related compounds.29,30 This fact would be indicative of a signiÔ¨Åcant anisotropy in the local environment of the probe atom arising from the presence of Ti and Fe in close vicinity besides the excess of 0.2 Li+ ions occupying M2 sites. The M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectrum recorded after the insertion of 0.5 Li+ per formula unit corresponds to the end of the plateau at 2.8 V. We can see a new  1 and a split doublet with an isomer shift value of 1.162 mm s  1. This signal is charquadrupole splitting value of 2.344 mm s acteristic of the presence of Fe2+ as a result of the electrochemical reduction. Therefore, most of the Fe3+ ions are reduced along this plateau. The remaining Fe3+ ions are further reduced along the low voltage plateau. Most probably, the occurrence of kinetic effects hindered a complete iron reduction in the 2.8 V region. The presence of minor contributions of Fe3+ at the end of the discharge could be assigned to minor impurities of electrochemically inactive Fe3+ compounds undetected by XRD.

The galvanostatic cycling of the studied samples was performed at several rates (Fig. 7). Capacity values as high as  1 were recorded for the LiTi2(PO4)3/C sample after 140 mA h g the Ô¨Årst discharge at C/10, though a continuous capacity fading  1 after 10 cycles. Iron substitution improved yielded 134 mA h g capacity retention even at high rates (C/2). Capacities around

variation.13 Similar features have also been observed in previous reports.21 On substitution by iron, the contribution of this signal progressively increases involving a migration of lithium to M2 sites and hence creating M1 vacant sites. This migration has also been reported when lithium is inserted to eventually achieve Li3Ti2(PO4)3.13 An alternative interpretation correlates this reduction signal to the Fe3+ to Fe2+ reduction. The lithium insertion reaction has been extensively studied in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 as an electrode material for lithium batteries.15,29‚Äì31 An orthorhombic phase is obtained by a solid state reaction while a rhombohedral phase can be prepared by lithium ion exchange in Na3Fe2(PO4)3.31 The electrochemical reduction of Fe3+ during the discharge process commonly leads to a voltage pseudoplateau at 2.6‚Äì2.8 V versus Li/Li+ which fairly agrees with the small plateau observed in our samples. The increased contribution of this plateau to the overall electrochemical reaction when the titanium is progressively substituted by iron allowed us to ascribe this feature to Fe3+ reduction.

The second signal can be observed at 2.0‚Äì2.6 V versus Li/Li+. According to previous reports, this feature can be correlated with Ti4+/Ti3+ redox reaction.23,24,27 The asymmetric proÔ¨Åle recorded at both charge and discharge branches suggests the occurrence of different energetic sites for titanium reaction. Delmas et al. have reported that the lithium ions inserted in the large M2 cavities occupy two different distorted tetrahedral sub-sites with an occupation factor 2/3 and 1/3, respectively.20 Thus, the slightly distinct energy of vacant sub-sites at which lithium is inserted would be responsible for the asymmetry in the charge and discharge curves at this voltage region. A signiÔ¨Åcant change of the voltage proÔ¨Åle is observed for x $ 0.3. The increased contribution of the orthorhombic phase and its inÔ¨Çuence on the distribution of vacant sites can be responsible for this behavior. In addition, the average cell potential of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Ti4+/Ti3 plateaus was recorded for the reduction process of all samples (Fig. 5). A linear increase was observed when Ti was substituted by Fe for both plateaus. This inductive effect has also been observed in olivine-type phosphates and explained in terms of the increase of the average metal‚Äìoxide bond length and hence the ionicity of each transition metal. This conclusion can also be applied to the studied series in which the iron substitution involves an overall volume expansion.32

improves the kinetic response of the electrode material at high rates.

A plausible explanation of the different performance could be related to the internal impedance at the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interphase, which is well known to play an important role in lithium migration towards the bulk electrode.33,34 To unveil the role of the interphase impedance, EIS were recorded for both LiTi2(PO4)3/C and Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C samples (Fig. 8). The Nyquist plots were characterized by two overlapped and depressed semicircles at high and medium frequencies respectively attributed to lithium migration through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and to the charge transfer (CT) at the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interphase. The straight slopping line recorded at low frequencies is commonly ascribed to a Warburg element describing the lithium diffusion into the bulk particles. The impedance spectra were Ô¨Åtted to an equivalent circuit including all these elements as described elsewhere.35 The results are summarized in Table 2. Large impedance values were recorded for LiTi2(PO4)3/C as compared to the iron containing sample irrespective of the analyzed cycle. This result can be correlated with the better performance of Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C at the higher kinetic rate.

Thus, the lithium migration through the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interphase is hindered in the LiTi2(PO4)3/C sample, preventing high capacity values at C/2. Also, a signiÔ¨Åcant rearrangement must occur at the LiTi2(PO4)3/C interphase upon cycling. The proÔ¨Åle of the impedance spectra was modiÔ¨Åed from the Ô¨Årst to the Ô¨Åfth discharge. RSEI abruptly increased while RCT decreased. An unstable interphase can be inferred from these results. In contrast, a slight increase of the resistance values was observed for Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C.

Five composites of the Li1+xTi2 xFex(PO4)3/C series with 0 # x # 0.4 were prepared by a sol‚Äìgel method using citric acid as a combined chelating agent and carbon source. The in situ generated carbon shell ensured a good electrical conductivity in the electrode material. The XRD pattern showed a rhombohedral phase. The substitution of titanium by iron had two major effects: the increase of the cell volume and the progressive appearance of a minor orthorhombic phase. 31P MAS NMR spectra showed a small variation of the chemical shift values to less negative values when the iron content was increased to x ¬º lengths. A further increase to x ¬º 0.4 involved a large variation of

The increase in the average cell potential of the reduction plateaus can be explained as a consequence of the cell volume expansion and increasing iconicity of the bond. The lithium insertion mechanism was conÔ¨Årmed by 57Fe M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra in which a predominant reduction of Fe3+ was detected at the end of the plateau at 2.8 V.  1 were recorded for Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C after 40 cycles. A slightly higher capacity was recorded for Li1.2Ti1.8Fe0.2(PO4)3/C than LiTi2(PO4)3/C at low rates. In contrast, an abrupt decrease in capacity was observed for the non-containing iron sample at the highest rate. This different behavior has been explained in terms of a lower kinetic response at the electrode‚Äìelectrolyte interphase of the latter sample.
