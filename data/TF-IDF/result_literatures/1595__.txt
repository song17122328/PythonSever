DTA was used to study thermal properties and thermal stability of (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 (x=0–10 mol%) and 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (y=5–20 mol%) glasses. The addition of TiO2 to lithium phosphate glasses results in a non-linear increase of glass transition temperature. All prepared glasses crystallize under heating within the temperature range of 400–540°C. The lowest tendency towards crystallization have the glasses with x=7.5 and y=10 mol% TiO2. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that major compounds formed by annealing of the glasses were LiPO3, L i4P2O7, T i P2O7 and NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3. DTA results also indicated that the maximum of nucleation rate for 45Li2O–5TiO2–50P2O5 glass is close to the glass transition temperature.

The additions of TiO2 into oxide glass-forming systems, usually contribute to the stabilization of their structure [1–3] and to the improvement of their properties [4, 5], e.g. chemical durability, mechanical properties, electrical conductivity, etc. From the glasses with a higher TiO2 content glass-ceramic materials can be prepared by controlled crystallization. In some cases these glassy-crystalline materials show better properties than their parent glasses [6]. For the preparation of glass-ceramic materials the knowledge of thermal behaviour of parent glasses and the mechanism of crystallization is very useful. Beside basic thermal parameters as glass transition temperature, dilatation softening temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, crystallization temperature etc. it is also useful to know nucleation rate under controlled heat treatment. The aim of this work is the investigation of thermal properties and crystallization processes in TiO2-doped lithium phosphate glasses. Glasses and glass-ceramics based on lithium titanium phosphate can find interesting applications, e.g. as solid electrolytes in high energy density batteries due to their high Li+ ionic mobility and their high stability. Ceramics conductors with the NASICON (Na Super Ionic CONductor) type structure [7] belong even to most promising oxide based Li+ conductor group studied in recent years [8, 9].

Lithium titanophosphate glasses with composition (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 (series A) and 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (B) were prepared in the batches of 20 g using analytical-grade Li2CO3, T i O2 (anatase) and H3PO4. Starting mixture was heated slowly up to 1320°C in a platinum crucible with a lid and after 15 min at the maximum temperature the obtained melt was cooled slowly in a graphite mould or quenched between two copper blocks (glasses with x=7.5; 10 mol% TiO2 for series A and with y=15; 20 mol% TiO2 for series B). The obtained glasses were annealed for 15 min at the temperature 5°C below their glass transition temperature, Tg. The presence of glassy state was checked by X-ray diffraction. Thermal behaviour of glasses was studied with the DTA 404 PC (Netzsch) operating in the DSC mode at the heating rate of 10°C min–1. Measurements were carried out with 50 mg powder samples with a mean diameter 8–10 ?m in corundum crucibles under inert atmosphere of N2. From DSC curves the values of the glass transition temperature, Tg, ( a s t h e midpoint of the change in heat capacity, cp, i n t h e glass transition region), the values of crystallization temperature, Tc, (the onset of the first crystallization peak) and the values of melting temperature, Tm, (onset of the first melting peak) were determined. For the evaluation of the mechanism of crystallization glasses were milled and screened to four fractions with the average particle sizes of 130, 300, 600 and 900 ?m. From DSC curves of these fractions obtained at the heating rate of 10°C min–1 the peak crystallization temperature Tp, its maximum height, (?T)p, and the width at the half-peak maximum, (?T)p, were determined. For the evaluation of the nucleation rate 50 mg of the glass with the average particle size of 300 ?m was first heated in DTA equipment from room temperature to a nucleation temperature, TN, between transition temperature, Tg, and crystallization temperature, Tc (onset of the first crystallization peak) and then nucleated at TN for 30 min. After subsequent cooling to 100°C the sample was heated again to the temperature above crystallization peaks at a rate of 10°C min–1. This process was applied for several nucleation temperatures TN. At the temperature corresponding to a maximum nucleation, determined in the previous step from the plot of crystallization peak height, (?T)p vs. TN, the glass was then heat-treated for 1–300 min. Crystalline samples were prepared using isothermal heating of powdered glasses in temperature range of 460–580°C (series A) and 550°C (series B) in a graphite mould for 2 h under inert atmosphere of N2. Crystalline phases were identified by X-ray powder diffraction analysis with Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer.

Two compositional series of lithium titanophosphate glasses (A) (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 with x=0; 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 mol% TiO2) a n d (B) 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (y=5, 10, 15 and 20 mol% TiO2) were synthesized and studied. The obtained compositional range corresponds to glass forming regions in Li2O–TiO2–P2O5 system described by Kishioka et al. [10]. Colour of the glasses slowly changed from clear (x= 0 ) t o b r o w n i s h (x=2.5; 5 and y=5; 10 mol% TiO2) and violet for x?5 a n d y?10 mol% with increasing TiO2 content in the both series of glasses. DSC curves obtained for the glass series (A) and (B) are shown in Figs 1 and 2. The values of glass transition temperature, Tg, crystallization temperature, Tc, melting temperature, Tm, and the values of the change in heat capacity, ?Cp, in the glass transition region determined form DSC curves are given in Table 1. As can be seen in this table, Tg values in the glass series (A) increase with increasing TiO2 content from 335°C for the 50Li2O–50P2O5 glass up to 383°C for the glass composition 40Li2O–10TiO2–50P2O5. Similar increasing was observed in the glasses of the compositional series 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (B), where Tg increases from 357°C (y=5) up to 460°C for the glass with y=20 mol% TiO2. An increase of Tg values can be ascribed to an increasing number of Ti–O–P bonds formed with increasing TiO2 content and therefore to the strengthening of glass network by TiOx structural units [1]. The value of ?Cp (Table 1) in compositional series (A) first decreases steeply from 15 J mol–1 K–1 (for 50Li2O–50P2O5 glass) to 7.7 J mol–1 K–1 for 47.5Li2O–2.5TiO2–50P2O5 glass, but with additional replacement of Li2O b y T i O2 the ?Cp values are practically constant. On the other hand, an increase in the TiO2 content for 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 glasses leads to a gradual increase of ?Cp values within the range of 7.1–14.5 J mol K–1. The observed ?Cp changes could indicate that the fragility of the (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 (A) glasses decreases with replacement of Li2O b y T i O2 while the replacement of P2O5 by TiO2 in the compositional series (B) leads to an increase of the fragility of the glasses [11]. The heat capacity changes were found independent of the heating rate. DSC curves (Figs 1 and 2) show also that all glasses crystallize on heating in the temperature range of 403–539°C, some of them in 2 crystallization steps. The first crystallization temperature, Tc, in the glasses of the 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (B) series increases with increasing TiO2 content up to x=10 mol% TiO2 and then remains nearly unchanged (Table 1), whereas in the metaphosphate glass series (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 (A) Tc reveals a maximum in the glass with x=7.5 mol% TiO2. XRD patterns of the crystallized samples are shown in Figs 3 and 4. In the parent glass of the series (A) with composition 50Li2–50P2O5 we found that the crystallization peak corresponds to the formation of lithium metaphosphate LiPO3. With increasing addition of TiO2, this compound is gradually replaced by titanium pyrophosphate TiP2O7. X-ray diffraction patterns of the series 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (B) (Fig. 4) show that by heating the starting glass composition 45Li2O–5TiO2–50P2O5 crystalline LiPO3 and TiP2O7 phases are formed. With increasing TiO2 content, these compounds are gradually replaced by lithium pyrophosphate Li4P2O7 and by NASICON-type lithium titanophosphate compound LiTi2(PO4)3 (Fig. 4).

For the evaluation of the thermal stability of glasses, ?T=Tc–Tg and Hruby criterion Kgl=(Tc–Tg)/(Tm–Tc) [12] were applied. Higher values of these criterions usually correspond to a higher thermal stability and glass-forming tendency. The obtained values of the ?T and Kgl for the studied glasses in compositional series (A) and (B) are given in Table 1. We can see that the values of both criterions for the glasses in metaphosphate compositional series (50–x)Li2O–xTiO2–50P2O5 (A) reveal a maximum at the glass containing 7.5 mol% TiO2. It means that this glass has the highest thermal stability and the lowest tendency towards crystallization. On the other hand the lowest thermal stability and therefore the highest tendency towards crystallization in compositional series (A) were found for the parent 50Li2O–50P2O5 metaphosphate glass. In the series 45Li2O–yTiO2–(55–y)P2O5 (B) the highest thermal stability was found for the glass containing 10 mol% TiO2 (Table 1). In order to control the shape and dimension of resulting crystalline phases and subsequently their properties, it is important to know the crystallization mechanism. The mechanism of crystallization (surface or volume) was evaluated from the changes in the shape and position of the crystallization peak on DSC curves in dependence on the particle size (130, 300, 600 and 900 ?m) of the studied glasses [13]. From the crystallization peaks on DSC curves the values of the peak temperature, Tp, its maximum height, (?T)p, and the width at the half-peak maximum, (?T)p, were determined. The ratio of the volume to the total effective surface area of all glass particles increases with an increasing particle size for a given amount of sample. Thus the parameters (?T)p and Tp 2/(?T)p should increase with an increasing particle size when the internal crystallization predominates, while for the dominant surface crystallization the reverse effect should be observed [13]. This analysis was carried out only for the samples with the composition of 50Li2O–50P2O5, 45Li2O–5TiO2–50P2O5 and 45Li2O–15TiO2–40P2O5. The estimated parameter of [(?T)p]R reduced to the sample with the lowest particle size of 130 ?m (the values of (?T)p were divided by the values obtained with the smallest particle size), are plotted as a function of particle size in Fig. 5. As can be seen from this figure, the values of [(?T)p]R parameter continuously decrease with increasing particle size only for the sample containing 15 mol% of TiO2, i.e. in this sample the surface nucleation is the prevailing process. For both other samples the values of [(?T)p]R parameter initially decrease with increasing particle size and then increase (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the glasses nucleate predominantly by surface crystallization mechanism when the particle size is ?600 ?m (for x= 5 m o l % T i O2) o r ?300 ?m (for x=0 mol% TiO2), respectively, but for the higher particle sizes internal crystallization becomes the dominant crystallization mechanism. Similar conclusions can be done also from the changes of [Tp 2/(?T)p]R reduced parameter as a function of particle size. From the changes in both [(?T)p]R and [Tp 2/(?T)p]R parameters with particle size of analyzed glasses is also evident that with increasing TiO2 content the contribution of the surface crystallization mechanism increases. This conclusion is in a good agreement with observed changes in Tg/Tm values as a function of TiO2 content (Table 1). According to [14] when Tg/Tm?0.6, only surface crystallization is observed in laboratory time scales, while internal crystallization is easily observed in glasses where Tg/Tm?0.6.

Besides the knowledge of crystallization mechanism in some cases it is also useful to know the nucleation rate. We studied the nucleation rate by the method described in paper [15] for the glass with composition of 45Li2O–5TiO2–50P2O5. The method consists in heating the glass at different constant temperatures for a fixed time in DSC equipment before being crystallized at a fixed heating rate. A plot of the maximum DSC peak height, ?Tp, a s a function of the nucleation temperature, produced a nucleation-rate-like curve that, determined the temperature range for nucleation and the temperature of the maximum nucleation rate [15]. DSC curves that were obtained after heat treatments of the glass sample at various nucleation temperatures, TN, (from 360 to 510°C) for 30 min are shown in Fig. 6. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that first crystallization peak is associated particularly with the formation of an unknown, probably lithium titanophosphate crystalline phase, which is at higher temperature t r a n s f o r m e d t o L i P O3 and TiP2O7 compounds (Fig. 7). As we can see in Fig. 8, with increasing nucleation temperature, TN, both first and then second crystallization peaks gradually disappear. Figure 8 shows that the peak height of the first crystallization peak, ?Tp1, gradually decreases with increasing nucleation temperature within the temperature region of TN from 360 to 420°C and for the nucleation temperature above 420°C the first crystallization peak practically disappears. This suggests that the highest amount of nuclei of unknown crystalline phase is formed at the temperature slightly above its Tg (357°C). With increasing nucleation temperature the nucleation rate decreases and above 420°C is too small to produce any additional nuclei. For the second crystallization peak associated with the formation of LiPO3 and TiP2O7, the nucleation rate (peak height ?Tp2) has a maximum at 450°C (Fig. 8) and for the sample nucleated at 510°C, the second glass transition temperature practically disappear. Figure 9 shows the changes of the maximum of crystallization peak temperature, Tp, with nucleation time for the 45Li2O–5TiO2–50P2O5 glass nucleated at 360°C (nearby above Tg). From this figure it is evident that the peak temperature, Tp, of both crystallization peaks (Tp1 and Tp2) steeply decreases with increasing nucleation time from 10 to 15 min and then it is nearly constant. This indicates that the glass is saturated with nuclei of all crystalline phases within a relatively short time (up to 15 min) at 360°C.

Study of lithium titanophosphate glasses revealed that both replacement of Li2O b y T i O2 or P2O5 by TiO2 lead to changes in thermal properties of these glasses. The incorporation of TiO2 into the structural network of the glasses is reflected by increasing values of the glass transition temperature, which shows on the strenghtening of chemical bonds in the structural network. The doping of lithium phosphate glasses by TiO2 resulted also in the changes of their thermal stability, crystallization temperature and the crystallization mechanism. Study of nucleation rate shows that it is possible to control nucleation and crystallization process of the studied glasses using DSC technique.
