Ceramic sheets of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with NASICON-related structure have been prepared by  tape-casting method. The addition of 60Na2O-10Nb2O5-30P2O5 glass to NVP is demonstrated to  enhance markedly the density of the sintered NVP sheet and its electrical conductivity. The best  densified NVP sheet with a thickness of a few tens of µm is obtained by sintering tape-casted NVP  added with 5 wt.% glass at 920 °C, which exhibits a total conductivity of 2.9 × 10−5  S cm−1 at room  temperature. A Pt | NVP sheet | Pt cell works as a tiny solid-state battery with a cell potential of 1.7  V, in which NVP acts as both cathode and anode active materials via redox reactions of V4+/V3+ and  V 3+/V2+ as well as a Na+  ion conducting electrolyte between the two electrode layers.

All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are recently attracting much attention due to their potential high  battery performances compatible with much safer operation compared with Li-ion batteries using  flammable organic liquid electrolyte.[1] ASSBs with the sulfide-based electrolyte are now  considered to be best promising owing to their superior ionic conductivity[2,3] So far, a single-step  mechanical pressing without heat treatment is often employed for the assembly of sulfide-based  ASSB.[4-6] However, this process might be not favorable for the precise control of the electrolyte  thickness, and further advanced processing such as a multiple-lamination. In addition, poor  chemical stability of sulfide-based electrolytes against humidity to generate harmful H2S is  problematic not only for a facile production process but also for the safety.

 The tape-casting of NVP slurry added with 5 wt.% NNP glass followed by sintering at 920 °C  provides the self-standing NVP sheets with high density (~82%) and negligible gas permeability.  Owing to improved sintering degree and thereby reduced grain boundary resistance by adding an  appropriate amount of the glass, the total conductivity of the sintered NVP sheet can be increased  up to 2.9 × 10−5  S cm−1  at RT. The CV of the Pt | NVP sheet | Pt symmetric cell exhibited a potential  of the NVP sheet as a single-phase solid-state battery with a cell potential of 1.7 V, by using the two  redox reactions of V3+/V2+ and V4+/V3+ as the cathode and anode, respectively.  The single-phase  NVP sheet cell acts as a small battery with the capacity of a few Ah kg−1 , although the columbic  efficiency is limited to be ~40−50% so far. The current process may be also effective for fabrication  of a laminate consisting of a solid electrolyte and NVP as an electrode active material.
