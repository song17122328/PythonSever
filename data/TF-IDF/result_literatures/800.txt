We successfully prepared NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) and a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 / carbon nanotubes (CNT) composite by spray-drying followed by heat treatment in argon for 2 hours at 600Â°C.
The addition of CNT in the spray-drying solution creates a CNT network within the NVPF particles.
After grinding, the smaller NVPF particles remain linked by CNT.
Thanks to this conducting network, the composite powder displays competitive electrochemical performance when cycled against lithium in hybrid-ion batteries (2-4.6 V vs.
Li+/Li) with specific capacities of 125 mAh.g-1 at C/10, 103 mAh.g-1 at 1C and 91 mAh.g-1 at 4C, together with 97.5% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 99.4%.
These results demonstrate that sodium vanadium (III) fluorophosphate electrode material can be obtained in a time-efficient way using the easily up-scalable spray-drying method.
Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 /CNT were obtained by spray-drying followed by a 2- hour heat treatment in argon.
The addition of carbon nanotubes (CNT) in the spray-drying solution created a composite where CNT were dispersed within the irregularly shaped NVPF particles.
After grinding, the smaller NVPF particles remained linked by CNT.
Thanks to this conducting network, NVPF/CNT displayed good electrochemical performance at increasing cycling rates in hybrid-ion batteries (2-4.6 V vs.Li+/Li).
Specific capacities of 125 mAh.g-1 at C/10 and 103 mAh.g-1 at 1C with an average working voltage of 4 V were obtained for NVPF/CNT, which demonstrated 97.5% capacity retention at 1C over 100 cycles with coulombic efficiency of 99.4%.
These results show that the easily up scalable spray-drying method can be used to prepare competitive NVPF/CNT through a time-efficient route.
Further improvement might be possible if using a spray-dryer designed to produce smallersized particles, in order to minimize polarization during electrochemical cycling.
