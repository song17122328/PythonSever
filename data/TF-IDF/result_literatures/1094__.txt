The structural and electrical properties of α-LiZr2(PO4)3 are studied at room temperature for the 

first  time.  A  room-temperature  stable  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  phase  (ܴ3ܿ,  a  =  8.85196(4)  Å  and  c  = 

22.1510(1)  Å)  is  prepared  by  a  modified  sol-gel  approach.  The  material  exhibits  a  room-

temperature (25 °C) total conductivity of 1.63 × 10-6 Scm-1 at a density of 76 % of the theoretical 

density.  A  room-temperature  bulk  conductivity  as  high  as  1.58  ×  10-4  Scm-1  can  be  estimated 

from  the  impedance  measurements.  Conductivity  measurements  suggest  that  a  nominal  α→  α’ 

phase transition occurs below room-temperature (at about 16 ̶ 18 °C). The activation energies for 

the conductivity of the  α  and  α’  phases are 0.39 and 0.99 eV, respectively  (in the temperature 

range  ̶ 20  ̶  100 °C).  

Lithium ion conducting NASICONs are widely investigated as potential solid electrolytes for 

lithium  battery  applications.  NASICON-structured  LixB2(PO4)3  phases  exhibit  a  framework 

structure consisting of corner-shared PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 octahedra, which can accommodate 

lithium ions in two types of interstitial sites, commonly referred to as M1 and M2; the M1 sites 

are  situated  between  pairs  of  BO6  octahedra  along  the  c-axis,  while  the  M2  sites  are  located 

between infinite ribbons of [O3BO3M1O3BO3⬚O3BO3M1]∞ (Figure 1). LiB2(PO4)3 NASICONs 

ideally  crystalize in the  rhombohedral  ܴ3തܿ space  group where lithium selectively  occupies the 

M1  sites.  Among  the  different  Li+  conducting  NASICONs,  titanium-based  ones  exhibit  the 

highest lithium ion conductivity at room temperature (up to 3 × 10−3 Scm-1 for LiAl0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3) 

[1,2]. These solid electrolytes are, however, difficult to sinter and their grain boundary resistance 

is generally very high. A second disadvantage is the presence of Ti4+ which is easily reduced to 

Ti3+  in  contact  with  low-potential  anodes  (Li  metal  or  C6Li)  and  also  limits  the  use  of  the 

material as a solid separator in contact with aqueous electrolytes.  LiZr2(PO4)3, alternatively, is 

expected  to  be  electrochemically  more  stable  than  the  titanium  analog  since  Zr4+  is  a  stable 

oxidation state in materials with related structure. However, LiZr2(PO4)3 exhibits very low ionic 

conductivity  at  room-temperature  (∼  10-8  Scm-1)  [3,4].  The  material  also  exhibits  a  complex 

polymorphism [5-10]. LiZr2(PO4)3 phases prepared at relatively low calcination temperature (~ 

900 °C), commonly denoted as β-type phases, are reported to be orthorhombic (β phase) above 

300  °C  and  monoclinic  (β’  phase:  β-Fe2(SO4)3-type  structure)  below  this  temperature  [7-9]. 

LiZr2(PO4)3  prepared  at  higher  calcination  temperatures  (~  1200  °C),  on  the  other  hand,  is 

rhombohedral  (α-LiZr2(PO4)3)  above  a  transition  temperature  varying  in  the  range  30-60  °C; 

below  this  temperature,  including  room  temperature,  LiZr2(PO4)3  is  monoclinic/triclinic  (α’-

LiZr2(PO4)3) [5-7,10-14]. The ionic conductivity of α’-LiZr2(PO4)3 is ~ 5 × 10-8 Scm-1 at 30 °C, 

while  the  conductivity  of  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  at  the  same  temperature  is  ~  10-5  Scm-1  as  estimated 

from extrapolating high-temperature measurements [3,4]. Efforts have therefore been directed to 

stabilize  (rhombohedral)  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  at  room  temperature  via  several  approaches  such  as 

varying synthesis conditions  (e.g. quenching [15]) and aliovalent doping [16-18]. Mixed phases 

such  as  lithium  zirconium/titanium  phosphate  and  lithium  zirconium  phosphate/arsenate  have 

also  been  prepared  [19,20].  In  this  report  a  room-temperature  stable  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  phase  is 

successfully  prepared  using  a  modified  sol-gel  approach,  which  has  enabled  structural  and 

electrical characterization of the material at room temperature for the first time. 


A  modified  sol-gel  procedure  was  employed  to  synthesize  LiZr2(PO4)3.  Lithium  acetate 

(99.95%), zirconium oxynitrate hydrate (99%) and lithium dihydrogen phosphate (≥98.0%) were 

purchased  from  Aldrich  and  used  as  starting  materials.  The  degree  of  hydration  in  zirconium 

oxynitrate  was  determined  experimentally  by  thermogravimetric  analysis.  Stoichiometric 

amounts  of  lithium  acetate  and  zirconium  oxynitrate  hydrate  were  first  dissolved  in  hot  dilute 

nitric acid solution (2-3 wt. %) and then mixed slowly with EDTA (dissolved in NH3 solution) 

and solid citric acid; mole ratio of total metal ions to EDTA and to citrate = 1:1:2. Dilute NH3 

solution was used to adjust the pH value of the solution to a value > 7. After addition of drops of 

H2O2  solution  (Aldrich,  30  wt.  %;  H2O2/zirconium-ions  mole  ratio  is  greater  than  1),  a 

stoichiometric amount of lithium dihydrogen phosphate was then added slowly with continuous 

stirring. The resulting clear solution was heated at ~ 110 °C to produce a transparent gel, which 

was  subsequently  heated  at  250  °C  to  form  a  black  solid  precursor.  The  solid  precursor  was 

ground  and  calcined  in  air  at  550  °C  for  24h  to  remove  organic  components.  The  obtained 

powder was then isostatically pressed into pellets at 150 MPa and calcined in air at 1200 °C for 

6h.  An  alumina  disc  covered  with  a  thick  platinum  sheet  was  used  as  a  sample  holder  for  the 

calcination step. The sintered pellets were then either crushed to be examined by X-ray powder 

diffraction  (XRD)  or  directly  used  for  conductivity  measurements.  We  found  that  syntheses 

starting  with  ~  5  wt.  %  deficiency  of  the  phosphate  source  (lithium  dihydrogen  phosphate) 

produce α-LiZr2(PO4)3 phases of high purity. 

X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected with an X’Pert Pro PANalytical (reflection mode) 

and  a  Bruker  D8  (transmission  mode)  diffractometers,  using  CuKα  radiations.  Rietveld 

refinement  based  on  XRD  data  were  performed  using  the  GSAS  suite  of  programs  [21]. 

Scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  studies  were  performed  using  a  MERLIN  machine  from 

Zeiss.  AC  impedance  measurements  were  recorded  using  Alpha-A  high  performance  modular 

measurement  System  (from  Novocontrol  technologies)  in  the  frequency  range  of  10  MHz  to 1 

Hz and using an electrical perturbation of 20 mV. The data obtained were then analyzed by the 

software package WinDETA. Pellets with a thickness of 5–9 mm and a diameter of 10–13 mm 

were  used  in  the  conductivity  measurements.  Au  electrodes  were  gas  phase  deposited  on  the 

circular  sides  of  the  pellets  by  thermal  evaporation  and  copper  discs  were  used  to  collect  the 

current.  Variable  temperature  conductivity  measurements  were  carried  out  using  a  Novocool 

cryosystem (from Novocontrol technologies) in the temperature range   ̶ 20   ̶  100  °C. Prior to 

each impedance measurement, the samples were equilibrated for 1 h at constant temperature. The 

differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was performed using a Seiko DSC 220 at 

a heating rate of 5 °C/min 


XRD analysis of the as-prepared LiZr2(PO4)3 showed that the material is single-phase with no 

evidence  of  impurity  or  unreacted  phases  (Figure  2a).  The  XRD  pattern  of  the  material  was 

readily  indexed  on  a  rhombohedral  unit  cell  (ܴ3തܿ  space  group),  consistent  with  a  NASICON-

type  structure.  The  XRD  pattern  is  characterized  by  the  absence  of  the  peak  splitting  which  is 

commonly  observed  in  previous  studies  and  suggests  a  distortion  of  the  NASICON-type 

structure  [8,15,22].  No  significant  change  is  observed  in  the  XRD  pattern  after  storing  the 

material for about one year (Figure 2b; the inset), indicating that no relaxation of the framework 

from rhombohedral to monoclinic/triclinic has occurred. Rietveld refinement based on XRD data 

of  LiZr2(PO4)3  was  performed  using  the  GSAS  suite  of  programs.  The  crystal  structure  was 

refined by starting from the ideal NASICON atomic coordinates with Zr, P and O atoms in the 

(12c), (18e) and (36f) Wyckoff positions, respectively, of the ܴ3തܿ space group. Li was assumed 

to occupy the M1 site [i.e. the (6b) position]. This refinement led to a good agreement between 

the experimental and calculated patterns (Figure 2b) and to low reliability factors (wRp = 0.0422, 

Rp  =  0.0314,  χ2  =  2.103.).  However,  due  to  the  low  sensibility  of  the  refinement  to  the 

occupancy of the Li ion sites, the suggested Li ion positions remain an assumption. The refined 

unit cell parameters are a = 8.85196(4) Å and c = 22.1510(1) Å. Interestingly, theses parameters 

are  very  close  to  those  reported  for  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  that  is  prepared  by  solid  state  reactions  (at 

1200  °C)  and  stabilized  at  150  °C  (a  =  8.85493(3)  Å  and  c  =  22.1440(1)  Å  [13]).    In  earlier 

reports  [5,6],  LiZr2(PO4)3  is  synthesized  by  the  hydrolysis  of  an  alcoholic  solution  containing 

zirconium  alkoxide  by  using  an  aqueous  solution  containing  lithium  and  phosphate  ions;  this 

procedure  produces  a  monoclinc/triclinic  LiZr2(PO4)3  phase  that  converts  to  rhombohedral 

LiZr2(PO4)3 (with  a ≈ 8.85 Å and c ≈ 22.24 Å) above a transition temperature varying in the 

range 30-60 °C. Alamo et al. prepared LiZr2(PO4)3 by dissolving reactants in acidic medium and 

claimed that the resulting phase is rhombohedral (with slight distortion) at room temperature, but 

they  reported  significantly  different  lattice  parameters  (a  ≈  8.79  Å  and  c  ≈  22.78  Å)  [15,22]. 

Hence,  the  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  phase  prepared  in  this  study  has  similar  lattice  parameters  to  that 

stabilized at temperatures above room-temperature, indicating that the transition temperature of  

LiZr2(PO4)3 has probably been lowered to a value below room temperature.  

Similar to LiTi2(PO4)3 and other NASICON-type phases, the as-prepared α-LiZr2(PO4)3 phase 

showed low sinterability. The as-prepared pellets showed relatively low densities of about 74-77 

% of the theoretical densities. Figure 3 shows the surface microstructure  of the  as-prepared  α-

LiZr2(PO4)3  pellet.  The  grains  are  in  good  contact  with  each  other  although  a  large  amount  of 

pores can be observed. 

The  ionic  conductivity  of  the  as-prepared  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  was  examined  by  AC  impedance 

spectroscopy using gas-deposited gold electrodes. The impedance of the material shows a strong 

dependence on temperature. The impedance spectra can be described in terms of two semicircles 

(at high and intermediate frequencies) and a low frequency tail; and, over the studied frequency 

range, a shift of the observation window from left to right, i.e. towards lower frequencies, occurs 

as  the  temperature  increases.  Figures  4  and  S1  (supporting  information)  show  the  Nyquist 

impedance plots for the material (two different pellets) in a temperature range from  ̶ 20 to  ̶ 100  

°C.  The  high  frequency  semicircle  disappears  from  the  spectra  at  temperatures  >  30  °C. 

However, this semicircle progressively appears, and the low frequency spike diminishes, as the 

temperature  is  decreased  (Figure  5).  The  impedance  data  were  well  fitted  using  R(RQ)(Q), 

Re(RQ)(RQ)(Q)  or  Re(RQ)(RQ)  equivalent  circuits  depending  on  the  temperature;  (RQ)  [a 

parallel  resistance/constant-phase-element]  and  (Q)  [a  constant  phase  element]  correspond  to  a 

semicircle  and  the  long  tail  in  the  z  plane,  respectively,  while  Re  is  added  to  account  for  the 

electronic resistance of the measurement system. The impedance at 25 °C, for example, is fitted 

using the Re(RQ)(RQ)(Q) equivalent circuit (Figure 4d). Although the high frequency semicircle 

is not fully defined in this plot (Figure 5), the data were well fitted using Re(RQ)(RQ)(Q) rather 

than  the  R(RQ)(Q)  equivalent  circuit.  We  generally  attribute  the  first  semicircle  (high 

frequency),  the  second  semicircle  (intermediate  frequency)  and  the  low  frequency  tail  to  the 

impedance  representing  bulk,  grain-boundary  and  electrode  contributions,  respectively.  This  is 

consistent with the results reported  elsewhere where, within a fixed frequency range, the  grain 

and  grain  boundary  contributions  to  the  impedance  become  more  distinguishable,  and  the 

electrode contributions diminish, as the temperature decreases. This impedance behavior is also 

consistent  with  the  behavior  observed  for  isostructural  LiTi2(PO4)3  [23].  For  LiTi2(PO4)3  (and 

using lithium borate as a sintering aid), the semicircles corresponding to bulk and grain-boundary 

effects were observed at -50 °C while both disappeared at 90 °C. Since Au blocking electrodes 

are  used  in  our  experiments,  the  appearance  of  the  low  frequency  tail  (at  appropriate 

temperatures)  generally  suggests  that  the  observed  transport  effect  is  mainly  ionic  and 

corresponds  to  lithium  ion  mobility  [24,25].  The  bulk  conductivities  of  the  material  could  be 

therefore estimated from the fitting data of the high frequency semicircle, or the intercept of the 

intermediate  frequency  semicircle  (at  the  high  frequency  side)  with  the  real  Z  axis  (for  data 

collected at temperatures > 25 °C and fitted using R(RQ)(Q) equivalent circuit).  

The measured total and bulk conductivities of as-prepared α-LiZr2(PO4)3 at room temperature 

(25 °C) are 1.63 × 10-6 and 1.58 × 10-4 Scm-1, respectively. Another two different pellets showed 

total conductivities of 1.50 × 10-6 and 1.34 × 10-6 Scm-1. These values are close to those reported 

for LiTi2(PO4)3 (total conductivity 2.0 × 10-6 Scm-1) which is isostructural to α-LiZr2(PO4)3 and 

shows a similar morphology (lack of sinterability; ~ 34% porosity [2,26]). However, due to the 

absence of electrochemically active Ti4+, a LiZr2(PO4)3-based membrane probably shows better 

characteristics  as  a  solid  electrolyte  in  all-solid-state  batteries  or  as  a  solid  separator  between 

different liquid electrolytes contacting the  anode and cathode. Goodenough et al. [16] reported 

total and bulk conductivities of Ca-doped LiZr2(PO4)3 as 4.9 × 10-5 Scm-1 and 1.2 × 10-4 Scm-1, 

respectively.  The  bulk  conductivity  of  Li1.2Zr1.9Ca0.1(PO4)3  is  similar  to  that  observed  for  α-

LiZr2(PO4)3  in  this  study,  however,  the  improved  total  conductivity  is  probably  related  to  an 

improved sinterability due to Ca-doping. Hence, our study provides structural and conductivity 

data  for  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  at  room  temperature  that  can  be  compared  to  the  available  data  for 

isostructural phases such as LiTi2(PO4)3, and also provide a base line for the ongoing attempts to 

stabilize  and  improve  the  sinterability  of  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  by  different  approaches  such  as 

The  activation  energy  Ea  for  the  Li-ion  conduction  of  the  material  is  obtained  from  the 

Arrhenius  plot  of  ߪ = ߪ଴ exp(−ܧ௔/݇ܶ),  where  ߪ଴  is  the  pre-exponential  factor,  k  is  the 

Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature. The Arrhenius plots using the total and bulk 

ionic  conductivities  of  α-LiZr2(PO4)3  are  shown  in  Figure  6a  and  the  corresponding  inset, 

respectively. The plots clearly show an inflection point at 16 ̶ 18 °C indicating a change in the Li 

ion  mobility  in  the  material.  This  is  attributed  to  a  phase  transition  from  rhombohedral  to 

monoclinic/triclinic  LiZr2(PO4)3.  The  observed  activation  energies  for  the  total  conductivity 

before and after the transition are 0.39 and 0.99 eV respectively. Boilot et al. reported a similar 

slope  discontinuity  in  the  conductivity  data  of  LiZr2(PO4)3  at  ~  40  °C  with  activation  energies 

0.42  and  0.65  eV  before  and  after  the  transition,  respectively;  however,  different  temperature 

ranges  were  used  in  their  study  [8].  The  observed  activation  energy  in  our  study,  in  the 

temperature  range  ~  20   100  °C,  is  slightly  lower  than  that  observed  by  Boilot  et  al.  for 

LiZr2(PO4)3  [8]  and  by  Goodenough  et  al.  for  Li1.2Zr1.9Ca0.1(PO4)3  [16,17].    The  variable-

temperature  conductivity  data  of  LiZr2(PO4)3  are  consistent  with  the  DSC  data  recorded  from 

material  in  the  temperature  range  -10   50  °C  (Figure  6b).  An  endothermic  peak  at  ~  15  °C  is 

observed in the  DSC curve of the material indicating that the as-prepared  LiZr2(PO4)3 exhibits 

α→ α’ transition below room temperature. Previous reports suggest that the α→ α’ transition in 

LiZr2(PO4)3  occurs  at  temperatures  varying  in  the  range  30-60  °C  depending  on  the  synthetic 

method. The synthesis method employed in this study, however, suggests that this limit can be 

stretched so that the transition temperature lies below room temperature which enables structural 

and  electrical  characterization  of  the  material  at  room  temperature.  Several  structural 

modifications related to the synthesis method may  have occurred and probably account for the 

room temperature stability of rhombohedral LiZr2(PO4)3, e.g. a deficiency of phosphate groups, 

incorporation  of  traces  of  carbonate  groups  or  a  disturbance  of  the  Li  ion  distribution  in  the 

NASICON  structure.  We  have  recently  observed  a  synthesis-related  disturbance  of  Li  ion 

distribution in LiTi2(PO4)3 that led to modified structural and electrochemical properties of the 

NASICON-type material [27]. 


A  modified  sol-gel  procedure  that  uses  EDTA/citrate  as  complexing  agent  and  employs  a 

slight deficiency of the phosphate is successfully used to produce a room-temperature stable α-

LiZr2(PO4)3 phase. The as-prepared material undergoes no phase change upon storing for more 

than  one  year.  The  refined  unit  cell  parameters  are  similar  to  those  reported  for  α-LiZr2(PO4)3 

prepared  by  solid  state  reactions  and  stabilized  at  150  °C.  The  measured  total  and  bulk 


conductivities of as prepared α-LiZr2(PO4)3 at room temperature (25 °C) are ~ 1.5 × 10-6 and 1.5 

× 10-4 Scm-1, respectively. The estimated bulk conductivity is comparable to those reported for 

LiTi2(PO4)3  and  Li1.2Zr1.9Ca0.1(PO4)3.
