Na3V2(PO4)3 has attracted great attention due to its high energy density and stable structure. However, in order to boost its application, the discharge potential of 3.3–3.4 V (vs Na+/Na) still needs to be improved and substitution of vanadium with other lower cost and earth-abundant active redox elements is imperative. Therefore, the Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3 seems to be more attractive due to its lower toxicity and higher voltage platform resulting from the partial substitution of V with Mn. However, Na4MnV(PO4)3 still suffers from poor electronic conductivity, leading to unsatisfactory capacity delivering and poor high-rate capability. In this work, a graphene aerogel–supported in situ carbon–coated Na4MnV(PO4)3 material is synthesized through a feasible solution-route method. The elaborately designed Na4MnV(PO4)3 can reach ≈380 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 C (1 C = 110 mAh g−1) and realize superior high-rate capability evenat 50 C (60.1 mAh g−1) with a long cycle-life of 4000 cycles at 20 C. This impressive progress should be ascribed to the multifunctional 3D carbon framework and the distinctive structure of trigonal Na4MnV(PO4)3, which are deeply investigated by both experiments and calculations.

Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have attracted considerable interest as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its abundant resource and low cost.1, 2 However, low energy/power density, short cycling lifespan, and safety issues on the cathode materials are still of great challenges for the development of NIBs.3, 4 To address these problems, tremendous effort has been made to explore suitable cathode materials, which are expected to have high capacity, high potential, stable lattice framework, and fast sodium-ion diffusivity. By far, various cathode materials including layered transition-metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), and polyanion-type compounds have been proposed. Although the layered transition-metal oxide materials normally exhibit high theoretical capacity, they suffer from structural instability and unsatisfactory cycle-life.5-7 On the other hand, the applications of PBAs are limited by their low volume density, inferior thermal stability, and toxicity of cyanide.8-10 In this context, great attention has been paid on the polyanion-type materials due to their robust crystal framework with high-level thermal stability, and the moderate capacity with tunable high redox potential, which can achieve high energy density.11-13

Recently, the Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structured polyanion-type materials are of significant interest because of their unique crystal framework that is constructed by units of MO6 octahedrons (M represents transition metals) and XO4 tetrahedrons (X = P, S, Si, As), building 3D ion channels for fast Na+ migration.14-18 Among diverse NASICON-structured compounds, Na3V2(PO4)3 is a hotspot, which can deliver a highly reversible capacity over 110 mAh g−1, and an energy density of over 370 Wh kg−1 as a result of a flat voltage plateau located at 3.3–3.4 V.19 Although massive work has been reported to promote the development of Na3V2(PO4)3 by nanosizing and/or optimizing its poor electronic conductivity,20-23 in order to meet the demand of practical applications of Na3V2(PO4)3, improving its operating voltage to reach a higher energy density is urgent. In this regard, researchers have focused on ion-doping strategy to partially substitute V with other elements. Lavela and co-workers used Cr to replace 10% of V and the as-synthesized Na3V1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 showed a short plateau above 3.8 V.24 This high-potential plateau can be prolonged by increasing the amount of Cr to 50%, forming a new material Na3VCr(PO4)3, which has been reported by Yang and co-workers.25 In addition, introducing F into Na3V2(PO4)3 has been proven effective and the resulting Na3V2(PO4)2F3 could exhibit an average potential at 3.7–3.8 V,26-29 apparently surpassing Na3V2(PO4)3. However, both Cr and F are too expensive and environmentally hazardous to scale-up production. Recently, Goodenough's group substituted half of V in Na3V2(PO4)3 with other transition metals, fabricating a series of NASICON-structured NaxMV(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Mn, Ni) compounds. From the point of view of energy density and manufactural cost, Na4MnV(PO4)3 is of great advantage due to its satisfactory theoretical capacity of 111 mAh g−1 (two reversible Na-ions intercalate/extract in per unit formula of Na4MnV(PO4)3), with a high redox potential of 3.6 V based on Mn3+/Mn2+ couple, and the low cost of manganese.30 Compared with Na3V2(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3 also possesses higher voltage, lower cost, and lower toxicity, demonstrating promising prospects for applications. Unfortunately, Na4MnV(PO4)3 also suffers from poor electronic conductivity, resulting in difficult realization of the theoretical capacity. Besides, researches on the high-rate performance, ultralong cycling stability, kinetics, and reaction mechanism of Na4MnV(PO4)3 are still rare as yet, which is of great urgency to understand.

Herein, to optimize charge carriers' mobility in Na4MnV(PO4)3, the NASICON-structured material and a highly conductive network are rationally integrated through a feasible solution-route method, fabricating a novel Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanograin with in situ carbon coating that is supported by porous 3D graphene aerogel (GA) material (denoted as NMVP@C@GA). The architecture has the following prominent advantages: (i) the nanoparticles shorten the sodium-ion diffusion length; (ii) the conducting network greatly improves the electronic conductivity of the material; (iii) the robust GA is able to buffer volume changes during Na+ insertion/extraction, offering better cycling stability; (iv) the porous structure with large ion-accessible sites greatly increases the contact area of electrolyte/electrode, leading to a full utilization of the active materials. As a result, the as-prepared Na4MnV(PO4)3 presents extraordinary reversible capacity delivering (98.9% of its theoretical capacity) with a high energy density of ≈380 Wh kg−1, and ultralong cycling stability under high rate at 20 C (68.8% capacity retention after 4000 cycles). Despite the advanced architecture, the reversible two-phase reaction mechanism with high apparent Na+ diffusion coefficients that is revealed by ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), and the 3D sodium-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers that are disclosed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are fundamental for the superior sodium storage performance in Na4MnV(PO4)3.

Figure 1 schematically illustrates the process to realize the architectural design for Na4MnV(PO4)3. First, a hydrothermal treatment is employed to construct the graphene hydrogel, which is composed of graphene oxide (GO) sheets interlinked by chemical bonds, forming a 3D framework.31, 32 The graphene hydrogel is then freeze-dried to obtain the porous GA. To introduce Na4MnV(PO4)3 particles into the GA framework, the GA fine powders are added into the mixed solution to form gel precursors through a sol–gel method. The mixed solution is made from stoichiometric amount of Mn(CH3COO)2, CH3COONa, NH4H2PO4, V2O5, and C6H8O7, which is used as both reductant to reduce V5+ to V3+ and chelating agent. The mixed solution can easily penetrate into GA, and then transform into gel precursors as the moisture gets evaporated. After the post-heat treatment at 750 °C for 9 h, the Na4MnV(PO4)3 crystal grains forms in GA and the C6H8O7 pyrolyze into amorphous carbon that in-situ coating on the surface of Na4MnV(PO4)3. Eventually, the NASICON-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanograins are well integrated with the highly conductive carbon network, which is supposed to greatly facilitate fast sodium storage performance.

Morphology of the samples were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2a shows that GO sheets are smooth and isolated from each other. While the GA is consists of interconnected GO sheets, assembling a 3D framework with abundant pore structure, which is beneficial for the penetration of mixed solution to form gel precursors in it. Note that, NMVP@C@GA maintains the 3D skeleton well even after high-temperature calcination, and most of the Na4MnV(PO4)3 particles are less than 200 nm in diameter, uniformly dispersing in the GA framework (Figure 2c). The even distribution and the small size of Na4MnV(PO4)3 particles can be attributed to the effect of carbon materials, which confine the growth of crystal grains and prevent them from aggregation.20 An individual Na4MnV(PO4)3 particle anchored on GA framework in Figure 2e was partially enlarged to obtain detailed information on the interfacial structure between Na4MnV(PO4)3 and carbon materials. Clearly, the Na4MnV(PO4)3 particle is well coated by a uniform amorphous carbon layer with a thickness of 2 nm, and then embedded in the graphene matrix (Figure 2f). The interfringe spacing of Na4MnV(PO4)3 is about 0.38 nm, corresponding to the (2 −1 3) interplane of trigonal Na4MnV(PO4)3. The elemental mappings and the energy dispersive spectrum displayed in Figure S2 (Supporting Information) exhibited a homogenous distribution of Na, Mn, V, P, and O in the NMVP@C@GA material. The morphology of the carbon-coated Na4MnV(PO4)3 (denoted as NMVP@C) and pure Na4MnV(PO4)3 (denoted as NMVP) can be seen from Figure S3 (Supporting Information).

Raman spectroscopy was carried out to investigate the surface features of the samples. As displayed in Figure 2g, both NMVP@C@GA and NMVP@C demonstrated characteristic signatures located at around 1350 and 1590 cm−1, corresponding to the D-band (disorder-induced phonon mode) and the G-band (graphite band), respectively. Typically, the intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) are used to indicate the disordered and graphitized carbon materials.33 As the value of ID/IG gets smaller, the degree of graphitization of the composite gets higher (higher electronic conductivity). The ID/IG of NMVP@C@GA and NMVP@C are calculated to be 0.89 and 1.08, respectively, indicating better electronic conductivity of the NMVP@C@GA material, which can be attributed to the highly graphitized GA skeleton. There are no signals of [PO4]3− detected in Raman scattering patterns of both samples, which further proves that the Na4MnV(PO4)3 particles are well covered by carbon materials.34 The rational carbon content of 8.63 wt% in NMVP@C@GA and 4.27 wt% in NMVP@C are determined by the thermogravimetric (TG) tests (Figure 2h). Nitrogen isothermal adsorption–desorption analyses were carried out to reveal the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the samples. The BET specific area of NMVP@C@GA is measured as 54.3 m2 g−1 (Figure 2i), far larger than that of NMVP@C (26.8 m2 g−1) and NMVP (2.3 m2 g−1) (Figure S3f, Supporting Information). The Barret–Joyner–Halenda pore–size distribution curve (Figure 2f, inset) indicates a mesoporous structure of the NMVP@C@GA material, where the abundant pores are supposed to greatly enhance high surface wettability and lead to a full utilization of the active material.

Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern (Figure 3a) determined a pure single phase of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in the NMVP@C@GA material (the atomic position information is listed in Table S1, Supporting Information). All the diffraction peaks indicate that Na4MnV(PO4)3 adopts a trigonal structure with the space group of R-3c.30 The crystal structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3 is composed of Mn/VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The Mn/VO6 octahedra is corner-shared with PO4 tetrahedra to form [MnV(PO4)3] “lantern” units, and further establish a 3D framework with facile ion diffusion paths. There are two independent sodium ions Na1 and Na2, with six and tenfold coordination, respectively, located in the voids/channels of the framework. 3D ion diffusion channels are illustrated in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Sodium ions can easily transport along the [2 1 0], [−1 1 1], and [5 −2 1] crystallographic directions due to the large interstitial space in these directions, which is the premise of fast sodium storage capability.30, 35 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the NMVP@C@GA material. The wide-range spectrum (Figure 3b) presents the existence of Na, Mn, V, P, O, and C, and the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP) further verifies the rational atomic ratio of Na:P:V:Mn = 3.96:2.93:1.07:1, indicating the high purity of the sample. The valence states of Mn and V are confirmed by XPS narrow spectrum (Figure 3c,d). The Mn 2p high-resolution XPS spectra split into two peaks due to spin–orbit coupling (Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2). The binding energy of Mn 2p1/2 (653.0 eV) and Mn 2p3/2 (641.1 eV) indicates that the valence state of Mn is bivalence.36 The V 2p core-level spectra consist of V 2p1/2 (522.9 eV) and V 2p3/2 (516.7 eV), determining trivalence of V in this product.37 The broad peaks centered at ≈645 and 520 eV correspond to the shakeup satellites, which are present for a paramagnetic metal state.38 Structure information of the NMVP@C and NMVP samples was also studied using XRD (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The diffraction peaks of the NMVP@C and NMVP materials are in good accordance with the trigonal-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3, and there are no impurity reflections detected, indicating the high purity of these materials.

Sodium storage performances of the as-synthesized NMVP@C@GA, NMVP@C, and NMVP were investigated by assembling coin cells. Figure 4a displays the charge–discharge curves of the NMVP@C@GA, NMVP@C, and NMVP electrodes within potential window of 2.5–3.8 V (vs Na+/Na) at a C-rate of 0.5 C (1 C = 110 mA g−1). There are two pairs of obvious voltage plateaus located at around 3.4 and 3.6 V (vs Na/Na+), corresponding to the redox of V4+/V3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ couples, respectively. The NMVP electrode delivers reversible capacity of only 51.8 mAh g−1, 54.6% of the NMVP@C electrode (94.9 mAh g−1). This may be ascribed to the poor electronic conductivity and large particle size of the NMVP material. Besides, the high voltage plateau of 3.6 V in NMVP is very short, indicating a severe polarization during the Mn3+/Mn2+ redox reaction. However, NMVP@C@GA exhibits an amazing capacity of 109.8 mAh g−1 (98.9% of its theoretical capacity), demonstrating a high energy density of 378.8 Wh kg−1. What's more, charge and discharge curves of the NMVP@C@GA electrode display smaller voltage gaps, indicating smaller polarization due to the improved conductive carbon network.39, 40 The dQ/dV plots (Figure 4b) highlight the redox potential of 3.40/3.38 and 3.60/3.56 V in the NMVP@C@GA electrode. Figure 4c displays the rate performance comparison between the NMVP, NMVP@C, and NMVP@C@GA electrodes. It is shown that NMVP exhibits a specific capacity of 25.6 mAh g−1 at 2 C, and when the C-rate increases to 5 C, NMVP is almost inactive due to its inferior electron transfer ability and extended ion diffusion length. Compared with NMVP, performance of NMVP@C has greatly improved because of the conductive carbon matrix. Even at a high rate of 10 C, there are still 60 mAh g−1 of reversible capacity. However, the capacity of NMVP@C falls drastically as the current rate further increases to 20 C and 50 C, and only 30.1 and 12.7 mAh g−1 of reversible capacity remained. Unsurprisingly, the NMVP@C@GA electrode demonstrates a superior rate performance: reversible capacity of 109.8, 107.3, 102.7, 95.9, 88.1, 77.3, and 60.1 mAh g−1 are obtained at various C-rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 C, respectively. When the current density turns back to 1 C from 50 C, its reversible capacity recovers to 104 mAh g−1, illustrating an excellent reversibility. Cycling stability of the samples was tested (Figure 4e). Capacity of NMVP falls drastically after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, and only 32.1 mAh g−1 remained, corresponding to 62.0% of capacity retention. With simple carbon modification, the cycling performance of NMVP@C boosts to 89.8%. For the NMVP@C@GA cathode with elaborate architecture, negligible capacity decay can be detected, indicating its prominent stability. Even after 500 cycles at 5 C, the NMVP@C@GA material still has an impressive capacity retention of 91.4%, much better than NMVP@C with 73.3% of its initial capacity (Figure 4f). The rational architecture of the NMVP@C@GA material is fundamental for the outstanding high rate capability and cycling stability. On the one hand, the highly graphitized GA substrates provide excellent pathways for fast electron transfer. On the other hand, small particle dimension of the natural NASICON-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3 material offers facile ion diffusion dynamics. These two key factors are well synergized because of the in situ carbon coating, forming an integrated structure.

Impressively, Figure 5a shows that the NMVP@C@GA electrode can deliver an initial capacity of 78 mAh g−1 at the ultrahigh rate of 20 C and maintains a remarkable capacity of 53.7 mAh g−1 after 4000 cycles. Note that, after 500 cycles, the electrode gradually reaches a steady level. The latter 3500 cycles performance demonstrates brilliant cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 87.6%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first realization of Na4MnV(PO4)3 with ultrahigh rate capability and ultralong cycling life. To have a deep insight of this prominent stability, structure information of the NMVP@C@GA electrode after 4000 cycles was further explored using XRD and TEM. Besides the additive Al reflection peaks deriving from the Al foil, all of the residual peaks can be well indexed to trigonal Na4MnV(PO4)3 without any impurities (Figure 5b), which indicates its perfectly maintained lattice structure and no side reactions happening during deep cycling. The TEM image in Figure 5c further verifies the perfectly maintained architecture even after ultralong cycling. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the outstanding cycling stability of NMVP@C@GA should be ascribed to the structure of robust interconnected GA framework–supported in situ carbon–coated NASICON-Na4MnV(PO4)3, which can not only endure the current attack even at high rate of 20 C, but can also buffer the lattice strain and volume change caused by Na+ diffusion behaviors to prevent the electrode from structural degradation.20, 39 Electron/ion diffusion dynamics of the materials were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The equivalent electrical circuit used to fit the impedance data is shown in Figure 5d. The physical elements of Rsf, Rct, Rb, CPEb, CPEdl, and CPEsf are clearly explained in previous reports.41, 42 The fitting results can be seen from Table S3 (Supporting Information). It shows that NMVP@C@GA has much smaller surface and charge transfer resistances than that of NMVP@C and NMVP, indicating the enhanced electronic conductivity. Figure 5e demonstrates a linear relationship between Z′ and ω−1/2 in the low-frequency region. The slope of Z′–ω−1/2 line equals to the Warburg factor, which can indicate the diffusivity of alkali ions.43 NMVP@C@GA displays the smallest slope, reflecting the fastest sodium diffusion realized by the architecture design.

Sodium storage mechanism in Na4MnV(PO4)3 was deeply investigated. Ex situ XRD patterns were collected under different charge/discharge states in the first cycle (Figure 6a). The peaks at 2θ = 24.38° ((2 0 2) reflection) and 47.40° ((2 2 6) reflection) split into two peaks from 3.55 to 3.8 V during the charge process and recovered to single peaks after discharge to 2.5 V, indicating a single-phase reaction based on V4+/V3+ redox followed with a two-phase reaction based on Mn3+/Mn2+ redox, which can also be determined by GITT (Figure 6b). In addition, the peaks of (2 1 1) reflection and (3 1 −1) reflection obviously experienced a right shift during the charge process and gradually recovered to their initial positions after a full cycle, which reflects lattice breathing during sodium insertion/extraction. The apparent sodium-ion diffusion coefficients DNa+ of the NMVP@C@GA material during the whole sodiation and desodiation process were calculated based on GITT (the calculation details can be seen from Figure S9, Supporting Information). The value of DNa+ varies from 10−10 to 10−12 cm2 s−1, which is comparable to Na3V2(PO4)3 (10−11 cm2 s−1).39, 44, 45 Such facile sodium ion/electron migration greatly facilitates fast sodium storage, enabling the outstanding rate performance of the NMVP@C@GA electrode. The multiple-dimension channels with low sodium-ion migration energy barriers should also account for the facile kinetics in Na4MnV(PO4)3, which is determined by first principles calculations. Three possible sodium migration paths that follow Na1 → Na2 and two paths that follow Na1 → Na1 were investigated (Figure 6c). It shows that sodium ions migrating from Na1 to Na2 along the b-direction (P2) has the lowest energy barriers of 0.323 eV (Figure 6d), which is much smaller than many reported cathode materials.46-48 P1 and P3 have the similar energy barriers of 0.327 and 0.326 eV, respectively. The energy barriers increase to 1.745 eV in P4, which represents Na1 would pass through two voids between PO4 tetrahedron and V/MnO6 octahedron, and finally migrate to Na1 site in plane-ac. It is less likely that Na1 will directly migrate to Na1 site following P5, since the energy barrier is as high as 6.210 eV (Figure 6e). These calculations can provide a fundamental understanding for fast sodium diffusion and the ability of high rate energy storage in Na4MnV(PO4)3.

The NMVP@C@GA cathode was further assembled with hard carbon anode to fabricate a full cell (noted as NMVP@C@GA/HD). To achieve a better sodium storage performance, the hard carbon anode was first cycled at 40 mA g−1 to stabilize the electrode, which further undergoes a pre-sodiation process (Figure S10, Supporting Information). Electrochemical performance of the NMVP@C@GA/HD full cell was obtained under a voltage window of 1.0–3.5 V. From Figure S11 (Supporting Information), it can be seen that NMVP@C@GA/HD can deliver an initial capacity of 81.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 110 mA g−1, with first cycle Coulombic efficiency of 83.8%. After 100 cycles, there is still 62.6 mAh g−1 of reversible capacity (capacity retention of 77.1%), demonstrating a promising prospect for practical utilizations. The capacity decay should be attributed to the unsatisfactory Coulombic efficiency below 97%, which needs to be further improved by exploring suitable anode materials.

In summary, through successfully constructing the architecture of GA-supported Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanoparticles with in situ carbon coating, Na4MnV(PO4)3 overcomes the drawback of inferior diffusion dynamics, exhibiting a superior sodium storage capability. NMVP@C@GA can achieve a high energy density of ≈380 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 C, and a high capacity retention of 68.8% after 4000 cycles at 20 C. The impressive performance should be attributed to the robust integrated electrode structure with highly conductive electron transport pathways and 3D sodium-ion migration channels with low energy barriers. With the overall merits of high energy density, low cost, outstanding structural stability, and flexible power delivering, Na4MnV(PO4)3 displays great applied prospects.
