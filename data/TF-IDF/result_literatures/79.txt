The insufficient ionic conductivity of oxide-based solid electrolyte and the large interfacial resistance between the cathode material and the solid electrolyte severely limit the performances of room-temperature all-solid-state sodium rechargeable batteries. A NASICON solid electrolyte Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12, with superior room-temperature conductivity of 5.27×10-3 S cm-1, is achieved by simultaneous substitution of Zr4+ by aliovalent Zn2+ and P5+ by Si4+ in Na3Zr2Si2PO12. The bulk conductivity and grain boundary conductivity of Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12 are nearly twenty times and almost fifty times higher than those of pristine Na3Zr2Si2PO12, respectively. The FeS2||polydopamine-Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12||Na all-solid-state sodium batteries, with a polydopamine modification thin layer between the solid electrolyte and the cathode, maintain a high reversible capacity of 236.5 mAh g-1 at a 0.1 C rate for 100 cycles and a capacity of 133.1 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C for 300 cycles, demonstrating high performances for solid state sodium batteries.
Due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resource, sodium ion batteries are promising for large-scale storage and power grids applications 1. All-solid-state sodium batteries using nonflammable solid electrolyte can achieve long cycling stability and high energy density due to the possibility of directly using metallic sodium anode and high voltage cathodes 2. Solid electrolytes are crucial components in all-solid-state sodium batteries. Among them, NASICON-structured electrolytes with composition of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0≤x≤3) attracted great interest due to good thermal and chemical stability 3. The bulk ionic conductivity of the NASICON-structured electrolytes has been effectively enhanced via aliovalent substitution by modifying the bottleneck sizes of Na+ migration channels and increasing the Na+ concentration 1, 4-9, and the grain boundary conductivity has also been improved by material densification 10, 11. In addition, structure control through substitution is also essential in improving the conductivity 12. Currently, the modification of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0≤x≤3) focuses on Na3Zr2Si2PO12 based material 4, 13-16, because the monoclinic NASICON phase (1.8≤x≤2.2) exhibits superior conductivity than rhombohedral NASICON phase 17, 18. Further refining the composition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 by substitution of P5+ by Si4+ and Zr4+ by low-valence anion can potentially further enhance the ionic conductivity, but haven’t been systematically investigated.In addition to the high conductivities of the solid electrolytes, the interfacial resistance between solid electrolytes and electrode is also crucial to achieve high performance for all-solid-state sodium batteries. The insufficient solid-solid contact between rigid solid electrolyte and electrode induces a high interfacial resistance 19. Moreover, the volume expansion and shrinkage of active materials during charge/discharge cycles also cause structural failure and resistance increase, leading to accelerate the capacity decay 20, especially in cathodes with three-dimensional volume changes. A straightforward solution is to introduce an interlayer or interphase with good stability and intimate contact with electrode and electrolyte 13-15.In this work, Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12 dense solid electrolyte with a high room-temperature sodium ionic conductivity of 5.27×10-3 S cm-1 is synthesized and a polydopamine (PDA) modification buffer layer is constructed, which lead to an ultrastable all-solid-state sodium rechargeable batteries. Na3.2+2xZr2-xZnxSi2.2P0.8O12 (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) materials with different Zn content and pristine Na3Zr2Si2PO12 were synthetized at 1250 °C in pure oxygen through solid-state reaction. Henceforth, Na3.2Zr2Si2.2P0.8O12, Na3.3Zr1.95Zn0.05Si2.2P0.8O12, Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12, Na3.5Zr1.85Zn0.15Si2.2P0.8O12 and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 are denoted as Zn0, Zn0.05, Zn0.1, Zn0.15 and pristine NZP, respectively. The difference between Zn0 and NZP is the higher Si/P atomic ratio of 2.75 in Zn0 than that (2.0) in NZP, reflecting the impact of substitution of P5+ by Si4+ in the property. As shown in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Figure 1a, at a low substitution of <0.15, all Zn0, Zn0.05, Zn0.1, Zn0.15 and pristine NZP electrolytes possess the same monoclinic (C2/c) NASICON main phase, indicating no crystalline structure change. However, when Zn concentration is higher than 0.3, the crystalline structure of Na3.8Zr1.7Zn0.3Si2.2P0.8O12 and Na4Zr1.6Zn0.4Si2.2P0.8O12 (x=0.3 and x=0.4, referred as Zn0.3 and Zn0.4) changed from monoclinic to an undesirable rhombohedral structure (Figure S1). In addition, a Zn-containing phase Na9Zn3(PO4)5 is also detected. The unit cell parameters reveal that the lattice parameters of a, b, beta angle increase and c decreases as Zn doping concentration increases (Figure 1b and Table S1). The substitution of Zr4+ with Zn2+ is further confirmed with the Rietveld analysis of the Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data (Figure 1c). As shown in Figure 1c, Figure S2 and Table S2, Zn2+ and Zr4+ occupied the same 8f octahedral site in the unit cells of all samples. In addition, no element segregation is observed in Zn0.1 sample according to the scanning transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) result (Figure S3), further confirming that Zn2+ is incorporated in the NASICON main phase. All the characterizations confirmed that the Zn2+ substituted Zr4+. Moreover, no difference could be found in peak intensities and peak positions between the XRD patterns of Zn0.1 sample sintered in oxygen and ambient air (Figure S4). 
The geometric analysis which was based on the NPD data suggested that substitution of Zr4+ by Zn2+ enlarges the bottlenecks in the migration channels (Figure 1d-f). The main migration channels in the monoclinic NASICON-type structure are Na1–Na2–Na1 channel and Na1–Na3–Na1 channel. For both the Na1–Na2–Na1 and the Na1–Na3–Na1 channels, the Na+ must migrate through four triangular bottlenecks. Each bottleneck is consisted of three O atoms of the framework. The bottlenecks in the Na1–Na2–Na1 and Na1–Na3–Na1 channels are designated by the symbols “A, B, B’, A’ ” and “C, D, E, F”, respectively (Figure S5 and Figure 1e). The NPD characterization (Table S3) demonstrated that the sizes of the smallest bottlenecks in the Na1–Na3–Na1 channel (bottleneck D) in NZP and Zn0.1 electrolytes are larger than that in the Na1–Na2–Na1 channel (bottleneck B). However both of them are smaller than the sum of the O2− and Na+ radii (about 2.35 Å according to the Shannon effective ionic radii table 21). Thus, the diffusion of Na+ in these systems is anisotropic, and Na+ tends to migrate through the Na1–Na3–Na1 channels in the bc plane rather than through the Na1–Na2–Na1 channels along the [101] direction owning to the larger size of bottleneck D compared with bottleneck B, which agrees with the previous studies 22. Notably, the size of the bottleneck D in Na1–Na3–Na1 channel is enlarged from 2.274 to 2.291 Å by Zn2+ substitution, as shown in Figure 1f. Furthermore, Zr4+ substitution by Zn2+ also increases the Na+ content, which also increases the bulk conductivity of the monoclinic NASICON-type materials due to the enhancement of correlated migration 22. Therefore, Zr4+ substitution by Zn2+ both modifies the size of the smallest bottleneck in Na1–Na3–Na1 channel and increases the Na+ content in the system, which would leads to higher Na+ conductivity.
The ionic conducting properties of Na3.2+2xZr2-xZnxSi2.2P0.8O12 electrolytes sintered at 1250 °C in pure oxygen were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Figure 2a displays the room-temperature impedance plots, and the Figure 2b shows the Arrhenius plots of Zn0, Zn0.05, Zn0.1, Zn0.15 and pristine NZP. The conductivities, activation energies as well as relative densities are summarized in Figure 2c and Table S4. The higher conductivities (1.19×10-3 S cm-1) of Zn0 electrolyte than that (5.22×10-4 S cm-1) of the pristine NZP demonstrated that increasing the Si/P atomic ratio enhances the ionic conductivity. For the Zn2+ substitution of Zr4+, the total conductivity of Na3.2+2xZr2-xZnxSi2.2P0.8O12 electrolytes reaches a maximum ionic conductivity of 5.27×10-3 S cm-1 for Zn0.1. The Zn2+ substitution modifies the bottleneck sizes and improves the Na+ transportation; In addition, the addition of Zn also promote sintering densification and grain growth through liquid phase sintering by forming a Zn-rich liquid phase and acceleration of the mass transport 23, which is also beneficial for the conductivity enhancement. When temperature increases to 60 oC, the conductivity of Zn0.1 electrolyte can further enhance to 1.14×10-2 S cm-1 (Figure 2b). However, the ionic conductivity of the electrolytes decrease when Zn content exceeds 0.1 (Table S4), which might be caused by the expanded Na+ migration bottlenecks beyond the optimal sizes and the high Na+ concentration disrupting correlated transport 5. In addition, owning to the good solubility and diffusivity of oxygen, the oxygen sintering atmosphere could facilitate the disappearance of intergranular pores via lattice diffusion or vacancy transport 11, leading to high grain boundary ionic conductivity. As shown in Figure S6, Zn0.1 electrolyte sintered in the air shows pores and micro cracks along grain boundaries, while no pores are observed in the Zn0.1 electrolyte that was sintered in the oxygen (Figure 2d). As demonstrated in Figure S7-S9 and Table S4-S6, the grain boundary conductivity (2.73×10-2 S cm-1) of Zn0.1 electrolyte sintered in oxygen environment is almost two-times higher than that (1.53×10-2 S cm-1) of sintered in ambient air, and is nearly fifty times larger than that (5.57×10-4 S cm-1) of pristine NZP sintered in ambient air. To our knowledge, the total conductivity of Zn0.1 is one of the highest among NASICON-structured Na-ion conductive oxide solid electrolytes reported in literatures 4, 6, 13, 16, 24 (Figure S10). 
The stability of Zn0.1 electrolyte against metallic sodium was investigated using a symmetrical Na/Zn0.1/Na cell at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 and a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm-2 under room-temperature. As presented in Figure 2e, the Na plating/stripping in symmetrical Na/Zn0.1/Na cell remains stable for 2400 h. Besides, when tested at 0.1 mA cm-2 and 60 °C, the potential polarization gradually increased during the initial Na plating/stripping and then stabilized after 800 h and remained stable up to 1400 h. The electrochemical window of Zn0.1 electrolyte is determined by cyclic voltammetry, no peaks or noticeable oxidation current is observed up to 6 V (Figure 2f). After formation of a passivation layer during initial Na stripping and plating cycles, the Zn0.1 electrolyte show excellent stability with sodium metal in the following cycles. However, the surface of Zn0.1 electrolyte becomes rough after contact with sodium metal due to formation of solid electrolyte interphase. Nevertheless, the element distribution on the surface is still homogeneous and almost the same with the fresh state, suggesting negligible side reaction occurs on the surface of Zn0.1 pellet (Figure S11a). The electronic conductivity at room-temperature is determined to be 4.7×10-9 S cm-1 by DC polarization measurement (Figure S11b), and the transference number is close to 1. The high ionic conductivity, the wide stability window, high stability against Na, and low electronic conductivity make Zn0.1 electrolyte a good candidate for all-solid-state sodium batteries.
To reduce the high interfacial resistance at cathode/electrolyte interface in the all-solid-state sodium batteries, an air-stable PDA thin layer was coated on the surface of Zn0.1 electrolyte pellet through a facile in situ polymerization method. The powerful adhesion capability of elastic PDA layer ensures its strong binding on the surface of Zn0.1 electrolyte pellet and intimate face-contact between the electrolyte and the cathode material 25, and provides the necessary flexibility to accommodate volumetric changes to maintain the interfacial contact and structural integrity during cycling. The charge transfer interactions between o-benzoquinone and catechol units in PDA enabled the Na-ion transfer 26. The surface morphology of Zn0.1 pellets before and after PDA coating is presented in Figure S12a and Figure 3a, respectively. A continuous dense layer with evenly distributed small particles is formed on the surface of the electrolyte grains. Moreover, the gaps between the grains have been eliminated due to the PDA coating layer, resulting in the effectively increased contact area and interfacial contact. The thickness of the uniform coating layer is determined to be approximately 34 nm (Figure 3b). The EDS mapping demonstrated that surface layer contains nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, sodium, silicon, zirconium and phosphorus. The characteristic peak of the N-H stretching vibration centered at 1510 cm-1 in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra (Figure S12b) and the existence of element nitrogen in EDS mapping further confirms the PDA coating layer.
The electrochemical performances of FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state batteries were evaluated at a current density of 0.1 C at 60 ºC. For comparison, the performances of FeS2||Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state batteries without PDA buffer layer were also evaluated under the same condition (Figure S13 and Figure 3d). As shown in Figure 3c and Figure 3d, the FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state battery delivers a charge capacity of 279.9 mAh g-1 with a coulombic efficiency of 69.54% in the initial charge/discharge cycle. The capacity slightly decays to 250 mAh g-1 within 15th cycles, and then maintains stable at 236.5 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles, which is much higher than that of PDA-absent FeS2||Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state sodium battery with only 63.21 mAh g-1 capacity left at 100th cycle. The low initial coulombic efficiency and capacity fading before 15th cycle is due to the phase transformation of FeS2 (from pyrite FeS2 to NaxFeS2 27). The rate capability and long cycling stability of FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state battery are further evaluated (Figure 3e and Figure 3f). FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na cell maintains high capacities of 311.3, 267.3, 249.3, 225.5, 202.7 and 141.6 mAh g-1 at the rates of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 C, respectively, and recovers back to 291.1 mAh g-1 when the current density reset to 0.05 C. By contrast, the PDA-absent FeS2||Zn0.1||Na cell only provides reversible capacities of 226.9, 192.6, 178.2, 161.4, 136.1 and 75.5 mAh g-1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 C, respectively, and only a low capacity of 189.9 mAh g-1 can be recovered at 0.05 C (Figure 3e). Moreover, FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na all-solid-state battery also shows a long cycling stability. At a high current of 0.5 C, the FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na battery could deliver a reversible capacity of 133.1 mAh g-1 for 300 cycles with a capacity retention ratio of 73.3%, which is one of the best performance among all reported NASICON solid electrolyte based all-solid-state batteries (Figure S14) 13, 24, 28-30.
The robustness of PDA layer in combing of Zn0.1 electrolyte with FeS2 cathode is witnessed by comparing the cross-sectional images of the cathode/electrolyte interface in the FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na and FeS2||Zn0.1||Na cells after 100 cycles at 0.1 C and 60 ºC. As illustrated in Figure S15a and Figure S15c, the FeS2 composite cathode is in close contact with the Zn0.1 pellet before cycling in both cells. Severe structural failure is observed at the cathode/electrolyte interface in FeS2||Zn0.1||Na battery after cycling (Figure S15b), resulting in capacity decay. By contrast, FeS2||PDA-Zn0.1||Na battery only shows a few pores and intimate interface is still maintained (Figure S15b), which enables the Na+ transfer at the interface and thus the favorable cycling performance and rate capability.
In summary, dense Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12 NASICON solid electrolytes with a record high ionic conductivity of 5.27×10-3 S cm-1 were synthetized by simultaneous substitution of P5+ with Si4+ and Zr4+ with Zn2+ and sintered in oxygen atmosphere. Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12 electrolytes were evaluated in FeS2||PDA-Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12||Na all-solid-state cells in which a PDA layer with strong bonding to Na3.4Zr1.9Zn0.1Si2.2P0.8O12 electrolyte was employed to ensure intimate contact and accommodate volume changes of cathode material during cycling. The obtained all-solid-state battery exhibits improved cycling capacity of 236.5 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate and high rate cycling stability with a capacity of 133.1 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 0.5 C. This modification strategy could be widely applied to other high energy density solid state battery systems.
