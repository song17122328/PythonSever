Here,   we   report   a   novel   double   perovskite-type   BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)   as  a   CO2 sensor   at ppm   level   in   a  mixture   of  21%   O2 in   N2 (dry   synthetic   air)   working   at   500–700 ◦C.  Powder   X-ray   diffraction   (PXRD)   was   used   to  conﬁrm   the   formation   of  cubic   double   perovskite-type   structure.   In   situ   PXRD measurement   under   CO2 showed   excellent   chemical   stability   in   the   temperature   range   of  25–800 ◦C. A  signiﬁcant   decrease   in   total   impedance   (resistance)   was   observed   upon   exposure   to  CO2 (ppm   level) in  synthetic   air   using   AC   impedance   spectroscopy.   Fe–BCN   showed   a  fast   response   (t90 ∼   4   min)   when 1500   ppm   CO2 was   introduced.   The   sensor   response   was   found   to   be   linear   over   the   investigated   range in   the  log  I   vs.  log   pCO2.  Fe-substitution   in   BaCa0.33Nb0.67O3 (BCN)   is   critical   for   the   observed   CO2 sensor properties   since   BCN   exhibited   a   poor   response   under   the   identical   sensor   measurement   conditions.   The CO2 sensor   mechanism   was   established   using   mass   spectrometry   (MS)   in   combination   with   DC   measurements.   The   long-term   sensor   performance   was   studied   for   Fe–BCN   and  re-assured   high   sensitivity, stability   and   reliability.

The  detection  of  greenhouse  CO2 is  gaining  attention  because of  increasing  global  warming  and  environmental  pollution.  Monitoring  CO2 in  residences,  industries,  agricultural  ﬁelds,  and  CO2 sequestration  plants  is  primary  concern  for  public  security  [1].   Reliable  gas  sensors  are  necessary  for  continuous  on-site  monitoring of  greenhouse  CO2 emitted  by  power  plants  and  solid  oxide  fuel cells  (SOFCs),  if  these  SOFCs  are  powered  by  hydrocarbons  and integrated  with  CO2 capture  and  storage  (CCS).  Also,  continuous detection  of  CO2 is  important  in  enhanced  oil  recovery  (EOR)  [2]  as well  as  carbon  capture  and  storage  (CCS)  [3].   Therefore,  it  is  essential  for  such  applications  to  detect  in  situ  CO2 concentration  at  high temperatures,  under  high  pressure  and  other  harsh  environmental conditions.

The  power  plant  industries  consider  solid  state  sensors,  which can  detect  in  situ  CO2 concentration  in  real-time,  as  a  potential  low cost,  high-sensitive,  high-selective  monitoring  system  [4–8].  CO2 is  commonly  detected  by  spectroscopic  method,  known  as  nondispersive  infrared  (NDIR)  sensor.  Not  only  are  they  expensive,  but

they  are  large  and  may   not  be  ideal  for  real-time  CO2 detection  in a  combined  CCS  and  SOFCs.  Optical,  semiconductor,  and  electrochemical  CO2 sensors,  in  development,  could  detect  wide  range  of CO2 concentrations  [9–13].  However,  they  are  not  applicable  for in  situ  measurements  at  elevated  temperatures  because  their  gas sensor  properties  become  unstable  [14].

Metal  oxides,  such  as  SnO2 [15]  and  In2O3 [16],  are  possible high  operating  temperature  gas  sensors;  however,  semiconductorbased  sensors  are  unsuitable  for  CO2 detection  at  trace  ppm  level because  the  detection  limit  is  too  high  and  the  sensors  display cross-sensitivity  to  humidity  [17].  Although,  the  fast  Na+ ion  conducting  Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and  Na-ˇ-alumina  were  found  to  detect CO2 down  to  ppm  level  [18–20],   these  sensors  have  a  reduced life-time  because  of  gas  leakage  through  the  sealing  and  electrolytes,  formation  of  reaction  products  at  interfaces,  and  use  of extra  auxiliary  electrode  [21].  Major  challenges  for  these  sensors  also  include  selectivity,  response  time,  and  degradation  of electrodes  [22].  Transition  metal  substituted  double  perovskitetype  BaCa0.33Nb0.67−xMxO3−ı (M–BCN)  has  been  widely  studied  as mixed  ionic  and  electronic  conductors  (MIECs)  for  SOFCs  [23–25]. Fe-substituted  BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)  is  explored  as a  potential  solid  state  resistance-type  CO2 sensor  in  synthetic air  at  500–700 ◦C  because  of  its  high  thermal  and  chemical stability  in  CO2 atmosphere.  In  addition,  Fe–BCN  is  less  likely to  deteriorate  in  humid  conditions,  offering  a  wider  range  of applications.

Required  stoichiometric  amounts  of  Ba(NO3)2 (99+%,  Alfa Aesar),  CaCO3 (99%  Fisher  Scientiﬁc  Company),  Nb2O5 (99.5%, Alfa  Aesar)  and  Fe2O3 (99+%,  Alfa  Aesar)  were  mixed  to  prepare double  perovskite-type  structure  BaCa0.33Nb0.67O3 (BCN)  and BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)  using  conventional  solid-state (ceramic)  reaction.  The  desired  amount  of  2-propanol  was   added to  these  starting  powder  materials  in  a  zirconia  bowl  and  ball  milled for  12  h  at  200  rpm  using  zirconia  balls  with  reversed  rotation  every hour  to  ensure  proper  mixing.  The  mixed  powders  were  then  dried and  calcinated  at  1000 ◦C  for  12  h.  The  resulting  powders  were  ballmilled  again  for  6  h  after  adding  2-propanol,  dried  and  pressed  into the  pellets  using  an  isostatic  pressure,  and  sintered  in  air  at  1400 ◦C for  24  h.  Re-crystallized  alumina  crucibles  were  used  for  sintering the  pellets.

The  sintered  pellets  were  crushed  into  powders  for  the  phase characterization  by  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (PXRD)  using  a  Bruker D8  powder  X-ray  diffractometer  (Cu  K␣,  40  kV;  40  mA)   at  room   step  scan  width  of  0.02◦ and  a  counting  time temperature  with  a  2␪ of  6  s  per  step.  The  structure  was  characterized  using  the  Rietveld reﬁnement  with  PXRD  data.  In  situ  chemical  stability  test  was  performed  from  25  to  800 ◦C  with  the  continuous  ﬂow  (100  sccm)  of 1%  CO2 (balanced  in  dry  synthetic  air,  21%  O2 in  N2)  using  the  PXRD equipped  with  the  Anton  Par  HTK2000  high  temperature  stage.  The temperature  was  raised  from  room  temperature  to  800 ◦C  at  the rate  of  6 ◦C/min  and  was  kept  for  an  hour  to  equilibrate  after  reaching  the  target  temperature  at  100–800 ◦C  with  the  difference  of 200 ◦C  for  each  measurement.

Scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  (Philips  XL30  SEM)  was used  to  study  the  microstructure  of  the  Fe–BCN  pellet.  Microstructure  and  phase  purity  were  further  studied  using  a  high-resolution transmission  electron  microscopy  (HRTEM)  coupled  with  selected area  electron  diffraction  (SAED)  (FEI  Tecnai  F20  FEGTEM  equipped with  a  Gatan  Imaging  Filter  and  a  Gatan  860  GIF  2001  CCD × of  1024    1024  resolution).  HRTEM  was  done  at  magniﬁcations between  940,000  and  1,350,000.  The  diffraction  patterns  were taken  at  a  camera  length  of  400  mm   and  directly  after  taking  each individual  diffraction  pattern  of  the  sample,  it  was  exchanged  by  a reference  sample  of  Au  without  changing  any  settings  on  the  microscope.  The  diffraction  rings  of  Au  were  used  to  conﬁrm  a  proper calibration  in  diffraction  mode  of  the  equipment.

Electrical  conductivity  of  sintered  pellets  was  measured  under different  pCO2 (0–1500  ppm  CO2 balanced  in  dry  synthetic  air)  at 500–700 ◦C.  Au  paste  (Heraeus  Inc.,  LP  A88-11  S  Germany)  was painted  on  both  sides  of  the  sintered  pellets  and  cured  at  600 ◦C  for 1  h  in  air  to  remove  the  organic  binders.  Moreover,  Au  wires  as  a current  collector  were  kept  in  contact  with  the  surface  of  the  pellet using  a  spring-loaded  contact.  The  cell  with  the  pellet  was  heated to  the  desired  temperature  (500–700 ◦C)  using  Barnstead  tubular furnace  (model  No.  21100).  The  furnace  temperature  was   held  constant  for  a  minimum  of  2  h  and  a  maximum  of  24  h  before  each measurement.  A  two  probe  electrochemical  cell  was   employed  for the  electrical  characterization,  where  conductivity  was  measured by  AC  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (Solartron;  model no.:  SI  1260,  0.1  V;  0.01  Hz–1  MHz).

A  typical  conventional  gas  ﬂow  apparatus  using  computer  regulated  mass  ﬂow  controllers  (MCS-100  SCCM-D/5M,  5IN)  was   used to  prepare  desired  pCO2.  The  concentration  of  CO2 was   controlled  in the  range  between  0  and  1500  ppm  by  mixing  N2 (99.99%)  and  CO2 balanced  by  dry  synthetic  air  (Praxair,  Inc.,  Canada).  The  total  gas ﬂow  rate  of  gas  passing  through  the  cell  was  100  sccm.  The  CO2 sensors  were  located  in  the  middle  of  a  quartz  tube  inside  the  Barnstead tubular  furnace  and  measurements  were  conducted  at  500–700 ◦C. A  two  probe  electrochemical  cell  was  employed.  DC  measurements were  done  by  applying  a  constant  voltage  of  0.1  V  (Solartron,  SI 1287).  Sensor  measurements  were  performed  at  constant  current of  0.2  mA,   0.5  mA,   and  1  mA   at  700 ◦C.  In  order  to  investigate  the effect  of  humidity  on  the  sensing  behavior,  the  sensing  characteristics  were  examined  in  both  dry  and  wet  atmospheres  (3%  H2O). For  wet   atmosphere,  the  mixed  gas  was   passed  by  bubbling  through ∼25 ◦C.  The  Au  electrodes  with  surface  area  of  0.049  cm2 water  at  were  used  for  measuring  the  surface  sensitivity  and  the  distance between  two   electrodes  was  kept  at  0.55  cm.   Mass  spectrometer (MS)  (Pfeiffer  Vacuum)  was   used  to  analyze  the  gases  coming  out of  the  operating  cell.

Fig.  1  shows  the  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (PXRD)  patterns of  as-prepared  parent  BaCa0.33Nb0.67O3 (BCN)  (Fig.  1a)  and Fe-substituted  BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)  (Fig.  1b).  All observed  diffraction  lines  for  both  compounds  can  be  assigned to  single-phase  double  perovskite  structure.  Rietveld  reﬁnement of  Fe–BCN  PXRD  pattern  is  shown  in  Fig.  2a,  which  further  conﬁrmed  double  perovskite-type  structure  (space  group:  Fm-3m   (No. 225))  with  a  lattice  constant  of  a  =  8.3257(2) ˚A,  akin  to  parent BaCa0.33Nb0.67O3 (BCN)  [23,24].  The  detailed  structural  models  and the  Rietveld  reﬁnement  results  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Furthermore,  HRTEM  and  SAED  studies  were  done  on  as-prepared  parent compound  BCN  (Fig.  2b)  as  well  as  on  Fe–BCN  (Fig.  2c)  to  validate  our  proposed  structure.  The  assigned  diffraction  lines  in  the SAED  patterns  shown  in  Fig.  2b  (ii)  and  c  (ii)  for  BCN  and  Fe–BCN respectively,  are  consistent  with  their  corresponding  PXRD.

All  of  the  peaks  at  high  temperatures  represent  a  double perovskite-type  structure,  suggesting  that  Fe–BCN  is  stable  against chemical  reaction  with  CO2.  Shown  in  Fig.  4  are  typical  SEM  images

Fe–BCN  exhibited  a  denser  surface  than  as-prepared  parent BCN.  The  particle  size  of  Fe–BCN  was   found  to  be  slightly  larger than  that  of  parent  BCN.

I,  II,  III  and  IV  represent 100,  500,  1000  and  1500  ppm  of  CO2 balanced  in  dry  synthetic  air  purged  inside  the gas-tight  quartz  cell  respectively.

observed  within  4–5  min   at  700 ◦C,  while  at  500 ◦C,  it  was   found to  be  7–8  min   for  Fe–BCN  (Fig.  6a).  The  parent  BCN  did  not  show any  signiﬁcant  response  to  CO2 gas  under  the  similar  conditions (Fig.  5b).  The  signal  to  noise  ratio  was  very  low  and  the  current  density  was  found  to  be  lower  than  that  of  Fe–BCN.  The  humidity  effect was  studied  at  500 ◦C  by  passing  the  mixed  gas  bubbling  through ∼25 ◦C.  The  sensor  exhibits  the  same  trend water  (3%  humidity)  at  and  similar  current  values  compared  to  the  sample  measured  in  a dry  condition  (Fig.  6b).  This  reﬂects  the  chemical  stability  of  Fe–BCN in  presence  of  moisture  that  was  also  proved  by  high  temperature in  situ  PXRD,  where  Fe–BCN  sample  was  subjected  to  water  vapor for  72  h  prior  to  the  XRD  measurement.  The  change  in  the  current density  becomes  smaller  as  the  ppm  level  of  pCO2 increases. Fig.  7  shows  the  variation  in  current  density  as  a  function  of pCO2 at  700 ◦C.  The  sensing  response  (current  density)  is  found  to increase  linearly  when  it  is  plotted  against  logarithmic  pCO2.  A  similar  trend  was  observed  at  500 ◦C  and  600 ◦C,  where  both  response and  recovery  current  density  values  were  also  close  to  each  other. The  current  density  increases  as  temperature  increases  for  the corresponding  pCO2.  The  conductivity  was  calculated  at  different temperatures  (500–700 ◦C)  after  subtracting  the  blank  measurements  to  observe  the  effect  of  CO2 and  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  8. Blank  measurements  were  performed  by  using  dry  synthetic  air (21%  O2 in  N2)  without  CO2 at  the  same  gas  ﬂow  rate  (100  sccm). The  electrical  conductivity  decreases  with  decreasing  pCO2,  which suggests  a  p-type  MIEC  behavior  of  Fe–BCN  under  the  investigated condition.

Typical  AC  impedance  plots  obtained  for  Fe–BCN  using  Au  electrodes  at  700 ◦C  at  different  pCO2 are  shown  in  Fig.  9.  AC  impedance showed  a  deﬁnite  low-frequency  intercept  to  the  real  axis  indicating  low  interfacial  resistance  between  electrode  and  electrolyte and  the  interface  is  non-blocking  for  electrons.  The  positive  value at  high  frequency  is  attributed  to  the  inductance  effect  which  may partially  be  resulting  from  the  experimental  set  up.  The  total  resistance  decreases  with  increasing  pCO2.  As  shown  in  Fig.  9,  the  total resistivity  of  Fe–BCN  signiﬁcantly  reduced  from  27    cm  (0  ppm  of

(For  interpretation  of  the  references  to  color  this  ﬁgure  legend,  the  reader  is referred  to  the  web   version  of  the  article.)

CO2 concentration  (Fig.  12)   was   also  found  similar  to  that  shown  in Fig.  7.  Therefore,  all  the  results  and  arguments  signify  the  resistivetype  sensing  behavior  of  Fe–BCN  for  CO2 at  ppm  levels.

All  the  above  sensing  measurements  (AC  and  DC)  were  done using  the  bulk  measurement  set-up  as  shown  in  Fig.  13a.  Generally,  the  surface  phenomena  seem  to  show  fast  response  time  in the  case  of  semiconductor  sensors.  In  particular,  the  resistive-type semiconductor-based  CO2 sensors  (e.g.,  SnO2,  In2O3)  operate  based on  the  phenomena  by  applying  constant  voltage  (0.1  V)  to  compare results  with  bulk  samples  (Fig.  13b)  [15–17].  The  area  covered  with

CO2 in  79%  N2 and  21%  O2)  to  15    cm for  1500  ppm  of  CO2.  The  resistivity  of  the  Fe–BCN  pellet  measured at  different  temperatures  (500–700 ◦C)  and  various  pCO2 using  both AC  and  DC  measurements  are  compared  in  Fig.  10.   It  is  evident  that both  values  are  very  close  to  each  other,  particularly  at  higher  pCO2.

Fig.  11  shows  the  response  and  recovery  transients  in  voltage  as a  function  of  time  by  applying  the  constant  current  of  0.2–1  mA   at 700 ◦C.  The  results  exhibit  a  similar  trend  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  5a. As  anticipated,  the  voltage  gradually  drops  when  CO2 is  introduced. The  similar  behavior  was  also  obtained  from  AC  impedance  results (Fig.  9)  and  DC  measurements  at  a  constant  potential  (Fig.  5a).

Au-paste  (Au-electrode)  in  this  set-up  was  very  low  (0.049  cm2).  In addition,  the  Au-electrodes  were  kept  at  0.55  cm  apart  from  each other  (Fig.  13b).  The  surface  response  was  found  to  be  rather  slower than  the  bulk  one,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14  inset.  However,  the  sensor showed  highly  reliable  and  reproducible  results  at  various  pCO2. The  slow  response  of  surface  structure  sensor  is  presently  unclear to  us  and  future  work  may   be  required  to  systematically  study  the effect  of  thickness  and  surface  area  on  CO2 sensing.

The  incorporation  of  CO2 in  oxygen  deﬁcient  double  perovskite was  originally  suggested  by  Irvine  group  [26]  using  neutron  diffraction  studies  of  the  Ta  analog  of  BCN  after  treating  with  CO2 at elevated  temperatures.  Lee  et  al.  reported  an  electron-induced dissociation  of  CO2 adsorbed  at  the  oxygen  vacancy  on  the  semiconducting  TiO2 (1  1  0)  surface  by  using  scanning  tunneling  microscopy [27].  It  is  also  reported  that  CO2 can  be  reduced  using  solid  electrolytes  at  elevated  temperature  [28].  The  reduction  of  metal  ions in  the  oxides  seems  to  favor  CO2 dissociation  which  changes  the impedance  of  the  investigated  Fe–BCN.  We   believe  that  the  applied DC  voltage  most  likely  decomposes  CO2 (Eq.  (1))  or  it  may   undergo the  catalytic  decomposition,  at  the  interfacial  region  where  Au, Fe–BCN  and  gas  phase  co-exist  (Fig.  15). CO2 →

Carbonate  formation  might  not  have  occurred  owing  to  high chemical  stability  of  Fe–BCN  in  presence  of  CO2 (Fig.  3).  The  present work  utilized  MIEC  Fe–BCN  directly  and  showed  a  remarkable response  to  CO2 at  relatively  low  DC  potential  of  0.1  V.  Fe  plays

Fig.  and  of BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)  at  various  concentrations  of  CO2 balanced in   dry  synthetic  air  (21%  O2 in  N2)  at  700 ◦C  (applied  voltage  =  0.1  V).  Schematic diagram  for  surface  sensitivity  measurement  is  shown  in  inset.

a  vital  role  in  conducting  and  transporting  ions,  since  the  sample without  Fe,  parent  BCN,  showed  very  poor  CO2 sensing  properties (Fig.  5b).  We   also  performed  the  sensor  property  of  commercial Fe2O3,  interestingly;  it  also  showed  better  response  to  CO2 at  elevated  temperature  compared  to  BCN  [29].  It  seems  that  CO2 is  being reduced  to  CO  and  O2 owing  to  the  catalytic  activity  of  Fe–BCN  in presence  of  Au.  The  possible  sensing  phenomenon  is  presented  in Fig.  15.

The  electrical  conductivity  increases  with  increasing  pCO2 and vice  versa,  which  signiﬁes  the  p-type  semiconducting  behavior. The  theoretical  calculation  for  Faradic  current  solely  due  to  CO2 reduction  also  showed  the  similar  values  for  lower  concentrations of  CO2 (<500  ppm).  Schematic  diagram  in  Fig.  15b  is  an  idealized mechanism  showing  the  incorporation  of  oxygen  (obtained  from CO2 reduction)  in  Fe–BCN.  This  argument  was   further  supported  by mass  spectrometer  (MS)  (Fig.  16),   which  was   connected  to  the  outlet  of  the  sensing  cell  kept  at  applied  voltage  of  0.1  V.  As  3000  ppm of  CO2 balanced  in  ultra  pure  Ar  gas  (Praxair,  Inc.)  was  introduced to  the  sensing  cell  (∼100  sccm),  the  MS   detected  the  ion  current signals  for  outcoming  gases  corresponding  to  Ar  (not  shown),  CO2 (blue),  CO  (black)  and  O2 (red).  This  result  seems  to  indicate  the reduction  of  CO2 into  CO  as  CO  signal  shifted  from  its  base  line when  CO2 was  introduced  into  the  testing  cell.  The  other  supporting  evidence  of  this  phenomenon  is  the  lowest  conductivity  and no  response  for  CO2 when  parent  BCN  (that  contains  no  iron)  was subjected  to  the  sensing  test  (Fig.  5b).  One  might  also  argue  that the  sensor  responded  to  O2 in  the  synthetic  air.  It  is  important  to note  that  electrical  conductivity  of  Fe–BCN  was  found  to  be  almost same  in  air  and  N2 at  the  sensor  working  temperatures.  However,

The  results  of  this  study  suggest  that  double  perovskite BaCa0.33Nb0.34Fe0.33O3−ı (Fe–BCN)  is  a  promising  material  for  solid state  CO2 detection.  Fe–BCN  is  preferable  in  extreme  temperatures,  up  to  800 ◦C  in  1%  CO2.  In  addition,  the  total  resistance  of Fe–BCN  signiﬁcantly  changed  upon  exposing  to  ppm  levels  of  CO2 because  of  its  catalytic  activities.  The  sensor  results  demonstrate Fe–BCN’s  high  reliability,  reversibility  and  reproducibility.  Fe–BCN showed  very  high  sensitivity  and  rapid  response  (t90 ∼ 4  min)  when 1500  ppm  CO2 was   introduced  with  dry  synthetic  air  (21%  O2 in  N2) at  700 ◦C.  For  further  application  as  CO2 sensor  material,  Fe–BCN requires  optimization  of  its  sintering  protocols  and  microstructure. In  addition,  the  role  of  Fe  in  CO2 detection  could  lead  to  the  use  of other  Fe-based  ceramics  for  sensors.  Further  research  could  also address  Fe–BCN’s  sensitivity  to  other  gases  (i.e.,  CO,  H2)  expanding its  possible  application  in  selective  gas  sensors.  Thus,  it  would  be necessary  to  optimize  the  Fe-substitution  level  in  BCN  for  either potential  use.
