In this study, a NASICON-structured Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) powder is prepared by hydrothermal methods followed by calcination, cold pressing and post-sintering processes. The white, solid product is characterized thoroughly using powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) and ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The conductivity of the material is measured by a impedance spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Initially, hydrothermal synthesis yields a material iso-structural with the orthorhombic oxyphosphate, LiTiOPO4. EDS analysis shows that the distribution of aluminum throughout this material is uniform. A systematic study is then performed to investigate how altering the sin-tering parameters (such as powder pre-sintering temperature and pellet sintering temperature) aﬀect the for-mation of LATP. The structure is determined by Rietveld reﬁnement against XRD data and the eﬀects of sintering temperature on porosity, microstructure and electrical conductivity were resolved. The experimental results show that the optimum pre-sintering and sintering temperatures of LATP powders and pellets respectively are 900 °C and 1100 °C. These conditions produce materials with the highest density (99.07% of theoretical), su-perior conductivity (grain-, grain boundary- and total lithium-ion conductivities of 6.57 × 10−4, 4.59 × 10−4 and 2.70 × 10−4 Scm−1, respectively) and with an activation energy for Li motion of 0.17 eV.
Since the commercialization of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), LIBs have been widely used as power sources for portable electronic devices due to their high energy density, light weight and long cycle life. However, LIBs containing organic liquid electrolytes have problems with leakage and ﬂammability, which particularly limits large-scale applications. Use of solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) in all-solid-state-batteries (ASSBs) is expected to counteract many of the present safety problems of lithium-ion batteries due to the minimization of unwanted reactivity at the electrode interfaces.Many kinds of inorganic solid state electrolytes, such as garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [1–5], perovskite-type Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3 [6–10], and Na-superionic conductor (NASICON)-type systems [11–15] are being ac-tively investigated. Among them, the NASICON-type material, lithium titanium phosphate, LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) is considered one of the most promising solid-state electrolytes given its inherent safety, low cost, high thermal and air stability at room temperature. In addition, LTP has proved to be an adaptable material, with use as an eﬀective electrolyte not only in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLBs) [16–18], but also in lithium-air [19,20] and lithium-sulﬁde systems [21].NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 forms with a rhombohedral structure composed of octahedral TiO6 which corner-share with tetrahedral PO4. Two types of Li cation vacancies exist in the structure; M1 vacancies, which are formed between tetrahedral PO4 and M2 vacancies, which are formed between adjoining octahedral TiO6. In a 3-D NASICON network [22,23], Li+ ions diﬀuse along the pathways which inter-connect the M1–M2 vacancies.The disadvantage with LiTi2(PO4)3, however, is lower ionic con-ductivity at room temperature [24]. In LTP, the contribution of the grain boundary resistance to the total resistance is much larger than that contributed by the bulk. In other words, the grain boundary re-sistance is the major factor that governs the total conductivity of Li-Ti2(PO4)3. Therefore, controlling the density of an LTP electrolyte be-comes a key factor towards optimizing the total conductivity. In order to increase the density, many researchers have begun to study the eﬀects of adding ﬂuxes or employing new sintering techniques, for example, some of which are discussed brieﬂy below [25].It has been found that Ti4+ can be replaced by various trivalent elements (such as Al3+,Fe3+,Y3+,Cr3+,Ga3+ and Sc3+) while re-taining the rhombohedral NASICON-type structure [17,26–28]. Among these aliovalent substituents, Al3+ appears to modify the NASICON cell volume towards its optimum size for facile Li+ transport and sig-niﬁcantly improves the conductivity in so-formed Li1+xAlxTi2-x (PO4)3 (LATP). Conversely, some studies have emphasized that a major role of the aluminum additive is to form the Al-rich second phase AlPO4, which improves the total ion conductivity by enhancing densiﬁcation eﬀec-tively forming a composite. However, the concentration of added Al is crucial since at high levels it acts so as to prevent Li-ion conduction across the LiTi2(PO4)3 grain boundaries. Thus, maintaining an overall control of the LTP microstructure would appear to be vital in eﬀorts to maximize overall conductivity; a balance needs to be struck between achieving high density and ensuring secondary phases do not impede ionic transport at the grain boundaries [29].An alternative approach to this microstructure problem is to employ low melting point ﬂuxes [24,30–32] to densify LTP and associated substituted solid electrolytes. In early research of this type, Aono et al.[24] used inorganic binders, such as Li2O and Li4P2O7,asﬂuxes to increase the relative density of the sintered pellets and the Li+ con-centration at the grain boundaries; the ionic conductivity was increased to 3.5 × 10−4 Scm−1 as a result. Aono et al. [30] went on to use other ﬂuxes, including Li3PO4 and Li3BO3, to reduce the activation energy of Li+ grain boundary diﬀusion and to increase the contact area between the crystal grains. The LTP-0.2 Li3BO3 sample showed an ion con-ductivity of 3.0 × 10−4 Scm−1 at room temperature. In more recent research, Bai et al. [31], found that LiBO2 could act as a very eﬀective sintering aid, which densiﬁes LATP and improves the Li-ion con-ductivity as a consequence. The LATP-LiBO2 material forms a uniform microstructure with a relative density of up to 97.1% of the theoretical value and a total ionic conductivity of 3.5 × 10−4 Scm−1, the acti-vation energy for Li+ motion was reduced to 0.39 eV.The focus of recent research has switched to employing diﬀerent sintering techniques to prepare LTP and LATP without sintering aids. These include melt quenching [33,34], sol-gel [11,13,35], mechanical milling [36,37], co-precipitation [38,39] and spark plasma sintering (SPS) [40–43] techniques. Kobayashi et al. [43] found out that the Li-ion conductivity in LTP at room temperature can be improved from 10−8 to 10−6 Scm−1 via the SPS process. In an alternative approach, Xu et al. prepared high density LATP (x = 0.4) with ~100% of theo-retical density by hydrothermal methods [41]. The resulting material possessed an exceptionally high ionic conductivity of 1.12 × 10−3 Scm−1 at room temperature and a corresponding low activation energy of 0.25 eV for Li-ion motion.
Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 (Acros, purity, 98%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Shimakyu's pure chemical Co, Ltd., 98%), H3PO4 (Echo chemical Co, Ltd., 86%) and LiOH·H2O (Acros, 98%) were used without further puriﬁcation and simply mixed with a molar ratio of Li:Al:Ti:P = 1.3:0.3:1.7:3. 60 ml of the resulting mixture was transferred into a 100 ml stainless steel au-toclave. The autoclave was sealed, and heated to 180 °C in a furnace (Thermo®, BF51314C) for 24 h before cooling to room temperature. The resulting product was ﬁltered, washed with deionized water and ethanol (Echo chemical Co, Ltd., 95%). The LATP precursor cake was dried for 12 h at 80 °C and the solid (named “LATP-pre”) characterized before further treatment. The dry powder was split into 5 samples and heated in air for 3 h at 500 °C (named “LATP-500”), 600 °C (“LATP-600”), 700 °C (“LATP-700”), 800 °C (“LATP-800”) and 900 °C (“LATP-900”), respectively. After cooling, each of the LATP powders was cold pressed at 13000 psi to a pellet of a diameter and thickness of ca.10 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. The pellets were sintered at 900 °C, 1000 °C, 1100 °C and 1200 °C for 3 h in air, respectively. Each of these pellets are denoted herein in terms of their initial heating and ﬁnal sintering temperatures (e.g. “LATP-500–900” etc.)
The two faces of each pellet were polished and painted with silver paste as blocking electrodes. The AC impedance was measured using a Solartron (SI1287 + 1255B) Impedance Analyzer in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz, with AC amplitude of 30 mV. The measurements were performed at temperatures from 25 °C to 125 °C. The dried precursor powders and the product pellets were characterized by powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD; Bruker D8 Advance Eco) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Rietveld structure reﬁnement against XRD data was performed using the GSAS software [44]. The morphology and structure of the LATP sample was analyzed using Ultra-High Resolution Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM; JEOL/JSM-7600F) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA; DuPont, TA Q50) was performed on the LATP-pre power at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of 30–800 °C under air atmosphere.
Electrodes for the pouch cell were provided by Gold Carbon Corp, Ltd. The anode consisted of artiﬁcial graphite (AG) (93.8%) active material and polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVdF) (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99%) binder on Cu foil (UBIQ Technology, purity 99%) current col-lector. The cathode consisted of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM-523, NCM)(82%) (Provided from Gold Carbon Company) active material and PVdF binder on Al foil (UBIQ Technology, purity 99%) current collector. A slurry containing LATP and PVdF binder (96:4 wt%) in NMP (N-methyl pyrrolidinone; UBIQ technology Co. Ltd., 99%) was used to prepare the LATP electrolyte. The LATP slurry was coated on the NCM electrode and dried at 80 °C, then marked as “NCM-LATP”. The NCM-LATP (193.3 mAh, density: 0.0175 g/mm2) and AG (254 mAh, density: 0.0072 g/mm2) electrodes were punched and dried at 120 °C for 8 h in vacuum to remove the residual water. The electrode sizes of anode and cathode are 25 mm × 25 mm. After pouch cell assembly (A/C ratio is 1.31), the cell was run over 2 cycles at a very slow rate (0.5C). The voltage range of 2.8–4.3 V under 0.5C was used for cycling stability tests. Manufacture and testing of pouch cells were in a closed room with 25oC in a drying room with air-conditioning.
Fig. 1(a) shows the experimental X-ray diﬀraction pattern of the LATP-Pre powder prepared by the hydrothermal method after drying. As shown in the ﬁgure, the peaks in the diﬀraction pattern could be assigned to that from the orthorhombic structure of LiTiOPO4 (Lithium titanium oxyphosphate, ICSD#39534).Fig. 1(b) displays the thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) proﬁle and the proﬁle from the diﬀerential of the thermogravimetry (DTG) signal for LATP-Pre. A weight loss of 7.76 wt% was measured from the TGA curve across the temperature range of 30–800 °C. Since the precursor powder of hydrothermal synthesis was a crystal phase of LiTiOPO4 with good crystallinity, the main reaction of the precursor powder in the heating process is the transformation of LiTiOPO4 crystal phase into Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 crystal phase, so the weight loss was very small. From the DTG curve we observed six peaks of mass loss. The ﬁrst broad peak occurred at 50–360 °C and was a slow endothermic process due to the decomposition of the adsorbed water in the sample. The second peak on the DSC curve was about 402 °C. It was caused by the de-composition of organic matter in the precursor powder. As the temperature gradually increases, there was one at 463, 550, 640, and 685 °C. The endothermic peak was a process in which the orthorhombic phase of the orthorhombic LiTiOPO4 was gradually converted into a trigonal Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 phase.Fig. 2(a) shows an FE-SEM image of the LATP-pre powder obtained following its recovery after hydrothermal synthesis. It can be clearly observed from the micrograph that LATP-pre takes the form of irre-gular, approximately rectangular plates in the nanometer regime, where the edge of each plate is approximately 80–130 nm in size. In turn, each plate is composed of smaller nanoparticles which can be just discerned from the image at the magniﬁcation of 9000X. Fig. 2(b–e) present the EDS mapping for each of the elements except Li from the image shown in Fig. 2(a). The distribution of each element across ag-glomerations of plates was uniform and homogeneous.
The XRD patterns of the LATP-pre precursor after calcination at diﬀerent temperatures (from 500 to 900 °C for 3 h) are shown in Fig. 3(a). The main peaks in the XRD patterns of LATP-500, LATP-600 and LATP-700 could be indexed as LiTiOPO4 (ICSD#39534). As the temperature increases, the phase composition gradually changes, such that at high sintering temperatures, (LATP-800 and LATP-900,) the main peaks in the diﬀraction patterns could be indexed as the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 NASICON-type structure (ICSD#257190) in rhombohedral space group of R3̅c.The eﬀect of temperature on the phase composition of the LATP sample was investigated further by analyzing the diﬀraction data by Rietveld reﬁnement. Table S1 lists the phase compositions of the var-ious LATP samples after Rietveld reﬁnement analysis. These phase composition data are plotted in Fig. 3(b). As the powder calcination temperature increases, orthorhombic LiTiOPO4 is gradually trans-formed into the rhombohedral Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 NASICON-type phase and once a powder calcination temperature of 800 °C was reached, the content of the LiTiOPO4 phase dropped from the value of 90.2 wt% observed at the lowest calcination temperature (500 °C) to 14 wt%. On increasing the powder calcination temperature further to 900 °C, there was no further trace of the LiTiOPO4 phase and the content of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 reaches a maximum (of 81 wt%).The total impedance was obtained by ﬁtting the respective semi-circles from spectra using an equivalent circuit model as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. In the ﬁtted circuit, Rb was interpreted as the circuit resistance external to the specimen, which originated from the intercept of the semicircle with the Z’ axis in the high frequency region and was taken as representing the bulk resistance. Rgb was deﬁned as the grain boundary resistance.Each of the calcined powders except LATP-1000 was pelletized and sintered at 900 °C for 3 h. These are hereafter denoted LATP-500–900, LATP-600–900, LATP-700–900, LATP-800–900 andLATP-900–900. The bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities of all samples sin-tered at 900 °C for 3h are listed in Table 1. As the calcination tem-perature (i.e. pre-sintering treatment temperature) increases, the im-pedance notably decreases. Consequently, LATP-900–900 exhibited the highest total ionic conductivity (σtotal) and relative density of 5.72*10−5 Scm−1 and 94.10%, respectively, at room temperature.Fig. 5(a)-(e) displays SEM images of samples of the LATP-500, LATP-600, LATP-700, LATP-800 and LATP-900 powders. The grain size was about 110–162 nm, 71–78 nm, 95–160 nm, 230–370 nm, 150–225 nm. Although there is not a clear trend of increasing particle size with calcining temperature, it is evident from the SEM images that at lower calcining temperatures the samples were composed of particles that were more three-dimensional and less anisoptropic in nature. At 500 °C, for example, the irregular cuboid crystallites are stacked rather ineﬃciently, leaving relatively large interparticle voids and creating a macroporous microstructure. As the calcination temperature is raised, the particles themselves become more two-dimensional, anisotropic and plate-like. Further, the platelets agglomerate such that the inter-particle porosity progressively decreases. By 900 °C, the density of the material has visibly increased in the SEM images. Fig. 5(f) shows the EDS spectrum from LATP-900. The experimental values measured for LATP-900 are very close to the theoretical values and consistent with the ratios of starting materials used to make the desired LATP product. Combined, from the results of EDS elemental mapping, area scans and point scans, one can infer from the uniform distribution of elements in the correct stoichiometric ratio, that the samples consist of agglomer-ated particles of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3.After conﬁrming that 900 °C was the preferred calcination tem-perature for the powders (i.e. that the LATP-900–900 sample was the best of the sintered samples), further studies were pursued to explore the eﬀect of the sintering temperature (i.e. second heat treatment temperature) on the microstructure and transport properties of the LATP samples. The LATP-900 powder was pelletized and sintered at 900 °C, 1000 °C, 1100 °C, 1200 °C and 1300 °C for 3 h (and will be referred to as: LATP-900–900, LATP-900–1000, LATP-900–1100, LATP-900–1200 andLATP-900–1300 respectively). The sample sin-tered at 1300 °C, however, was discarded as the sintering temperature had evidently exceeded the melting point of the material.Fig. 6(a) compiles the Nyquist plots from the AC impedance analysis of all the LATP pellets measured at 25 °C and the bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities of all samples are displayed in Table 2. Results demonstrate that as the sintering temperature is increased so the total Li-ion conductivity increases until a maximum of 2.70 × 10−4 Scm−1 is reached at a sintering temperature of 1100 °C (LATP-900–1100). Similarly, the grain boundary resistance decreases over the same tem-perature range and LATP-900–1100 has the maximum grain boundary conductivity (4.59 × 10−4 Scm−1) Both the grain boundary con-ductivity and total conductivity decrease (to 3.32 × 10−4 Scm−1 and 2.24 × 10−4 Scm−1, respectively) in the sample sintered at 1200 °C (LATP-900–1200). Tellingly, these results follow a close correlation with the phase composition data obtained from Rietveld reﬁnements against XRD data taken for the high temperature sintered samples (Table 3). LATP-900–1100 was found to contain more of the desired rhombohedral fast-ion conducting Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 phase than LATP-900–1200, which conversely contained more impurities. In fact, the major diﬀerence between the two samples in this respect is the proliferation of AlPO4 at higher temperature. It is reasonable to assume that despite the improved bulk transport of Li+ in the LATP phase, the increased presence of the phosphate at the LATP grain boundaries is suﬃcient to block the diﬀusion of lithium ions, reducing not only the grain boundary conductivity but also the magnitude of the total con-ductivity. Hence any densiﬁcation beneﬁts apparently imparted by AlPO4 are rendered counter-productive by the increased grain boundary resistance.
Fig. 6(b) shows the temperature dependence of the conductivity for the high temperature sintered pellets LATP-900-900 – LATP-900-1200 from 25 to 125 °C. From the resulting Arrhenius plot, the data de-monstrate that, the conductivity of all the samples increases with temperature as one would expect and that across the measured tem-perature range the conductivity improves as the sintering temperature increases.Fig. 7 collates the FE-SEM micrographs for the high temperature sintered samples (excluding LATP-900–1300). The microstructure not only does the size of the individual LATP particles tend to increase with elevated sintering temperature, but also as these particles fuse together, so the density once again increases and the macropores that remain following calcination diminish in number still further.Fig. 8(a) shows several discharging curves of the NMC-MCMB solid pouch cell between 2.8 and 4.25V. All the testing procedures were charged with the constant current (CC) protocol at a rate of 0.5C and discharged at diﬀerent rates, i.e.: 0.5C, 1C, 1.5C, 2C and 2.5C. The capacity values under various C-rates is summarized in Fig. 8(b). The discharge capacity of the cell was 26.5 mAh, 24.9 mAh, and 22.9 mAh at 0.5-, 1- and 1.5-C-rates, respectively. The capacity retention ratio of 1.5C-discharging to 0.5C-discharging is 86%, indicating a stable ionic conductivity under small to medium c-rates. However, the capacity decreased rapidly with the C-rate over 1.5C and was 43% capacity re-main (comparing to 0.5C) at the rate of 2.5C. Obvious capacity de-creasing with an increasing discharge C-rate may be explained in terms of the electrochemical polarization due to the increased IR drop. Inset in Fig. 8(b) display cross-sectional SEM image of electrode on cathode side. As shown in this picture, the thickness of LATP layer on the top of NCM was ~100 μm. NCM cathode layer is in between LATP layer and Al foil with a thickness of ~70 μm. Fig. 8(c) shows the plot of charging-discharging capacity as a function of the cycle number for the NMC-MCMB solid pouch cell during a long-term cycling test between 2.8 and 4.25V. The inset in Fig. 8(c) displays a scheme of the pouch cell in the size of 40 mm*50 mm to light LED lamp. Identically, the capacity decay of 1st to 100th cycle was only 7%, but the capacity decreasing of 100th to 200th cycle and 200th to 300th cycle was 10% and 13%, respec-tively. The ﬁnal capacity at 360th cycle was 16.7mAh, which was 63.2% of the ﬁrst cycle. The 0.5C discharging curves show similar voltage plateau from 1st to 100th cycle but obvious decay of working voltage from 100th to 300th cycle as demonstrated in Fig. 8(d). Fig. 9 displays the cross-sectional SEM image of electrode after 350 cycles. From the observation of SEM image of electrode after cycling tests, the structure of NCM and LATP were integrated and the interface between NCM and LATP was still very clear, which was similar to that of fresh electrode shown in the inset in Fig. 8(b). The result further conﬁrmed the outstanding cycle performance of as-assembled NCM-LATP/MCMB pouch cell.
In summary, through the discussion of two-stage sintering. The good contact between the grains and the lower amorphous content of the second phase between the grain boundaries are the key in obtaining high lithium-ion conductivity. The activation energy of LATP-900-1100 °C is 0.17 eV, and the relative density is 99.07%. Its grain con-ductivity, grain boundary conductivity and total lithium-ion con-ductivity are 6.57*10−4, 4.59*10−4, 2.70*10−4 Scm−1, respectively. Moreover, we developed a coating method for assembling NCM-LATP/AG pouch cell. The NCM-LATP/AG pouch cell exhibited a high re-versible capacity of 16.7 mAh at 0.5C after 360 cycles with 63.2% ca-pacity retention. The obtained results indicated that LATP is a potential solid electrolyte material could be applied to lithium ion batteries.
