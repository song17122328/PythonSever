Dual-emitting and thermochromic Eu2+, Mn2+ co-doped Na3Sc2P3O12 (NSPO) phosphor was synthesized by a modified solid-state method. Its crystal structure and luminescent properties, especially temperature-dependent fluorescence properties are discussed in detail. Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ simultaneously exhibits two broad bands under single UV excitation, i.e. Eu2+ blue emission band centered at 460 nm and Mn2+ red emission band centered at 600 nm with quantum efficiency of >90%. The dual emissions in Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ have different thermal responses due to the competition between trap-to-activator energy transfer and thermal quenching, by which a novel self-referencing non-invasion optical thermometer with high sensitivity and superior signal discriminability was designed. The temperature sensing properties of Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ in a wide range of 293–473 K were analyzed, which shows good linear relationship between ratiometric intensity and temperature (R2 > 0.999) as well as high sensitivity (1.556% K−1). Besides, the emitting color is highly sensitive to the temperature variation. The results suggest that Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ could be a good candidate high-sensitive for optical thermometry and safety sign in high temperature environment.

In recent years, researches on optical thermometry using the fluorescence intensity ratio (FIR) technique have received great interest [1], [2], which could not only circumvent the shortages of conventional contact thermometers (i.e., low resolution and long response time) but also can realize non-invasion detection and monitor the temperature distribution of micro-systems and bio-organs. Up to dates, most of the FIR optical thermometers are based on temperature-triggered inverse electron population in thermal coupled levels of rare-earth (RE) and transition metal (TM) ions, such as Er3+ (2H11/2, 4S3/2), Tm3+ (3F3, 1G4) and Eu3+ (5D0, 5D1) [3], [4]. However, these kinds of temperature probes usually suffer from low accuracy and low signal discriminability, due to the overlapped emissions induced by the small energy gap (200 cm−1 < ΔE < 2000 cm−1) between the thermally coupled levels [5]. In order to avoid the above intrinsic limitations, a novel optical thermometry strategy, which rely on the phonon assisted energy transfer between sensitizer and activator along with their various thermal behaviors, have been extensively investigated. The ratiometric optical thermometers based on phonon assisted energy transfer strategy, such as LaOBr: Ce3+, Tb3+ [6], [7], LuVO4: Bi3+, Eu3+ [8] and β-NaY0.8Gd0.2F4: Ce3+/X3+ (X = Eu, Tb and Dy) [9], exhibit high sensitivity and superior signal discriminability.

It is well known that choosing a proper host is of vital to make luminescent materials with superior luminescent properties. NASICON (sodium ion conductor), which has a three-dimensional framework structure and possesses a high Na ionic conductivity, is one of the most efficient and best known classes of fast-ion conductors [10], [11]. Although NASICON systems have been widely studied, most of the research attentions are focused on their ionic conductivity, while the luminescent property is not a popular topic in the past. In 2017, Im et al. developed a novel phosphor, the Eu2+-doped NASICON phosphate Na3Sc2P3O12, which shows an extraordinary thermal stability of the emission intensity [12]. When sensitizer-activator pair is incorporated in NASICON host, the phonon-assisted energy transfer could occur and dual-emission might exhibit different thermal dependencies. Thus, novel high-performance optical temperature sensors are expected. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, the study on the optical thermometric behaviors of RE/TM ions co-doped NASICON is lacked.

In this study, a high-efficient and thermochromic NASICON-structure phosphor, Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+, is constructed by a modified solid-state method, and the corresponding phase structure and PL properties are discussed in detail. It is found that Eu2+ blue emission is continuously enhanced as the temperature increase, while Mn2+ red emission declines generally, in which FIR value of Eu2+/Mn2+ exhibits a good linear relationship with temperature. Thus, it shows an interesting thermochromic phenomenon that the emitting color varies from red (293 K) to purple (473 K). Ultimately, the optical thermometry properties of the resultant compounds were systemically studied by analyzing the different temperature responses of Eu2+ and Mn2+ emission.

NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ samples with composition of Na3-xSc2-yP3O12: xEu2+, yMn2+ (x = 0.03, y = 0 ∼ 0.12) were prepared by a modified solid-state method. Na2CO3 (AR), Sc2O3 (AR), NH4H2PO4 (AR), Eu2O3 (99.99%) and MnCO3 (AR) are used as raw materials. In a typical synthesis, the raw materials with stoichiometric amounts were mixed thoroughly with alcohol (∼20 ml) and ground for 30 min in an agate mortar. The pasty mixtures were dried at 160 °C for 5 h and ground into powder. The obtained precursors were calcined in a tube furnace at 1100 °C for 5 h under a reductive atmosphere (5% H2 + 95% N2), and then cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, the as-synthesized samples were ground to powders for subsequent analyses.

X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were collected by a Rigaku D/max-II B X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The data for Rietveld structure refinement were collected by the same equipment with scanning speed of 1° per minute in the 2θ range from 10° to 120°. The Rietveld structure refinements were performed by using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software. The determination of dopant concentration was carried out by using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (PerkinElmer NexION 350X, USA) with high-purity argon (99.999%, Guangzhou Inlygas Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China). Details of the instrumentation and operation conditions are given in Table S1. Sample digestion and acid evaporation were performed by a BHW-09C acid-driven processor (Botonyc Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Electronic analytical balance was employed to measure the sample mass (0.1 mg precision, BS423S, Beijing Sartorius Instrument Systems Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, temperature-dependent PL spectra and decay curves were measured on an Edinburgh FLS980 Fluorescence Spectrometer combined Fluorescence Lifetime and Steady State Spectrometer equipped with 450 W xenon lamp, nanosecond flash lamp and μF lamp. The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) were obtained on HITACHI F7000 spectrometer with excitation wavelength of 340 nm. All measurements were carried out at room temperature except the temperature dependent PL spectra. UK. The thermoluminescence (TL) curves were measured with a SL08 TL meter (Guangzhou Yili electronic technology Ltd, China) in the range of 30–400 °C with heating rate of 1 °C/s. The samples were exposed to the radiation from UV light (365 nm) for 10 min before measurement, the weight of the measured samples was constant (2 mg).

The phase purity of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ samples were identified by XRD, and the patterns of samples (y = 0 ∼ 0.09) are shown in Fig. S1. All the diffraction peaks were well-matched with that of standard card (ICSD 65407, Na3Sc2P3O12), indicating all samples are single-phased without impurity and Eu2+/Mn2+ doping cannot induce significant changes of the crystal structure. As seen in the magnified diagram of Fig. S1, the XRD peaks shift to lower angle with increasing Mn2+ content, which indicates the occurrence of host cell expansion. It is reasonable since Mn2+ is expected to occupy Sc3+ sites, where the ionic radius of Mn2+ (0.83 Å for 6-coordinated) is larger than that of Sc3+ (0.75 Å for 6-coordinated).

The crystal structure of Na3Sc2P3O12 in a trigonal system with space group R3c(167) of the unit cell is represented in Fig. 1a. The corresponding cell parameters are a = b = 8.927 Å, c = 22.276 Å, V = 1537.37 Å and Z = 6. In the unit cell of Na3Sc2P3O12, there are two Na crystallographic sites and one Sc site, which are all coordinated with oxygen atoms and the corresponding coordinated number is 6, 8 and 6, respectively. Typically, dopant ions are expected to occupy the cation sites with similar effective ionic radius and valence. Thus, in view of ionic radius and valence, Eu2+ ions (1.17 Å for 6-coordinated and 1.25 Å for 8-coordinated) will preferably occupy the Na+ sites (1.02 Å for 6-coordinated and 1.18 Å for 8-coordinated), while Mn2+ (0.83 Å for 6-coordinated) tend to occupy Sc3+ site (0.75 Å for 6-coordinated) [13].

The site occupancy of Eu2+ and Mn2+ in Na3Sc2P3O12 was investigated by Rietveld refinement. The refinement result of the representative Na3Sc2P3O12: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ sample is shown in Fig. 1b. It should be noted that the refinement for Na3Sc2P3O12: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ is based on the structure of Na3Sc2P3O12 (ICSD 65407). Fig. 1b suggests that there is no impurity but only Na3Sc2P3O12 phase existing. Crystallographic data, refinement parameters, and occupancy are shown in Table 1. The reliability parameters of refinement are Rwp = 8.36%, Rp = 5.84%, GOF = 2.39, which can verify the phase purity of the as-prepared sample. The refinement result suggested that Eu2+ ions are mainly entered into the Na+ site, while Mn2+ prefer to occupy the Sc3+ site.

The actual concentrations of Eu2+ and Mn2+ ions in NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphors were checked via ICP-MS experiment as shown in Table 2. Quantitative analysis of the obtained phosphor by ICP-MS shows that actual Eu2+ doping concentrations are almost constant (∼0.03) for all tested samples NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ (y = 0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09), while the corresponding actual Mn2+ concentrations are determined to be 0.0095, 0.0255, 0.0502, 0.0655 and 0.0921, which shows the similar increasing tendency with increasing Mn2+ amount of precursor.

The PL and PLE spectra of representative NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ samples (y = 0 and 0.07) are shown in Fig. 2. NSPO: 0.03Eu2+ phosphor exhibits an intense blue emission band at 460 nm under UV excitation, and the corresponding PLE spectrum consists of a broad absorption band at 340 nm with shoulder at 280 nm (Fig. 2a). The excitation spectra of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+ phosphor monitoring different emission wavelength are shown in Fig. S2a, in which the spectral shape are similar with each other. The decay lifetimes under 320 nm laser while monitoring different emission wavelength are demonstrated in Fig. S2b, where no obvious change is observed. As reported by Im.et al., density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that energetically the most favourable site for Eu2+ in both polymorphs of Na3Sc2P3O12 is the eight-coordinated (NaO8) Na site. Another possible explanation is the similarity of the crystal-field environments even though the coordination environment of the occupied crystallographic sites differs [14].

Mn2+-doped Na3Sc2P3O12 exhibits a series of weak absorption peaks due to 3d-3d transitions, and a weak red emission band at ∼600 nm of 4T1(4G) → 6A1(6S) transition. The absorption efficiency of Na3Sc2P3O12: Mn2+ is quite low because 3d-3d transitions are spin-forbidden ones. Besides, the PLE spectrum of Na3Sc2P3O12: Mn2+ has a great overlap with the PL band of of Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the reason of efficient Mn2+ red emission in of Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ could be ascribed to be Eu2+ → Mn2+ energy transfer. When co-doped with Mn2+, the PL spectra of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ shows a blue emission at 460 nm and a red emission at 605 nm, which could be ascribed to the 5d-4f transition of Eu2+ and 3d-3d transition of Mn2+, respectively. The strong red emission of Mn2+ under Eu2+ 340 nm excitation indicates that the Mn2+ ion can be sensitized by Eu2+ ion in Na3Sc2P3O12 host. Fig. 2b shows the PLE spectra of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ monitored at 460 and 605 nm emission, whose profiles are alike and mainly origin from the transition of Eu2+. Thus, the existence of efficient Eu2+ → Mn2+ energy transfer could be confirmed.

The PL spectra of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ with varied Mn2+ concentration are shown in Fig. 3a. All emission bands exhibit two broad bands, i.e. Eu2+ blue emission band centered at 460 nm and Mn2+ red emission band centered at 605 nm. Eu2+ blue emission exhibits a continually decrease, at the same time there is a obvious increase in Mn2+ red emission intensity, which reaches its maximum at x = 0.07, then declines slightly beyond this value, which is aroused by the concentration quenching effect. When Mn2+ concentration is above the critical concentration (>0.07), concentration quenching occurs due to the fact that the non-radiative relaxation on killer centers might be dominant rather than radiative transitions, which could provide an extra decay channel for absorbed energy, resulting in the decrease of emission intensity. Both Eu2+ and Mn2+ emission peak wavelengths show no shift with varied Mn2+ concentration, which indicates that Mn2+ co-doped have no obvious effect on Eu2+/Mn2+ site-occupancy. The emission spectra under different excitation wavelength are shown in Fig. S3. Although the variation of Eu2+/Mn2+ emission intensity is obvious, both the peak position and the shape of emission spectrum are independent of excitation wavelength or Mn2+ concentration, which confirm that the activator ions (Mn2+) occupy only one type of equivalent positions in the host lattice. Similar phenomena could be found in Refs. [15], [16], [17].

where Iso and Is is the intensity of the sensitizer (Eu2+) in the absence and presence of the activator (Mn2+), respectively. The variation of ηET depending on the Mn2+ content is shown in Fig. 3a inset. It is found that ηET value keeps rising with increasing Mn2+ content, and reaches to ∼80% at y = 0.12, while Mn2+ emission intensity reaches its maximum at y = 0.07 (ηET = ∼60%). The non-radiative relaxation of excited energy in Mn2+ by Mn2+-Mn2+ internal concentration quenching process is increasing with decreasing intra-Mn2+ distance, which becomes dominant when y > 0.07 and eventually quenches the transferred energy from Eu2+. Similar phenomena could be found in Ca2Sr(PO4)2: Ce3+, Mn2+ [19], Ca2.5Sr0.5Al2O6: Ce3+, Mn2+ [20] and NaCaBO3: Ce3+, Tb3+, Mn2+ [21].

To further shed light on the ET process, the sensitizer (Eu2+) decay lifetimes in NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ are measured in Fig. S4a. The Eu2+ decay curve of 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ samples can be well fitted with a bi-exponential decay equation as:I0 and I(t) stands for initial emission intensity and emission intensity at time t; τ1 and τ2 stands for fast and slow lifetime components; A1 and A2 stands for different constants. Thus, the effective decay time τ* could be obtained by:

The effective decay times (τ*) are calculated to be 394.67, 392.36, 390.69, 389.79, 379.25, 364.27, 358.28, 354.35 and 348.80 ns for y = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09 and 0.12, respectively. The decay lifetimes of the Eu2+ decrease monotonically with rising Mn2+ doping concentration. The decrease of Eu2+ lifetime is due to the introduction of extra decay pathway, in which the excited energy of Eu2+ is transferred to Mn2+, efficiently competing with the spontaneous emission of Eu2+. As a comparison, the activator (Mn2+) decay lifetimes are also measured by monitoring its 605 nm emission at 340 nm excitation (Fig. S4b). All the decay curves can be well fitted by single exponential function, and effective lifetimes vary from 10.70 ms (y = 0.005) to 12.71 ms (y = 0.02), meeting a maximum of 16.89 ms when Mn2+ content reaches 0.07, then slowly decrease to 11.00 ms at y = 0.12. In summary, the lifetime of Mn2+ is influenced by both ET processes of Eu2+-Mn2+ (trend to lengthen the lifetime) and Mn2+-Mn2+ (trend to reduce the lifetime). The Eu2+-Mn2+ ET dominates before y = 0.07. After that, the Mn2+-Mn2+ ET leads the decay result and reduces the lifetime. These results indicate that an energy transfer from the excited levels of Eu2+ to the 3d-band of Mn2+ results in stabilization of Mn2+ emission decay and enhancement of Mn2+ emission intensity.

Fig. 3b demonstrate the CIE coordinate diagram and digital photographs of the prepared samples With the content of Mn2+ increasing from 0 to 0.12, the CIE coordinates of the samples varied from (0.145, 0.095) to (0.545, 0.361) and the emission colors changed from blue to purple and then to red. Quantum yield is an important parameter to evaluate the performance of phosphor. The quantum efficiency (IQE) of as-prepared samples could be obtained as [22]:in which ES stands for the spectrum of light used for exciting the phosphor, LS represents the emission spectrum of the phosphor, and ER is the spectrum of excitation light without phosphor in sphere. Detailed results of QE measurement are shown in Fig. S5. The quantum efficiency values of the phosphors at 340 nm excitation are listed in Table 3. It could be observed that the co-doping of Mn2+ can improve the QE value of phosphor, which may due to the effective sensitization of Eu2+, i.e. excitation energy is transferred to Mn2+ and result in Mn2+ sensitized emission rather than quenches in a nonradiative way. However, the further increment of Mn2+ content can cause the concentration quenching of Mn2+ and result in a decrement of quantum efficiency. The IQE value of optimal-composition NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ sample is 98.15%, which is one of the highest QE value in Mn2+-activated phosphors ever reported.

Temperature has significant effect on the luminescent properties of phosphors. Phosphors generally suffer emission loss with increasing temperature, owing to the non-radiative relaxation of excited electrons to the ground state of the activator ions, whose probability rises along with temperature [23], [24]. The serious emission loss at high temperatures due to thermal quenching is one of the greatest challenges that limit the application of phosphors. Trap levels have been used as energy storage sites in after-glow materials for decades [25], [26]. Nowadays, thermal activated trap-to-activator energy transfer is found to be an effective strategy to offset the thermal quenching, and thus the emission intensity remains unchanged or even enhances with rising temperature. Thermal stable phosphors, such as KxCs1-xAlSi2O6: Eu2+ [27] and Na2CaGe6O14: Pr3+ [28], have been synthesized using this strategy. An efficient thermal activated trap-to-activator energy transfer requires both similarity in energy and close proximity between electron-hole pairs and activator excited states. The competition between trap-to-activator energy transfer and thermal quenching could lead to different temperature-dependent emission response for different emission, which could be used for ratiometric and colormetric temperature sensing.

The temperature-dependent photoluminescence properties of NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphor were investigated both in terms of intensity and lifetime. The temperature-dependent PL spectra of single-doped NSPO: 0.03Eu2+ and co-doped NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ phosphors are represented in Fig. 4a and b. As reported by Im et al and Wang et al, NSPO: 0.03Eu2+ blue phosphor does not exhibit thermal quenching even up to 473 K, which is due to non-equivalence replacement of Eu2+ ions for Na+ ions causing defects, inducing the abnormal thermal quenching behavior [12]. Similar phenomena is found in Fig. 4a, i.e. the shape and the peak position of Eu2+ emission spectra are almost unchanged with increasing temperature, while its integrated intensity generally rises to its maximum (165% of RT intensity) at 433 K and remains at 150% of RT intensity at 473 K. As seen in Fig. 4b, Eu2+ blue emission and Mn2+ red emission in NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ phosphor exhibits different temperature dependencies. Eu2+ blue emission keeps zero emission loss as the temperature ascends, and it reaches 125% of RT intensity at 473 K. Meanwhile, Mn2+ red emission decreases continuously with the rise of temperature and shows an emission loss of 46% at 473 K.

When doping ions are introduced, especially in the case of non-equivalent replacement, cation vacancies would be generated easily. As a result, there could exist plenty of traps capturing some electrons or holes in the host [29]. The induced available traps are employed to trap carriers effectively, which inhibits energy loss in the form of phonons as a non-radiative process [30]. When the energy and distribution of traps are appropriate, they would affect temperature-dependent PL spectra of phosphors. Schematic illustration of the mechanism for different Eu2+/Mn2+ thermal-quenching tendency is shown in Fig. 4c. The absorption event at the trap sites occurs by the filling of traps with electrons under UV excitation and simultaneous generation of holes at the valence band (VB). By thermal activation (Fig. 4c (1)), the trapped electrons jump out from traps levels and subsequently recombine with holes. Due to the similarity in energy and close proximity between electron-hole pairs and Eu2+ 5d excited states, an efficient energy transfer to Eu2+ excited states occurs (Fig. 4c (2)), which provides Eu2+ an additional excitation energy as well as an enhanced blue emission (Fig. 4c (4)) at high temperature and counteract the thermal quenching effect (Fig. 4c (5)). When co-doped with Mn2+, the energy transfer process from Eu2+ to Mn2+ (Fig. 4c (3)) results in a strong sensitized Mn2+ red emission (Fig. 4c (6)). However, the energy difference between defect levels and Mn2+ 3d excited states is too great to result in an efficient energy transfer. Therefore, the non-radiative relaxation through the crossing intersection of Mn2+ excited state and ground state (Fig. 4c (7)) dominates at high temperature, and an obvious thermal quenching of Mn2+ red emission is expected.

In order to confirm the above-mentioned possible mechanism, temperature-dependent Eu2+ and Mn2+ decay lifetimes of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ phosphor are measured and shown in Fig. 5. The decay time of Eu2+ increases from 380.81 ns at 293 K to 388.86 ns, 391.51 ns and 388.41 ns at 333 K, 373 K and 473 K, respectively, indicating an energy transfer process occurring from the trap levels to the 5d excited state of Eu2+ with increasing temperature, which results in prolong lifetime of Eu2+ emission. Meanwhile, Mn2+ decay lifetime exhibits a declining tendency with increasing temperature, i.e. 16.83 ms at 293 K, 13.83 ms at 373 K and 6.68 ms at 473 K. The decline of Mn2+ decay lifetime indicates that the non-radiative relaxation is dominant at high temperature and result in obvious thermal quenching of Mn2+ red emission.

The thermoluminescence (TL) curves of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, NSPO: 0.07Mn2+, NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ and NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.07Mn2+ have been measured and shown in Fig. 6. The TL spectrum of NSPO: Eu2+ shows a band peaking at 180 °C, while that of NSPO: Mn2+ exhibits two distinct bands at 200 and 305 °C. As reported by Wang et al [31], an empirical law concerning the influences of dopants on traps properties can be proposed: the depth of traps can be tailored by dopants, and the dopants with larger Ionization energy (IE) can increase the density of deeper traps or make the present trap deeper and vice versa. The IE of Eu2+ (dopant) and Mn2+ (co-dopant) is reported to be 2404 KJ/mol and 3248 KJ/mol, respectively. It is reasonable to deduce that the co-dopant with larger IE would increase the density and depth of the deep traps corresponding to the TL bands in a higher temperature region. Too large IE may result in too deep depth of traps, and probably the carriers stored in traps can not be promoted even by high temperature. When co-doping Mn2+ with Eu2+, the TL spectra of NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ exhibits an asymmetric peak with a shoulder, which could be fitting with two Gaussian bands at 195 and 240 °C.

Both Eu2+ occupation of Na+ sites and Mn2+ occupation of Sc3+ sites are non-equivalence replacements. The former could generate negatively-charged Na vacancies (), and the latter would form positively-charged oxygen vacancies ().

These  vacancies localize to the vicinity of Eu2+ ions with increasing temperature, forming a -Eu2+- defect cluster that serves as the electron-trapping centre. The number of these traps increases with rising temperature. These traps assist in the energy transfer from defect levels to the Eu2+ 5d-band that could explain the self-healing property of Eu2+ emission with increasing temperature.

However, such situation mentioned above could not applied in the case of oxygen vacancies formed by Mn2+ doping. Both Mn2+ ions and oxygen vacancies () are positively charged. The electrostatic repulsion between them prohibit the formation of defect cluster. Besides, oxygen vacancies could not serve as the electron-trapping centre, which could store the excited energy and lease it at high temperature to compensate the thermal-quenching effect. It is more likely that oxygen vacancy might act as energy killer site. When temperature rises, the fraction of Mn2+ excited energy that migrated to killer sites increases, leading to the luminescence quenching.

In order to realize a ratiometric and colormetric thermometer using the different temperature response of Eu2+ and Mn2+ emission, the NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ phosphor is chosen as a representative, and the corresponding temperature-dependent PL spectra were investigated (Fig. 7a). With increasing temperature from 293 K to 473 K, the intensity of Eu2+ blue emission band generally increase, while the intensity of Mn2+ red emission band substantially decreases, which is similar with the tendencies of other NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ samples shown in Fig. 4. The CIE chromaticity coordinates of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ at different temperature are calculated and shown in Fig. 7b. The CIE coordinates are (0.468, 0.308) at 293 K and (0.315, 0.231) at 473 K, i.e. the temperature-dependent emitting colors of NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ are systematically tuned from red to purple from 293 to 473 K, which can be observed directly by the naked eye or camera. This temperature-dependent emitting color behavior implies that the studied samples can also act as a safety sign in high-temperature environment.

with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99921, where I(Eu2+) and I(Mn2+) are the integrated intensity of Eu2+ (350–530 nm) and Mn2+ (530–800 nm) emission, respectively, T is the temperature of the NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ system (K). Actually, NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, yMn2+ phosphors with other Eu2+/Mn2+ ratios also exhibit good linear relationship between FIR and temperature, i.e. R2 = 0.9981, 0.9975, 0.9985 and 0.9990 for y = 0.005, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.07 sample, respectively (Fig. S6). One could observe the Mn2+ emission wavelength blue-shifts with rising temperature, which could be attributed to thermally activated phonon-assisted excitation from lower excited levels to higher ones in Mn2+ [32], [33]. To further evaluate the reversibility of the NSPO: 0.03Eu2+, 0.01Mn2+ thermometer, the temperature-dependent emissions were conducted between 293 K and 473 K for three cycles. The emission intensities at different temperatures for each cycle are hardly changed, demonstrating its excellent reversibility.

The sensitivity is one of the key parameters for temperature sensors. In order to evaluate and compare different kinds of thermometers, the relative sensitivity is usually utilized and defined as [34]:where P is the measured temperature-sensitive parameter, such as intensity, lifetime, or intensity ratio. In case of ratiometric luminescent thermometry, the relative sensitivity can be determined as [35]:where I1 and I2 are the two luminescence intensities of the dual emission. Fig. 7d shows the relative sensitivity reaches it maximum of 1.556% K−1 at 473 K, which is much higher than many reported thermometers such as [Ln(ad)0.5(phth)(H2O)2] (1.21% K−1) [36], C-QDs@UiO-66-(COOH)2 (1.3% K−1) [37] and BaZrO3: Er3+/Yb3+ (1.39% K−1) [3]. The high sensitivity is due to the enhanced Eu2+ blue emission and decreased Mn2+ red emission in NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ as discussed above.

In summary, a facile modified solid-state route was employed to synthesize Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ dual-emitting and thermochromic phosphor. Under 340 nm UV, the phosphor simultaneously shows both Eu2+ blue emission band centered at 460 nm and Mn2+ red emission band centered at 600 nm. The analysis of PL spectra and decay times confirm the occurrence of efficient energy transfer between Eu2+ and Mn2+. In NSPO: Eu2+, Mn2+ system, Eu2+ blue emission intensity is ascending promptly with the rise of temperature and reaches ∼150% of RT intensity at 473 K, while that of Mn2+ is generally descending, which results in a ratiometric and colormetric variation with changing temperature. The different responses of Eu2+ and Mn2+ emission with increasing temperature is probably due to the competition between thermal-activated energy compensation from trap level and non-radiative relaxation. By the fitting and calculating, a very good linear relationship between Eu2+/Mn2+ intensity ratio and temperature with maximum relative sensitivity 1.556% K−1 in the temperature range from 293 K to 473 K is obtained. With high quantum efficiency (∼98%), good linear relationship between FIR and temperature (R2 > 0.999), wide sensing range (293–473 K) as well as high sensitivity (1.556% K−1), Na3Sc2P3O12: Eu2+, Mn2+ could be a good candidate for high-sensitive optical thermometry and safety sign in high temperature environment.
