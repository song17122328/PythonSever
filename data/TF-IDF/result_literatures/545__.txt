NASICON-type materials with the compositions Na3V2– xAlx(PO4)3, Na3V2 - xFex(PO4)3, Na3 + xV2– xNix(PO4)3, and Na3V2 - xCrx(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1) have been prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the highest electrical conductivity among the samples studied is offered by the material doped with 5% Fe: Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3. The activation energy for low-temperature conduction in the doped materials decreases from 84 ± 2 to 54 ± 1 kJ/mol and that for high-temperature conduction is ~33 kJ/mol. The discharge capacity of Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C under typical working conditions of cathodes of sodium ion batteries has been shown to exceed that of Na3V2(PO4)3/C. The capacity of the more porous material prepared by the Pechini process (Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{II}) approaches the theoretical one at a low charge–discharge rate and retains its high level as the charge rate is raised (its discharge capacity was 117.6, 108.8, and 82.6 mAh/g at a discharge rate of 0.1C, 2C, and 8C, respectively).

Lithium ion batteries are widely used as power sources for a variety of electronic devices owing to their high capacity and efficiency [1–7]. However, lithium is not a widespread element and is nonuniformly distributed over the Earth’s crust, which limits its potential applications for completely meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy storage devices. Given that sodium is considerably more widespread, the use of sodium compounds instead of their lithium analogues is expected to help resolve this issue [8–13]. The capacity of sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is limited primarily by the capacity of the cathode materials used in them [14], which include a number of compounds, such as layered sodium iron oxides [15, 16], sulfates [17], fluorophosphates [18], pyrophosphates [19, 20], or phosphates [21–23], as well as sodium vanadium NASICON-type phosphates [24–36]. NASICON-type compounds constitute a large class of materials with the general formula AxB2(PO4)3, whereА = H, Li, Na, K, H3O, or NH4and B = In, Sc, Fe, V, Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, Ge, etc. [37, 38]. The alternating voids in their framework crystal structure ensure fast ion transport. In addition, their advantages include high chemical and thermal stability, low thermal expansion [39], and catalytic activity [40]. These compounds are thought of primarily as promising electrolytes with lithium ion, sodium ion, or proton conductivity [37, 38, 41–45]. The compounds containing polyvalent cations capable of changing their oxidation state (Ti, Fe, and V) can be used as electrode materials [46]. Among materials potentially attractive as cathode materials for SIBs, attention should be paid to the sodium vanadium phosphate Na3V2(PO4)3, which has a theoretical specific capacity of 117.6 mAh/g and a high and essentially constant charge/discharge potential of ~3.4 V vs. Na+/Na, corresponding to the V4+/V3+ transition, and offers good cycling stability and relatively low cost. This material has drawbacks of low electronic conductivity and insufficient ionic conductivity, which significantly limits its application where a fast charge and discharge are needed [25, 36, 47, 48]. At present, several main approaches are used to improve the electrical conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3: fabrication of composites with carbon [25–27], use of small particles [25, 36], and doping [29, 33, 35, 49, 50]. Partial substitution of cations similar in radius to V3+ on its site does not change the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 but has a significant effect on its electrochemical characteristics. For example, Li et al. [49] reported a substantial reduction in the rate of the decrease in capacity, accompanied by a rise in current density, for Na3V1.95Mg0.05(PO4)3 in comparison with the undoped material [49]. Lalére et al. [50] affirm that, in spite of some drop in discharge capacity, specific energy capacity increases from 396.3 Wh/kg for Na3V2(PO4)3 to 424.6 Wh/kg for Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3, owing to partial oxidation of V4+ to V5+ at a potential of ~3.95 V. Shen et al. [33] reported that doping with manganese cations improved the cyclability of materials. In particular, Na3V1.975Mn0.025(PO4)3 has discharge capacities of 96.5, 91.8, and 86.7 mAh/g at discharge currents of 5C, 10C, and 15C, respectively, and retains 95.9, 97.2, and 91.6% of the discharge capacity after 100 cycles at the respective rates, whereas even the initial discharge capacities of Na3V2(PO4)3 at these rates are 85.4, 52.6, and 30.4 mAh/g, respectively. At the same time, data on the effect of doping on the electrical conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 are not available in the literature. In this paper, we report the preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3-based materials doped with di- and trivalent cations and examine the effect of doping on their electrical conductivity and electrochemical characteristics.

The starting chemicals used for the sol–gel synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3V2– xAlx(PO4)3, Na3V2– xFex(PO4)3, Na3 + xV2– xNix(PO4)3, and Na3V2– xCrx(PO4)3 (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1) were NaNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich 99%), NH4H2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich 98%), NH4VO3(Sigma-Aldrich 99%), and Al(NO3)3⋅ 9H2O (SigmaAldrich 99%), Fe(NO3)3 ⋅ 9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich 99%), Ni(NO3)2⋅ 6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich 99%), or Cr(NO3)3⋅ 9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich 99%), respectively. Stoichiometric ratios of the starting reagents were dissolved in deionized water while heating and stirring. The solutions obtained by mixing the starting reagents were held at a temperature of 95°C for 2 h with constant stirring until homogeneous suspensions were obtained. The resultant suspensions were heat-treated at 300°C for 4 h in air in order to remove gaseous reaction products and prevent uncontrolled expansion of the sample during subsequent annealing. The resultant powder was thoroughly ground in a mortar, annealed at 600°C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere, and pressed into pellets 6 mm in diameter at a pressure of 500 MPa, which was applied for 5 min. The pellets were then sintered at 800°C for 10 h in an argon atmosphere. Carbon-containing composites were produced in a similar way, but after the first anneal at 300°C the powder was comminuted in a mortar, ground with sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) (50% of the weight of the powder), and placed in a furnace for two-step annealing: 5 h at 600°C and 5 h at 800°C in an argon atmosphere. In what follows, the sodium vanadium double phosphates prepared by the sol–gel method and the phosphate–carbon composites are denoted by the symbol {I} after their chemical formula: for example, Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{I}. Na3V2(PO4)3/C and Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C nanocomposites were also prepared by a modified Pechini process, using a technique described by Chekannikov et al. [36]. All of the chemical reagents used for this purpose were of analytical grade. V2O5, oxalic acid, NaNO3, NH4H2PO4, and citric acid were mixed in the molar ratio 1 : 6 : 3 : 3 : 2 and placed in a beaker containing water and ethylene glycol in the volume ratio 3 : 7. To obtain Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C, an appropriate amount of Fe(NO3)3⋅ 9H2O was added to the reaction mixture instead of vanadium oxide. Moreover, AgNO3(0.2 wt % of the intended weight of the phosphate being synthesized) was added to the solution of the starting reagents in order to improve the electrical conductivity of the composites owing to the presence of silver nanoparticles [36]. The mixture was heated (50–80°C) and stirred until all of the solid phase was dissolved. The solution was then heated to 300°C and held there for 2 h. The precipitate was ground in a planetary mill (800 rpm, 8 h) and annealed in an Ar atmosphere for 10 h at 600°C, then at 800°C for 2 h. The composites based on sodium vanadium double phosphates and carbon and prepared by the Pechini process are denoted by {II} after their chemical formula: for example, Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{II}. The phase composition of the samples thus prepared was determined by X-ray diffraction on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (CuKα radiation, angular range 2θ = 10°–60°). The crystallite size was assessed from X-ray diffraction line broadening using the Scherrer formula [51]: (1) where d is the crystallite size,λ is the X-ray wavelength used,θ is the diffraction angle, k = 0.9 is the Scherrer constant, B is the measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, and b is the FWHM of a line of a standard. As a standard for evaluating the instrumental broadening, we used LaB6 powder (Standard Reference Material 660a).

The geometric density of the sintered samples was evaluated as their weight divided by their volume, which was found from their geometric dimensions. The dimensions of preground samples were measured with a micrometer to an accuracy of ±0.01 mm. Their theoretical (X-ray) density was calculated by the formula (2) where M is the molecular mass per formula unit of the substance, Z is the number of formula units per unit cell, and V is the unit-cell volume. The density of the ceramics obtained was on average 60% of their X-ray density. Carbon in the composites was determined using a EuroEA 3000 CHNS analyzer. The microstructure of the samples was examined by scanning electron microscopy on a Carl Zeiss NVision 40 operated at an accelerating voltage of 1 kV and equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-Max X-ray detector. X-ray microanalysis was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Raman spectroscopy experiments were conducted on a DXRxi Raman imaging microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 532-nm laser beam was focused on the powder surface by a microscope lens with a 50× magnification (beam diameter, ~1μm). The laser power incident on the sample surface was set in the range 0.2–0.6 mW in order to avoid thermal breakdown of the cathode materials. For each sample, 50 acquisitions were made, each taking 0.5 s. Mössbauer effect measurements were performed on an MS-1104Em spectrometer, intended for measuring Mössbauer absorption spectra. The gamma source used was 57Co(Rh). The electrical conductivity of the samples was measured with an Elins Z-500-Pro impedance meter at ac (in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 500 kHz) and dc (voltage of 100 mV) in the temperature range 25–300°C at 10 to 20°C intervals using samples pressed into pellets ~6 mm in diameter and ~1–2 mm in thickness on a Carver Model #3912 hydraulic press. Fine silver powder was used to make electrodes. The electrical conductivity at each temperature was evaluated from the resistance found by extrapolating impedance spectra to the real axis. Electronic conductivity was determined by measuring the dc resistance. Electrical conductivity was calculated by the formula (3) where h (cm) is the thickness of the sample, S (cm2) is its cross-sectional area, and R (Ω) is its resistance. Electrode paste was prepared by mixing undoped or doped Na3V2(PO4)3/C as an active material (80%), conductive carbon black (Timcal, Belgium) (10%), and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder (Aldrich) ρ = 1.66 ,x MZ V ( )σ = 1 h R S (10%) dissolved in anhydrous N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Aldrich, 50 ppm H2O). The paste was spread as a thin layer on a stainless steel grid (current collector). The resultant electrode was pressed at 100 MPa and vacuum-dried at 120°C for 8 h. The amount of the active material on the electrode was 20 mg. Electrochemical tests were performed in hermetically sealed three-electrode cells containing a working electrode, auxiliary electrode (Na), and reference electrode (Na). The surface area of the working electrode was 2.25 cm2. The cells were set up in a glove box under a dry argon atmosphere containing about 10 ppm water. A polypropylene separator (NPO Ufim, Moscow, Russia) was placed between the electrodes. The electrolyte used was a 1 M NaPF6 solution in a 1 : 1 mixture of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate. According to Karl Fischer coulometric titration results, the water content of the electrolyte was within 15 ppm. The cells were electrochemically cycled at potentials in the range 2.7–3.8 V using a ZRU 50 mA–10 V charge–discharge system (OAO NTT Buster, Russia). The tests were conducted in galvanostatic mode at current densities from 11 to 880 mA/g. Specific capacities (mAh/g) were calculated per unit mass of the phosphate in the composite.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples prepared by the sol–gel process at 600 and 700°C contained a considerable number of reflections from impurity phases. The sodium vanadium phosphate samples obtained at a final annealing temperature of 800°C, as well as the phosphate–carbon composites, had a NASICONrelated rhombohedral structure (sp. gr. R c) and contained no impurity phases (Fig. 1). Because of this, the temperature 800°C was chosen as the final annealing temperature. The observed variation in unit-cell parameters with increasing dopant concentration leads us to conclude that the cations are incorporated into the Na3V2(PO4)3lattice to form solid solutions (Table 1). In the case of doping of Na3V2(PO4)3 with Al3+ and Cr3+ ions, which have smaller ionic radii in comparison with V3+ [52], there is a tendency for the unit-cell volume to decrease. Doping of Na3V2(PO4)3 with nickel and iron cations, which have larger ionic radii in comparison with V3+ [52], leads to an increase in the unit-cell parameter a and a decrease in c (Table 1). The decrease in the c parameter with an increase in the degree of aluminum and chromium substitution for vanadium is quite expectable. It is worth noting in this context that, whereas the a parameter of these materials decreases by 0.01–0.07%, their c parameter decreases by 0.13–0.20%. From this point of view, it is unexpected that doping with iron and nickel doubly charged ions also reduces the c parameter, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent: by 0.03–0.18%. At the same time, the increase in a parameter turns out to be more significant, reaching 0.08-0.16%. Owing to this, the unit-cell volume on the whole increases. Note that similar effects of different changes in a and c parameters are sufficiently characteristic of NASICON-type materials [53]. For example, HZr2(PO4)3⋅ H2O dehydration substantially reduces the cation size (Н3О+→ H+). This is accompanied by a sharp drop in c parameter and an increase in a parameter. At the same time, further heating increases the c parameter, as would be expected, whereas the a parameter and unit-cell volume on the whole decrease [53]. This is due to the reduction in the size of the voluminous voids of the M1 and C types in the structure due to rotation of structural polyhedra [54]. The fabrication of composites based on a cathode material and carbon increases the grain-boundary electrical conductivity of the material and prevents the sintering of particles during annealing, thereby help ing to obtain a finer particle material [25, 36, 55]. To reduce the particle size, the carbon-containing composites produced by both sol–gel synthesis and the Pechini process were annealed stepwise: first at 600°C and then at 800°C. As shown by Chekannikov et al. [36], this heat treatment schedule helps to obtain materials with a smaller particle size in comparison with single-step annealing at 800°C.

The carbon present in Na3 + xV2– x (PO4)3/C and Na3V2– x (PO4)3/C is X-ray amorphous. According to elemental analysis data, the carbon content of the composites produced by the sol–gel method was 11–14 wt % and that of the composites produced by the Pechini process was 8–9 wt %. In the case of the carbon-containing composites, we observed diffraction line broadening in their X-ray diffraction patterns. The crystallite size evaluated by formula (1) is 55 and 43 nm in Na3V2(PO4)3-{I} and Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{I}, respectively (Table 2). At the same time, micrographs of Na3V2(PO4)3C-{I} and the doped materials Na3 + xV2– x (PO4)3/C-{I} and Na3V2– x (PO4)3/C-{I} demonstrate the presence of agglomerates ranging in size up to several microns (Fig. 2a). The crystallite size of the Na3 + xV2– x(PO4)3-{II} and Na3V2– x (PO4)3-{II} synthesized by the Pechini process is ~40 nm according to X-ray diffraction data. SEM images of Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{II} and Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{II} also demonstrate larger particles in comparison with the calculated crystallite size. Note that the materials produced by the Pechini process have higher porosity (Fig. 2b) than do those produced by the sol–gel method (Fig. 2a). Thus, the use of the Pechini process makes it possible to obtain materials with a larger surface area owing to the formation of a polymer matrix that prevents particle growth during annealing and acts as a carbon source. The chemical composition of the synthesized materials was determined by X-ray microanalysis. The IIMx IIIMx IIMx IIIMx elements present in the composites were Na, V, P, O, C, and Al, Cr, Fe, or Ni. The Na : V : P : MII or Na : V : P : MIII atomic ratio corresponded to that in the starting mixture. According to the Raman spectroscopy results, the obtained carbon coatings consist predominantly of graphite (Fig. 3). The strong band centered at ~1595 cm–1 in their Raman spectra is attributable to the G band of single crystalline graphite (sp2-hybridized carbon), and the band at ~1350 cm–1 is attributable to the D band of polycrystalline graphite. In addition, there are two broad bands around 1200 and 1500 cm–1, which correspond to carbon groups differing in structure [50, 56–58]. The present Raman results lead us to conclude that the carbon coating consists predominantly of graphite and has high electrical conductivity [59, 60]. The percentage of carbon with high electrical conductivity in the materials produced by the Pechini process was found to exceed that in the materials prepared by the sol–gel method. The oxidation state of iron in the composition of the Na3V2– xFex(PO4)3 samples was determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy. The room-temperature Mössbauer spectra of the Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3 and Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C samples have the form of two doublets corresponding to the Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions (Fig. 4). The percentages of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3-{I} were determined to be 47 ± 1% and 53 ± 1%, respectively. The fractions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{I} were 61 ± 1% and 39 ± 1%, respectively. There are two possible charge compensation mechanisms in the structures under consideration, in which some of the V3+ ions are replaced by Fe2+. Some of the vanadium ions can be oxidized to V4+ or an additional number of Na+ ions can be accommodated in structural voids. Therefore, it is more appropriate to represent the chemical formula of the materials under consideration as Na3 +δV1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3.

In our electrical conductivity measurements, we used pressed pellets prepared from carbon-free polycrystalline samples. Impedance spectra of polycrystalline solid electrolytes with ionic conductivity typically consist of two sequential semicircles at high and intermediate frequencies, which correspond to the bulk resistance of their grains (Rb) and the grain boundary resistance (Rgb), and a straight line at low frequencies, which corresponds to the capacitance of the electrical double layer at the electrode/sample contacts [61–66]. From the abscissa intercept of the straight line, we determined the total resistance of the materials under investigation and calculated their electrical conductivity (σ). The impedance spectra of most of the materials under investigation are difficult to interpret because of their high resistance. Moreover, their electrical conductivity may be slightly overestimated due to water sorption on their surface. Because of this, their room-temperature elec- trical conductivity was evaluated by extrapolating temperature dependences of their conductivity to room temperature (Table 3). The ionic conductivity of our samples rises with increasing temperature and shows linear behavior in Arrhenius plots at low temperatures (Fig. 5). The ionic conductivity of the doped materials rises with increasing dopant concentration, except in the case of doping with chromium cations. In the low-temperature region (<180°C), the highest electrical conductivity is offered by the compounds doped with iron and nickel cations, whereas the conductivity of the Cr3+-doped compounds remains essentially unchanged (Table 3). When some of the V3+ ions in the structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 are replaced by nickel or iron divalent cations, charge compensation is ensured by the incorporation of additional sodium ions into interstitial sites, which leads to an increase in carrier concentration and a rise in the electrical conductivity of the samples [37, 38, 41, 42, 64]. In the case of doping with iron, there is also an increase in electronic conductiv ity, as evidenced by the reduction in dc resistance [67], but the ionic component of the total conductivity remains prevalent. Raising the temperature leads to a deviation of the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity from Arrhenius behavior. In the low-temperature region (below 180°C), the activation energy for electrical conduction is Em +ΔHd/2, where Em is the activation energy for defect migration andΔHd is the enthalpy of defect formation [66]. The increase in sodium cation mobility in the structure with increasing temperature entails a more uniform sodium distribution over the Na1 and Na2 sites. As a consequence, after reaching some threshold level the contribution ofΔHd to the activation energy for electrical conduction drops to near zero and the activation energy decreases in the high-temperature region (Table 3). In the case of the doped materials, the activation energies for conduction in the low-temperature region decrease because of the partial reduction in the contribution ofΔHd/2, whereas in the high-temperature region they remain essentially unchanged [68].

In our electrochemical tests, we used the following compositions: the undoped phosphate Na3V2(PO4)3 and the material doped with 5% iron cations, Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3, because it offered the highest ionic and electronic conductivities according to the impedance spectroscopy results. Electrochemical tests were performed for the composite materials based on the phosphates under investigation and carbon, which were prepared by the sol–gel method and its modification: Pechini process. Figure 6 shows typical charge–discharge curves of the samples under investigation during galvanostatic cycling at a current density of 11 mA/g, which corresponded to a 10-h discharge (current of 0.1C). Charge–discharge processes follow a two-phase mechanism, as evidenced by the presence of well-defined charge and discharge plateaus in the charge–discharge curves at ~3.4 V. The discharge capacities of Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{I} and Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{I} were determined to be 95 and 114 mAh/g, respectively, at a current density of 11 mA/g. In the case of the doped sample, we observe a decrease in the slope of the plateaus in the charge and discharge curves. The charge–discharge process in Na3V2(PO4)3 follows a heterogeneous-grain model [36]. The slope of the plateau is then determined by the increase in the resistance of the growing layer of the forming phase [69], as evidenced by the rise in the electrical conductivity of the doped material. It is worth noting that the difference between the charge and discharge potentials of Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{I} is smaller than that in the case of Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{I}, which points to lower energy losses during charge–discharge processes. At the same time, with increasing charge–discharge rate the capacity of the materials produced by the sol–gel method (Fig. 7, data points 1, 2) falls off rather rapidly. At a current density of 220 mA/g (2C), the discharge capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3-{I} and Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3-{I} was 52 and 56 mAh/g. It is worth noting that, if the discharge rate is again set at 0.1C, the capacity of the materials produced by the Pechini process returns to its original level; that is, cycling causes no degradation of the material. The capacity of the more porous materials prepared by the Pechini process [36] approaches the theoretical one at a low charge–discharge rate and retains its high level as the charge rate is raised (Fig. 7, data points 3, 4). In particular, the discharge capacity of Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{II} was 117.6, 108.8, and 82.6 mAh/g at a discharge rate of 0.1C, 2C, and 8C, respectively. Note that the discharge capacity of the Fe-doped material slightly exceeds that of Na3V2(PO4)3/C-{II}. Thus, doping with Fe has an advantageous effect on the electrochemical characteristics of the material under investigation owing to the increase in its electrical conductivity. At the same time, the effect of the particle size of the material on its electrochemical characteristics is not less significant (Fig. 7, data points 2, 3). The most likely reason for the observed effect is that, according to the present impedance spectroscopy results, the electrical conductivity of the materials studied here is predominantly ionic; that is, the electron transport rate in the bulk of the material remains low after doping as well, limiting the rate of the charge–discharge process. Because of this, the increase in the porosity of the material and the presence of an effective electrically conductive coating have a more significant effect than does the doping. The observed advantageous effect is due to the better contact with the electrolyte and the reduction in the diffusion path length of charge carriers in the particles [4].

Using a sol–gel method and the Pechini process, its modification, we have synthesized a rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)3 NASICON-type compound; doped materials based on it, namely, Na3V2– xAlx(PO4)3, Na3V2– xFex(PO4)3, Na3 + xV2– xNix(PO4)3, and Na3V2– xCrx(PO4)3 (x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1); and carbon-containing composites. The electrical conductivity of the synthesized sodium vanadium double phosphates has been determined by impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the doping of Na3V2(PO4)3 with aluminum, nickel, and iron cations leads to an increase in its electrical conductivity. The highest electrical conductivity among the samples studied is offered by the material doped with 5% Fe. The discharge capacity of the sodium vanadium double phosphate doped with 5% Fe has been shown to exceed that of Na3V2(PO4)3. The capacity of the more porous material prepared by the Pechini process (Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{II}) approaches the theoretical one at a slow charge–discharge rate and retains its high level as the charge rate is raised. The discharge capacity of Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C-{II} was 117.6, 108.8, and 82.6 mAh/g at a discharge rate of 0.1C, 2C, and 8C, respectively.
