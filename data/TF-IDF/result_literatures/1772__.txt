Electrical materials incorporating lanthanide ions have great potential as electro-opticalmultifunctional systems.
Polycrystalline NASICON (sodium silicon conductor) fast-ion conductors (Na5LnSi4O12, Ln = Eu, Tb) have been prepared via solid-state synthesis.
Thesematerials have been characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy, including steady-stateemission and excitation spectra, and measurement of the lifetimes of the excited states.
Two Eu3+sites have been detected: (i) in regular framework positions, and (ii) replacing Na+ ions in thetunnels.
Samples containing only Eu3+ or Tb3+ emit mainly from one transition, respectively,5D0 A 7F2 (610 nm, red) and 5D4 A 7F5 (550 nm, green).
Mixed lanthanide samples,Na5Eu0.75Tb0.25Si4O12 and Na5Eu0.25Tb0.75Si4O12, have also been prepared and efficient TbAEuenergy transfer has been observed for the latter.
Na5LnSi4O12, Ln = Eu or Tb, compounds were prepared viasolid-state synthesis.
The emission spectrum of the Eu3+ sample and the bi-exponential fit of the 5D0 lifetime decayshow the presence of two lanthanide sites.
The combination ofmeasurements at several wavelengths and at high and lowtemperature allowed the assignment of each of the two sites(and respective lifetimes) to the Eu3+ in the regular crystallographicposition, and as a substitutional defect, replacingNa+ cations in the channels.
The single cation compositionsshow red (Eu3+) and green (Tb3+) emission with colourcoordinates close to those of standards used in industry.
In addition, the Tb3+-NASICON compound shows a radianceclose to that of the green standard phosphor Gd2O2S:Tb3+.
This system shows promising energy transfer propertiessince both mixed cation samples show emission dominated bythe Eu3+ ion, while there is clear evidence of excitation to theTb3+ ion when monitoring the Eu3+ emission.
