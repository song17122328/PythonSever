The concept of realisation of different substitution models in REE–LZP crystal structures where REEs occupy either Li+ or Zr4+ crystallographic positions corresponding to triclinic Li1−3xREExZr2(PO4)3 or NASICON-like ion conductive rhombohedral Li1+xZr2−xREEx(PO4)3 phases was verified. Different synthesis approaches (a polymerizable-complex Pechini method and a solid state reaction) were tested to obtain polycrystalline samples with REE = La and x = 0.1. The reaction mechanism in the mixtures was explained using thermal analysis and XRD. On the basis of the obtained results, the most suitable synthesis method with regard to the phase composition (PM) was applied to obtain a whole series of REE–LZPs in order to verify their crystal structure and characterise their optical properties for pigment application. It is shown that realisation of the different substitution models in LZP polycrystalline samples can be distinguished by high resolution X-ray powder analysis that confirmed the co-existence of both types of solid solutions. However, REE–LZP phases have limited thermal stability and under the studied conditions can be obtained only in a mixture with non-substituted β-LZP. Moreover, Li excess, typically used to achieve the formation of pure-phase LZP products, in the studied case induced REE replacement in the LZP structure producing the (REE)PO4 phase. It is shown that some REEs (Nd, Tb, Ho and Pr) induce in LZP ceramics attractive colouration varying from purple to yellow and green shades, which is pre-determined by the crystal structure of the prevailing REE–LZP phase and in some cases is sensitive to ambient light due to the luminescence properties of REEs.
Lithium zirconium phosphate (LiZr2(PO4)3, LZP) represents an important object of investigation because of its valuable properties for high-tech applications.1–3 Among others, LZP-based materials of NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor) type have been intensively studied as one of the most promising solid electrolytes for application in rechargeable ionic batteries with improved safety and advanced parameters.1,4–10 In particular, the rhombohedral modification of LZP has been recently reported to provide high bulk Li-ion conductivity, high electrochemical stability and a small interfacial resistance for Li+ transfer.6 The rhombohedral LZP with a NASICON-like structure is a high temperature modification of LiZr2(PO4)3 which exhibits a complex structural polymorphism. A common approach to achieve stabilization of the high-temperature rhombohedral LZP phase with high ionic conductivity at room temperature (RT) is its substitution by REEs.11–15 However, the crystal structure of the REE-substituted compounds on the basis of LZP may vary. According to literature analysis, two substitution models where REEs may occupy either Li+ or Zr4+ crystallographic positions could be realised leading to different crystal symmetry distortion resulting in varied properties.In particular, from a crystallographic point of view, REEs are supposed to occupy charge compensation cationic sites in the LZP crystal matrix. These positions are partially occupied by Li+ ions too and, in view of large ionic radii of REEs, are the most size-suitable cationic sites. This type of substitution has been realised in continuous solid solutions of general formula Li1−3xLaxZr2(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1/3) reported for the LiZr2(PO4)3–La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 system.16 The crystal symmetry of the solid solutions depends on the substitution degree x and varies at RT from triclinic (x ≤ 1/6) via rhombohedral (1/6 < x < 1/3) to trigonal (x = 1/3). The formation of these solid solutions can be described by the substitution model ‘Li/La’: Li+ → 1/3La3+ + 2/3□, where the large La3+ ions occupy the ion compensation sites shared with Li+ leading to an increase of the vacancy number correlated to an increase of the La3+ content (Table 1). The end-member of the solid solutions, La1/3Zr2(PO4)3, adopts at RT a trigonal structure where La–O interatomic distances vary from 2.47 to 2.9 Å and those of Zr–O – from 1.95 to 2.2 Å.17 The comparison suggests that alternative cationic positions of Zr are too small to host the large REEs in the LZP structure.However, realisation of the substitution model corresponding to general formula Li1+xZr2−xREEx(PO4)3 (REE = La, Y, x ≤ 1) where REE substitutes Zr was also reported.11,12,15,18,19 Crystallographically, this results from stabilization of the rhombohedral LZP phase of NASICON type with high ionic conductivity. However, the formation of pure rhombohedral Li1+xZr2−xREEx(PO4)3 phases was reported to take place only in a very limited substitution range (in most studies it is limited to x ≤ 0.4).11,12,18–20 Realisation of this type of solid solution takes place in the LiZr2(PO4)3–Li(REE)2(PO4)3 system where REE ions share the crystallographic position with Zr4+ described by the substitution model ‘Zr/La’:Zr4+ → La3+ +Li+ (Table 1). According to powder XRD analysis and Rietveld refinement,11,12,18,19 the substitution of Zr by REE stabilises the highly conducting rhombohedral LZP phase at RT, however no X-ray or neutron diffraction studies have been performed for these types of compounds to confirm their structure. From a crystallographic point of view, due to the large difference between Zr ionic radii (0.72 Å) and those of the REEs (>0.9 Å),21 it is very unlikely that the framework zirconium positions of the rhombohedral LZPs where Zr–Ois only about 2.06 Å (ref. 22) host large cations such as La or Y. Moreover, the REE compositional analogue of LiZr2(PO4)3 in such a substitution model is Li(REE)2(PO4)3, which adopts a totally unrelated structure type of monoclinic monazite, that excludes the possibility of the formation of continuous solid solutions between LiZr2(PO4)3 and A(REE)2(PO4)3.20 However, the co-existence of two modifications of REE-substituted LZP ceramics in the low substitution range is an open scientific question that requires additional examination and proof.Besides application in the field of ionic conductors, REE–LZP systems also found application as adsorbents.19 Moreover, REE-substitution may also induce attractive colouration in white LZP ceramics, which in combination with their thermal stability makes them attractive candidates for application as high performance inorganic pigments. The primary demands for this class of pigments include outstanding optical and thermal properties as well as chemical stability at high temperatures and resistance to aggressive media such as melted glazes.23 Previously, it had been already reported that La-substituted LZPs exhibit good chemical and structural stability and are resistant to air, water, Li metal, and acidic and basic solutions.12 However, there are no reports focused on detailed investigation on visible-light reflectance and colour analysis of REE–LZPs and their potential for pigment application.The objective of the present study was to verify the concept of the formation of solid solutions according to two different substitution models (Li1−3xREExZr2(PO4)3 and Li1+x-Zr2−xREEx(PO4)3) and to examine the optical absorption properties of the samples for pigment application.
Synthesis of the La-modified LZP solid solutions with a La content of 0.1 corresponding to Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 (representing the Li1−3xLaxZr2(PO4)3 substitution model) and Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 (representing the Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3 substitution model) was performed by a polymerizable-complex method based on the Pechini method (PM) and a solid state reaction (SSR).For the PM approach, stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3 (P. A., Lachema, CZ), La(NO3)3·6H2O (P.A., Merck, DE), and ZrOCl2·8H2O (P.A., Merck, DE) were separately dissolved in deionized water, mixed with citric acid (CA, C6H8O7·H2O, P. A., Lach-Ner, CZ) in a CA/metal ion molar ratio of 4 for 2 h under stirring at RT that allowed homogenization and formation of metal chelates. Next, ethylene glycol (EG, C2H6O2, P.A., Lach-Ner, CZ) in molar ratio CA : EG = 1 : 4 was added. Esterification between CA and EG was promoted by heating at 60 °C resulting in the formation of viscous gel. A stoichiometric amount of dissolved NH4H2PO4 (P.A., Lachema, CZ) was added in two different ways: in one case it was added simultaneously with EG; in another case it was added 2 h after addition of EG. In both cases, addition of phosphate promoted the formation of solid particles that substantially increased the viscosity of the mixture. The obtained white suspensions were kept under stirring and moderate heating for several hours and then dried at 150 °C for 24 h followed by treatment at 250 °C for 12 h. As a result, a black solid precursor was obtained. Annealing of the precursor was performed in an electric furnace between 600 and 1400 °C for 2–48 h using a heating rate of 1–2 °C min−1.The PM approach was also used to obtain a full series of REE-substituted LZPs with Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9-La0.1(PO4)3 compositions, where the REE is Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb or Lu. As initial components, similar compounds like in the PM synthesis of La-substituted LZPs were used (P.A. REE nitrate crystallohydrates were purchased from Merck, DE). Annealing was performed under similar conditions at a temperature of 1000 °C.In another synthesis approach, SSR, a stoichiometric mixture of Li2CO3 (P.A., Lachema, CZ), La2(CO3)3·xH2O (P.A., Aldrich, DE), ZrOCl2·8H2O (P.A., Merck, DE) and (NH4)2HPO4 (P.A., Lachema, CZ) was thoroughly ground in an agate mortar with a pestle, transferred into corundum crucibles and slowly heated to 600 °C in an electric furnace with a heating rate of 1–2 °C min−1. After calcination at 600 °C for 30 min, the samples were slowly cooled down to RT, reground in an automatic mortar grinder and pressed to form high-density pellets with 2–3 mm thickness and 10 mm in diameter using a stainless steel press and a laboratory press at 150–200 bar. The pellets were calcined in an electric furnace at 600–1400 °C for 2–48 h using a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. After each calcination step, the samples were reground in an automatic mortar grinder for 5–10 min and shaped again to form high-density pellets.Thermal transformations of the initial chemical compounds, reaction mixtures and precursors were studied using thermal analysis, TA (DSC–TGA, Labsys Evo 1600, Setaram, FR). The measurements were performed in corundum crucibles in an Ar flow of 50 ml min−1,ina temperature range of 25–1200 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.After each calcination step, the ceramic samples were ground and the obtained fine powders were subjected to phase composition analysis performed using a benchtop diffractometer Miniflex 600 (Rigaku, JAP) using the following settings: CuKα radiation (CuKβ Ni filter), 1D detector D/teX Ultra, continuous scanning over the 2θ range from 10 to 80°with a scanning speed of 5–10° 2θ min−1, a recorded step size of 0.02°. Crystal phase identification was performed using PDXL2 Rigaku data analysis software and the PDF-2 database. In this paper, the optimised XRD patterns are displayed on the artwork related to XRD analysis (Fig. 2). The quantitative composition of each sample was calculated based on RIR analysis using PDXL2 software.Due to the possible Li loss at high temperature treatment, its content has been analysed in the final products using AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy, GBC, 906 AA, Australia). The measurements were performed in emission mode, calibration measurements were performed using the Li standard (Merch, DE) in the concentration range of 1–5 ppm, typical measurement errors varied from 2 to 5%. In order to transfer Li into the solution, the samples were treated in melted Na2CO3 and after cooling dissolved in concentrated HNO3.The colour properties of the samples were analysed by measurement of spectral reflectance in the visible region of light (400–700 nm) using a spectrophotometer (ColorQuest XE, HunterLab, USA). The measurement was performed for the powdered samples hand-pressed into quartz cuvettes. The measurement conditions were as follows: a standard illuminant D65 (daylight), 10° standard observer and measuring geometry d/8°. Experimental colorimetric parameters were calculated from diffuse-reflectance spectra. The colour properties are discussed in terms of CIE L*a*b* and CIE L*C*h° systems recommended by CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage24). For each sample, the colour parameters were measured thrice and the average value was chosen as its result. Generally, for a given sample, the standard deviation of the measured colour parameters was <0.10 and the relative standard deviation was ≤1%, indicating that the measurement error can be ignored.
A polymerizable-complex method based on the Pechini method (PM) and a solid state reaction (SSR) were selected for the synthesis of the samples. Previously, the PM approach has been reported to be suitable for realisation of both substitution models,12,16,18 while the SSR has been used before only to obtain the Li1+xZr2−xREEx(PO4)3 series with the R3¯c NASICON-like LZP structure.11,19 In our study, the substitution degree x in both models was limited to 0.1 giving Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 compositions that lie within the previously reported range of existing solid solutions in both substitution models. Interactions in the reaction mixtures leading to the formation of La-modified LZP solid solutions were studied by TA and XRD analysis. The TA results in the temperature range of 25–600 °C are presented in Fig. 1. According to the results, the thermal behaviour of the reaction mixtures differs considerably depending on the synthesis approach (SSR or PM).TA of the raw mixtures of the initial reagents for the SSR (Li2CO3,La(CO3)3·xH2O, ZrOCl2·8H2O and (NH4)2HPO4) has revealed complex transformations corresponding to multiple overlapping endothermic reactions. Each of the observed endothermic effects is accompanied by weight loss that is clearly seen from the comparison of DSC and DTG curves of the samples. At the same time, the thermal behaviour of the samples with different compositions corresponding to different types of solid solutions (Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 or Li1.1-Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3) was very close to each other that can be explained by a minor difference in the chemical composition of the initial mixtures (Fig. 1, SSR). The main difference that is noticeable in the TA curves is the higher content of the ZrOCl2·8H2O component in the Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 sample. Because ZrOCl2·8H2O is one of the main components that contributes to the observed TA transformations, the weight loss in this sample progresses more intensively and reaches higher values in comparison to the Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 sample.Upon heating, the first process that is detected in the TA curves is dehydration. Accordingly, the first endothermic effect at 120 °C and the associated weight loss can be attributed to dehydration of crystallohydrates present in the mixture (ZrOCl2·8H2O and La2(CO3)3·xH2O). The calculated weight loss corresponding to this process should reach 25%of the total mixture weight. However the observed values are lower which can be explained by partial dehydration that occurred during the sample storage in a desiccator prior to TA analysis. It also contributed to the decrease of the total weight loss of the mixtures by 10–12% from the calculated theoretical values (experimental weight loss is 43–46%against theoretical 56%). The second endothermic effect that is clearly divided into 2 separate processes can be attributed to elimination of ammonia of (NH4)2HPO4 and reaction with carbonates. XRD analysis has confirmed the transformation of lanthanum carbonate into lanthanum phosphates at 200 °C. However, the presence of unreacted lithium carbonate has been detected as well that indicates that lanthanum carbonate which is fully transformed into phosphate is a much more reactive component than lithium carbonate. Actually, our previous study has indicated that unreacted lithium carbonate may remain in the phosphate-based reaction mixtures up to 400 °C.25 The next endothermic effect in the studied mixtures appears at 264 °C and is accompanied by a substantial weight loss. Typically, the presence of ZrOCl2·8H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 in the initial mixture results in the formation of NH4Cl which is indicated by the extensive weight loss and endothermic effect at 330–350 °C associated with decomposition and sublimation of NH4Cl.25,26 However, in the present case, the observed endothermic effect is shifted to a much lower temperature (minimum at 264 °C). In addition, in the case of the formation of NH4Cl, the effect of elimination of ammonia of (NH4)2HPO4 which appeared at 181–201 °C should be absent because of its reaction with ZrOCl2·8H2O producing NH4Cl.25 Thus, the effect at 264 °C can be hardly attributed to decomposition of NH4Cl. Indeed, with help of XRD analysis it was confirmed that NH4Cl has not been formed in the studied mixtures. The sample heated at 250 °C for 1 h contained only zirconium oxychloride, zirconium pyrophosphate, lanthanum phosphates and lithium carbonates. Heating at 300 °C for 1 h produced mainly ZrP2-O7 with a small amount of lanthanum and lithium phosphates and LZP. The results indicate that the endothermic effect with a minimum at 264 °C should correspond to the transformation of dehydrated zirconium oxychloride into phosphates by its reaction with the present phosphate components and lithium carbonate with release of HCl, CO2 and NH3. Thus, the reaction pathways in the present case are very different from those observed for a similar reaction mixture corresponding to the pure LZP phase in our previous study.25 The main difference between the initial mixtures for the formation of pure LZP and the substituted one is the presence of La2(CO3)3·xH2O. Thus, in spite of the low content of La2(CO3)3·xH2O in the initial reaction mixtures, it is a very reactive component able to change the whole reaction pathway. A further increase of the temperature leads to the continuation of the reaction between formed ZrP2O7, and lanthanum- and lithium phosphates leading to the formation of the LZP phase. In general, it can be concluded that the studied reaction mixtures corresponding either to the Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 or Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 composition do not provide direct formation of the La-substituted LZP phases by the solid state reaction.The PM precursors that were subjected to TA consisted of amorphous black solid powders pre-treated at 250 °C for 12 h. Their colour indicates that during drying not only dehydration but also pyrolysis of the organic polymer has occurred. The TA results of the precursors of different compositions were identical to each other, therefore the results of only one of the mixtures corresponding to Li0.7-La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 1 (PM, Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3). According to the results, no low-temperature effects connected with dehydration appeared, which indicates that the samples were well dried. An intensive weight loss of 46.5% accompanied by the exothermic DSC effect appears in the temperature range of 300–600 °C. It can be attributed to the process of decomposition/pyrolysis of the organic polymer that initiated the interaction in the mixture. The first crystalline products appeared only after prolonged treatment at 600 °C that corresponded to single-phase low crystalline LZP phases. Thus, it can be concluded that the formation of the La-substituted LZP phase takes place directly from PM precursors without the formation of intermediate products like in the case of the SSR.Further transformation of the reaction products under prolonged treatment at high temperatures was studied by XRD analysis. Moreover, XRD analysis helped to distinguish which exact type of La-substituted LZP structure was formed in the mixtures. According to previous reports, the symmetry of the LZP crystal structure depends on the method of preparation, in particular, the presence of moisture and processing temperature that determine the extents of Li+ deficiency in the structure.7,27 Even within the unsubstituted LiZr2(PO4)3 composition, LZP is known to exhibit a complex polymorphism: it can adopt the hexagonal, rhombohedral NASICON, triclinic NASICON, orthorhombic SW (scandium wolframate) or monoclinic SW structure type depending on the synthesis conditions and temperature.7,8,27–31 Regarding the solid solutions on the basis of La-substituted LZP, within the studied substitution rate (x = 0.1), they may adopt either the structure type of Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 (triclinic symmetry) or R¯3c LiZr2(PO4)3 (rhombohedral NASICON-like high ionic conductive structure). Accordingly, detection of Li0.7La0.1-Zr2(PO4)3 (ICDD 01-076-4033 marked as Li/La–LZP) or R¯3c LiZr2(PO4)3 (ICDD 01-072-7743 marked as Zr/La–LZP) in the phase composition, identified realisation of either the Li1−3x-LaxZr2(PO4)3 or Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3 substitution model, respectively; while β-LiZr2(PO4)3 (β-LZP, ICDD 01-070-5819) is considered as the unmodified LZP phase intolerable to La-doping. The results of XRD analysis for the samples obtained by the SSR and PM with different calcination temperatures are presented in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and also are summarised in Table 2. The evolution of the samples' composition and, in particular, the change in proportion of each phase can also be seen from the pie charts (Fig. 2) representing the results of RIR analysis.
In the case of the SSR, for both compositions (Li0.7La0.1-Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3) after the first calcination step at 600 °C, the main crystalline phase corresponded to ZrP2O7 (ICDD 01-073-2296), which constitutes 62–75%. ZrP2-O7 was formed in the mixture with ZrO2 (ICDD 01-071-4810), LaLi(PO3)4 (ICDD 01-076-5086) and an insignificant amount (6–9%) of Li/La–LZP (Fig. 2, 600 °C). An additional phase of lithium phosphate LiPO3 (ICDD 01-070-5642) was also detected by corresponding reflections at 16.3, 18.8 and 25.1 degrees 2θ in Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3, which correlates well with the higher initial content of Li in this sample. At higher temperatures, the phase composition of both samples transformed into a mixture of LZP phases with an impurity of 3–4% of LaPO4 (ICDD 01-083-0651) and 3% of another modification of ZrO2 (ICDD 00-037-1484). Thus, tazheranite modification of ZrO2 has fully disappeared in both compositions after calcination at 1000 °C, while baddeleyite modification formed at the temperatures above 1300 °C. Regarding ZrP2O7, for the sample with a higher Zr content (Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3), its small amount (5%) was still detected after calcination at 1200 °C. In this sample it was fully reacted only after prolonged calcination at 1300 °C; for another sample with a lower Zr content (Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3), ZrP2O7 was fully reacted below 1200 °C. A reflection at 21.8 2θ corresponding to an unknown phase was also detected in the Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 sample after high-temperature treatment (marked by * in Fig. 2a, 1300 °C).
The main high-temperature solid state reaction products for both compositions are the LZPs that constituted about 93% according to RIR analysis. The sample Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 after calcination at 1300–1400 °C contained a mixture of 2 substituted LZP phases (Li/La–LZP and Zr/La–LZP). With the increase of the calcination temperature from 1200 to 1300 °C, the relative content of Li/La–LZP in this sample has clearly reduced in comparison to that of Zr/La–LZP, which increased. Undoped β-LZP, which was present in the Li0.7-La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 sample at lower temperatures, was fully transformed into La-substituted LZPs which is indicated by the absence of the typical β-LZP reflections at 15.7–15.8 degrees 2θ. On the opposite, the sample Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 treated at 1300–1400 °C contained the main phase of La-substituted Zr/La–LZP with impurities of undoped β-LZP. As an intermediate product at lower temperatures, this sample also contained the Li/La–LZP phase, in which the content was significantly reduced after the treatment at 1200 °C. At the same time, the relative content of β-LZP at lower temperatures was also higher. The result suggests that Zr/La–LZP is more stable at higher temperatures. Further, calcination at 1400 °C has not influenced the phase composition of the samples and the relative intensity of the reflections of different phases remained the same. This suggests that no reaction between LaPO4 and other phases to form La-substituted LZPs or decomposition of La–LZPs to form LaPO4 and β-LZP occurred. In addition, it is worth mentioning that due to the presence of LaPO4 impurities, the real substitution rate achieved for the La-substituted LZPs obtained by the SSR should be lower than 0.1.Previously, a similar SSR method has been used in our study to obtain pure LZP with a NASICON-related R¯3c structure.2 In that study, we have also used a highly reactive zirconium source (ZrOCl2·8H2O) and the formation of pure phase products of LiZr2(PO4)3 was achieved at 1300 °C. However, the conventional SSR may fail to provide the formation of LZP without impurities when other less reactive initial reagents, like ZrO2, are used. In particular, due to a slower reaction rate, considerable Li loss was observed during high temperature treatment in one of the studies and the formation of pure LiZr2(PO4)3 by a SSR required complex manipulations.7 In our case, the content of Li has been monitored in the calcination products at different temperatures. In spite of insignificant Li loss at the initial stage in one of the samples (up to 5% loss in the Li1.1Zr1.9-La0.1(PO4)3 composition after calcination at 600 °C), its content remained stable in the range of 800–1400 °C. It could be explained with the high stability of the LZP phase, because according to the XRD analysis (Fig. 2a, Table 2), at 800 °C all Li has been incorporated into the LZP structure (no additional Li-containing phases are detected), after which the Li content is not reduced. On the other hand, La atoms at this point already become partially involved in the formation of LaPO4 impurities, in which the proportion (about 3%according to RIR analysis, Fig. 2a) has hardly changed with the temperature increase. It can be explained by the fact that the reactivity of LaPO4 is quite low and its transformation into the La–LZP phase may require high activation energy. On the other hand, due to the initial stoichiometry, when some La atoms are used for the formation of the LaPO4 phase, there should be some access of Zr in the LZP structure, which is regulated by yielding ZrO2 impurities at high temperatures. Even so, successful adaptation of the SSR approach for the synthesis of REE-substituted LZPs with a low substitution degree might be developed in the future.In the case of the PM, as was already mentioned earlier, interaction in the mixture is initiated by exothermic polymer decomposition/pyrolysis, which leads to direct formation of pure LZPs regardless of the initial composition (Fig. 2b, 600 °C). Initially, substituted Zr/La–LZP and undoped β-LZP can be distinguished in the phase composition of both samples. In addition, Li/La–LZP appeared in the composition of the Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 sample after calcination at 1000 °C. The dominant La-substituted LZP phase in both samples seems to be Zr/La–LZP (37–53% according to RIR analysis, Fig. 2b). However, with the calcination temperature below 1100 °C, the reflections of LZP phases appeared poorly separated due to low crystallinity that reduced the precision of RIR analysis. At higher temperatures, β-LZP fully transformed into the substituted LZPs, however, small impurities of ZrO2 (6.5–9.5%) and LaPO4 (3–3.5%) appeared in the phase composition of both samples. Similar to the results obtained by the SSR, Zr/La–LZP dominated at higher calcination temperatures that confirms its higher thermal stability. In particular, with a calcination temperature of 1200 °C, Zr/La–LZP is the only LZP phase detected in the Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 sample. With the increase of the calcination temperature, the proportion of the impurity phases (ZrO2 and LaPO4) almost did not change, while additional unknown phases similar to those detected in the SSR-Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 sample appeared after calcination at 1300 °C (marked by * in Fig. 2b, 1300 °C). Thus, it can be concluded that the PM allows synthesis of a mixture of LZP phases with a substitution rate of 0.1 with no impurities only at the temperatures below 1100 °C. The formation of LaPO4 impurities above 1100 °C also suggests that the tolerance towards substitution is decreased below 0.1 at higher temperatures. It should also be noticed that the PM synthesis approach at lower temperatures does not lead to the formation of the pure phase products corresponding either to Li1−3xLaxZr2(PO4)3 or Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3 substitution models with a substitution degree of 0.1 but the formation of a mixture of these phases with β-LZP. Thus, our study confirms the possibility of realisation of both substitution models however the solid solutions can be obtained only in the mixture with β-LZP or/and with each other regardless of the composition of the initial mixture.As it was mentioned above, the formation of the impurities in the LZP samples has been explained in previous studies by Li loss during treatment.7,27 Accordingly, it has been shown that high temperature treatment leads to Li+ deficiency in the LZP structure which can be compensated by Li excess (up to 20%) in the initial mixture. Although in our study the phenomenon has not been confirmed (by Li analysis in the calcination products), we have also tried the ‘Li-access’-approach with the purpose to reduce the amount of the formed impurities. However, for the samples calcined at 1200 °C and higher, the excessive content of Li in the initial mixture leads to higher impurity content, in particular of LaPO4. A substantial increase of the relative intensities corresponding to LaPO4 reflections was observed when the lithium excess reached 20%. The result suggests that the Li atoms compensate charge deficiency more effectively than La and could replace them in the LZP structure in both substitution models. This suggestion is also supported by the fact that, in general, the proportion of undoped β-LZP is higher in Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 samples which have a higher content of Li that more readily occupies charge compensating positions.The discrepancy between our results and the previous studies which report realisation of the targeted substitution models in the pure state11,12,16,18,19 may be explained by the fact that the discussed LZP-related structures are crystallographically close to each other and under certain conditions it could be difficult to distinguish the formation of mixed phase compounds. In particular, while the formation of β-LZP is clearly indicated by characteristic reflections (15.7–15.8 degrees 2θ), the reflections of Li/La–LZP and Zr/La–LZP are very close to each other and can be distinguished only in well-crystalline samples with high resolution XRD. Moreover, the question of the formation of different models within REE–LZP has not been raised before in any of previous studies on this subject. Therefore, we suggest that careful attention should be paid to phase identification of REE-substituted LZP phases where possible appearance of different substitution models that affect the sample properties should be taken into account.On the basis of these results, the synthesis approach on basis of the PM was employed for the preparation of a series of REE-substituted LZPs corresponding to two substitution models with a REE content of 0.1. For each REE, two initial compositions corresponding to two substitution models Li0.7-REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3, where REE is Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb or Lu, were studied. The effect of the initial composition was evaluated with focus on the phase composition, optical absorption properties, sintering degree, particle size, etc.The results of XRD analysis confirmed the formation of a mixture of REE substituted and not-substituted LZP phases. Due to very close radii of REEs, no shift of the XRD reflections was detected and the different LZP phases were identified using the same database records like in the case of La: Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 (ICDD 01-076-4033) and R¯3c LiZr2(PO4)3 (ICDD 01-072-7743) identified realisation of either the Li1−3x-LaxZr2(PO4)3 (Li/REE–LZP) or Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3 (Zr/REE–LZP) substitution model, respectively; β-LiZr2(PO4)3 (β-LZP, ICDD 01-070-5819) is considered as the unmodified LZP phase intolerable to REE-doping. Similar to La-substituted LZPs, after calcination at 1000 °C the samples with the initial composition Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 contained three LZP phases (Zr/REE–LZP, Li/REE LZP and β-LZP), while Li1.1Zr1.9-REE0.1(PO4)3 – only two (Zr/REE–LZP and β-LZP). The proportion of each phase was also calculated using RIR analysis. As a result, the Zr/REE–LZP phase was shown to prevail in both compositions counting up to 35–60%, while the amount of Li/REE–LZP, which was detected only in the Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 sample, varied between 15 and 35%. In order to evaluate the value of the samples for pigment application, the colour properties of the two series of REE–LZPs (Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3, where REE = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb or Lu) were calculated on the basis of the diffuse reflectance of the powders in the visible region of light. Prior to the light reflectance measurement, the mean particle size distribution of the samples was evaluated to be in range of 2.28–5.47 μm that exclude the possibility of the particle size impact on the reflectance properties of the samples. Next, on the basis of the reflectance spectra of the powders in the visible region of light (400–700 nm), the following colour parameters were calculated: a* and b* which indicate the colour shade (colour hue h° = arctangent (b*·a*−1·360°·(2·3.14)−1) and the colour saturation (chroma C* =(a*2 + b*2)0.5); L* which represents the lightness or darkness of colour as related to a neutral grey scale and is described by numbers from 0 (black) to 100 (white). The total colour difference between pure LZP and REE–LZP was calculated according to the formula: dE =(dL*2 +da*2 +db*2)0.5). The colour parameters of pure LZP (LiZr2(PO4)3) were determined as follows: a* = 0.4, b* = 2.5, L* = 95.4, h° = 81.1, C* = 2.5, white colour. The calculated a* and b* colour parameters of all the samples are presented in Fig. 3 (a* corresponds to the abscissa that represents the green (−) → red (+) axis; b* corresponds to the ordinate that represents the blue (−) → yellow (+) axis). Fig. 3 also shows the lightness and saturation parameters of the samples where the values for REE = Y–Lu (i.e. Y, La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er, Tm, Yb or Lu) in Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9-REE0.1(PO4)3 are combined in circles as being very close to each other. The digital images in Fig. 3 show the visual appearance of the samples with the most saturated colouration: Pr-, Tb-, Nd-substituted samples are shown in daylight; Ho-, Er-substituted samples in daylight (left) and UV-light (right). Appearance of Ce-substituted LZP in which the colour is perceived as close to white is shown for comparison. All calculated colour parameters of the samples with Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3 compositions where REE = Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb or Lu are summarised in Table 3.As follows from the presented results, the colour change induced by REE doping is perceptible to the human eye (dE is above 1) in all the samples, however due to high lightness (L* = 93.1–94.8), in most cases even in spite of high saturation, it is still perceived as very close to white (such as colour of Li0.7Ce0.1Zr2(PO4)3 shown in Fig. 3). In general, only four REEs have significantly affected the colour of the samples mainly with the Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 composition. In particular, for this composition, Nd has an induced purple shade, Tb – yellow, Ho – yellow and Pr – green. The colour of these samples can be well perceived by the human eye also because it is darker and in most cases quite saturated (Fig. 3, Table 3). Among all REEs, Pr is the only element that induced well-visible green colouration in both substitution models, Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3. By saturation and hue, the colour of Li1.1Zr1.9Pr0.1(PO4)3 is very close to that of Li1.1Zr1.9Ce0.1(PO4)3, however, due to high lightness, the colour of Li1.1Zr1.9Ce0.1(PO4)3 is perceived as almost white (Fig. 3).In some cases the effect of the REE on the samples' colouration depended on the composition (Li0.7REE0.1-Zr2(PO4)3 or Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3) and the source of incident light (daylight or fluorescent lamp). For Ho and Er, the colour of the samples in daylight is light yellow and pale red, respectively, while in fluorescent light for both samples it became more saturated of the pink shade. This phenomenon can be explained by the luminescence properties of the REEs.The origin of colouration of the studied REE–LZP samples can be ascribed to REE substitution. Similar to 3d metals, REEs act as chromophores that partially absorb light in the visible range due to electronic transitions of 4f electrons. The effect of the substitution model on the colour properties of the samples is connected to the phase composition, in particular the crystalline structure which prevails in each particular case. According to the crystal field theory, which can be applied to solid polycrystalline phosphates, the colour of the samples depends on the crystallographic environment of the REEs in the LZP structure, which is different in the considered substitution models. In particular, in Li1.1Zr1.9-REE0.1(PO4)3, the REEs occupy tight octahedral Zr positions, while in Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 the REEs are located in the structural cavities (channels) of irregular geometry with 6 or more oxygen atoms in the nearest environment.32 In view that the proportion of the phases corresponding to different substitution models within the samples varies, therefore, in some cases the resultant colour is different not only in the view of lightness, but also colour shade. As mentioned above, the phase composition of the Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 samples corresponded to a mixture of three LZP phases (Zr/REE–LZP, Li/REE–LZP and β-LZP), while the Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3 sample – only two (Zr/La–LZP and β-LZP). Thus, the Li/REE–LZP phase has been detected only in the samples with the Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 composition, which may be responsible for the more intense colouration of some samples in this series. Considering the colour shade, it has significantly varied in Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 and Li1.1Zr1.9REE0.1(PO4)3 with REE = La, Nd and Ce which is indicated by the significant change in colour hue (h°) that should also be connected to the phase composition (Table 3).In general, the colour of the REE–LZP samples (where REE = Nd, Tb, Ho or Pr) is lower in saturation and higher in lightness in comparison to other ceramic pigments based on 3d metal phosphates.2,33–40 However, the content of chromophores in the studied samples (REE) is substantially lower than those in individual complex 3d metal phosphates. If the studied samples are compared with analogous solid solutions of Cr(III), at the same substitution range (x = 0.1) the colour parameters of Cr-containing samples are comparable or even less attractive than those of REE-containing samples.2 In particular, Li1.1Cr0.1Zr1.9(PO4)3 was characterised with a lightness (L*) of 88.5 and a saturation (C*) of 5.7. A colour saturation (C*) above 10 is reached in this series only with a Cr(III) molar content above 1 (corresponds to the Li2.1Cr1.1Zr0.9(PO4)3 composition) which is 10 times higher than that in Li0.7Pr0.1Zr2(PO4)3 with C* = 10.7. Theoretically, REEs could provide even more intense colouration at higher concentrations, however in the case of the LZP structure, its content is limited due to the narrow substitution range. It can be concluded that REE substitution can be considered in line with 3d metal substitution as an alternative approach to modification of white phosphate ceramics in order to achieve attractive colouration for pigment application. Additional advantage of REEs in comparison to 3d metals can be attributed to colour sensitivity to ambient light attributed to the luminescence properties of REEs.
In our study, the concept of the formation of solid solutions according to different substitution models (Li1−3xLaxZr2(PO4)3 and Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3) has been verified using two synthesis approaches: a polymerizable-complex method based on the Pechini method (PM) and a solid state reaction (SSR). The substitution degree x in both models was limited to 0.1 giving Li0.7La0.1Zr2(PO4)3 corresponding to triclinic LZP and Li1.1Zr1.9La0.1(PO4)3 corresponding to NASICON-like high ion conductive rhombohedral LZP. Formation of the different REE–LZP compounds can be distinguished in well crystalline powders by high resolution XRD analysis.Our results indicate that both substitution models can be realised, however within the studied synthesis routes it is impossible to obtain the substituted structures of a particular type in the pure state. The preferable method for the synthesis of REE-substituted LZP is the PM which allows synthesis of a mixture of LZP phases with a substitution rate of 0.1 with no impurities at temperatures below 1100 °C. At higher temperatures, the substituted LZPs are less stable and additional impurities of LaPO4 and ZrO2 are formed. It is shown that the Li1+xZr2−xLax(PO4)3 model has higher thermal stability and this phase prevails at temperatures above 1200 °C. However, the tolerance towards substitution in both substitution models is decreased below 0.1 above 1000 °C that results in the formation of LaPO4 impurities. Moreover, it is shown that Li excess in the initial mixture, typically used to achieve the formation of pure phase LZP products, under the studied conditions induced REE replacement in the LZP structure producing the (REE)PO4 phase.The Pechini method was applied to the whole series of REEs in order to obtain REE-substituted LiZr2(PO4)3 and to verify their optical properties for pigment application. Similar to La–LZPs, after calcination at 1000 °C the samples with the initial composition Li0.7REE0.1Zr2(PO4)3 contained three LZP phases (Zr/La–LZP, Li/La LZP and β-LZP), while Li1.1Zr1.9-REE0.1(PO4)3 – only two (Zr/La–LZP and β-LZP). Among the studied samples, only four REEs (Nd, Tb, Ho and Pr) provide attractive colouration that varies from purple to yellow and green shades and depends on the crystal structure of the prevailing REE–LZP phase in the product. Our study confirms that REE substitution can be considered as an alternative approach to modification of white phosphate ceramics to induce attractive colouration in which additional advantage consists of colour sensitivity to ambient light attributed to the luminescence properties of REEs.In general, it can be concluded that very careful attention should be paid to phase identification of REE-substituted LZP phases where possible appearance of different substitution models that affect the sample properties should be taken into account.
