Solid state ionic conductors are important from an industrial viewpoint.
A variety of suchconductors have been found.
In order to understand the reasons for high ionic conductivity in these solids,there have been a number of experimental, theoretical and computational studies in the literature.
Weprovide here a survey of these investigations with focus on what is known and elaborate on issues thatstill remain unresolved.
Conductivity depends on a number of factors such as presence of interstitial sites,ion size, temperature, crystal structure etc.
We discuss the recent results from atomistic computer simulationson the dependence of conductivity in NASICONs as a function of composition, temperature, phasechange and cation among others.
A new potential for modelling of NASICON structure that has been proposed is also discussed.
We have provided a summary of experimental,computational and sometimes theoretical studies onsolid-state ionic conductors.
It appears that the solidstate ionic conductors are superior to liquid electrolytesin several ways.
The reasons for this is not difficultto appreciate.
The disorder in these crystallinesolids is significantly less than that seen in liquids.
There still remain certain aspects that need to beinvestigated.
These are the microscopic nature of theionic motion, the normal to superionic phase transitions,the dependence of diffusivity on the size ofthe diffusing species, the changes in the zirconium silico phosphate-framework upon the variation ofsize and the content of alkali ion and the role offramework expansions as well as vibrations on conductivity.
