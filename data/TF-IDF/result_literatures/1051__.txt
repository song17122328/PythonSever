LiSn2P3O12 with sodium (Na) super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type rhombohedral structure was successfully obtained at low sintering temperature, 600 °C via citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. However, when the sintering temperature increased to 650 °C, triclinic structure coexisted with the rhombohedral structure as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Conductivity–temperature dependence of all samples were studied using impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 30 to 500 °C, and bulk, grain boundary and total conductivity increased as the temperature increased. The −5 S/cm at highest bulk conductivity found was 3.64×10 500 °C for LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 650 °C, and the lowest bulk activation energy at low temperature was 0.008 eV, showing that sintering temperature affect the conductivity value. The voltage stability window for LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 600 °C at ambient temperature was up to 4.4 V. These results indicated the suitability of the LiSn2P3O12 to be exploiting further for potential applications as solid electrolytes in electrochemical devices.

Sodium (Na) super ionic conductor (NASICON) structure with general formula Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 was first discovered by Goodenough et al. [1]. Since then, extensive study has been done as the NASICONs exhibit many useful as well as interesting properties which are often attributed to their unique three-dimensional framework rhombohedral structural features. The three-dimensional framework consists of ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra [2, 3]. The Na+ ions are located in the interstitial sites in this framework. Ionic conduction takes place when Na+ moves from one site to another through bottlenecks formed by oxygen ions. Other than that, some of the properties of NASICONs which make them a technologically important material are the flexibility of chemical substitution, high thermal and chemical stability, high ionic conductivity and low thermal expansion [4]. These unique properties make them useful for applications such as in electrochemical devices.

Lithium stannum phosphate, LiSn2P3O12 is a Li+ ion conductor that shows NASICON-type structure and the least studied in the NASICON family [5–8]. Two crystallographic phases have been reported so far for this compound [5, 6, 9]; a high temperature phase with rhombohedral R3c symmetry and high ionic conductivity, a low-temperature phase with triclinic P1 symmetry or monoclinic Cc symmetry and lower conductivity. Martinez-Juarez et al. [10] and Lazarraga et al. [11] have reported that LiSn2P3O12 has a low ionic conductivity of −1. The studies were done by mixing the compound ∼10 with Teflon as a binder in order to improve the stability of the compound as it can be easily broken due to phase change phenomenon. This was due to structure transition (monoclinic to rhombohedral structure) which yielded changes in the lattice volume leading to breakage of the pellet used for conductivity measurement. Besides using Teflon as a binder, yttrium also makes a good binder to the NASICON and can improve its stability [12]. However, Norhaniza et al. [7, 13–15] have succeeded in obtaining stable pellets of LiSn2P3O12 via mechanical milling method without any use of binding agent but −1 −7 S cm the ionic conductivity of the compound was only ∼10 at room temperature. Besides that, the prepared compound contained impurities that might have impeded the migration of ions leading to low conductivity.

In order to overcome those problems, the sol-gel method may be used to prepare LiSn2P3O12 NASICON-structured materials instead of the conventional solid state method. The sol-gel method has the advantages of lowering the synthesis temperature as it will lower reaction temperature, and shorter reaction time are possible yielding to a high homogeneity and high specific area materials [16, 17]. Furthermore, the sintering temperature also plays an important role as it will not only influence the particle size, but also the structural, conductivity and electrochemical properties of the prepared materials [18]. In the present study, LiSn2P3O12 was synthesized using low-temperature sintering citric acid-assisted sol-gel method resulting in only minor traces of impurity compared to the samples prepared by Norhaniza et al. [7] by mechanical milling method. The effects of the low sintering temperatures on the structural, conductivity and also electrochemical stability window of LiSn2P3O12 samples are discussed.

LiSn2P3O12 compound was prepared via citric acid-assisted sol-gel method. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and directly used as received without further purification. Lithium acetate (CH3COOLi), stannum (IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4.5H2O) and ammonium phosphate (H12N3O4P) were used as the starting materials with citric acid (C6H807) as the chelating agent and distilled water as the solvent. Firstly, CH3COOLi, SnCl4.5H2O and H12N3O4P of molar ratio 1:2:3 were dissolved in distilled water under magnetic stirring. Citric acid (C6H8O7), poly ethylene glycol (C2H6O2) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) were then mixed together to the previously prepared solution under magnetic stirring. C2H6O6 and NH4OH were added to promote polyesterification and polycondensation reactions. The molar ratio of C2H6O6:NH4OH was 1:1. The solution was then transferred into a reflux system and continuously stirred until homogenous solution was formed. After stirring for 24 h, the solution was taken out and vaporized for about 4 h under magnetic stirring at 80 °C. The resulting gels formed was then dried in an oven at 150 °C for 24 h in order to remove water particles, resistance organic groups and also to avoid ceramic crack. The obtained precursor powder was then ground for 30 min in order to obtain a very fine powder. Then, the precursor powder was subjected to an annealing process at four different temperatures, 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C for 24 h. The final product was then ground again for 30 min before the powder was pressed using Specac hydraulic press under a pressure of 5 tons to form pellets with a diameter of 13 mm and thickness of 1.00–2.00 mm.

The prepared samples were subjected to various studies. Thermal behaviour of the precursor sample was analysed using Setaram Labsys Evo in nitrogen atmosphere at a constant −1 in the temperature range from 30 heating rate of 10 K min to 1100 °C. Phase analysis of the samples were performed by X-ray diffraction using a PANalytical-X’pert3 x-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation of wavelength of 1.5406 Å. The 2θ range was between 10 and 45° and 0.026° in step size.

The samples were characterized using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) to observe the functional group and chemical interaction in the system. FTIR spectra were recorded by computer interface with PerkinElmer Frontier spectrometer. The sample powder was placed onto ATR crystal and analyzed in the frequency range of 550 −1 at room to 1350 cm temperature. The morphologies of the sample powders were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray which was carried out using Zeiss-Evo MA10 scanning electron microscope attached with Oxford Aztec X-Act EDX spectrometer. The particle size information was obtained using FRITSCH-Analysette 22 NanoTec laser particle sizer. The sample electrical properties were determined by ac impedance spectroscopy using Solartron 1260 impedance analyzer over a frequency range from 1 to 106 Hz. An applied voltage was fixed at 200 mV. All measurements were done in temperature range 30 to 500 °C. The bulk conductivity (σb) and grain boundary conductivity (σgb) which represent the direct current (dc) conductivity in the samples were calculated using equation: σb ¼ d ARb and σgb ¼ d ARgb

In these equations, d is the sample thickness, A is the crosssectional area of sample, Rb is the bulk resistance and Rgb is the grain boundary resistance. The electrochemical stability was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using Wonatech ZIVE MP2 multichannel electrochemical workstation.

Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in order to investigate the effect of the heat-treatment temperature and optimization of the sintering temperature on the synthesis of LiSn2P3O12 sample. TGA curve for the precursor of LiSn2P3O12 is presented in Fig. 1. From the figure, three main weight losses are identified in the TG curve. The first soft slope is in between 30 and 120 °C with a total weight loss of 1.73 %, which is due to the evaporation of water. The second weight loss is a steep slope in the temperature range from 120 to 350 °C indicating the decomposition of ammonium and acetate group [18-19]. The third weight loss is 3.70 % in the temperature range from 350 to 480 °C which is attributed to the chemical reaction during formation of LiSn2P3O12. At temperatures above 500 °C, there was no significant weight loss, which suggests that the gases (NH3, CO2 and H2O) are mainly produced below 500 °C and that the reaction at high temperature does not result in further weight loss [8]. The plateau at temperature range 500 to 1100 °C suggests that all chemical reactions in the sample have been completed. So, based on the TGA result, four sintering temperatures have been chosen, that is, 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C.

The phase composition of LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at different temperatures was determined from X-ray diffraction analysis. Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples. The figure shows that LiSn2P3O12 samples started their crystallization around 600 to 650 °C. At lower synthesis temperature, mainly 500 and 550 °C, the lower intensity of the main peaks indicates low crystallinity of the samples. Rhombohedral NASICON-type structure (phase I) and R3c symmetry along with minor traces of SnP2O7 impurity was successfully obtained upon sintering at 600 °C. However, as the sintering temperature increased to 650 °C, new peaks ap  peared at 19.9 and 20.9° that correspond to triclinic structure (phase II) and P1 symmetry along with rhombohedral NASICON-type structure (phase I) and R3c symmetry exist together with minor traces of SnP2O7 impurity. It has previously been reported that the two phases of LiSn2P3O12 coexist at temperatures below 700 °C [8], while in rhombohedral type structure (phase I), this phase always coexisted with other products such as phase II, SnO2 and SnP2O7 [6]. The presence of only minor traces of impurity shows that the use of sol-gel method can minimize the impurity.

Meanwhile, the variations of the lattice parameters of the sintered samples are listed in Table 1. Based on the table, the value of a, c and unit cell volume (V) increases with the increase of the sintering temperature of the LiSn2P3O12 samples. However, the crystallite size decreases as the sintering temperature increases. This observation illustrates that the increase in temperature leads to a decrease in defect concentration by decreasing in the proportion of surface atoms [20]. Hence, it will also improve the degree of crystallization in LiSn2P3O12 samples as proven in Fig. 2.

For density measurements, the density of LiSn2P3O12 sam−3, ples sintered at 600 and 650 °C are 3.48 and 3.54 g cm respectively. It shows that the densities of all the sintered LiSn2P3O12 samples are more than 90 % of its theoretical −3). Among the samples, LiSn2P3O12 density (3.79 g cm the υ3 asymmetric stretching vibrations, and bands in the −1 correspond to the υ4 symmetric region of 900 to 980 cm ions [21–26]. Comparing stretching vibrations of the PO4 all the dominant absorption bands of O-P-O and PO4 , as the sintering temperature increases from 500 to 650 °C, the two absorption bands are shifted to the lower wave number direction. This is due to the increase of the crystallinity of the sintered samples as also confirmed by the XRD analysis [27].

Fig. 3 The FTIR spectrum of various functional groups in LiSn2P3012 samples sintered at different temperatures samples sintered at 650 °C have the highest density due to the close packing of smallest crystallites.

Figure 3 displays FTIR spectra of various functional groups in LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C −1. It can clearly in the spectral region from 550 to 1400 cm be seen that the entire region is dominated by the vibrations of PO4 tetrahedral, and these features are all the same in all the sintered samples. The absorption bands in the region of −1 as shown in Fig. 4a are mainly caused by 560 to 670 cm the υ2 asymmetric bending vibration modes of O-P-O units. Stretching vibrations of P-O-P are observed in the region of −1. Meanwhile, the absorption bands in the 700 to 800 cm −1 as in Fig. 4b are assigned to region of 1000 to 1280 cm

Scanning electron microscopy, EDX and particle size distribution analysis

The cross-sectional SEM micrographs of LiSn2P3O12 pellets and particle size distribution of samples sintered at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 5. From the SEM micrographs, the particle size clearly decreases as the sintering temperature increases. This is confirmed by the analysis of the particle size distribution. The average particle size for the LiSn2P3O12 sample decreases from 10.01 to 5.58 μm as the sintering temperature increases from 500 to 650 °C. These results show an agreement with the XRD analysis showing that increases of the sintering temperature improve the crystallinity of the prepared samples. Besides that, the smaller particles in LiSn2P3O12 sintered samples are favourable as this may improve contact with electrode materials when it is used for device fabrication such as in electrochemical devices [28].

The EDX analyses of LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at different temperatures are tabulated in 5. As lithium is not detectable by EDX due to its light atomic weight which does

For impedance measurement, only two samples were chosen based on the XRD analysis. The chosen samples are LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at 600 and 650 °C as these two samples are fully crystallized compared to the other two samples. The complex impedance plots of LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at 600 and 650 °C are displayed in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. From Figs. 6a and 7a, several important points are observed. Firstly, at 30 °C for both compounds, the plots seem to consist of two overlapping semicircles with an electrode spike at low frequency region. The high frequency semicircle is assigned to bulk response with its intercept at the x-axis assigned to bulk resistance (Rb) while the middle frequency semicircle is assigned to grain boundary response with its intercept at the x-axis corresponds to grain boundary resistance (Rgb). When the temperature increases to 400 °C for both samples, both bulk and grain boundary resistance (Rb and Rgb) shift towards lower value indicating an increase in conductivity. As the temperature increases to 500 °C, only one semicircle is found for both compounds that correspond to bulk response by high capacitance electrode effects.

Bulk and grain boundary conductivities, σb and σgb, are then calculated using Rb and Rgb values determined from the impedance plots. The plots of log σ versus 1000/T for both samples are shown in Fig. 8. It is observed that bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities for both samples increase with temperature as listed in Table 2. For LiSn2P3O12 sample than reported by Norhaniza et al. [7]. It is known that the conductivity of NASICON increases with an increase in the lattice constants because of the increment of the tunnel or bottleneck size for Li+ ion migration [29]. So, as compound sintered at 650 °C has larger lattice constants as confirmed by XRD compared to compound sintered at 600 °C, one should have expected a larger conductivity for compound sintered at 650 °C. The increment of conductivity with temperature also can be due to the increase in the thermal activated drift mobility of ions according to hopping conduction mechanism. The activation energy for the Li+ migration was determined

where σ, T, σ0, Ea and k denote the conductivity, absolute temperature, pre-exponential factor, activation energy for Li+ ion migration and Boltzmann’s constant, respectively. From the graph, differences in slopes are evident as we can see two regions, region I associated with low temperature and region II associated with high temperature. The bulk activation energy for sample sintered at 600 and 650 °C for region I is 0.01 and 0.008 eV, respectively, as tabulated in Table 3. While for region II, the bulk activation energy is 0.23 and 0.21 eV for the sample sintered at 600 and 650 °C, respectively. The same trend applied for grain boundary activation energy for both samples. Furthermore, the activation energy value reported here is much lower compared to those obtained by other researchers [7, 10].

However, the activation energy value obtained at higher temperature is higher compared to the activation energy value obtained at lower temperature. According to Chourashiya [30], this may be due to at low temperatures; extrinsic vacancies are the most important. Furthermore, the concentrations of intrinsic vacancies are so small at low temperature that they may be ignored. The number of vacancies is essentially constant; m (slope) in the extrinsic region thus only depends on the mobility of mobile species due to the extrinsic defects. At higher temperature, the concentration of intrinsic defects has increased so that it is similar or greater than the concentration of extrinsic defects. Thus in this region, for a system with Schottky defects and with Frenkel defects, a plot of log σ versus 1000/T gives a larger value for the activation energy (Ea) because it depends on both the activation energy for the sintered at 600 °C, bulk conductivity (σb) increases from −1 at 500 °C. 1.05×10 While for LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 650 °C, bulk con−6 and 3.64× ductivity (σb) at 30 and 500 °C are 1.15×10 −1, respectively. The highest total conductivity (σt) 10 −5 S/cm at 500 °C for LiSn2P3O12 sample found is 3.64×10 sintered at 650 °C which is three order of magnitude higher

AC conductivity has been evaluated from dielectric data in accordance with the relation: σAC ¼ ωε0ε00 where ε0 is the permittivity of the free space (8.854× −1), tan δ is the loss tangent factor and ε″ is the 10 dielectric loss. The real and imaginary parts of permittivity and modulus are calculated based on the equation: ε* ¼ ε

The log σac versus log ω plots of LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at 600 and 650 °C are illustrated in Fig. 9. Each plot consists of a spike in low-frequency region, a plateau in intermediate frequency region and high frequency dispersion. The low frequency dispersion is due to electrode polarization effects which are related to blocking of ions

between the electrode and samples [22]. Meanwhile, the intermediate frequency plateau is due to frequency independence of conductivity corresponding to DC conductivity. The transition from the DC plateau to AC conductivity dispersion region shifts towards higher frequency range when temperature increases. At high frequencies, the power law feature is observed [28].

According to Almond and coresearchers, the AC conductivity data can also be used to estimate the ionic hopping rate, ωp. The hopping rate of ion in a material is valuable information to elucidate the ionic conduction of the samples. In this case, ωp can be obtained from the graph of log σ(ω) versus log ω by extrapolating at twice the value of DC conductivity from the vertical axis horizontally towards the graph and then extrapolating downwards vertically to the horizontal axis. 

The value of σ, ωp, K, n and μ at all temperatures studied for LiSn2P3O12 samples sintered at 600 and 650 °C are tabulated in Tables 4 and 5. From the table, K and n are found to be constant over the temperature range studied. This shows that all the ions which are responsible for the conductivity are in a mobile state which can be best represented by the strong electrolyte model [31–33]. Hence, the conduction mechanism in the investigated LiSn2P3O12 sample is attributed to the hopping of charge carriers. Meanwhile, from the table, μ increases with increasing temperature. This means that the increase in conductivity in the samples can be attributed to the increase in ionic mobility since the density of mobile ions is constant over temperature range studied [31–33]. The trend of μ value can be correlated with the results from impedance analysis showing that the LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 650 °C has higher ionic conductivity compared to LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 600 °C. The mobility of ions, μ, in LiSn 2P 3O 1 2 sample sintered at 650 °C is 1.72 × −1 which is higher compared to the sample −1 s 10 sintered at 600 °C.

In Eq. 9, e is electron charge, γ is correlation factor which is set equal to 1 and a is the jump distance between two adjacent sites for the ions to hope which is assumed to be 3 Å for all the samples [32, 33]. The density of mobile ions (charge carrier), n, can be calculated using Eq. 10, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The ionic mobility, μ can be calculated using equation: μ ¼ σdc ne

The electrochemical stability window of the ceramic electrolyte was determined by LSV. Only LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 600 °C was chosen as it contained single phase NASICON-type rhombohedral R3c structure. Figure 10 illustrates linear sweep voltammogram of the LiSn2P3O12 sample sintered at 600 °C. From the figure, the voltage stability window in the LiSn2P3O12 sample at ambient temperature is up to 4.4 V. The result indicates the suitability of the LiSn2P3O12 to be exploiting further for potential applications as solid electrolytes in electrochemical devices.

LiSn2P3O12 with NASICON-type rhombohedral R3c structure was successfully obtained at low sintering temperature, 600 °C via citric acid-assisted sol-gel method as confirmed by   XRD and FTIR analysis. However, when the sintering temperature increased to 650 °C, triclinic P1 structure coexisted with the rhombohedral R3c structure. From the XRD analysis, the value of a, c and unit cell volume (V) increased linearly with the samples sintering temperature. Besides that, as the sintering temperature increased, the crystallite size and the particle size of the samples decreased in all the sintered samples indicating the improvement of the degree of crystallization of the samples. Meanwhile, the highest −6 S/cm at conductivity value obtained was in order of 10 −5 S/cm at 500 °C for the sample sintered at 30 °C and 10 650 °C as the mobility of ions, μ, in the sample was 1.72× −1 which is higher compared to the sample 10 sintered at 600 °C. These results proved that sintering temperature also plays a very important role in structural and electrical properties of the prepared samples. Besides that, the voltage stability window for the sample was relatively high at ambient temperature and was up to 4.4 V. These results proved the suitability of the LiSn2P3O12 samples for applications as solid electrolytes in electrochemical devices.
