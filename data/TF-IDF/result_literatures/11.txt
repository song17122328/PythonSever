In this work, the synthesis of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolytes is demonstrated through a low temperature and rapid microwave sintering process and its application in Na-ion batteries is investigated. The quickly and uniformly heating of microwave sintering can inhibit the excessive grain growth signiﬁcantly, resulting in the ﬁne grained NZSP electrolyte with high relative density of 96%. The obtained NZSP electrolyte sintered by microwave heating at 850 ◦C for 30 min shows high room temperature ionic conductivity of 2.511 × 10- 4 S cm- 1, which is comparable to that of sample synthesized by solid-state sintering method at 1200 ◦C for 720 min. The application of the resultant NZSP electrolyte in Na-ions batteries is evaluated by assembling Na3V2(PO4)3/C| NZSP|Na solid sodium battery. Discharge speciﬁc capacity of 75.7 mAh g- 1 with a capacity retention rate of 81.97% is recorded after 100 cycles at 0.5C. This work reports the microwave sintering synthesis of NZSP solid electrolyte with fascinating advantages of energy-saving and time-saving, driving the application of inorganic solid electrolyte in solid batteries.
In the past decades, abundant attentions from academia and industry were focused on Li-ion batteries that available widely in portable elec-tronic devices and electric vehicles. Recently, Na-ion batteries attracted intensive research attentions due to its higher elemental abundance and lower cost as well as lower ionization potential (5.1391 eV) comparing to the Li-ions (5.3917 eV) batteries. However, the safety concerns with the use of liquid electrolytes for the conventional Li- or Na-ions batteries are denounced intensely. The employment of liquid electro-lytes not only has the safety issues but also restrict the performances limited by the voltage window in which the batteries can operate. Therefore, exploring an alternative to liquid electrolytes is crucial for these energy storage devices to meet the application requirements of high-level safety and high-level performance. Solid electrolytes were recognized as the promising candidate to replace liquid electrolytes in view of the merits in overcoming the above mentioned disadvantages and in achieving both of higher energy and power densities. NASICON (Na superionic conductors) electrolyte, with a stoichiometry of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 < x < 3) and high struc-ture tolerance and ﬂexibility for cation-substitution, was considered to be one of the most promising Na ion solid electrolytes due to its rela-tively high conductivity at room temperature and outstanding chemical stability as well as excellent electrochemical decomposition voltage. The NASICON family of solid electrolytes can provide a 3-D Na ions diffusion framework, enabling the higher ionic conductivity comparing with the commercial beta-Al2O3 solid electrolyte with a 2-D Na ions conductive pathway. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) is the most common formulation of NASICON and was revealed to have a higher ionic con-ductivity (0.2 S cm- 1 at 300 ◦C) in comparison to other types. This type of NASICON electrolyte was pioneered by Goodenough and Hong and a wide range of ionic conductivity from 9.2 × 10- 5 to 1.2 × 10- 3 S cm- 1 were demonstrated, depending on the densities and mi-crostructures of the sintered materials. Being a polycrystalline, the total ionic conductivity (including the grain conductivity and grain boundary conductivity) of solid electrolyte is strongly affected by its microstructures, such as porosity, grain size, impurity phase etc., which are controlled substantially by the sintering process . For example, Lee et al. reported that the ionic conductivity of electrolytes could be enhanced by prolonging the sintering time due to the increasing of densiﬁcation. Fuentes et al. revealed that the overlong sintering duration might increase the grain boundary resistance owing to the presence of a liquid phase. Conventional solid-state sintering was the most used method to synthesize ceramic electrolyte. However, the required high temperature (above 1200 ◦C) and long duration (up to 10 h) during solid-state sintering easily lead to the abnormal grain growth of materials and the loss of volatile components then eventually resulting in the decreasing of ionic conductivity, in addition to the dis-advantages of energy and cost intensive. The introduce of ﬂuxing agent Na3BO3 and Na2SiO3 could decrease the sintering temperature and the sintering time to a certain extent. Alternatively, some new sintering technologies including hot pressing sintering], spark plasma sintering and cold sintering were exploited to prepare ceramic electrolytes. For example, Grady et al. re-ported the improved cold sintering process to prepare NZSP electrolyte at a very low temperature of 400 ◦C, but the precursor still needs to be calcined at 1000 ◦C for 720 min. Microwave sintering technology has an enormous demand for the ceramic materials to replace the solid-state sintering method due to its promising merits of moderate sintering temperature, shorter sintering time and higher yields. This sintering method promotes homogeneous and rapid heating of ceramic pellets, resulting from the interaction of microwave with atoms, ions and dipoles existed in the materials on a microscopic level. Recently years, successful application of microwave sintering within low tem-perature and short duration for solid electrolyte was described frequently in the literatures. For example, Lai et al. demonstrated that the sintering temperate of LiZr2P3O12 electrolyte could be drastically reduced from 1200 ◦C to 900 ◦C with a 4 h holding time by using mi-crowave sintering approach; Li1⋅3Al0⋅3Ti1⋅7P3O12 electrolyte with high purity and crystallinity and promising ionic conductivity (3.15 × 10- 4 S cm- 1) was achieved by employing microwave sintering method at 890 ◦C only in 10 min; Amores et al. reported the synthesis of Li6⋅5Al0⋅25La2⋅92Zr2O12 garnet electrolyte by microwave sintering at 700 ◦C for 6 h, reducing considerably the reaction times and sintering temperature; Yan et al. prepared Li1⋅5Al0.4Ga0.1Ge1.5(PO4)3 elec-trolyte with bulk ionic conductivity of 6.67 × 10- 4 S/cm by microwave-assisted melting quenching crystallization method. Rapid microwave-assisted synthesis of Li3PS4 electrolyte in 3 h vs. 3 days with the conventional ball-milling techniques was demonstrated by Suto et al. Compared with the Li-based solid electrolytes mentioned above, there are seldom works have been conducted about the micro-wave sintering of Na-based solid electrolytes except the old-fashioned Na-β’’-Al2O3 electrolytes.In the presented work, the synthesis of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolytes application for Na-ion batteries was demonstrated through a low temperature and rapid microwave sintering process. The crystal structure, microstructure, densiﬁcation and Na ion conductivity as well as the electrochemical performance applied in Na-ion batteries for the microwave sintering NZSP electrolyte were investigated in detail. 
Sol-gel method was employed to prepare NZSP precursor. C8H20O4Si (5 mL) was mixed with H2O (2.5 mL) and C2H6O (5 mL), and a small amount of nitric acid was added to the hydrolyze C8H20O4Si. NaNO3 and ZrO(NO3)2⋅xH2O were added into H2O (250 mL) under stirring at 60 ◦C for 10 min. After mixed the above two solutions, NH4H2PO4 was added and stirred for 30 min to form a uniform precipitation. Among them, 15 wt% of excessive NaNO3 and NH4H2PO4 were used to compensate the volatilization of Na and P elementals at high temperature. The mixture was stirred at 90 ◦C to evaporate the water, and the dried gel was ground and calcined at 550 ◦C for 30 min using an industrial microwave oven (2.45 GHz, INNOV-CS-03M1600, China) under atmosphere to obtain the NZSP precursor. The NZSP solid electrolyte was synthesized by micro-wave sintering process. Typically, the obtained NZSP precursor was sufﬁciently ball-milled and pressed into green pellets, then sintered at 750–950 ◦C for variable time (15, 30 and 60 min) using above mentioned microwave oven. During microwave sintering process, the green pellets were loaded on the ZrO2 powder bed in a corundum cru-cible and the SiC powder was used as the auxiliary absorbing material surrounded the crucible. The power rating of the microwave oven was operated in the range from 500 W to 800 W during sintering. After cooling, dense NZSP solid electrolytes synthesized by microwave sin-tering were received and indexed as MW-T-t (T = 750, 800, 850, 900 and 950 ◦C; t = 15, 30 and 60 min). For a comparison, NZSP solid electrolyte synthesized by the conventional solid-state sintering was conducted. The green pellet was sintered in a mufﬂe furnace at 1200 ◦C for 720 min under atmosphere. The obtained sample by solid-state sintering was labeled as SS-1200 ◦C - 720 min. The cathode material used for assemble of solid sodium battery was Na3V2(PO4)3/C, which was prepared by a sol-gel method described in details elsewhere. Typically, Citric acid and NH4VO3 (0.01 mol) were added into H2O (100 mL) under stirring at 70 ◦C for 1 h, in which vanadium to citric ratio was 2:2. The stoichiometric amount of Na2CO3 and (NH4)2HPO4 was added and stirred for 1 h followed by evaporated at 80 ◦C with continuous stirring. The resulting gel was vacuum dried at 120 ◦C for 12 h and then calcined at 350 ◦C for 4 h under Ar stream to remove NOx, CO2 and H2O. Finally, Na3V2(PO4)3/C can be obtained by calcinating the dried gel at 850 ◦C for 8 h under Ar stream. 
The phase composition of prepared ceramic samples was analyzed with X-ray diffraction (ARL Equinox 3000, France) at room temperature. The microstructure and composition of the obtained electrolytes was characterized by ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (Phenom Pro, America) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) (Quanta FEG, America). The bulk density of the sintered ceramics was measured using an electronic densitometer (YD-100ES, China) accord-ing to the Archimedes method with considering a theoretical density of 3.243 g/cm- 3. An electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, China) was used to evaluate the ionic conductivity of the samples by electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz. Prior to test, both sides of the pellets were polished and sput-tered with gold thin layer. The measurements of EIS were performed at room temperature and different temperatures to estimate the activation energy of the electrolyte. Zview software was employed to analyze the obtained EIS data. 
Na3V2(PO4)3/C|NZSP|Na solid sodium battery in the form of coin cell was assembled to evaluate the application of NZSP electrolytes synthesized by microwave sintering method in energy storage devices. Working electrodes were prepared by mixing the prepared Na3V2(PO4)3/C material with acetylene black carbon and poly-vinylidene ﬂuoride binder at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 using N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone as solvent. The resultant slurry was cast onto the Al foil and dried at 80 ◦C in vacuum for 24 h then compressed at 10 MPa pressure. Subsequently, CR 2032 coin-type cells were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glovebox using Na3V2(PO4)3/C as the working electrode, Na disks as both the counter and reference electrode, NZSP electrolytes synthesized by microwave sintering method as separator and electrolyte, and 10 μL of liquid electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in EC/DEC (1:1)) was used to wet the interface between the working electrode and the NZSP electrolyte. The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged in the voltage range of 2.5–4.0 V vs Na/Na+ at 80 ◦C using an automatic battery tester system (Land CT2001A, China). 
Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of NZSP electrolytes synthesized by microwave sintering at different temperatures for 30 min and solid-state sintering at 1200 ◦C for 720 min. It was found that NZSP crystalline phase was not well formed when the microwave sintering temperature was 750 ◦C. When the sintering temperatures larger than 750 ◦C, the sintered pellets were well indexed as monoclinic-phase Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (PDF: 84–1200) with a space group of C2/c and lattice parameters of a = 1.5651 nm, b = 0.9055 nm, c = 0.922 nm and β = 123.74◦. With the increasing of sintering temperature, the diffraction peaks became nar-rower, indicating the improved crystallization at higher temperatures. ZrO2 impurity, the easily separated phase in NZSP electrolyte synthe-sized by conventional solid-state sintering method, was not traced for our microwave sintering NZSP samples. As a comparison, the sample obtained by solid-state sintering at 1200 ◦C for 720 min shows much narrow diffraction peaks than that of the microwave sintering samples, indicating the smaller and ﬁne grains for the microwave sin-tering samples. The bulk density and relative density of the corre-sponding prepared NZSP electrolytes were exhibited in Fig. 1(b). The relative density was found to increase with the increasing of sintering temperature for the microwave sintering samples and got the maximum value of 96.0% at 850 ◦C. This value is slight higher than that of sample prepared by solid-state sintering at 1200 ◦C for 720 min. These results revealed that promising quality of NZSP ceramic with high purity and high densiﬁcation could be realized by the low temperature and rapid microwave sintering method. Fig. 2 depicts the cross-section SEM images of the fractured NZSP electrolytes obtained by microwave sintering and solid-state sintering methods. It can be observed that numbers of pores exist in the pellet for the sample obtained by microwave sintering at 750 ◦C (Fig. 2(a)). With the increasing of microwave sintering temperature, the pores reduced obviously and the densest morphology was observed at temperature of 850 ◦C (Fig. 2(d)). Further increasing the sintering temperature, the dense morphology was broken owing to the random appearance of pores, resulting from the anisotropic grain growth speed and the larger grain size at higher temperature. This observation was consistent with the density test results (Fig. 1(b)). Especially, the pellets synthe-sized by microwave sintering displayed small and ﬁne grain size without distinct grain structure compared with the solid-state sintering sample (Fig. 2(f), owing to the volume heating effect of microwave irradiation can reduce the temperature gradient inside the material and limits the growth of grains. The small and ﬁne grain size is beneﬁted to obtain high densiﬁcation ceramic by enhancing the contact and packing be-tween grains. The EDS elemental analysis results were exhibited in the inset of Fig. 2. It was found that highest Na content of 18.66 at. % was recorded for the MW-850 ◦C-30 min sample. Fig. 3(a) and (b) and depict the Nyquist impedance plots at 25 ◦C for the synthesized NZSP pellets by microwave sintering and solid-state sintering methods. The recorded impedance spectra were fairly similar to the characteristic impedance spectra of polycrystalline electrolytes reported in Refs. The impedance spectra of NZSP electrolytes are composed of one semicircle at high frequency and an inclined line at low frequency. We could ﬁnd that the plot of sample prepared by mi-crowave sintering at 750 ◦C was distinctly different from that of other samples, traced with extremely large resistance owing to the unsuc-cessful formation of NZSP. Commonly, the Nyquist plot of poly-crystalline electrolyte should have three different components: the ﬁrst semicircle at high frequency range attributed to the grain resistance, the second semicircle at medium frequency range due to the grain boundary resistance and the inclined line at low frequency range ascribed to the blocking electrode effect. Brick Layer Model was common employed to identify the contribution of grain and grain boundary for polycrystalline electrolytes, as represented by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 3(b). This equivalent circuit diagram is composed of a parallel of resistor and capacitor for grain and grain boundary each connect in series. Only one semicircle was recorded in Nyquist plots for our prepared NZSP electrolytes, however, owing to the sodium ion con-ductivity is extremely high at room temperature. Thus, the grain conductivity (σg) could be evaluated by the ﬁrst intercept of the semi-circle and grain boundary conductivity (σgb) is the size of the semicircle. Fig. 3(c) summarized the σg, σgb, and total conductivity (σ) of the NZSP electrolytes. It was observed that the σg of microwave sintering samples is higher than that of solid-state sintering sample, due to their ﬁne and small grains. In contrast, their σgb is lower than that of solid-state sin-tering sample because of the more grain boundary structure in the mi-crowave sintering samples composed of ﬁne and small grains. Commonly, small grains in oxide compounds have large amount of grain boundary and thereby lead to large contribution of the grain boundary conductivity to the total ionic conductivity. Actually, the grain bound-ary ionic conductivity can be affected by three factors, the grain boundary, impurities and porosity. For the microwave sintering NZSP solid electrolytes, high purity without the formation of ZrO2 impurity easily separated in conventional solid-state sintering method was recorded (Fig. 1(a)). In addition, the small and ﬁne grains of the mi-crowave sintering NZSP solid electrolytes is beneﬁted to obtain high densiﬁcation ceramic by enhancing the contact and packing between grains. For these reasons, the contribution of the grain boundary to the total ionic conductivity was not larger for the microwave sintering NZSP solid electrolytes, even though the ﬁne grains were observed. The σ of microwave sintering samples was recorded to increase with the increasing of sintering temperature and the highest σ of 2.511 × 10- 4 S cm- 1 was recorded at 850 ◦C with a hold time 30 min. This value is slight higher than that of sample obtained by the solid-state sintering sample (2.126 × 10- 4 S cm- 1) at 1200 ◦C for 720 min. The promising ion conductivity of microwave sintering NZSP electrolyte was ascribed to its high quality of NZSP ceramic with characters of high pure, ﬁne grains and excellent density induced by microwave heating. In order to obtain the activation energy (Ea) of NZSP electrolyte, the Nyquist plots at temperatures from 25 to 100 ◦C and - 15 to - 40 ◦C were tested for the optimal microwave sintering sample (MW-850 ◦C-30 min), as demon-strated in Fig. 3(d–e). The σ measured at 100 ◦C, 75 ◦C, 50 ◦C, 25 ◦C, - 15 ◦C, - 20 ◦C, - 25 ◦C, - 30 ◦C, - 35 ◦C and - 40 ◦C was 1.523 × 10- 3 S cm- 1, 1.091 × 10- 3 S cm- 1, 6.01 × 10- 4 S cm- 1, 2.511 × 10- 4 S cm- 1, 4.142 × 10- 5 S cm- 1, 3.137 × 10- 5 S cm- 1, 2.515 × 10- 5 S cm- 1, 1.506 × 10- 5 S cm- 1, 1.159 × 10- 5 S cm- 1, 8.306 × 10- 6 S cm- 1 respectively. The activation energy (Ea) was extracted from the linear ﬁt to the Arrhenius plot in the form of ln (σT) versus 1000/T. The Ea,total, Ea,g and Ea,gb of MW-850 ◦C-30 min sample were determined to be 0.31 eV, 0.28 eV and 0.36 eV from the slopes in the inset of Fig. 3(f) respectively. The Ea,total was comparable with the values reported in references for the traditional solid-state sintering ceramics (0.26–0.4 eV). Fig. 3(g–h) demonstrated the low temperature impedance to show the separation of the grain and the grain boundary conductivity. The Mark 1 in the two ﬁgures represented the response of the crystal grain. Mark 2 represented the correspondence of the grain boundary. This huge com-plete semicircle indicated that the grain boundary resistance occupied a greater proportion of the total resistance at low temperature, which was consistent with the result reported in the literature. Mark 3 rep-resented the response of the blocked electrode. Except the microwave sintering temperature, the inﬂuences of mi-crowave sintering time on the phase, density and microstructure for the NZSP electrolytes were also investigated. The XRD patterns of NZSP electrolytes obtained by microwave sintering at 850 ◦C for different durations were demonstrated in Fig. 4(a). Target NZSP phase without impurity was formed successfully for all the samples even the sintering time is as short as 15 min, revealing the promising advantage of mi-crowave sintering in energy-saving. Fig. 4(b) exhibits the corresponding relative density, SEM images and elemental analysis results of NZSP pellets sintered for variable durations. High densiﬁcation associated with dense morphology was recorded for the microwave sintering ce-ramics. Highest relative density of 96.0% was recorded for the sample sintering for 30 min. Even the sintering time was as short as 15 min, it was still to obtain the acceptable relative density at 92.7%. The Na content was found to increase ﬁrstly and then decrease with the sin-tering time increased from 15 min to 60 min. The change of Na contents induced by sintering time for the synthesized NZSP electrolytes was mainly associated with the densities of the pellets. A larger densiﬁcation is beneﬁcial to inhibit the Na volatilization during sintering process. As a result, highest Na content was recorded for the MW-850 ◦C-30 min with largest density. In addition, the excessive duration (60 min) might aggravate the volatilization of Na. Fig. 4(c) and (d) depict the Nyquist impedance plots and the ionic conductivities at 25 ◦C of NZSP electro-lytes synthesized by microwave sintering at 850 ◦C for different dura-tion. The total conductivity of MW-850 ◦C-15 min, MW-850 ◦C-30 min, MW-850 ◦C-60 min was calculated to be 2.173 × 10- 4 S cm- 1, 2.511 × 10- 4 S cm- 1, and 1.980 × 10- 4 S cm- 1 respectively. The increased conductivity from 15 min to 30 min was ascribed to the enhanced densiﬁcation. Further prolong the sintering time to 60 min, the pores and cracks produced by the loss of volatile components results in the decreasing of conductivity. In order to evaluate the application of NZSP electrolytes synthesized by microwave sintering method in energy storage devices, Na3V2(PO4)3| NZSP|Na solid sodium battery was assembled and the electrochemical performances were measured. Fig. 5(a) is the galvanostatic charge- discharge curves of the solid sodium battery at 0.5C. The obvious charging and discharging platform could be observed at 3.4 V and 3.3 V, which represents the reversible oxidation process from V3+ to V4+. The ﬁrst charge/discharge speciﬁc capacity was recorded to be 109.0/93.1 mAh g- 1 with Coulomb efﬁciency of 85.37%. The cycling performance associated with the coulomb efﬁciency of the fabricated solid sodium battery under constant current at 0.5C was shown in Fig. 5 (b). It was found that the Coulomb efﬁciency rose to ~95% and tended to be stable after several cycles. After 100th cycle, the speciﬁc discharge capacity was recorded to be 75.7 mAh g- 1 with a capacity retention rate of 81.97%. The capacity fade was mainly due to the deteriorated interface contact between NZSP and Na, owing to the volume change of Na in the process of electroplating and stripping. In addition, the side reactions of the cathode material also affected the electro-chemical performance. 
In summary, this work demonstrated the synthesis of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) solid electrolytes using low temperature and rapid microwave sintering method. Promising ceramic qualities of NZSP pellets with high purity, excellent densiﬁcation, ﬁne grains and dense morphology, beneﬁting by the quickly and uniformly heating of microwave sintering in inhibiting the excessive grain growth. The resultant NZSP electrolytes delivered high relative density of 96% and high room temperature ionic conductivity of 2.511 × 10- 4 S cm- 1 with activation energy of ~0.31 eV. The synthesized NZSP electrolyte applied in Na3V2(PO4)3/C|NZSP| Na solid sodium battery showed good cycling performance. The discharge speciﬁc capacity could be retained at 75.7 mAh g- 1 with a capacity retention rate of 81.97% after 100 cycles. This work reported the microwave sintering synthesis of NZSP solid electrolyte with fasci-nating advantages of energy-saving and time-saving, driving the appli-cation of inorganic solid electrolyte in solid batteries.
