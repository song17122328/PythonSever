Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the dominant technology in the ﬁeld of electrochemical energy storage, but ongoing challenges with cost and safety have driven interest in alternative battery systems.

Sodium-ion batteries (Na-ion, NIBs) have generated signiﬁcant interest as a prospective competitor to LIBs, in part due to the greater earth-abundance of sodium vs. lithium.

Cell voltages for NIBs are modestly lower than their LIB counterparts due to a more positive is +0.2 Cell voltages for NIBs are modestly lower than their LIB counterparts due to a more positive is +0.3 V higher vs. E0 of + potential for Na + ), yet that same potential shift eliminates the requirement for Li/Li copper current collectors at the negative electrode.

As a result, NIBs avoid corrosion issues common to LIBs, and can be taken to a completely discharged state, which is a safer condition for transportation and stationary storage.5 In addition, aluminum current collectors al+ does not readily low for another cost-effective advantage because Na alloy with aluminum at extremely negative potentials, whereas alloy + .5 In addition, aluminum current collectors al+ does not readily low for another cost-effective advantage because Na alloy with aluminum at extremely negative potentials, whereas alloy + .5 Sodium-ion systems are also being formation does occur with Li explored with aqueous electrolytes, which offer further safety and cost advantages.

Many electrode materials that have been developed for LIBs are + -insertion reactions,7,8 but the number of posreadily adapted for Na itive electrode candidates for NIBs outweighs the available choices for the negative electrode.9 Hard carbons have been commonly used for the negative side in NIBs, but suffer from problems associated with large ﬁrst-cycle irreversible capacity and continuous growth of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.

These problems can be avoided by using titanium oxides, which are promising alternative + -insertion in a pocandidates due to their ability to undergo Na + ; note that SEI tential range of relevance (0.10 These problems can be avoided by using titanium oxides, which are promising alternative + -insertion in a pocandidates due to their ability to undergo Na + ; note that SEI tential range of relevance (0.25–1.25–1.5 V vs. Na/Na + formation will occur at potentials <0. Na/Na + formation will occur at potentials <0.5 V vs. Na/Na ) for negative electrode operation.3–5 For example, sodium titanium oxides, in a variety of compositions and crystal habits (e.g., NaxTiO2,11 Na2Ti3O7,12 Na2Ti6O13,13 NaTi3O6(OH)· 2H2O,14 and lepidocrocite structures15), have been extensively investigated for -insertion properties. 

While such titanium-based oxides function effectively for Na insertion reactions in nonaqueous media, their insertion potential lies too far negative to be used in aqueous-electrolyte NIBs.The operating potential of metal-containing insertion compounds can be shiftedto more positive values vs. their oxide counterparts by utilizing the 3–). One such material, inductive effect of the phosphate anion (PO4 + sodium titanium phosphate (NaTi2(PO4)3; NTP), exhibits the Na Super Ionic Conductor (NASICON) structure in its crystalline form and undergoes reversible Na -insertion at an intermediate redox potential + ).17,18 When translated to an aqueous electrolyte (2.17,18 When translated to an aqueous electrolyte (2.1 V vs. Na/Na + -insertion potential (–0.

Thus, NTP can be paired against a positive electrode material such as Na0.19,20 Thus, NTP can be paired against a positive electrode material such as Na0.44MnO2 to construct a compelling energy-storage device using an aqueous electrolyte.21,22-insertion for NTP have focused on crystalline forms because those generally exhibit superior electrochemical properties (high speciﬁc capacities and stable cycling).17–19,21 However, there has yet to be a report on how crystallization of the NTP NASICON structure impacts speciﬁc electrochemical chargestorage processes, for example, surface-limited vs. diffusion-limited mechanisms. Several studies have also shown that the electrochemical behavior of NTP can be enhanced by the addition of conductive carbon networks such as graphene,23–25 carbon nanotubes,26,28 various forms of graphitic carbon,27,28 3D carbon networks,23,29–33 and even a conductive polymer coating. 

With the incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), near theoretical capacity for NTP (133 mAh g–1) can be achieved in either nonaqueous or aqueous systems.23–25In the present paper, we ﬁrst explore the impact of NTP crys-insertion properties (speciﬁc capacity, rate capatallinity on Na bility), as assessed in both nonaqueous and aqueous electrolytes. With an amorphous-to-nanocrystalline series of NTP materials, we -insertion performed a thorough kinetics analysis showing that Na is primarily a surface-limited reaction in amorphous NTP, while nanocrystalline NTP exhibits diffusion-controlled behavior that is consistent with Na -insertion into the bulk solid. We then examine a nanocomposite comprising reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and crystalline NTP (NTP800), demonstrating enhanced Na-ion capacity up to the theoretical value for NTP, consistent with previous reports in nonaqueous23,25 and aqueous electrolyte.

The improved rate capability of NTP800–rGO corresponds with charge-storage becoming more surface-limited, rather than an entirely diffusion-limited mechanism.

The calcined NTP powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Miniﬂex II diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation source. 

The Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw InVia micro-Raman spectrometer equipped with an 1800 lines mm–1 grating and the 514 nm line from an argon ion laser (25 mW) excitation source. Simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed using an SDT Q600 TA Instrument. The samples were heated from room-temperature to ◦ ◦ C min–1 under ﬂowing air (100 mL min–1). C at a ramp rate of 10 900 Electrochemical measurements were carried out in three-electrode ﬂooded cells using either a nonaqueous electrolyte (1 M NaClO4 in propylene carbonate:ﬂuoroethylene carbonate; 95:5, v:v)38 or an aqueous electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4 with 50 mM borate buffer). A borate buffer was added to 1 M Na2SO4 (pH ∼ 5. A borate buffer was added to 1 M Na2SO4 (pH ∼ 5.5) in order to stabilize the pH of the aqueous electrolyte solution to pH ∼ 9, thus suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction at the lower potential limit.39 Working electrodes for both nonaqueous and aqueous experiments were prepared by casting ∼0.39 Working electrodes for both nonaqueous and aqueous experiments were prepared by casting ∼0.5–1 mg of a carbon composite slurry onto stainless-steel mesh and pressed uniaxially at 8000 psi. 

The carbon composite slurries contained 70% active material (including rGO), 25% conductive carbon Super P, and 5% polyvinylidene ﬂuoride binder. For nonaqueous experiments, sodium metal foils served as the counter and reference electrodes and all electrochemical testing was handled in an argon-ﬁlled glovebox (moisture and oxygen levels <1 ppm). Aqueous experiments were carried out using reticulated vitreous carbon as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl; 0. Aqueous experiments were carried out using reticulated vitreous carbon as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode (3 M KCl; 0.21 V vs. S.H.E.) as the reference electrode.

Na/Na ments and –0.95 and –0.95 and –0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl for aqueous measurements. The speciﬁc capacities were measured from the integrated current for each charge–discharge time scale and were normalized to the mass of NTP.

Thermal analysis was used to track the removal of organic byproducts from the Pechini synthesis of NTP, as well as crystallization to the NASICON structure (Figure 1a). Upon heating the as-prepared NTP powder, a sharp weight loss (∼30 wt%) and a corresponding ◦ DSC exotherm are observed from 200–250 C, likely arising from the decomposition of residual organics and loss of structural water. Above ◦ 250 C, gradual weight loss occurs followed by another sharp feature C. The high-temperature DSC in both the TGA and DSC around 700 peak corresponds to crystallization of NTP, as further conﬁrmed by XRD (Figure 1b).

The sharp weight loss at this temperature is alsoFigure 1.The sharp weight loss at this temperature is alsoFigure 1.

(b) X-ray diffraction patterns and (c) Raman spectra collected between 200–1250 cm–1 of NTP500, NTP600, NTP700, and NTP800. (b) X-ray diffraction patterns and (c) Raman spectra collected between 200–1250 cm–1 of NTP500, NTP600, NTP700, and NTP800.

To further assess the crystallization of NTP as a function of heat treatment, Raman scattering spectra were collected in the 200–1200 cm–1 region (see Figure 1c). 

In the 900–1200 cm–1 region, the NTP spectrum is dominated by a peak at 1098 cm–1 and a high-intensity peak at 1010 cm–1.40 In the 900–1200 cm–1 region, the NTP spectrum is dominated by a peak at 1098 cm–1 and a high-intensity peak at 1010 cm–1.

These peaks are assigned to the v1 symmetric stretching mode of the (PO4)3– anion, while peaks at 986 and 972 cm–1 belong to the v3 antisymmetric stretching mode.41 Weak bands above 500 cm–1 are assigned to antisymmetric bending modes v4 while the highly symmetric structure of (PO4)3– anions induces strong bands at 440 cm–1 via symmetric bending motions (v2).

Overall, the intensity of the Raman peaks increases with higher treatment temperatures, indicating a progressively greater degree of crystallinity, with NTP800 showing the highest crystallinity in the NASICON structure (inset in Figure 1c).

Raman scattering provides information not only on the crystallization of NTP, but also on the structure of both adventitious and intentionally added carbon phases. Prominent Raman scattering features for carbons are observed in the 1200–1700 cm–1 spectral region (Figure 3a). For NTP500 and NTP600, we observe two broad peaks characteristic of disordered carbon, a “G” band at ∼1590 cm–1 and a “D” band at ∼1350 cm–1. For NTP500 and NTP600, we observe two broad peaks characteristic of disordered carbon, a “G” band at ∼1590 cm–1 and a “D” band at ∼1350 cm–1. The G band corresponds to the E2g phonon of C sp2 atoms, while the D band arises from defects such as vacancies, grain boundaries, and amorphous carbon species.36,37,43 The peak-intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG) provides a semi-quantitative measure of structural order in the carbon phase. For NTP500 and NTP600, the ID/IG ratio is 1. For NTP500 and NTP600, the ID/IG ratio is 1.01 and 1.01 and 1.03, respectively, indicating a disordered carbon phase that likely arises from the decomposition of organic byproducts of the NTP synthesis. Both carbon peaks disappear for NTP700 and NTP800, indicating that the carbonaceous species have been removed by combustion/oxidation at those treatment temperatures in the presence of air.

Because the inherent electronic conductivity of NTP is poor, it is often combined with conductive carbon additives such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, and graphene.22–27,30–33 Here, we explored integrating rGO with NTP to introduce more electronic pathways and ultimately improve the speciﬁc capacity and charge-storage kinetics. The NTP800–rGO is prepared by dispersing NTP800 powder in a suspension of GO, followed by evaporation of the solvent to wrap the NTP nanoparticles onto GO sheets. Subsequent heating under an inert atmosphere converts GO to RGO while maintaining attachment to the NTP nanoparticles, as conﬁrmed by TEM (Figure 3b). Micrographs of NTP800–rGO show∼60 nm–sized nanoparticles, consistent with the crystallite size determined from XRD line broadening. The nearly transparent rGO sheets shown in the TEM micrograph promote particle-to-particle conductive pathways that facilitate electrochemical charge storage.In addition, the Raman scattering spectrum forFigure 2.In addition, the Raman scattering spectrum forFigure 2.

The XRD results show in the temperature range from 250–600 that heat treatment at 500 C is insufﬁcient to crystallize NTP, while at ◦ C, a phase-pure nanocrystalline NTP is formed.temperatures >600 With increasing calcination temperature, the crystallite size, as calculated by the Scherrer equation, increases from 40 nm at 600 C to ◦ 60 nm at both 700◦ C and 800For a more accurate representation of particle sizes, TEM was performed on this series of amorphous to nanocrystalline NTP materials. Amorphous NTP500 is composed of nanoparticles (∼25 nm) agglomerated in a high concentration of organic residue (Figure 2a). While still appearing agglomerated, the 600 C heat treatment renders the NTP nanoparticles (now ∼25–50 nm) easier to distinguish (Figure 2b), likely due to carbonization of the organic residue. At higher treatment temperatures, NTP700 shows a wide distribution of particle sizes (∼25–100 nm; Figure 2c), whereas NTP800 exhibits a narrower size distribution of larger particles (∼50–100 nm; Figure 2d).

Critical parameters such as speciﬁc capacity and rate capability were determined in both nonaqueous and + aqueous Na -containing electrolytes. Representative voltammograms for powder–composite electrodes containing these NTP materials are shown in Figure 4a (nonaqueous) and 4b (aqueous). In a nonaqueous + electrolyte, NTP500 and NTP600 show broad redox peaks cenNa + tered at a potential of 2. In a nonaqueous + electrolyte, NTP500 and NTP600 show broad redox peaks cenNa + tered at a potential of 2.1 V vs. Na/Na (inset in Figure 3a); integrating the voltammograms yields speciﬁc capacity values that are relatively low (50 mAh g–1 for both NTP500 and NTP600 at 0. Na/Na (inset in Figure 3a); integrating the voltammograms yields speciﬁc capacity values that are relatively low (50 mAh g–1 for both NTP500 and NTP600 at 0.1 mV s–1).A setof small, sharp redox peaks is observed on top of the broad CV waves for NTP600, consistent with the presence of a small quantity of crystalline NTP. In contrast, nanocrystalline NTP700 and NTP800 exhibit + well-deﬁned Na -insertion/de–insertion peaks and speciﬁc capacity approaching 100 mAh g–1. In contrast, nanocrystalline NTP700 and NTP800 exhibit + well-deﬁned Na -insertion/de–insertion peaks and speciﬁc capacity approaching 100 mAh g–1.

Combining NTP800 with rGO yields even higher voltammetric peak currents, corresponding to greater charge-storage capacity. At a modest scan rate (0. At a modest scan rate (0.1 mV s–1), NTP800–rGO achieves the theoretical capacity for NTP of 133 mAh g–1 (normalized to NTP mass). The positive impact of incorporating rGO also extends to rate capabilities, as shown in Figure5b. Capacity retention with increasing scan rate improves when rGO is present with NTP800; at a rate of 10 mV s–1, NTP800–rGO retains 60% of its theoretical capacity.Even though all of the electrodes fabricated from these NTP materials contain SuperFigure 5.Even though all of the electrodes fabricated from these NTP materials contain SuperFigure 5.

One challenge with using aqueous electrolytes for NTP is that the + Na -insertion/de-insertion potential is close to that for the hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, it is necessary to impose a lower potential limit of –0. As a result, it is necessary to impose a lower potential limit of –0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is only 0. Ag/AgCl, which is only 0.15 V negative of the NTP redox potential.6 As a consequence, the available capacity of NTP diminishes at increasing voltammetric scan rates (>10 mV s–1) due to this tight potential window and increasing overpotential and ohmic drop (Figure 5c).Thus, capacity decreases much more quicklywith increasing scan rate in the limited potential range imposed by + the aqueous electrolyte, despite its higher ionic conductivity and Na concentration (Figure 5d).

To investigate the kinetics of Na-insertion/de-insertion in this series of NTP materials, we focused on the nonaqueous electrolyte measurements because of the larger potential window.The cyclic voltammograms were analyzed according to a power-law relation in which the peak current, i, as a function of sweep rate, v, can be used to model charge-storage kinetics:In Equation 1, a and b are adjustable values. Plotting log i vs. log v and taking the resulting slope gives the “b–value”.44 A b–value of 1 corresponds to surface-limited charge storage at the interface of the active material within the carbon composite, whereas a b–value of 0.44 A b–value of 1 corresponds to surface-limited charge storage at the interface of the active material within the carbon composite, whereas a b–value of 0.5 indicates a process limited by semi-inﬁnite diffusion, which in this case corresponds to solid-state Na-ion diffusion within the NASICON structure.

In Figure 6a , theb–value for the cathodic peak is determined for all samples reported in this study. 

Analysis of voltammograms for NTP500 and NTP600 yields b–values of 0. Analysis of voltammograms for NTP500 and NTP600 yields b–values of 0.74 and 0.74 and 0.70, respectively. Such b–values are expected for redox processes involving ﬁnite diffusion, i.e., electrolysis of a thin layer of redox sites.

 On the basisgests a higher capacitive contribution arising from the electric double layer, which was also observed by experimental and numerical predictions of pseudocapacitive T-Nb2O5.45–48 On the basisgests a higher capacitive contribution arising from the electric double layer, which was also observed by experimental and numerical predictions of pseudocapacitive T-Nb2O5.51 The aforementioned analysis underscores the key ﬁnding that amorphous NTP is able to store charge under a surface-limited regime whereas nanocrystalline NTP is limited by semi-inﬁnite diffusion. In addition, in order to enhance charge-storage kinetics, it is crucial to incorporate a conductive carbon network (rGO) to improve through-conductivity of the bulk electrode ﬁlm.

On the basis of the results described above, we selected NTP800– rGO to perform long-term cycling studies. As shown in Figure 7, NTP800–rGO initially stores a speciﬁc capacity of 95 mAh g–1 when cycled at 5 mV s–1 (corresponding to a charge or discharge time of approximately 2 min). After 1000 charge/discharge cycles, the NTP800–rGO speciﬁc capacity is 82 mAh g–1, which translates to a capacity retention of 86%. Coulombic efﬁciency also remains high (>99%) throughout the 1000 cycles.

The results reported herein show that a well-formed NASICON crystal structure for NTP is essential for achieving high levels of + -insertion from either aqueous or nonaqueous electrochemical Na electrolytes. By intimately mixing nanocrystalline NTP with rGO in a nanocomposite, one is able to achieve the theoretical speciﬁc capacity of NTP while also enhancing the kinetics of charge storage. This combination of properties in conjunction with the redox potential of NTP makes such materials promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage systems based on Na-ion electrolytes.
