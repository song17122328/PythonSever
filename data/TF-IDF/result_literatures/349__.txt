NASICON-type Na4MnV(PO4)3 with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been synthesized by the simple sol-gel  reaction and characterized by different analytical techniques. The resulted material has been explored as a  cathode material for rechargeable non-aqueous and aqueous sodium-ion batteries. In non-aqueous electrolytes,  the as-synthesized Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite shows stable discharge capacity of 86 mAh g 0) 1 at 0.1 C and 68  mAh g 0) 1 at 0.2 C after 100 cycles in half-cell and full-cell configurations, respectively. In aqueous electrolytes, it  delivers an initial discharge capacity of 92 mAh g 0) 1 at 1 C rate in half-cells and 97 mAh g 0) 1 at 10 C rate in full cells having NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT as the anode. Stable cycleability and high rate capabilities of Na4MnV(PO4)3 rGO composite can be attributed to the very strong and sustainable conductive percolation networks for both  electrons and Naþ ions. The obtained results reveal that the aqueous electrolyte cell has a huge scope for gird  level energy storage applications.   


The rationales for researching and developing sodium-ion batteries  (SIBs) are the everlasting availability of sodium, the compelling similarity in science and engineering between SIBs and Li-ion batteries, and  the prospect of applying the Na-ion battery technology as stationary  energy storage systems for onand off-grid storage applications [1,2]. To  date, various transition metal oxides such as NaxCoO2, NaxCrO2, [3]  NaxMnO2, [4] P2-Nax[Fe1/2Mn1/2]O2, [5] and O3-Na[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]  O2; and polyanionic compounds such as NaFePO4, [6] Na3V2(PO4)3,  NaFe2(PO4)2(SO4)2, [7] Na2FePO4F, Na1.86□0.14Fe3(PO4)3, [8] Na3V2(PO4)2F3  and Na3V2O2(PO4)2F, [9] had been reported as cathodes for  SIBs. [10–12]. Among these compounds, Na3V2(PO4)3 is of peculiar interest  owing  to  the  NASICON  framework  that  favors  the  reversible  removal/uptake of Na-ions over the voltage plateau of 3.3–3.4 V. This  voltage  is  associated  with  the  electrochemical  activity  of  the  redox  couple V4þ/V3þ and leads to the generation of a specific theoretical  capacity of 110 mAh g 0) 1 [13]. Recently, Zhou et al. replaced half of  vanadium in Na3V2(PO4)3 with other elements to make Na4VM(PO4)3 (M ¼ Fe,  Mn  &  Ni)  without  jeopardizing  the  NASICON  crystalline  arrangement. Of significance, Na4VMn(PO4)3 has shown advantages in  terms of electrochemical performance compared to the other materials,  and has to the promise to be an inexpensive cathode candidate. Indeed,  Na4VMn(PO4)3 exhibited a relatively higher specific capacity (110 mAh  g 0) 1) due to the reaction of up to two Na-ions per unit formula of Na4VMn  (PO4)3, and the simultaneous electrochemical activation of V4þ/V3þ and  Mn3þ/Mn2þ at 3.3 and 3.6 V, respectively [14]. The drawback, however,  is that Na4MnV(PO4)3 is a poor electronic conductor [15]. Nonetheless,  Li  et  al.  improved  the  electronic  conductivity  of  Na4MnV(PO4)3  in  combination with graphene aerogel by means of sol-gel synthesis [16].  The graphene-based composite achieved an energy density of 380 Wh  kg 0) 1 at the 0.5 C rate, and retained 69% of its initial capacity after  completion  of  4000  cycles  at  20  C  in  the  presence  of  non-aqueous  electrolytes  [16].  Despite  these  improvements,  three  major  hurdles  have to be overcome before the implementation of sodium ion batteries  in large scale can happen: 1) most of the sodium-based cathodes are  much more moisture sensitive compared to their lithium-based counterparts; this implies that the handling, processing and fabrication of 

Sodium metal was used as the anode, and 1 M NaClO4  in Propylene  Carbonate (PC) with 5 vol% of Fluoro-Ethylene Carbonate (FEC) was  used as the electrolytes. The coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled  glove box using a borosilicate glass-fiber separator (Whatman GF/D). In  the full-cell tests, the composite NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT was coated onto  an  Al-foil and  used  as  the  anode.  The loading  densities  of  Na4VMn  (PO4)3-rGO  and  NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT  were  0.8  and  1.5 g cm 0) 2,  respectively. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling of the  cells were carried out using the potentiostat VMP3 (Biologic) and battery cycler (Arbin). The half cells were cycled between 2.5 and 3.8 V,  and the full cells were cycled between 0.6 and 1.8 V.  In the case of the aqueous electrolyte, the Na4VMn(PO4)3-rGO based  slurry was coated onto a carbon paper and cut into 10 mm squares and  14.5 mm diameter disc electrodes. In the half-cell configuration, the  active material-coated carbon paper and a bare carbon paper (3 times  bigger) were used as the working and counter electrodes, respectively.  Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode. 1 M Na2SO4, 5 M  NaClO4, and 10 M NaClO4 with 2 v. % Vinylene Carbonate (VC) dissolved in double distilled water were used as electrolytes. In the full-cell  configuration, NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT coated onto a carbon paper was  used as the anode. Beaker-type half-cells were cycled between 0 and  0.82 V in a galvanostatic mode using the potentiostat VMP3 (Biologic,  SP-300)  at  1  C  and  10  C  rates.  The  NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT/Na4MnV  (PO4)3-rGO cells were cycled between 0.8 and 1.65 V at the 10 C rate  based on the cathode material weight.  3. Results and discussion  3.1. Structural and microstructural characterization 

Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite was prepared by sol-gel method. In  this case, we have used Na-acetate, Mn-acetate, NH4H2PO4, V2O5 (all  Sigma-Aldrich), and graphene oxide (GO) as precursors. First V2O5 and  citric acid (2 gm) were dissolved in 20 ml of H2O and stirred at 80 �C to  form a clear blue solution (Solution A). Then, Na-acetate and GO were  also added into solution A. NH4H2PO4 and Mn-acetate were dissolved in  10 ml of H2O (Solution B). After stirring at 80 �C for 30 min, solution B  was added slowly to the solution A and the final solution was continuously stirred at 80 �C for 12 h. Thereafter, the gel was transferred into an  oven and heated up to 180 �C for 3 h. Then, the dry gel was ground and  calcinated under an argon atmosphere at 750 �C for 9 h to obtained pure  Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite. A detailed procedure can be found in  Ref. [16].  2.2. Characterization 

The purity of Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite was checked by x-ray  diffraction (Bruker, Advance D8) with a Cu-Kα radiation (λ ¼ 1.5418 Å)  at room temperature. The particle size and morphology were characterized using the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM,  FEI,  Quanta  650).  A  transmission  electron  microscope  (TEM,  Talos  F200X, FEI) with a 200 kV operating voltage was used to capture the  morphology, EDX spectrum and SAED patterns of the Na4VMn(PO4)3 rGO composite. The Raman spectra of the powders were recorded at  room temperature on a Raman spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,  DXR  smart  Raman)  using  a  monochromatic  He–Ne  laser  (532 nm)  operating at 15 mW. Carbon content was determined by TG analysis  using a TA instrument (TGA800) under synthetic air atmosphere.  The electrochemical studies were carried out using Na4MnV(PO4)3 rGO assembled with a non-aqueous electrolyte in CR2032 coin cells. The  electrode composition was 80 wt % active material, 10 wt% Super-P  carbon and 10 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in the N Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The slurry was coated onto an Al foil. The latter was cut into disc electrodes with a diameter of 14.5 mm. 

Powder  x-ray  pattern  of  the  composite  Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO  compared to a reference is shown in Fig. 1. The indexation confirms that  the material belongs to the trigonal (R-3c) space group with the lattice  parameters a ¼ 8.96354(2) Å and c ¼ 21.48319(7) Å, and the unit cell  volume V ¼ 1494.82(1) Å3, which is in agreement with previous reports.  [34]. The crystalline structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3  is made of Mn/VO6  octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra that share corners, and hence form the  anionic framework [MnV(PO4)3]4 0) . There exists two fully occupied and  independent sodium sites surrounded by different oxygen environments  (i.e. six-fold coordination for Na(1) (6b) site, and eight-fold coordination  for Na(2) (18e) site) [34].  Fig. 2 shows the SEM and TEM images with different magnifications.  The microstructure reveals that rGO is uniformly distributed across the  interconnected  particles  of  Na4MnV(PO4)3  (cf.  Fig.  2aand  b),  which  would help improve the electronic conductivity of the composite cathode. The primary particle average sizes of Na4MnV(PO4)3  are in the  range of 300–500 nm. Fig. 2cand d show TEM images that illustrate the  integration  between  rGO  and  Na4MnV(PO4)3  in  the  composite.  The  carbon weight percentage in the composite was 14 wt% as determined 

The electrochemical performance of the cathode Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO  was checked with different aqueous electrolytes solutions, (1 M Na2SO4,  5 M NaClO4 and 10 M NaClO4 with 2 v.% vinylene carbonate (VC)), in  half cell configurations. Fig. S6 shows the charge-discharge curves of  Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO in aqueous half-cells containing two electrolytes  (1 M Na2SO4 and 5 M NaClO4). 10 M NaClO4 (with 2% VC) provides  better cycle life and good capacity retention compared to the other  electrolyte  formulations.  It  should  be  noted  that  an  optimum  high  electrolyte concentration (e.g. 10 M) exhibits higher ionic conductivity,  because  of  its  high  concentration.  Hence,  10 M  NaClO4  electrolytes  showing  high  performance  compared  to  other  1 M  Na2SO4  and  5 M  NaClO4  electrolytes.  In  view  of  these  results,  the  best  electrolyte  formulation,  10 M  NaClO4  (with  2%  VC),  was  selected  for  further  studies. In our previous studies, we have examined the formation of  passivation layer on electrode surface by using XPS analysis and discussed its impact on electrochemical properties. When VC is added to  the aqueous electrolyte, it stabilizes the electrode surface by making  passivation layer and also decreases the pH of electrolyte to 1.8. At this  low pH values the cell can be cycled comfortably between 0.0 and 0.9 V  [39]. Fig. S7 shows the cyclic voltammetry plots measured between  0  and  0.82 V  vs.  Ag/AgCl  for  a  cell  containing  Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO  electrode and the electrolyte solution 10 M NaClO4  (with 2% VC). It  should be noted that two voltage plateaus were obtained in normal  charge-discharge process. However, splitting of peaks corresponding to  V4þ/3þ and Mn3þ/2þ redox couples were observed in the CV measurements (cf. Fig. S7). In order to corroborate the above peak splitting in CV  plots,  we  again  measured  the  charge-discharge  profile  of  Na4MnV  (PO4)3-rGO under slow current rate, i.e. 0.05 C, in non-aqueous electrolyte (Fig. S8). In that case, two main sloppy voltage plateaus were  observed (Fig. S8a) likely observed in Fig. 4b for fast charge-discharge  process. However, differentiation (dQ/dV) of capacity vs. voltage plot  reveals  two  sub-voltage  regimes  in  each  of  these  voltage  plateaus  (Fig. S8b). The behavior of the peak splitting is not clearly understood as  only two different sodium sites [Na(1) and Na(2)] are available in the  crystal structure. It is known that removal of sodium switching from Na  (2) site to Na(1) site depending on the energetic favorability (state of  charge and discharge). We speculate that each plateau may have additional energetic sites those are responsible for the spitting of the peak.  Details understanding of such behavior is under progress by experimental and simulation studies.  Fig. 7 shows the cyclic stability for the Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite at 1C (110 mAh g 0) 1) and 10 C for 50 cycles in a voltage range of  0–0.82 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The half-cell delivers an initial discharge capacity  of 92 mAh g 0) 1, and 82% of the initial capacity was retained after 10  cycles at 1 C rate. At higher rate (10 C), Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO composite  delivers a stable capacity of 60 mAh g 0) 1  for 40 cycles. The charge discharge  voltage  profiles  for  each  cycle  is  shown  in  Fig.  7b.  The  average voltage of Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO electrode in aqueous electrolytes  is 0.66 vs. Ag/AgCl. The SEM image and cyclic voltammetry results of  the NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT sample in 10 M NaClO4  (with 2% VC) are  shown in Fig. S9 [40].  Fig. 8 shows the electrochemical performances of an aqueous full-cell  fabricated  with  NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT//Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO.  Fig.  8a  shows the cycling performance of the aqueous full-cell in the voltage  range 0.8 V–1.65 V at 10 C rate (1.1 A g 0) 1). The initial discharge capacity of the aqueous cell was 97 mAh g 0) 1, and after 60 cycles, it stabilized at 50 mAh g 0) 1 with 99% coulombic efficiency. Fig. 8a shows the 

The Na4MnV(PO4)3 was synthesized with reduced graphene oxide  (rGO) by the simple sol-gel method. The composite was characterized by  XRD, SEM, TGA and TEM-EDX techniques to confirm the phase purity  and  microstructural  properties.  The  synthesized  Na4MnV(PO4)3-rGO  composite was tested as a cathode material in both aqueous and non aqueous  electrolytes  using  half-cell  and  full-cell  configurations.  The  half-cell delivers a stable discharge capacity of 86 mAh g 0) 1 after 100  cycles at C/10 rate, and can tolerate a very high current rate of 20 C in a  non-aqueous electrolyte. The enhanced performance is mainly due to  the fast mass transport in the NASICON structure and the improved  electronic conductivity in rGO network that is homogenously integrated  with  the  active  particles.  The  assembled  full  cell  with  NaTi2(PO4)3 MWCNT exhibits a discharge capacity of 68 mAh g 0) 1 after 100 cycles at  the 0.2 C rate. Na4MnV(PO4)3 shows the initial discharge capacity of 92  mAh g 0) 1 at 1 C rate in aqueous electrolyte in a half-cell, and 97 mAh  g 0) 1 at 10 C rate when coupled with NaTi2(PO4)3-MWCNT.
