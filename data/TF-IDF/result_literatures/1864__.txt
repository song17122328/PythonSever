Lithium ion conducting glass ceramics composed of the crystalline conductive phase Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3(x = 0 – 1.0) with the Nasicon-type structure have been synthesized and characterized by DTA, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and complex impedance techniques. The experimental results indicated that the glass ceramics were mainly composed   4 S/ of solid solution Li(Ge1   xTix)2(PO4)3 formed by LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 in the whole x range and showed conductivity over 10 cm at room temperature. The maximum room temperature lithium ion conductivity of 6.21  10   4 S/cm with an activation energy as low as 0.32 eV was obtained for the Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 treated at 950 jC for 18 h. Mechanisms for the enhancement of rtotle in glass ceramics were given and discussed. 
The high conductivity, good chemically stability and easy fabrication of the Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 system suggest that they are promising solid electrolytes for all-solid state Li ion rechargeable batteries. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Fast lithium ion conductors are potential electrolytes for utilization in high energy density batteries and other electrochemical devices. For practical use, moreover, the conductors are required to possess good chemical stability and to be easily manufactured.
Glass ceramics is another category of materials of great potential as solid electrolytes. Compared to the sintered polycrystalline materials, they can be made into desired shapes and sizes more easily, have dense microstructure, possess negligible grain boundary effects and exhibit good chemical stability. Hosono and Abe [6], Hosono et al. [7], Fu [8 – 10] and Chowdari et al. [11] have succeeded in obtaining fast lithium ion conductive glass ceramics with ionic conductivity close to 1 10   3 S/cm at 300 K where the conducting crystalline phase essentially consists of NZP structure. It is of immense practical significance to develop and study this type of fast ionic conducting materials.
The current work is concerned with the synthesis and characterization of the glass ceramics in the system Li2O – Al2O3 – MO2 – P2O5 (M = Ti and Ge). Compared to Li1 + xAlxGe2   x(PO4)3, Li1 + xAlxTi2   x(PO4)3 with the Nasicon structure has a higher lithium ion conductivity. But as a host compound for lithium ion migration, Ti4 + may not be as stable as Ge4 + in the presence of Li+ [8,9]; moreover, the glass in the system Li2O – Al2O3 – TiO2 – P2O5 is difficult to fabricate. The purpose of this work is to substitute the germanium in the system Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 partially by titanium, so as to obtain the glass ceramic solid electrolytes with high lithium ion conductivity, good chemical stability and even low cost and favorable productivity. The ionic conductivity of the glass ceramics containing Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 as a major crystalline phase will be mainly evaluated, and the effects of treating conditions on the electrical properties will be systematically investigated.
The composition Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0 – 1.0) was synthesized by the solid state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of lithium carbonate Li2CO3, aluminum hydroxide Al(OH)3, germanium oxide GeO2, titanium oxide TiO2 and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH4H2PO4. The powders were thoroughly mixed by planet ball milling and then heated in an alumina crucible at 700 jC for 2 h. The mixture was cooled, thoroughly reground and then heated up to 1400 – 1500 jC and melted at the temperature for 1 h. The melts were poured onto preheated stainless steel plates and pressed into glass flakes between two steel plates. The glasses were immediately placed in furnace at 500 jC for annealing to relieve the thermal stresses. Finally, the samples were cooled naturally.
Glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) were determined using differential thermal   1 in the analysis (DTA) at a heating rate of 10 K min temperature range of 200 – 900 jC. Based on the DTA data, thermal treatment was done in two steps. In the first step, the samples were heated to the temperature between glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) for 2 h in order to form the crystal nucleus. In the second step, the glassy samples were heated at the temperatures above Tc for different periods to reach the best treating conditions to optimize the conductivity of the glass ceramics.
Crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis at room temperature using Cu Ka radiation. The microstructures of the crystalline phases were observed by means of the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) on the fracture surfaces. Polished samples were served for ionic conductivity measurements. Gold electrodes were sputtered on both sides of the samples as blocking electrodes. Platinum metal foils were used to sandwich the samples on both sides for complex impedance measurements carried out on a Solartron 1260 impedance   1 – 106 Hz. Ionic analyzer with the frequency range of 10 conductivity values were calculated with r = d/AR, where d is the sample thickness; A, the area of the electrodes; and R, resistance of the sample obtained from the complex impedance plots.
Glass formation was first investigated. Fig. 1 shows the DTA profiles of the glasses in the system Li1.4Al0.4 (Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 in the ‘x’ range of 0 – 1.0, from which the glass transition temperatures (Tg) and crystallization temperatures (Tc) were estimated for all specimens. It can be seen that Tc increased gradually with the increasing ‘x’, suggesting that the crystallization of the glasses was more and more difficult. Table 1 summarizes Tg and Tc of the annealed glasses. Tg of the annealed glasses was 546 and 626 jC for the Li2O – Al2O3 – GeO2 – P2O5 and Li2O – A12O3 – TiO2 – P2O5 systems whereas Tc of the annealed glasses was 658 and 688 jC, respectively. The values of Tg and Tc for the two systems were to some extent different from those reported in Ref. [9]. 
The difference would be attributed to different annealing conditions adopted. Increasing the x from 0 to 0.33 resulted in an increase in Tc  Tg, indicating the enhanced thermal stability of the glass with the substitution of Ti4 + ions for Ge4 + ions. However, further increase of x from 0.33 to 1.0 resulted in a decrease in Tc  Tg, representing decreased thermal stability with the increasing content of LiTi2(PO4)3. In short, in the Li1.4Al0.4 (Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 system, the thermal stability of the glass for the composition with x of 0.33 is the best.
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   x Tix)1.6(PO4)3 glass ceramics annealed at 900 jC for 12 h.
Diffraction peaks arising from the solid solution Li(Ge1   xTix)2(PO4)3 formed by LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 were observed in all the specimens. Because no new peak appears as Al3 + ions replace Ge4 + or Ti4 + ions, it is inferred that the added Al3 + ions were incorporated into the structure of Li(Ge1   xTix)2(PO4)3 by replacing Ge4 + or Ti4 + ions. Thus, the precipitated conducting phase can be expressed as Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3. Diffraction peaks due to AlPO4 began to appear when 0.5. These results indicate that Li(Ge1   xTix)2(PO4)3 is x the major crystalline phase in all the specimens. When x was increased, the diffraction peak positions had the trend to shift toward the peak positions of LiTi2(PO4)3. In addition, the peaks became narrower and narrower, which demonstrated an inhibition effect for titanium replacement on controlling the growth of particle size of the crystalline conducting phase.
The room temperature complex impedance plots (Cole – Cole plot) are illustrated in Fig. 3 for Li1.4Al0.4 (Ge1   xTix)1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0 – 1.0) glass ceramics treated at 900 jC for 12 h. It can be seen that only one semicircle was observed for all samples. As known, for a fast ionic conductor, the choice of the electrode materials is important for an accurate determination of rionic. Especially, when blocking electrodes are used in the case of compounds with   1), the semicircle in the high high rionic (10 frequency (MHz) range due to the bulk impedance will usually be covered by the linear region of the interfacial impedance [9,10,12 – 14]. 
The disappearance of the bulk impedance semicircle in the impedance profile at room temperature could be ascribed to the very low resistance of the bulk, which usually responses at very high frequencies, for example, over 106 Hz. The total resistance (Rb + Rgb) of the sample was obtained from the right intercept of the semicircle with the real axis in the plots, and the bulk resistance (Rb) was obtained from the left intercept of the semicircle with the real axis. The value of the grain boundary resistance (Rgb) was therefore the difference between (Rb + Rgb) and Rb. The Rb, Rgb and (Rb + Rgb) were used to calculate the corresponding values of rb (bulk conductivity), rgb (grain boundary conductivity) and rtotle (total conductivity), respectively, and the results are listed in Table. 2. As seen, the rtotle increases rapidly at first with increasing ‘x’ and then decreases with further increases of ‘x’. 
It is obvious that in a wide composition   4 S/ range, the glass ceramics exhibit conductivity over 10 cm at room temperature, and a maximum conductivity 3.85 10   4 S/cm at room temperature was obtained when x was 0.33, viz Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3. It should be pointed out that the room temperature conductivity for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, 1.85  10 is much lower than the value reported in Ref. [8].
In Fig. 5, the XRD patterns of the specimens treated than the crystallization at various temperatures higher temperature for 12 h are shown. Diffraction peaks arising from the solid solution Li(Ge0.67Ti0.33)2(PO4)3 are observed in all the specimens, and no impurity peaks were found as Al3 + ions replaced Ge4 + or Ti4 + ions, indicating that only the crystalline Nasicon type phase was formed. Thus, the precipitated conducting phase can be expressed as Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3. It was also seen from the values near the most intense peaks in the figure that the intensity of the peaks due to solid solution Li(Ge0.67Ti0.33)2(PO4)3 increased when the treating temperature increased from 800 to 950 jC, indicating gradual growth of the Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67 Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 phase. However, further increase in the treating temperature to 1000 jC decreased the diffraction intensity of the specimen to some extent. Therefore, 950 jC was suggested as the best treating temperature.
Arrhenius plots of Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 glass ceramics treated at various temperatures for 12 h are shown in Fig. 4(B). The plots of log (rtotleT) against 1000/T are found to be linear and fit the Arrhenius equation. In the testing range, no break was observed on the Arrhenius plot. The data are listed in Table 2. As seen, the room temperature conductivity increases remarkably with the increased treating temperature from 800 to 950 jC, a maximum value, 5.26  10   4 S/cm, was obtained for the specimen treated at 950 jC. However, further increase of treating temperature decreased the conductivity unexpectedly. It can also be seen that a minimal Ea value of 0.32e V was obtained for the treating temperature at 950 jC, which might be the reason why the Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 glass ceramics treated at 950 jC demonstrated the highest room temperature conductivity. The results agreed with XRD results (Fig. 5).
Fig. 6 shows the room temperature complex impedance plots for Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 glass ceramics treated at 950 jC for various periods. From the plots, it can be found that the (Rb + Rgb) decreased with the extension of treating time from 6 to 18 h, and then increased with further extension of the treating time. A maximum room temperature conductivity of 6.21 10   4 S/cm was obtained for the sample treated for 18 h. In addition, the minimum activation energy of 0.32 eV was obtained from the same specimen as listed in Table 2. It is interesting that both Rb and Rgb decreased with increasing treating time when the treating time was less than 18 h, but further increase in treating time over 18 h led to the increase of Rgb, while Rb was nearly kept constant. The obvious increase in Rgb was probably due to the appearance of pores and cracks in intergranular region, which caused the decrease in the total lithium ion conductivity of the specimen.
Preliminary research work on the influence of microstructure of the glass ceramics on their electrical properties was carried out. FESEM micrographs for Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67 Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3 glass ceramics treated at 950 jC for 6 and 18 h are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that much glassfeatured phase still remained in the specimen treated for 6 h. In addition, the grain size of the crystalline phase was not uniform. When the treating time was extended to 18 h, wellcrystallized grains with average size of about 300 nm were formed. The microstructure of the specimen treated for 18 h indicated its dense and much better crystalline aspect, which endows the material high conductivity and low activation energy. Detailed mechanism analysis on the grain growth and the influence of microstructure on the electrical properties of the glass ceramics are underway.
Fast lithium ion conducting glass ceramics containing Li1.4Al0.4(Ge1   xTix)2(PO4)3 crystalline phase have been successfully prepared from Li2O – Al2O3 – (GeO2 – TiO2) – P2O5 glasses. The glass ceramics exhibit conductivity higher than 1 10   4 S/cm over a wide composition range at room temperature, and at the same time, demonstrate good chemical stability and easy productivity. The compound Li1.4Al0.4(Ge0.67Ti0.33)1.6(PO4)3, i.e. x = 0.33, treated at 950 jC for 18 h displays the best thermal stability, as well as the maximum room temperature conductivity as high as 6.21 10   4 S/cm and the minimum Ea of 0.32 eV, which suggests that the electrolyte is a promising candidate in allsolid state Lithium ion rechargeable batteries.
