EXPERIMENTAL

Syntheses of Li(1~x)MnxTi(2~x)Crx(PO4)3 (x"0, 0.5, 1) were carried out using conventional solid-state reaction techniques. Powder crystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of (MnCO3xH2O), TiO2, Cr2O3, NH4H2PO4, and Li2CO3, in stoichiometric proportions. The mixtures

The X-ray di!raction data were collected at room temperature with a Philips PW 1820 di!ractometer (CuKa) equipped with a di!racted beam monochromator. The data were collected in the 14}1203 range in steps of 0.023 (2h), with a constant counting time of 40 s per step. The re"nement of the structure by the Rietveld method was performed using the Fullprof program (25).

Electrochemical intercalation was carried out in lithium cells with the following electrochemical chain: Li/LiClO4 (1 M) (in propylene carbonate)/Nasicon (70 wt%)#graphite (28 wt%)#polytetra#uoroethylene (2 wt%). Cells were assembled in an argon-"lled dry box and galvanostatically cycled under low current density ( j"40 lA/cm2 for an active mass of 15 mg) at room temperature, with a homemade cycling system managed by an HP 1000 computer (26). For the OCV experiments, in order to be as close as possible to the equilibrium conditions, the relaxation was interrupted when the slope of the <"f (t) curve was equal to 1 mV/h. For the structural characterization of electrochemically intercalated materials, larger cells were built without polytetra#uoroethylene ( j"20 lA/cm2 for an active mass of 80 mg).

The X-ray of Li(1~x)Mnx Ti(2~x)Crx(PO4)3 (x"0, 0.5) shows that these materials are isostructural with MnTiCr(PO4)3, which crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, space group: R31 c (11). The progressive substitution of manganese for lithium and of chromium for titanium leads to an increase of the c)%9. hexagonal parameter and to a slight decrease of the a)%9. parameter (Table 1). In order to determine the e!ect of manganese and chromium substitution in LiTi2(PO4)3, we focused our attention on the Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5 (PO4)3 composition, which appears to be representative of the general behavior of the Li(1~x)MnxTi(2~x)Crx(PO4)3 (0(x(1) system. The manganese, chromium, and titanium cationic distribution was studied by Rietveld analysis.

Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 are assumed to be statistically distributed within the B octahedral sites of the B2(PO4)3 framework. As was found for the Mn-Nasicon compounds Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, MnTiCr(PO4)3 and LiMn0.5TiCr(PO4)3 (10, 11), the Mn atoms are supposed to occupy only the M1 site. Note that for the materials involved in the present study, the R31 c space group leads to a statistical distribution of Mn2‘ ions within the M1 site, whereas in the case of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (R31 space group), the Mn2‘ ions are ordered in every other M1 site along the c-axis (10). The atomic positions in MnTiCr(PO4)3 were used as starting of Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3. The re"nement was done in two steps. In the "rst, the lithium ions were ignored: this structural model leads to satisfactory reliability factors "4.2%). As a consequence of the very "10.2%, RB (RWP small atomic di!usion factor of Li‘ ions, the Rietveld re"nement using XRD data does not permit the location of lithium without ambiguity. As will be shown later, an electrochemical study has demonstrated that the Li‘ ions in Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 are localized in the M1 site. In a second step, the Rietveld analysis was thus performed with the lithium ions in the M1 site. As expected, this second hypothesis leads to a small improvement of the reliability "3.5%). the atomic positions of factors (RWP Mn, Ti, Cr, and O remain very similar in the two hypotheses. The "tted X-ray di!raction pro"le and the results of the Rietveld re"nement are given in Fig. 1 and Table 2, respectively. The re"nement assuming the presence of lithium ions in the M2 site does not lead to an improvement of the relationability factors. Moreover, this hypothesis is not expected since the corner-sharing Nasicon structure tends to favor the occupation of only one type of sites if the chemical formula allows it.

Cr(PO4)3, In Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5 Cr0.5(PO4)3, the Li(Mn)}O2 distance between the cation at the center of the M1 site (6b position) and the surrounding O2 oxygen atoms (36f position) is equal to 2.24 A_ , which is intermediate in MnTiCr(PO4)3 (2.22 A_ ) and the Li}O2 one in LiTi2(PO4)3 (2.26 A_ ) (Table 3). Therefore, the Li(Mn)}O2 distance in Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 appears to be in good agreement with the statistical occupancy of the M1 site by Mn and Li atoms. Note that the c)%9. parameter increases when Li‘ ions in LiTi2(PO4)3 are replaced by Mn2‘ ions, as "0.74 A_ and expected from the di!erence in ionic radii (R‘L* R2‘M/ (27)). In Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 and MnTiCr(PO4)3, the distortions of the Ti(Cr)O6 octahedra are similar; they are greater than the TiO6 ones in the case of LiTi2(PO4)3. This is due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion between Ti(Cr) and the divalent manganese ions in comparison to the Ti}Li one. In the case of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the ordered distribution of manganese and vacancies along the ribbon leads to a large distortion for half the TiO6 octahedra which are in the vicinity of the Mn2‘ ions and to almost no distortion for the

The electrochemical intercalation study was carried out using Li//Li(0.5‘y)Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 cells. The OCV curve obtained for the "rst discharge is reported in Fig. 3 in comparison to those of LiTi2(PO4)3 and Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3. In previous studies, we have shown that the "lling of the M2 site in titanium-based Nasicon phases leads to a potential close to 2.5 V (7, 13, 28). This value was especially well shown in the case of the LiTi2(PO4)3}Li3Ti2(PO4)3 system, for which a neutron di!raction study showed that the M1 site is completely occupied for LiTi2(PO4)3 and completely empty for Li3Ti2(PO4)3 (28). Very recent reinvestigation of this system showed that in the latter material, the lithium ions are not in the center of the M2 site, but occupy a distorted tetrahedral site (M3) localized between M2 and M1 (28) as was recently found for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Li3V2(PO4)3 (22, 29).

In the case of Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the "lling of half the M1 sites that were initially empty ([Mn0.5 0.5]M1Ti2(PO4)3) leads to a potential plateau in the vicinity of 2.8}3.0 V. Note that when the [Li0.5Mn0.5]M1Ti2(PO4)3 composition is exceeded, lithium ions are intercalated further into the M2 site and a 2.5}2.2 V voltage range is obtained. This di!erence in cell voltage related to lithium intercalation in M1 and M2 sites was also found in the LiyMn(0.5‘x)Ti(2~2x)Cr2x(PO4)3 (04x40.50) system, where the number of lithium ions which can be intercalated in the vicinity of 3 V is equal to the number of vacancies (0.5!x) in the M1 site (13). A general comparison of all these experiments and the similarity between the observed potentials suggest that the lithium ions intercalated in Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 occupy the M2 site. Therefore, one can assume that in this phase, the M1 sites are fully occupied.

formula unit, to give Li2Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 in OCV experiments. This intercalation corresponds to the reduction of all the titanium ions to the trivalent state. The powder XRD patterns of the Li(0.5‘y)Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (y"0. 1.5) phases are compared in Fig. 4. After intercalation, the crystallinity remains good although a slight broadening the di!raction lines appears. The hexagonal cell of "8.510(1) A_ ; parameters of Li2Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (a)%9. "20.949(2) A_ ) show a very slight variation in comparic)%9. son to those of the Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 starting phase. At this point, one question arises: does the 0.5 lithium ion present in the starting material remain in the M1 site or does it move to the M2 site? These two hypotheses lead to

Rietveld re"nement of the XRD pattern and lithium intercalation were used as complementary methods to characterize the distribution of lithium and manganese ions in Li0.5Mn0.5Ti1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3. It was shown that Li and Mn occupy statistically the M1 sites and that the lithium ions electrochemically intercalated in this structure are localized in the M2 site. Neutron di!raction experiments are in progress to unambiguously con"rm these results.
