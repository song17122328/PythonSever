Mixed phosphates of K and Zr have been prepared by means of the reactions of hydrated ZrOCl2 and NH4H2PO4 salts with KNO3 in the temperature range 250–550°C. Molten salt reactions were studied by thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry of the evolved gases. Thermal analysis of the ternary mixture demonstrated that a strongly exothermic mass loss occurs at ca. 250°C, due to the reaction producing a KHZr(PO4)2 phase. Depending on the reaction conditions, dierent solids can be obtained, including dispersed zirconia superﬁcially doped with phosphate or crystalline ternary phosphates such as KZr2(PO4)3 of NASICON structure or the layered compound K2Zr(PO4)2. The solidsobtained were characterized by X-ray diraction, 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy. A correlation of 31P chemical shift and the mean electronegativity of the obtained solids has been proposed.

After the reaction, the insoluble product was extracted at room temperature from the solidiﬁed melt by distilled water, then dried in air at 100°C for 24 h. Some samples of the solidiﬁed melts were taken directly for the characterizations. In the reaction mixtures the atomic ratio P/Zr varied from 0.1 to 10. Potassium nitrate was always taken in a tenfold molar excess relative to the amount of Zr salt.

Study of the reaction products

Molten nitrates as reaction media provide some original possibilities for the preparation of solid materials. Reactions in molten nitrates have been utilized for the preparation of ﬁnely divided oxides for applications in ceramics or catalysis. Highly dispersed oxides of Zr, Al or Ti have been obtained by the reactions of the mixtures of the corresponding metal salts with the alkali-metal nitrates.1–3 In such syntheses molten nitrates react as oxobases (Lux–Flood bases), i.e. they donate an oxide ion to any appropriate electrophilic species, causing precipitation of an oxide (that of Mg, Al, Ti, Zr) or formation 2−, MoO42−). of some soluble oxoanions (SO4 If the nitrate melts are doped with polyvalent oxoanions like sulfate, phosphate or molybdate, interactions between the oxoanions and other metalspecies canlead to various products such as ﬁne dispersions similar to the supported catalysts (molybdate species on zirconia4) or complex ternary and quaternary salts, for example calcium chromate.5 Few works deal with the chemistry of phosphates in the nitrate melts. Solubility of alkali-metal phosphates in molten nitrates and the acidobasic transformations of phosphate ions in molten nitrate have been reported earlier.6–8 Ion exchange isotherms of a-Zr phosphate in dierent nitrate melts have been obtained.9–11 However, chemical reactions of phosphate and transition-metal species in the nitrate melts were never studied. Ternary and more complex phosphates including Zr possess physicochemical for applications interesting ion exchangers,12 high-temperature ion conductors,13 as catalysts14,15 and non-linear optics materials.16 Recently, the possibility offorming ternary zirconium–alkalimetal phosphates in K–Na low-melting point mixtures has been reported,17 which opens a new soft chemistry route for the preparation of these important solids. The present work deals with the study of the reactions of zirconium and phosphate species in the KNO3 melt and the characterization of its solid products.

The reaction was studied using a mass spectrometer Gas trace A (Fisons Instruments) equipped with a quadrupole analyser (VG analyser) working in a Faraday mode. Mixtures containing ca. 1 g of salts were heated in a glass cell with a heating rate of 1.5°C min−1 from room temperature to 550°C. A silica capillary tube heated at 180°C continuously bled o gaseous reaction products. Signals were registered with m/z 15, 18, 30, 32, 36, 44, 46, corresponding respectively to NH (from NH3), H2O, NO, O2, HCl, CO2 and NO2. Thermogravimetric measurements were carried out using a Paulik D1500 device in the platinum crucibles in air, the heating parameters being the same as in the mass spectrometric study. X-Ray diractograms (XRD) were recorded on a Siemens D500 diractometer using Ni-ﬁltered Cu-Ka radiation. Standard ﬁles of JCPDS were employed to identify the phases. Simulation of powder XRD patterns was made using the Powder Cell 1.8 program.18 Surface areas and pore radii distributions were measured by nitrogen adsorption. 31P and 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker MSL 300 device. MAS spectra (ca. 3.5 KHz) were registered with the proton decoupling of the 31P signal. Chemical analyses of phosphorus, zirconium and alkali metals were carried out using an atomic emission method with a spectroﬂame ICPD device.


Zirconium oxychloride octahydrate, ammonium hydrophosphate NH4H2PO4 and potassium nitrate (all Aldrich ACS reagents) were employed as the reactants. The reaction was carried out reactor under a nitrogen ﬂow. Dehydration at 150°C for 2 h and reaction at 250–550°C for 2 h were subsequently carried out (unless otherwise stated).

Results and Discussion

Reactions of the precursor compounds and their mixtures (DTA–DTG and MS data)

Sincein thesystem ZrOCl2–KNO3–NH4H2PO4 allthe components can react with each other, understanding of the ternary system can be strongly assisted by comparison with the reactions of simpler binary mixtures and/or decomposition of the individual precursor compounds. Therefore some of the DTA–DTG and MS data are presented below for binary mixtures.

ZrOCl2+KNO3. Decomposition of ZrOCl2Ω8H2O in air commences at rather low temperature (ca. 100°C) and above ca. 370°C leads to the formation of crystalline ZrO2.19 While heating ZrOCl2Ω8H2O in air, endothermic peaks due to dehydration at 130 and 160°C are followed by the progressive mass decrease up to 500°C, without any thermal events. Mass spectrometric data show that after elimination of water, the only gaseous product is HCl. The mass loss observed at 530°C was 59.1%; the calculated value for the reaction (1) is 61.5%. (1) Dierential thermal analysis of the ZrOCl2Ω8H2O reaction with the low-melting point NaNO3–KaNO3 mixture has been discussed earlier,19 whereas here we used individual KNO3. Compared to the NaNO3–KNO3 mixture, the curve in pure KNO3 diers by the absence of distinct reaction peaks in the high temperature domain (Fig. 1). The endothermic events are the dehydration of zirconium salt (at 100°C), the a–b transition in solid KNO3 (140°C) and its melting (334°C). The smearing of the mass loss over the temperature scale seems to be related to the higher melting point of KNO3 (334°C). Apparently, at the moment of KNO3 melting a signiﬁcant amount of the zirconium oxychloride is already decomposed. The observed mass loss (68%) is intermediate between the value observed for ZrOCl2Ω8H2O decomposition and calculated for the reaction (2) (78%): (2) The mass spectrum of the same (preliminary dehydrated at 100°C) mixture is shown in Fig. 2. It corresponds to eqn. (2) above 300°C but there is no production of oxygen at lower temperatures. At the same time strong peaks of NO and NO2 appeared at 180°C (NO2 gas gives the signals of m/z 30 and 46 with an intensity ratio of 10, as observed elsewhere20). It can be explained by the reaction with the impurity of highly reactive nitrite, always present in the commercial nitrate [eqn. (3)]. (3) On the basis of the observed DTA–DTG and MS data, it can be stated that the reaction of hydrated ZrOCl2 in KNO3 occurs as a superposition of reactions (1)–(3). The solid product obtained at 500°C is dispersed ZrO2 as discussed in ref. 19. Note that the H2O curve of the mass spectrum does not coincide with the dehydration maximum in Fig. 1 since the mixtures taken for MS study were dried at 100°C in an oven overnight, to avoid the presence of water which tends to condense in the capillary and block it. NH4HPO4+KNO3. On the DTA–DTG curvesof this binary mixture (Fig. 3), dehydration of ammonium salt with the endothermic mass decrease is seen (190, 250°C); then an

Two narrowmasslossesat 525–530°C and580–600°C were observed, havingopposite thermal eects. XRD data show that the solidiﬁed melt after the reaction at 350°C contained a large amount of potassium metaphosphate KPO3 whereas that after 550°C contained orthophosphate K3PO4 and some pyrophosphate K4P2O7. Therefore, the mass loss at 350°C can be related to the reaction of the ammonium salt with the nitrate yielding KPO3 [eqn. (4)], whereas the high temperature peaks are due to the further acid–base reactions leading to the orthophosphate. NH4H2PO4+KNO3 129)KPO3+NO+1/2N2+3H2O (4) (5) The presence of K4P2O7 in the reaction products and two equal peaks on the DTG curve allow us to conclude that reaction (5) is in fact the sum of two steps: (6) (7) The mass spectra of gaseousproducts are presented in Fig. 4.

mixture compared to any of the binary mixtures is a strong exothermic eect at ca. 250°C, with a narrow peak of mass loss in the DTG curve (Fig. 6). Since the event at 250°C was found only in the ternary mixture, it must relate to a reaction of all the three compounds composing the ternary mixture. This reaction cannot be classiﬁed as a Lux–Flood interaction, because the amounts of oxygen and nitrogen oxides evolved at 250°C are very small (Fig. 7). We suggest that it is a metathetical reaction which occurs due to a strong anity of phosphate for the Zr species. At 240–250°C the reaction mixture remains solid though it strongly sinters. XRD of the mixture after heating at 250°C showed the appearance of KHZr(PO4)2 crystals (JCPDS card 28-0759, Fig. 8), so that

Only the beginning of NO2 formation due to the reactions (6) and (7) could be observed in the glass reactor used for the MS studies. NH4H2PO4+ZrOCl2. Thermal analysis (Fig. 5) showed an exothermic process widely spread over the temperature range. The mass loss measured at 500°C for the mixture of atomic ratio P/Zr=2 was 52.5%; the calculated value for reaction (8) is 51.9%.

of the layered phase. Though the XRD pattern obtained could be perfectly indexed as an individual hexagonal phase with a=5.716 A˚ and c=9.012A˚, no identiﬁcation with the JCPDS catalogue was possible. However, the best ﬁt was obtained with the JCPDS card 45-232 for K2Zr(PO4)2.23 All the lines ﬁtted except for a strong line at d=4.004 A˚ in our pattern and one at d=3.735 A˚ in ref. 23. Probably, there is an error in the article and consequently in the JCPDS card. The structure determination anhydrous K2Zr(PO4)2 monocrystal has been done earlier.24 This phase possesses a layered structure and crystallizes in the space group P 3´. However, no powder diractogram has been reported in ref. 24. Taking the atomic coordinates from ref. 24, we simulated the XRD pattern using the Powder Cell program.18 Calculated XRD peaks positions and intensities coincided with those observed by us experimentally. Note also that metaphosphate and pyrophosphate ions are present in the melt as the intermediate products in the course of reaction, but there are no signs of their interaction with Zr species. Apparently, since these anions are less basic than orthophosphate, the stability of their complexes with ZrIV is lower.

P/Zr ratio

Solid products of the ternary reaction

NH4H2PO4+ZrOCl2+KNO3 as a function of temperature and Here are presented the results of the characterization of the products obtained by water extraction from the solidiﬁed melts. As follows from the chemical analyses, all the Zr loaded in the reaction mixtures was found in the precipitates, whatever the reaction conditions were. No Zr species was found in the washing solutions. Unless otherwise stated the solids were characterized after thorough washing with distilled water and oven drying at 120°C. The properties of the solids vs. the reaction temperature and the P/Zr ratio are listed in Table 1. The ratios P/Zr from 0.1 to 10 have been studied for the reaction temperatures 350°C (samples 1–4) or 500°C (samples 5–9). Chemical analyses show a tendency of phosphate to be bound within the water-insoluble solid, even if no crystalline Zr phosphates are formed (P/Zr=0.1). Since the samples 1 and 5 contained only the ZrO2 phase (Fig. 9) we suppose that in these samples phosphate groups are anchored on the surface of the dispersed zirconia. Increase of the speciﬁc surface area of zirconia due to the phosphate admixture is observed (200 m2 g−1, sample 5), compared to that of the non-doped zirconia prepared using the same method (130 m2 g−1, ref. 19). This stabilizing eect of a polyvalent oxoanion on the zirconia dispersions seems to be a general phenomenon, described earlier for molybdate and sulfate.25 For the ratios of P/Zr=0.3 or 1 (samples 2, 6), narrow lines of crystalline K–Zr phosphates appeared, the solids being present as mixtures of dierent ternary phosphates with dispersed zirconia. These samples are not homogeneous because of a P/Zr ratio insucient to produce any pure compounds. Speciﬁc surfaces are intermediate between those of doped zirconia (P/Zr=0.1) and crystalline phosphates. Pure ternary compounds can be obtained at the ratios P/Zr4. In this case the reaction temperature determines the natureof the product. NASICON is the only product at 350°C whatever the duration of the reaction (Fig. 9). The layered phasewas obtained at 500°Cbut it contained someNASICON impurity. To prepare the pure layered compound, the reaction temperature should be increased to 550°C. 31P NMR MAS 31P spectra with proton decoupling of the samples 4, 5 and 10 are presented in Fig. 10, showing characteristic bands of the NASICON phase in the sample 4 (d −24.9) and layered

(9) Reaction (9) is the simplest one including all the reactants and the products; it does not have any mechanistic value. Side reactions are of course possible, including decomposition of salts and(or) the binary reactions discussed above. Some KZr2(PO4)3 phase with the NASICON structure (JCPDScard 35-0756) was observed in the mixture after heating at 270°C [eqn. (10)]. NASICON becomes the only reaction product at 350°C. It is likely that NASICON was produced from the decomposition of zirconium–potassium hydrogen phosphate.21,22 (10) At higher temperatures, the mass spectra and DTG curves of the ternary mixture containing excess of phosphate almost coincide with those of the binary NH4H2PO4+KNO3 mixture, showing the transformation of KPO3 to K3PO4 independently of the reactions of the Zr compounds. The XRD study shows that beginning from 400°C the NASICON phase gradually transforms to the layered phosphate K2Zr(PO4)2 though no distinct features in the thermal analysis curves or in the mass spectra can be related to this transformation. The reaction producing the layered phase can be formally written as the addition to the latter of orthophosphate, without the production of any gases [eqn. (11)]. (11) Further enrichment of the Zr-containing product with phosphate or(and) potassium never occurred for the conditions applied. K5Zr(PO4)3 phase could not be obtained even at 550°C and P/Zr=10. Some remarks should be made concerning the identiﬁcation

The sample 5, prepared at P/Zr=0.1 and consisting of the phosphate-modiﬁed tetragonal ZrO2 phase, showed a single broad band atd −9.12. Since in this sample the phosphate groups are anchored on a heterogeneous surface of zirconium oxide, the resonance band is broadened. In the earlier works,26 the chemical shift of 31P in the orthophosphates was related to the electronegativity of the next-neighbour cations, so that the progressive decrease of the environment increase of the chemical shift. Therefore, replacing the Zr coordinating a phosphate group with a K+ ion should increase the value of d. For the anhydrous orthophosphates containing only one cation and no other anions than orthophosphate, the chemical shift was expressed in the form: d(ppm)=−35.5(EN)+41, where EN is the Pauling electronegativity of the cation. For the solids studied here the second coordination shell of 31P can include K, Zr and H. We tried to ﬁnd a correlation between the composition of the solids prepared in this work (and some lit. references) and the isotropic chemical shift of 31P. Excluding from consideration any proton-containing solids, a quite good correlation could be obtained between the


chemical shift of phosphorus and the mean electronegativity x of the solid, calculated according to eqn. (12),27 x=[∑i(x*i)1/2+1.36z]/∑i(x*i)−1/2 (12) where x*i are the electronegativities of the constituent elements and z is the total charge of a chemical entity. The linear dependence of the chemical shift on the mean electronegativity obeys the formula d(ppm)=117−54x, with a correlation coecient of 0.997 for the points indicated in Fig. 11. Although being satisfactory for the points selected, the above relation is of course of no general value, because both hydrogencontaining solids and those with several dierent phosphorous species in the structure cannot be described by this relation. 1H NMR The spectra were obtained after heating the samples in a vacuum oven at 120°C overnight to remove as much of the absorbed water as possible. However, since the spectra were obtained in air, a large signal of adsorbed water at d ca. 4.7 was found in all the products. This was the only signal for the sample 5 (consisting of phosphate-modiﬁed zirconia). Apart from the adsorbed water, three narrow bands have been found

Therefore, the molten salt technique provides a ﬂexible way for the preparation of dispersed mixed phases, containing dierent oxoanions and (transition)-metal cations, which may present great interest for catalysis and other applications.
