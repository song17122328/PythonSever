shown in Figure 1b. All of the Na-superstructure reflections disappear as expected. The diffraction pattern was indexed in the space group R3h with a ) 8.316(1) Å and c ) 22.484(1) Å, which is very similar to those of B-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (R3h; a ) 8.3162(4) Å and c ) 22.459(1) Å).8,25 There is thus a strong increase in the c axis along with a decrease in the a axis when Na+ is substituted by Li+. The origin of the expansion in c is probably the same as that suggested by Delmas26 on reduction from LiTi2(PO4)3 to Li3Ti2(PO4)3 and as that we have recently discovered for the corresponding Li3Fe2(PO4)3 NASICON structure:25 namely, the M(1) crystallographic site of the NASICON structure, which is fully occupied in the sodium phase, is emptied in the lithium phase. This results in a strong repulsion between neighboring MO6 octahedral faces along [001]. In B-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (R3h), Li lies in a unique 4-fold-coordinated crystallographic site, shifted by approximately 0.8 Å along [001] from the M(2) site of the NASICON structure. We designate this as M(3) and propose that Li lies in a similar location in the B-LVP (R3h) structure.

Electrochemical oxidation of B-Li3V2(PO4)3 under slow potentiodynamic conditions (10 mV/1.5 h) up to 4.1 V followed by equilibration shows that almost 2 Li can be extracted from the framework (Figure 2a).28 Examination of the cyclic voltamogram and the corresponding chronoamperogram shows that oxidation of the V3+ to V4+/Li deinsertion is a two-phase process with an equilibrium potential of 3.77 V. Significant deviation from diffusion-controlled kinetics occurs during this

The charge-discharge profile of B-Li3V2(PO4)3 under galvanostatic control (Figure 2b) confirms that two alkali cations/electrons can be extracted under these conditions, which minimize possible parasitic electrolyte oxidation. On subsequent discharge, a polarization in the discharge curve at x ) 1 is observed and only 1.3 Li are reinserted (QR ) 90 mA 226)h/g), suggesting a kinetic limitation to the reinsertion of Li, which may be due to the structural changes incurred on extraction of 2 Li. This may be due to the localization of Li in the M(1) sites and/or the effective contraction along the c axis that also results or other structural effects that hinder displacement of Li from these sites.32 Future work will focus on suppression of the transition by selective doping of the framework.

 The capacity loss may also be partly due to degradation of electrical contact between the current collector and the cathode material due to the strong anistropic contraction of the unit cell and/ or partial dissolution of vanadium from the lattice on oxidation. Initial results from chemical analysis of the electrolyte following oxidation indicated only a very small V content in solution that would not account for the capacity loss; however, we cannot rule out the possibility of V entrapment in the binder or on the surface of the carbon particles.

Figure 3. 7Li MAS NMR spectra for (a) B-Li3V2(PO4)3 and (b) B-LiV2(PO4)3 at 4.1 V after potentiostatic equilibration. The spectra were recorded on a Bruker DSX200 with a rotorsynchronized echo pulse sequence, using a pulse width of 1.2  237)s, which corresponded to a 90° flip angle. Spectra are referenced externally to solid 7LiCl at 0 ppm, and the isotropic resonances are marked on the spectra; all other peaks are spinning sidebands.

from the population of the M(2) sites, apparently toward preferential occupation of M(1)-related sites and by concomitant oxidation of V3+ ions to V4+.

7Li MAS NMR studies of the initial sample and of that equilibrated at 4.1 V support this proposal. The starting material, B-Li3V2(PO4)3, exhibits a single resonance at 85 ppm (Figure 3a) corresponding to Li in the 4-foldcoordinated M(3) site of the NASICON structure.25 Extraction of up to 2 Li in the two-phase process results in the disappearance of the signal and the appearance of a single peak at 62 ppm (Figure 3b). We attribute the latter to a single M(1)-related site, as suggested by the large contraction of the c parameter in the oxidized sample. Occupation of the M(1) site in LiTi2(PO4)3 has also been previously suggested on the basis of static NMR data.30 This slight alteration in the site geometry, along with the difference in the Fermi contact term between V3+ (Li3V2(PO4)3) and V4+ (LiV2(PO4)3), ac-
