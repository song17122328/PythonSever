Development of highly reversible multi-electron reaction per redox center in NASICON-structured cathodematerials is desired to improve the energy density of Sodium-ion batteries.
Here, we investigated more than one electronstorage of Na in Na3VCr(PO4)3. Combining a series of advanced characterization techniques such as ex situ 51V solid-statenuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray absorption near edge structure and in situ X-ray diffraction, we reveal that, V3+/V4+ andV4+/V5+ redox couples in the materials can be accessed, leading to 1.5-electron reaction.
It is also found that a light changeon the local electronic and structural states or phase change could be observed after the first cycle, resulting in the fastcapacity fade at room temperature.
We also showed the irreversibility of the phase changes could be largely suppressed atlow temperature, and thus leading to a much improved electrochemical performance.
The redox coupleV3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+ could be observed form a series ofcharacterization techniques such as in situ XRD , ex situsolid state NMR and XANES.
The mechanism of the capacitydecay from the slight structural irreversibility withthe formation of a metastable phase at the room temperaturewas also revealed by these characterization techniques.
Besides, by suppressing the irreversibility at frozentemperature, we showed that the performance will belargely improved, and with 92% retention after 200 cycleshas been achieved.
