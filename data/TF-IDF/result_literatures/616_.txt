The compound NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 is successfully synthesized via a solid state reaction route and its crystal structure is determined using powder X-ray diﬀraction data.
NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 phase is also characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 crystallizes with the well-known NASICON-type structure.
SAED and HRTEM experiments conﬁrm the structural −2 polyanions is detected.
The electrochemical tests indicate model, and no ordering between the PO4 that NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 is a 3 V sodium intercalating cathode.
The electrical conductivity is relatively low (2.2 × 10−6 Scm−1 at 200 °C) and the obtained activation energy is ∼0.60eV.
The GITT experiments indicate that the diﬀusivity values are in the range of 10−11-10−12 cm2/s within the measured sodium concentrations.
−3 and SO4Compounds of the NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor) family are being reinvestigated as electrode materials for sodium-, lithium-, and magnesium-ion batteries.
Previously, they were extensively studied for their luminescence and gas sensor-properties [5–7], and as potential hosts for radioactive waste.
Of signiﬁcance, NASICON compounds possess solid electrolytes properties owing totheir pronounced ionic conductivity.
The ﬁrst NASICON compound NaZr2(PO4)3, belonging to the family AxM2(XO4)3, was synthesized by Sljukic et al. in 1967, and its crystal structure was solved a year later by Hagman and Kierkegaard.
The structure has the rhombohedral symmetry space group R-3c and consists of 3D M2(XO4)3 skeleton made of corner sharing MO6∗ Corresponding author.
