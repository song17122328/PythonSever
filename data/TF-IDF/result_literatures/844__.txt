NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor) structures of NaxMV(PO4)3 (M = Mn, Fe, Ni) were prepared, characterized by aberration-corrected STEM and synchrotron radiation, and demonstrated to be durable cathode materials for rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. 

In Na4MnV(PO4)3, two redox couples of Mn3+/Mn2+ and V4+/V3+ are accessed with two voltage plateaus located at 3. In Na4MnV(PO4)3, two redox couples of Mn3+/Mn2+ and V4+/V3+ are accessed with two voltage plateaus located at 3.6 and 3.6 and 3.3 V and a capacity of 101 mAh g−1 at 1 C. 

Furthermore, the Na4MnV(PO4)3 cathode delivers a high initial eﬃciency of 97%, long durability over 1000 cycles, and good rate performance to 10 C. 

The robust framework structure and stable electrochemical performance makes it a reliable cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries.KEYWORDS: Sodium cathodes, framework oxide, manganese oxidation, Na+ transport, STEMThe layered sodium cathode materials commonly exhibit multiple phase changes and strongly sloping discharge voltages, and the cyanoperovskites have potential environmental problems due to the cyanide anions. 

Among the framework structures, Na3V2(PO4)3 with the NASICON type structure delivers the best electrochemical performance,16−19 showing a highly reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 with a ﬂat voltage plateau of 3. Among the framework structures, Na3V2(PO4)3 with the NASICON type structure delivers the best electrochemical performance,16−19 showing a highly reversible capacity of 110 mA h g−1 with a ﬂat voltage plateau of 3.3− 3.3− 3.4 V associated with the V4+/V3+ redox couple.The initial Coulombic eﬃciency can reach as high as 97% with good cycling and rate performance owing to the fast Na+ transfer inthe crystal structure. Although Na3V2(PO4)3 shows potential promise in terms of applications, the substitution of V with other lower-cost and earth-abundant active redox elements remains desirable due to the relatively high cost of elemental V. Moreover, the replacement of V allows for a possibility to improve the cell voltage.

Here, we report an investigation of NASICON structured Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na3FeV(PO4)3, and Na4NiV(PO4)3 as cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries. 

Both Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 materials deliver an initial capacity of over 100 mAh g−1 and show stable capacities over 1000 cycles. Na4MnV(PO4)3 exhibits two ﬂat voltage plateaus located at about 3. Na4MnV(PO4)3 exhibits two ﬂat voltage plateaus located at about 3.6 and 3.6 and 3.3 V; Na3FeV(PO4)3 shows two voltage plateaus at 3.3 V; Na3FeV(PO4)3 shows two voltage plateaus at 3.3 and 2.3 and 2.5 V, both with good capacity retention at 10 C, showing they are highly durable cathodes for sodium-ion batteries with cost-eﬀective elements for large-scale energy storage applications.

Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 were synthesized using a sol−gel method followed by calcination of the precursor at 650 °C in argon.

Letterdiameter of 100 nm stack together with some interparticle pores. In this nanostructure, the small particle dimension and generous interparticle void space allows the good contact with carbon particles and so improves the electrical conductivity since the transition metal phosphates usually suﬀer from low electrical conductivity as cathode materials. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) images in Figure 1 show that both Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 have an ordered single phase crystal structure, and the particle maintains this structure all of the way to the surface. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis gives strong signals of Mn, V, O and Fe, V, O, indicating a welldistributed existence of elemental Mn, V, O and Fe, V, O in Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information), respectively.

Rietveld analysis of the X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) pattern conﬁrmed the existence of a pure single phase (in Figure 2, Figure S2, and Table S1). 

The lattice parameters obtained for the Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanoparticles were a = 8. 

The lattice parameters obtained for the Na4MnV(PO4)3 nanoparticles were a = 8.9647 Å and c = 21.9647 Å and c = 21.4938 Å with a R3̅c trigonal structure; these values compare well with the existing structure of Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3.4938 Å with a R3̅c trigonal structure; these values compare well with the existing structure of Na4Fe2+Fe3+(PO4)3.21 Na4MnV(PO4)3 has a corner-shared Mn/VO6 octahedral and tetrahedral units to establish the anion framework PO4 [MnV(PO4)3]4− (Figure 2b). Two types of independent Na cations are located in the interstitial space of the framework with diﬀerent oxygen environments, one for 6-fold coordination (Na1), and three have 10-fold coordination (Na2) per formula unit.22 Owing to a stronger bonding force between O and Na at Na1 sites, the Na2 cations are more easily extracted and inserted in the electrochemical redox process of energy storage.The structure of Na3FeV(PO4)3 is a little diﬀerent from that of the Na4MnV(PO4)3; a cooperative distortion of theFigure 2.

FeO6 octahedron distorts the crystal structure to monoclinic (Figure 2d).23 Nevertheless, Na cations in both are located in two diﬀerent the framework with multidimensional Na+ migration pathways.

The contrast of Na and O in STEM is much weaker and not clearly discernible in most projections owing to the relatively low atomic number; the only exception is at the [210] zone axis where the Na columns show up next to the P columns (Figure 3b). As shown in Figure 3a−b, the framework structure with void space in the atomic alignment for sodium migration along the [−111] and [210] directions can be clearly observed. More projected lattice images along other directions of the [001], [110], and [42−1] planes in Na4MnV(PO4)3 are shown in Figure S3, where an individual Mn/V surrounded by six PO4 at a regular hexagon can be observed in a [001] direction, in good agreement with the atomic arrangement of the NASICON structure.In four directions of [−111], [110], [5−21], and [48−1], clear pictures of Na-ion transportation channels can be identiﬁed, and the dimension of the channel is larger than theLetterdiameter of the Na+, which allows the fast transport of Na+ in these channels (Figure 3c−d and Figure S3).

Electrodes prepared from Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 were examined in coin-type half-cells with sodium metal as a counter electrode. 

The electrochemical behaviors of two materials were ﬁrst determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans (Figure S5). 

Both Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 show two redox couples, which can be assigned to the multistep reduction mechanism of transition metals. 

According to previously reported results, the redox peaks centered at about 3.

 According to previously reported results, the redox peaks centered at about 3.6−3.6−3.5 V, 3.5 V, 3.4−3.4−3.2 V, and 2.2 V, and 2.7−2.7−2.4 V can be attributed, respectively, to the equilibrium voltage of the Mn3+/ Mn2+, V4+/V3+, and Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couples.16,28,29 In agreement with the CV data, two well-deﬁned charge/discharge plateaus were observed in both Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 (in Figure 5a,b).The Na4MnV(PO4)3 delivers aFigure 5.The Na4MnV(PO4)3 delivers aFigure 5.

Na3FeV(PO4)3 gives a capacity around 103 mAh g−1 at 1 C with two charge/ discharge plateaus at 3. Na3FeV(PO4)3 gives a capacity around 103 mAh g−1 at 1 C with two charge/ discharge plateaus at 3.3 and 2.3 and 2.5 V, corresponding to the redox behavior of V4+/V3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+. Neither the Na4MnV(PO4)3 nor the Na3FeV(PO4)3 electrodes experienced signiﬁcant capacity loss as the C-rate was increased from 1C to 10C (from 101 mA h g−1 to 90 mA h g−1), demonstrating excellent rate performance, which can be attributed to the uniform nanosize of the particles aggregated with a porous morphology and to high speed Na+ migration in the NASICON framework structure.

Both compounds show a high initial Coulombic eﬃciency of around 96−97% followed by a stable Coulombic eﬃciency around 99%, indicating a low initial sodium loss in the formation cycles, which beneﬁts theirapplication as commercial cathodes since there is no need for an excess sodium source in the full cells. On longer cycling at 1C, stable discharge capacities were observed for both structures, as is shown in Figure 5c. After 1000 cycles, capacities of 90 mA h g−1 and 100 mA h g−1 were obtained for Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3, respectively, corresponding to the capacity retentions of around 89% and 95%. 

Generally, the manganese-based polyanion compounds suﬀer from some structural distortion in the high oxidation state the appearance of a cooperative Jahn−Teller because of the Mn3+.31 The good long-term cycling distortion at performance of Na4MnV(PO4)3 indicates the presence of V4+ suppresses the cooperative geometric distortion and ensures the structural stability of the Na4MnV(PO4)3 framework during long-term extraction and insertion of sodium ions.

To determine the structural change of the Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 cathodes during the extraction and insertion of sodium-ions, ex situ XRD patterns were obtained at diﬀerent depths of the ﬁrst charge and discharge process and are plotted in Figure 6 and Figure S6.

To determine the structural change of the Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 cathodes during the extraction and insertion of sodium-ions, ex situ XRD patterns were obtained at diﬀerent depths of the ﬁrst charge and discharge process and are plotted in Figure 6 and Figure S6. The growth of new peaks and simultaneous decrease of existing peaks were clearly observed throughout the entire ﬁrst cycle. The peak at 2θ = 31−32° for both cathodes disappeared completely when charged to 3. The peak at 2θ = 31−32° for both cathodes disappeared completely when charged to 3.8 V and recovered gradually during discharge. The peak at 2θ = 35−36° experienced an obvious continuously right−left shift in the charge−discharge process, which is consistent with a change of crystal lattices when the transition metal in octahedral MO6 is oxidized/reduced, accompanied by sodium ion extraction/insertion. 

In addition, some peaks experience merging or splitting, but they recover their original shapes after a full cycle. 

These phenomena are typically observed in two-phase reactions and suggest that both Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na3FeV(PO4)3 undergo successive framework,32 biphasic transitions that preserve the overall which is consistent with the two well-deﬁned charge−discharge voltage plateaus and superior electrochemical stability.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were carried out to examine the oxidation states of manganese and vanadium in Na4MnV(PO4)3 at diﬀerent charge states (Figure S7). The charge process is expected to be accompanied by the oxidation of vanadium from V3+ to V4+ and then manganese from Mn2+ to Mn3+. Upon charge to 3. Upon charge to 3.5 V, the binding energy of V increased from 523.5 V, the binding energy of V increased from 523.8 to 525.8 to 525.1 eV, and the peak of Mn 2p does not show any obvious shift indicating the formation of a higher oxidation state only of V.16,17 After further charge to 3.16,17 After further charge to 3.8 V, the binding energy of Mn 2p3/2 increased to 642.8 V, the binding energy of Mn 2p3/2 increased to 642.8 eV from 641.8 eV from 641.9 eV, indicating the formation of Mn3+.33 These results show the successive two-step two Na+ ions from the Na4MnV(PO4)3 extraction of accompanied by the successive oxidation of V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+.

To investigate further these two-metal phosphates, Na4NiV(PO4)3 was prepared through a similar method; but a pure NASICON phase was not obtained after many tries, which may be because of the formation of some pyrophosphate during the heat treatment (Figure S8).34 In a half cell, as shown in Figure 7, Na4NiV(PO4)3 shows a slightly oblique voltage plateau from 3.34 In a half cell, as shown in Figure 7, Na4NiV(PO4)3 shows a slightly oblique voltage plateau from 3.9 to 3.9 to 3.3 V with capacities near 80 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 70 mA h g−1 at 5 C, indicating that more than one sodium ion can be reversibly extracted.

After 500 cycles, a capacity of 67 mA h g−1 at 5 C was retained, around 83% of initial capacity, indicating astable structure during long-term sodium extraction-insertion cycling. 

The XPS spectra show that the bonding energy of V increased and the bonding energy of Ni did not change when charged to 3. The XPS spectra show that the bonding energy of V increased and the bonding energy of Ni did not change when charged to 3.5 V, corresponding to the exclusive oxidation of V3+/V4+ at this stage (Figure S9). 

Interestingly, the bonding energy of both V and Ni slightly increased after charge to 4.35 Interestingly, the bonding energy of both V and Ni slightly increased after charge to 4.0 V, meaning that both V and Ni were oxidized during the charge process. Since less than two sodium ions were extracted in Na4NiV(PO4)3, the Ni2+ and V4+ were both partially oxidized to Ni3+ and V5+ during charge from 3. Since less than two sodium ions were extracted in Na4NiV(PO4)3, the Ni2+ and V4+ were both partially oxidized to Ni3+ and V5+ during charge from 3.5 to 4.5 to 4.0 V.

In conclusion, we prepared three cathode materials for a sodium-ion battery that not only show an acceptable capacity and good initial eﬃciency but also have long durability and excellent rate performance needed for real applications. In Na4MnV(PO4)3, the introduction of Mn lowers the cost of materials and improves the voltage compared with the Na3V2(PO4)3; the presence of V suppresses a cooperative Jahn−Teller distortion of Mn3+ during charge and stabilizes the structure over long cycling. 

Therefore, the combination of Mn and V integrates the beneﬁts from each and addresses the problems of each. In addition, these materials exhibit fast ionic transport paths for facile sodium ion diﬀusion that, coupled with the nanosized morphology, are capable of charge and discharge in a matter of minutes. Compared with the lithiumion batteries presently ubiquitous, these cathodes oﬀer a promising low-cost alternative for stationary electric power storage.
