NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 is one of the most promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries,delivering about two Naþ-ions extraction/insertion from/into the unit structure.

However, the lowelectronic conductivity which leads to bad rate capability and poor cycle performance, limits its practicalapplication for sodium-ion batteries.

To overcome the kinetic problem, we attempt to prepare the carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanocrystals further decorated by graphene sheets and doped with Mg2þ ionvia the two steps of sol-gel process and solid-state treatment for the first time.

 Such architecture synergistically combines the advantages of two-dimensional graphene sheets and 0-dimensional Mg2þdoped Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanoparticles.

It greatly increases the electron/Naþ-ion transport kinetics andassures the electrode structure integrity, leading to attractive electrochemical performance.

When usedas sodium-ion batteries cathode, the hybrid composite delivers an initial discharge capacity of115.2 mAh g1 at 0.2 C rate, and retains stable discharge capacities of 113.1, 109.0, 102.4, 94.0 and85.2 mAh g1 at high current rates of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 C rate, respectively.

Thus, this nanostructuredesign provides a promising pathway for developing high-performance Na3V2(PO4)3 material for sodium-ion batteries.

Nowadays, as one type of promising device for large-scale energy storage, the rechargeable sodium-ion battery is considered asthe optimal alternative for the traditional lithium-ion battery dueto its lower cost, more uniform distribution, and higher abundanceof sodium resources in the earth's crust [1–4].

Among the compositions of sodium-ion battery, cathode material plays a key rolein determining the electrochemical property of the battery.

Hence,in order to develop superior sodium-ion batteries, one of the mainchallenges should be to enhance the electronic and ionic conductivities of the cathode materials to improve the Na-storageperformances [5].

In recent years, many cathode materials, such as NaxCoO2 [6],NaLi0.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 [7], NaMnO2 [8], Na0.95V3O8 [9], Na2FePO4F/C[10], NaFePO4 [11], Na3V2(PO4)3 [12–14], Na0.7Fe0.7Mn0.3O2 [15]and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 [16], have been extensively studied for sodiumion batteries and all of them have exhibited certain reversiblecapacity and cycling stability.

Among the various materials, theNASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 has attracted much attention becauseof its high theoretical energy density (400 Wh kg1), good thermal stability and open three-dimensional framework with largeinterstitial channels [17–19].

Nevertheless, the poor intrinsicelectronic conductivity of the pure Na3V2(PO4)3, which resultsfrom the separation of the VO6 octahedra from the PO4 tetrahedrain the rhombohedral structure, limits its practical use [17].

Inprinciple, there are two approaches of increasing the transportkinetics: the first is to vary the composition of the electrode material by doping a slight amount of other alien ions [20–22] inorder to make it sufficiently mixed conducting; the second, whichappears most promising in this case, is to modify the surface ofNa3V2(PO4)3 with carbon [17,23–27] or graphene [28,29], and toprovide an effective conducting network.

For instance, Masquelier's group reported that substitution of aluminum for vanadiumin Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3 significantly increases the theoretical energydensity of the electrode (425 Wh kg1) [30].

prepared acarbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 which could deliver a capacity of44 mAh g1 at 200 C, which outshined of commonly used lithiumion batteries cathode including LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 [24].

suggested that graphene supported Na3V2(PO4)3could provide a superior cyclability and 93% capacity retention canbe obtained at a rate of 1 C after 100 cycles [31].

Although the rateperformance and cycling stability have been largely enhanced recently, the achieved electrochemical property of NASICON-typeNa3V2(PO4)3, especially at high rate performance, is by no meanscomparable with high performance lithium-ion batteries cathodematerials.

Obviously, most of the previously reported papers aremerely focused on one of the above approaches, and thus lead to alimited improvement in the battery performance.

Herein, we firstly attempt to synthesize and characterize thecarbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 nanocrystals further decorated bygraphene sheets and doped with Mg2þ ion using a sol-gel routeand followed by the solid-state treatment.

For comparison, thesample modified only with graphene as well as the pureNa3V2(PO4)3/C were also prepared by the same process.

Thecharge/discharge capacities and cycling performances of the asprepared electrode materials when used in sodium-ion batteriesare investigated.

As excepted, this hybrid composite exhibits betterbattery performance than other electrodes.

The possible reasonsare studied and discussed in this paper in detail.

In summary, we propose and synthesize the NVP/C nanocrystals further decorated by graphene sheets and doped with Mg2þion using a sol-gel route and followed by the solid-state treatment.

XRD results reveal that the obtained G-NVMgP/C has a high purityNASICON phosphate phase and the graphene sheets as well asMg2þ-ions have no influence on the structure of NVP/C material.

SEM and TEM images show that the NVMgP/C nanoparticles areadhered inside the graphene sheets, forming a three-dimensionalconductive network which can greatly facilitate the transport ofelectron/ion.

 The G-NVMgP/C is able to deliver a reversible capacity of 115.2 mAh g1 (ca.98% of the theoretical capacity) at a lowrate of 0.2 C.

 Furthermore, a good capacity retention of 92.1% canbe maintained after 200 cycles at 5 C.

The remarkable batteryperformance of G-NVMgP/C electrode makes this 3.4 V-class hybrid composite a promising alternative for sodium-ion batteries.
