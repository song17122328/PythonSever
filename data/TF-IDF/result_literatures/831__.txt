Symmetric sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) have become a research focus since they employ bi-functional electrode materials as both the cathode and the anode, resulting in reduced manufacturing cost and simpliﬁed fabrication process. Layered oxide bi-functional materials have received great attention recently, while phosphate analogues have rarely been involved in the same energy storage system. 

Herein, we report a new phosphate compound of Na3Co0. Herein, we report a new phosphate compound of Na3Co0.5Mn0.5Mn0.5Ti(PO4)3, and investigate the electrochemical performances of this bi-functional material in traditional organic electrolyte.

However, one of major issues for developing NIBs is to nd suitable electrode materials that can accommodate sodium-ions with suﬃcient capacity and reversibility.3,4 To date, great eﬀorts have been made in the search of cathode or anode materials, and usually a sodium-insertion cathode designed in a sodium-rich state (a discharged state) acts as a sodium-ion reservoir to provide removable sodiumions for the sodium-decient anode, so as to enable a rocking chair NIB.

Based on this understanding, most designs of sodium-ion full-cells are asymmetric, i.e., one side is consisted of sodium-rich transition metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues or polyanionic compounds, while the other side is sodiumdecient metal oxide, carbon-based or alloy materials.7–13 As comparison, symmetric NIBs are promising from a commercial standpoint because this so-called bi-functional material can simplify electrode design and reduce manufacturing cost in a single powder preparation and slurry casting process for bothPolyanions provide potential advantages such as good structural and thermal stability, at voltage response on sodium-ion (de)intercalation, and better capacity retention endowed by their structural energetics and robust frameworks.18,19 frameworks, phosphate-based systems are arguably the best in terms of thermal and chemical stability. 

Importantly, the widely available commercialized material in LIBs, lithium iron phosphate, sheds light on us to develop safe phosphate analogues in NIBs. In addition, phosphate-based sodium compounds have the advantage of lacking signicant sensitivity to ambient atmosphere, i.e., H2O and CO2, which enabled them as a more promising candidate for commercialization when comparing to sodium layered metal oxides.20,21Herein, we reported the electrochemical performance of a new phosphate-based compound Na3Co0.
