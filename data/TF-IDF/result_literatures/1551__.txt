Li 1 – x Ti 2 – x Nb x ( PO 4 ) 3 NASICON materials are prepared and studied by X-ray diffraction, 7 Li and 31 P NMR spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. V acancy mobility in Li 1 – x Ti 2 – x Nb x ( PO 4 ) 3 is lower than interstitial lithium mobility. Nb 5+ cations with low doping levels increase cation mobility in LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 .

NASICON double phosphates attract the attention of researchers on account of their high cation mobility and thermal and hydrolytic stability. The LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 structure is built of Ti 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 units, which are composed of two TiO 6 octahedra linked via corner sharing with three PO 4 tetrahedra [1, 2]. Lithium cations can occupy two types of interstices: M1 interstices are in the inversion center and surrounded by six oxygen atoms, and M2 interstices are on the third-order rotation axis and formed by eight oxygen atoms [3]. The alternation of these two types of interstices along the conduction channels forms a three-dimensional network over which rapid ion transport occurs. Heterovalent doping is a popular strategy for improving ion conductivity. We used this strategy for modifying LiZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 (a NASICON structure), where Zr 4+ was in part replaced by Nb 5+ or Ta 5+ [4]. The incorporation of pentavalent cations was found to stimulate the transition of the LiZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 structure from triclinic to rhombohedral and to increase low-temperature cation mobility. It is of interest to apply the same strategy to structurally allied lithium titanium phosphate LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 . Studies on cation mobility in NASICON lithium titanium phosphate are rather few. We can only mention the 7 Li NMR and impedance spectroscopic study of cation mobility in LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 [5]. That study discovered that lithium ions enter a mobile state at 230–330 K. No data have been found in the literature on the properties of LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 materials doped with pentavalent niobium. Here, we prepare Li 1 – x Ti 2 – x Nb x ( PO 4 ) 3 lithium titanium phosphates and study cation mobility in these materials.

Test materials were synthesized by ceramic technology by the scheme (1) where x = 0, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.2. All reagents were carefully ground with a mortar and pestle and sintered in platinum crucibles at 870 K for 4 h. Then, the sinter was again ground to homogeneity, compacted into disks to improve particle–particle interactions, and finally annealed at 1300 K for 10 h. X-ray powder diffraction was measured on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (Cu K α radiation) equipped with a high-temperature attachment at temperatures from 293 to 973 K in ≈ 100 -K steps and 2-min preexposure at each temperature. The Rigaku Application Data Processing program package was used for spectral data processing and qualitative analysis. Conductivity was measured in cylinder-shaped disks ( R = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) with platinum electrodes within 298–873 K using an IPU-62 ac bridge at frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz. Conductivity was found by extrapolation of bulk conductance semicircles to the resistance axis. Wide-line 7 Li NMR spectra were recorded within 80–320 K at 34 MHz on a Tesla BS-567A spectrometer modified for recording wide lines. 31 P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker MSL-300 spectrometer with Fourier transform and magic angle spinning (the spinning rate was 3000 Hz) at 121.5 MHz (SW = 125 kHz). Chemical shifts were determined relative to 85% phosphoric acid.

Undoped LiTi 2 ( PO4)3 is a single phase and crystallizes in hexagonal crystal system as probed by X-ray powder diffraction. Partial (10%) substitution of Nb5+ for Ti4+ in the LiTi2(PO4)3 structure does not affect the phase composition of the resulting materials. Doping of LiTi2(PO4)3 brings about linear increases in the unit cell parameters ‡ and Ò (Fig. 1). Heating to 973 K does not change the phase state of LiTi2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2). The reflections 012 and 104 shift toward small angles, whereas the reflection 110 does not shift. Similar evolution is observed in other angle ranges. This is because thermal expansion coefficients in various directions are not equal. The parameter Ò increases from 20.864(5) to 21.287(9) Å upon heating from 300 to 973 K, whereas the parameter ‡ changes as little as from 8.519(1) to 8.523(2) Å. Thus, the thermal expansion coefficient is (3.20 ± 4.06) × 10–7 ä–1 along axis ‡ and (3.95 ± 0.10) × 10–5 ä–1 (two orders of magnitude greater) along axis Ò. Earlier [4], we established a similar temperature dependence of unit cell parameters in hexagonal NASICON LiZr2(PO4)3: its parameter Ò increased, whereas the parameter ‡ decreased. Moreover, low values of thermal expansion coefficients for NASICON structures are known from the literature [5]. The 31P MAS NMR spectrum of LiTi2(PO4)3 is a singlet at –27.5 ppm (Fig. 3). This is characteristic of the hexagonal NASICON structure, in which all phosphorus atoms are equivalent [6]. Doping broadens the line and gives rise to a signal at –32.2 ppm, whose intensity increases with niobium doping level. This signal is due to the higher polarization of P–O–Nb bonds compared to P–O–Ti bonds and the associated appearance of nonequivalent phosphorus atoms in the structure. In addition, the inhomogeneous surroundings of phosphate ions in doped samples bring about broadening of spectral lines. The low-temperature conductivity of the test materials is relatively low and affected by ambient humidity. At higher temperatures, ambient factors are negligible. Therefore, ion conductivity was measured in the range 390–920 K. The activation energy of conduction for a set of Li1 – xTi2 – xNbx(PO4)3 samples changes only weakly with increasing substitution level, being 60–70 kJ/mol (Fig. 4). However, conductivity changes nonuniformly with increasing doping level. For example, the substitution of Nb5+ for 1% Ti4+ in LiTi2(PO4)3 gives rise to a small increase in conductivity (Fig. 4; curves a, d). As the niobium level increases further, however, the conductivity decreases systematically. Defect generation upon niobium(III) doping of LiTi2(PO4)3 can be described by the quasi-chemical reaction (2) where “*” and “'”, respectively, denote the positive and negative charges of ions relative to the charge of the relevant lattice site. The excess charge of dopant niobium ions relative to the Ti4+ positions is balanced by vacancy formation in lithium positions. For this reason, conductivity slightly increases at the initial doping stages. As the doping level increases, vacancy association comes into play and the effective vacancy density increases far more slowly. Moreover, because of the constancy of the equilibrium constant of defect formation (after Schottky, = const), the interstitial lithium concentration noticeably decreases. Wide-line 7Li NMR spectra are an important source of cation mobility data (Fig. 5). The spectrum of LiTi2(PO4)3 at 118 K is a poorly resolved triplet with the quadrupole splitting constant ëQ = 9.9 kHz. Below 183 K, only a weak increase in ëQ occurs; during further heating, the constant increases considerably (Fig. 6). Temperature elevation above 183 K increases cation mobility in the structure; Li+ cations leave M1 positions and in part enter M2 positions. There are indications in the literature [7] that quadrupole splitting in less symmetrical M2 sites is far stronger. However, the spectrum is averaged because of the high lithium mobility; as a “NbTi PO4( )3”/LiTi2 PO4( )3 = VLi' TiTi NbTi* 3PO4 P O4( ),+ + + VLi'[ ] Lii*[ ] Lii*[ ] result, the average quadrupole splitting constant ëQincreases with temperature elevation. The Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound relationship [8] is useful to estimate the correlation time τc of lithium ion diffusion. This is the relationship between the hopping frequency νc and the 7Li NMR line width: (3) Here, ∆H1/2 is the line width at half-height at a particular temperature, Hz; ∆Hr.l. is the 7Li NMR line width for a rigid lattice, Hz; and α is a constant function of line shape. On the correlation time versus temperature curve for the undoped sample (Fig. 7, curve a), we can distinguish the range 150–275 K where the correlation time systematically drops because of a systematic increase in cation mobility. In the range 275–300 K, the correlation time decreases abruptly, most likely, because of the phase transition we described in [9]. In the sample in which niobium substitutes for 5% titanium, however, the relevant transformations are displaced toward higher temperatures. The abrupt drop in correlation time is observed in this sample only above 350 K (Fig. 7, curve b). Proceeding from 7Li NMR and conductivity data in combination with a considerable increase in LiTi2(PO4)3 conductivity in response to increasing interstitial lithium concentration [9], we may infer that vacancy mobility in LiTi2(PO4)3 is far lower than interstitial lithium mobility. To summarize, we have demonstrated that low Nb5+ doping levels increase cation mobility in LiTi2(PO4)3. However, conductivity decreases with increasing niobium level as a result of defect association. 7Li NMR and impedance spectroscopy shows that vacancy mobility in Li1 – xTi2 – xNbx(PO4)3 is lower than interstitial lithium mobility.
