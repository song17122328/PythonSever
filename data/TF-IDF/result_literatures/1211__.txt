Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a NASICON-type structure is shown to be synthesised with the particle surface found to be coated with amorphous carbon with its thickness in the range of 25–32 nm. The crystallographic planes (hkl) are labelled according to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations towards the as-prepared Na3V2(PO4)2F3. The performances of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 have been investigated in lithiumand sodium-ion  1 with an average discharge plateau around 4 V vs. batteries, exhibiting a speciﬁc capacity of 147 mA h g  1 with three discharge plateaus in sodium-ion batteries. A predominant Li ion Li+/Li, and 111.5 mA h g insertion mechanism is veriﬁed by comparing the redox potentials from CV and charge/discharge curves. It is found that the main migration from/into the crystallographic sites of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 of Li ions is favoured to obtain satisfactory properties by a two-step process, while the Na ions are found to require three steps. The stable and three-dimensional open framework of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is considered to be vital for the excellent C-rate and cycling performances, as well as the fast ion diﬀusion with a magnitude of  1, which could demonstrate that Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is a multifunctional dual cathode for both 10 lithium and sodium ion batteries and capable to be a promising candidate in the construction of highenergy batteries.

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been of considerable interest worldwide due to their comparably high stored energy densities with their advantages successful commercialization in a variety of portable electronic devices.1,2 However, the low abundance of lithium in the earth's crust (0.0065%) resulting in the high cost of LIBs as well as the safety, energy density, rate capability and service life issues still remain as key challenges aﬄicting the development of LIBs for the potential markets of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).3–7 However, one technological bottleneck for the commercial development of advanced LIBs is the lack of high-performance cathode materials.8 Layered lithium-rich  1) and low materials with high specic capacity (ca. 250mA h g cost have attracted attention due to their encouraging features, while the intrinsically poor rate capability and emerging safety hazards have made them controversial materials for use in LIBs.9 Framework materials based on the phosphate polyanions are being investigated as favourable replacements for lithium metal oxides due to the high energy storage capacity combined with electrochemical stability,10 such as olivine LiFePO4.11 This structural polyanion is constructed by a rigid [PO4]3  network which helps to stabilise the crystal structure of the material. The oxygen atoms are xed in the [PO4]3  structure to limit the likelihood of oxygen liberation which leads to good thermal stability.12 In addition, the incorporation of [PO4]3  groups can also rise the charge/discharge potentials of the materials by an inductive eﬀect.13 This, and associated materials possess high redox potentials and good lithium transport and are capable to contribute to remarkable electrochemical and thermal stability in comparison with lithium metal oxides. Nonetheless, some shortcomings lithium-ion transport or two-phase redox reaction that together limit the mobility of the phase boundary are critical for phosphate polyanion cathodes within the application in high-energy systems.10 Meanwhile, lithium compounds can be put into question as a result of the un-easy availability of readily-accessible lithium in the environment.14 Reasonably, tremendous attention has been focused on sodium-ion batteries constructed with a sodium-containing cathode, such as NaTi2(PO4)3,15 Na3M2(PO4)3 (M ¼ Ti, Fe, V)3,16–18 and Na3V2(PO4)3 (ref. 17–20) et al. Among these, NASICON (Na superior conductor)-structured compounds have been brought into wide investigation attributed to the feature of a highly covalent framework that generates large interstitial spaces for sodium ions to diﬀuse.21,22 Furthermore,

the discharge plateau should be declined in a sodium-ion battery due to the redox potentials versus Na+/Na, when the standard electrode potentials of Li+/Li ( 3.04 V vs. SHE) and Na+/Na ( 2.71 V vs. SHE) have been taken into consideration,20 which is not consistent with the requirement for high-energy batteries. However, the participation of uorine in a transient metal-based structure seems to be able to enhance their working potentials owing to a larger ionicity of the M–F (M ¼ transient metal) bond than that of the M–O one.23 Thus, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has been explored as a promising cathode material to be utilized into a sodium-ion battery with an average voltage of 3.95 V and a  1.24 Since the need for a high specic capacity of 110 mA h g voltage of a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode battery, a hybrid-ion system has been employed with a conguration composed of traditional lithium-based non-aqueous electrolyte and metallic lithium (or graphite) anode.20,25 If the sodium containing material could work well as a cathode in lithium-ion battery systems which might be called a hybrid-ion system, it will be greatly signicant for the developing of secondary batteries, particularly in terms of the cost when used for large-scale energy storage. Moreover, the intrinsically well-dened NASICON channel structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 that facilitates excellent ionic conductivity1 could result in useful performances in terms of specic capacity, rate capability and cycle life.

Herein, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was synthesized by an improved carbothermal reduction (CTR) methodology which is found to be carbon coated on the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 particle surface and is utilized as a cathode in both lithium and sodium-ion batteries to explore the corresponding electrochemical properties from which Na3V2(PO4)2F3 could be pointed out to be promising and multifunctional for high-energy battery fabrication.

Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C composite powders were prepared using analytical grade reagents by a CTR method. Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, NaF and V2O5 were adequately dissolved into 50 mL distilled water and dried under 50 C by forced-air drying. Following this, acetylene black powders were mixed in the abovementioned precursor and ground to a uniformly particle distribution. The used acetylene black involved the mass as reducer and conductive agent (5 wt% to the total mass of reagents). Aerwards, the ground powders were preheated at 350 C in ow argon for 4 h, and reground when it cooled to room temperature. Then, the obtained powders were re-red at 650 C in argon atmosphere for 8 h to generate Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C composite materials.

The crystallographic structure of the as prepared material was studied by X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 diﬀractometer with monochromatic Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.5406 ˚A), and the diﬀraction data was recorded in the 2q range  1. The infrared (IR) spectra of 10–60 was obtained using an FT-IR Spectrometer (Jasco, FT/IR-4100, Japan) under transmission mode based on the KBr pellet  1. The particle method in the range of 500–2000 cm morphology of the composite was investigated by a FEI Quanta

200 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and JEOL 2010F transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermogravimetric analysis (TG) of the samples was carried on a Diamond TG thermo-analyzer.

The cathode electrode was fabricated with the active material, acetylene black, and binder (polyvinylidene uoride, PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 by using NMP as solvent and an aluminium foil as current collector (4.5 mg cm  2), followed by drying in vacuum at 110 C for 24 h. The R2016 coin cell was assembled in an argon-lled glove box using metallic lithium and sodium as the anode for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries, respectively, with a Celgard 2500 membrane as separator. The electrolyte for constructing lithium-ion battery was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC) (v/v/v, 1/1/1) and for sodium-ion battery, was 1 M NaClO4 in EC. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling tests were carried out in a setting voltage range by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C) and a CT2001A LAND battery tester, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was studied using a Modulab (Solartron Analytical) with the amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 mHz. All electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature.

All calculations on Na3V2(PO4)2F3 were performed with the spinpolarized Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation parameterization to Density Functional Theory (DFT) using CASTEP program. A plane-wave basis with a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 330 eV was used, and size of standard grid was 1.5. BFGS optimization method was used and the geometry optimization parameters of total energy convergence, max ionic force, max ionic displacement and max stress component tolerance were 0.2  10  4 eV per atom, 0.5  10  2 ˚A and 0.1 GPa respectively. The electronic convergence thresholds parameters of total energy were 0.2

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared material, as well as the Rietveld renement of the patterns. The rened lattice parameters are a ¼ b ¼ 9.05 ˚A, c ¼ 10.679 ˚A, V ¼ 874.64 ˚A3 according to the observed XRD pattern, with a degree of crystallinity of 94.4%. All diﬀraction peaks could be indexed well to tetragonal Na3V2(PO4)2F3 structure with the space group of P42/mnm, which agree well with previously reported values.26,27 The observed crystallographic planes (hkl) of this crystal Na3V2(PO4)2F3 were denoted when the results of DFT calculation on Na3V2(PO4)2F3 model have been taken into consideration. Moreover, the feature peaks of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 are greatly enhanced when compared with our previous work,28 demonstrating an eﬀective solvation result for precursor preparation in

the CTR synthesis. In addition, there are no observed traces of carbon in the XRD patterns, implying that the residual carbon produced by the mechanism of CTR method in the composite is in an amorphous state which is consistent with published conclusions.28,29

Shown in Fig. 2 are the graphical representations of the uorophosphates structure viewed along c and b axis. The crystal structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 could be best described as a three-dimensional (3D) NASICON framework. This structure is composed of [V2O8F3] bi-octahedral and [PO4] tetrahedral units of which [V2O8F3] bi-octahedra is bridged with two [VO4F2] octahedra united by one uorine atom, whereas the oxygen atoms are all interconnected through the [PO4] units. Consequently, the sodium ions could be statistically distributed in the resultant network of the NASICON structure. As suggested by Shakoor et al.,24 two sodium sites (Na1) are fully occupied while the other two (Na2) are half occupied by Na ions in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Meanwhile, this extended 3D NASICON-type structure is expected to be capable of facile fast ion diﬀusion.28,30

Reasonably, the NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is highly likely to have been fabricated when the combined results of XRD and FT-IR are considered.

Furthermore, in order to estimate the carbon content in the as-prepared Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C composite, the TG test in air atmosphere was carried out and found to present a value of 9.2% (Fig. 4). The morphology of the as-prepared Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was studied by SEM as shown in Fig. 5, from which the irregularly shaped particles are distributed in the range of 0.5–1 mm due to the mechanochemical activation before sintering and some of the particles are agglomerated to form larger secondary particles. From the TEM image depicted in Fig. 6, the coated carbon on the surface of particles is in an amorphous state with the thickness estimated to be in the range of 25–32 nm. The coated carbon could be great signicance to improve the electronic conductivity of the particles which is benecial for the electrochemical properties of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 electrode material and prevent the growth of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 particles.

The insertion/extraction mechanism of ions in hybrid-ion batteries are interesting and have been described recently for Na3V2(PO4)3.20 Herein, another interesting experiment focusing

the cathodic peaks at 3.58 and 4.15 V vs. Li+/Li could contribute to the ion insertion, of which the anodic peaks of the rst cycle could contribute to the extraction of two sodium ions and the corresponding cathodic peaks would be ascribed to the insertion of hybrid ions. This is because a vast excess of lithium ions with smaller volume and mass are easy transported while the irreversibility for sodium ions mainly from the formed solid electrolyte interface (SEI) lms seems not suitable for the migration of sodium ions. Moreover, the peak shapes of the CV curves demonstrate an enhanced reactive activation as a result of the participation of more lithium ions. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) analysis has been utilised to investigate the electrochemical insertion mechanism of Na3V2(PO4)2F3, which indicated a Li/V molar ratio of 0.97 in the experimental Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode at the 10th galvanostatic cycle with a corresponding conguration of Li1.94Na1.06V2(PO4)2F3. This is evidence to support that the migrated ions have been predominantly Li+ ions by replacing Na+ ions during cycling.29 In addition, the CV curves of these anterior 50 cycles seemed almost coincident during cycling, which could indicate that the replacement does not cause signicant change to the material structure and thus bring a good reversibility and stability. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode utilised in a sodiumion battery also exhibited two obvious anodic peaks located at 3.9 and 4.28 V vs. Na+/Na with corresponding cathodic peaks at 3.28 and 3.85 V vs. Na+/Na from the rst CV curve as shown in Fig. 8. It is reasonable for the potential decrease of redox peaks in a sodium-ion battery because the standard electrode potential of Li+/Li ( 3.04 V vs. SHE) is 0.33 V lower than that of Na+/Na ( 2.71 V vs. SHE). Additionally, the potential diﬀerences of the lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries are 0.08, 0.08, 0.3 and 0.3 V by comparison the locations between the relevant anodic and cathodic peaks. This result, to some extent, could illuminate that the extracted ions in the rst anodic reaction for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 lithium-ion battery would be predominantly Na+ ions mixed with a few Li+ ions and the inserted ions in the rst cathodic reaction would be mainly Li+ ions. Otherwise, under  1, the anodic peaks locations of the same scan rate of 0.5 mV s Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in lithium-ion batteries should be the same to those in sodium-ion batteries corresponding the only Na+ ions extraction, and the cathodic peaks locations of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 in lithium-ion batteries would be 0.33 V higher than that in

on hybrid-ion batteries was investigated using the Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a cathode. Fig. 7 shows the rst 50th CV cycles of  1 Na3V2(PO4)2F3 hybrid-ion battery at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s over the voltage range from 2.5 to 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li. These two couples of redox peaks are likely to be responsible for the insertion/extraction of two alkali ions to realise the transformation from Na3V2(PO4)2F3 to NaV2(PO4)2F3 associated with V3+/V4+ reaction, resulting from the ion migration from two Na(2) sites with 0.5 occupation and one Na(1) site with 1 occupation for this NASICON-type structure, which is consistent with the reported literature.20,24 The anodic peaks located at 3.98 and 4.36 V vs. Li+/Li can be attributed to the ion extraction and

sodium-ion batteries resulted from the total Li+ ions insertion. Furthermore, there seems to be a diminutively anodic peak located at 3.5 V vs. Na+/Na, which could be explained by the twostep extraction of the rst Na ions from Na(2) sites with diﬀerent ions conguration in this NASICO-type structure during charging process. In addition, the diﬀerence of peak currents between two adjacent peaks is observed larger for hybrid-ion batteries than that for sodium-ion batteries, from which the higher peak current indicating higher reactive activity, could be attributed to the electrochemical behaviours of mixed Li ions for hybrid-ion system.

The CV curves of this hybrid-ion battery in a voltage range of 2.5–4.6 V vs. Li+/Li at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 mV  1 are shown in Fig. 9a, respectively. Clearly, with the increase s of scan rate, the height and area of the redox peaks increase because the peak area divided by the scan rate yield the capacity of the electrode that should be constant.33 In addition, the anodic peaks seem to shi to higher potentials and the corresponding cathodic peaks to lower values, where the variation could demonstrate a more and more manifest irreversibility for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 at relatively larger scan rates. The reason for this is the uncompleted ion extraction/insertion from/into the electrode producing an un-suﬃcient redox reaction during the time interval of a high-rate scan, which could cause the irreversible behaviours.33 Especially for the hybrid-ion extraction/insertion system, irreversible behaviours should be considered normal due to the existence of the larger and heavier Na+ ions which would be hysteretic in the electrochemical reaction compared with Li+ ions. In

principle, only two alkali ions could extract/insert the crystallographic sites of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 no matter the ions are Na+ or Li+, and the electrochemically formed phase LixNa3 xV2(PO4)2F3 (x # 2) would present a constant concentration of the alkali ions. Furthermore, the good liner relationships between the square root of the scan rate v1/2 and peak current ip as depicted in Fig. 9b illustrating a diﬀusion-controlled process for the whole electrode reaction and a typical equilibrium behaviour of an intercalated type electrode. Thus, the ion diﬀusion in the electrode should be treated as the rate-limiting step if the charge transfer at the interface is fast enough, while it is an important work to explore the diﬀused capability of these ions in this NASICON-type electrode. As suggested by previous works,20,33–36 Randles–Sevcik equation (eqn (1)) was used to calculate the diﬀusion constant D which describes the relationship between the peak current ip and the square root of the scan rate v1/2:

where m is the mass of active cathode material, F the Faraday constant, R the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, n the number of electrons in reaction (n ¼ 2), A the eﬀective contact area between the electrode and electrolyte (here the geometric area of electrode, 0.79 m2 is used for simplicity) and C is the concentration of alkali ion in the cathode calculated from the crystallographic cell parameter of Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Similar to the works of Rui et al.,33 the two anodic peaks (A and B) and one cathodic peak (D) seem to disappear gradually at a high scan  1). Thereby, the le cathodic peak (C) might rates ($0.8 mV s represent a solid solution behaviour which could be used to characterize the true ion diﬀusion coeﬃcient while the calculated values based on other peaks could be regarded as the apparent results. D values of the anodic and cathodic reactions are calculated as 4.64  10  1 (B) and 3.29  10  10 cm2 s  1 (D), respectively. It is noted that the A peak displayed an apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient higher than B peak in the extracted process, conrming that the extraction of the rst alkali ions was kinetically the most diﬃcult and requires more energy.33 A structural reorganization was also reasonably suggested to explain this result because this structural change could optimize the conguration of alkali ions in NASICON framework which would be facile to migrate in electrochemical process. Meanwhile, the relatively similar values between the true D (C) and the apparent D (A) were used to demonstrate a good reversibility of the electrode. For the sodium-ion system as demonstrated in Fig. 10a, the CV curves in a voltage range of 2.5–4.6 V vs. Na+/Na at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1 mV  1 with the corresponding liner relationships between the s square root of the scan rate v1/2 and peak current ip as displayed in Fig. 10b are capable to calculated the chemical diﬀusion of Na ions according to the same principle abovementioned. Thereby, the D values of the two anodic and cathodic peaks are calculated as 2.04  10  1 and 1.01   11, 1.92  10  11 cm2 s  1, respectively. Obviously, the values 10 are much smaller than those for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 lithium-ion

batteries. This reason could be ascribed to the larger ionic radius and heavier mass for the Na ions during charge/ discharge process compared with those migrated with predominant Li ions.

As shown in Fig. 11a, the hybrid-ion batteries presented the initial specic capacities of 147, 132, 123, 115, 101 and 87.5 mA  1 at diﬀerent current densities of 0.09, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 h g C (note that 1 C refers to the extraction of two ions per formula unit in 1 hour), respectively. There are two obvious dischargevoltage plateaus around 3.8 and 4.25 V vs. Li/Li+ for the rst cycle proles at 0.09 C, which should be responsible for the two ions extraction/insertion associated with V3+/V4+ redox reaction. Additionally, these two plateaus could be used to conrm that the extraction/insertion of two alkali ions from two Na(2) sites and one Na(1) site is a two-step process accompanied by structural reorganization. Otherwise, one plateau would be produced to realize the electrochemical behaviour of two ions with one couple redox reaction of V3+/V4+ in a relatively high voltage region such as 3–4.6 V vs. Li/Li+. This produced average discharge plateau of ca. 4 V vs. Li/Li+ with a high specic  1 demonstrate that Na3V2(PO4)2F3 could capacity of 140 mA h g be promising for the use as cathode in fabrication of a highenergy battery. The exhibited capacity in this work has exceeded  1 for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 the theoretical value of 128 mA h g provided that two ions could be reversibly extracted/inserted. Our previous conclusion could explain this result which demonstrated that the applied voltage range would play vital role in the migrated ion number and the redox reaction of the transitional metal thus determine the

performed capacity. However, the polarization of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 hybrid-ion batteries enhanced rapidly when the employed current increased which could be lowered by constant voltage charging method, and the slope shape in charging/discharging linked with a solid solution behaviour should be attributed to the uncompleted extraction/insertion of ions at a large current density, such as 2 C. Fig. 11b shows the C-rate and cycling performances of Na3V2(PO4)2F3. During the C-rate cycling, the  1 could average capacities of 130, 121, 112, 100 and 84 mA h g be obtained when the hybrid-ion batteries were tested at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 C, respectively. Moreover, this hybrid-ion  1 battery could still exhibit a discharge capacity ca. 84 mA h g with corresponding coulombic eﬃciency of 99% at 2 C aer 190 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. The satised performances of stable capacity and high coulombic eﬃciency should be ascribed to the specialized NASICON structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 which provides three-dimensional channels for ion transport. In addition, Fig. 12a shows that Na3V2(PO4)2F3  1 with a could present an initial capacity of 111.5 mA h g coulombic eﬃciency of 93% at 0.091 C in a sodium-ion battery. There are two obvious discharge plateaus around 4 and 3.5 V vs. Na+/Na with a third plateau at 3.3 V vs. Na+/Na, which are responsible for the insertion of two Na ions into two Na(2) sites and one Na(1) sites. Because the ions at Na(2) sites of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 have a high chemical potential,24 the insertion into Na(2) sits prefers to occur at a later stage in the discharge

process. When Na ions insert into the Na sites step by step, the whole conguration would likely undergo related reorganization to a stable state, and thus, the three diﬀerent inserted voltage plateaus should result from the structure reorganization and V3+/V4+ redox transformation. Interestingly, two discharge-voltage plateaus for lithium-ion batteries are presented around 3.8 and 4.25 V vs. Li/Li+ which are 0.3 and 0.25 V higher than the two main plateaus in sodium-ion batteries, respectively. It also could be used to explain that the inserted ions in the lithium-ion system are hybrid ions with main Li ions due to the voltage diﬀerences. Meanwhile, the predominant insertion of Li ions would prefer to be divided into two steps with corresponding two plateaus, mainly due to the easygoing characteristics of Li ions. The corresponding cycling performances tested under a current density of 0.91 C have  1 and a coulombic presented a specic capacity of 87 mA h g eﬃciency of 92% for the 102th cycle as displayed in Fig. 12b, which are comparably acceptable towards to the performances of sodium-ion batteries. However, it is reasonable to believe that Na3V2(PO4)2F3 is multifunctional and capable to exhibit well properties no matter in lithium-ion or sodium-ion batteries, and seems suitable for the fabrication of high-energy batteries by employing it in lithium-ion batteries.

EIS was further used to explore the electrochemical kinetics of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 when the hybrid-ion battery cycled aer 5 and 100 cycles at 0.1 C and charged to a same voltage of 3.2 V. The corresponding Nyquist plots are given in Fig. 13a, from which the small intercept at the Zre axis is attributed to the internal resistance of the battery. The semi-circle in the high frequency region is due to the resistance of SEI lm,

Fig. 13 (a) Nyquist plots of the hybrid-ion battery charged to 3.2 V vs. Li+/Li for the 5th and 100th cycle. (b) The equivalent circuit model.

while the other one in the middle frequency region is resulted from the charge transfer resistance. The sloping line in the low frequency region should correspond to the diﬀusion of alkali ions in the electrode bulk, namely Warburg impedance. Fig. 13b displays the tted equivalent circuit and all the impedance parameters with relative errors estimate (%) of the tting equivalent circuit are listed in Table 1 by using ZSimWin soware. Here, R1 represents the internal resistance involving the resistance of the electrolyte and electrode and R2 corresponds to the resistance of SEI lm while C1 signies the resultant capacitance from SEI lm. R3 is the charge transfer resistance in the intermediate-frequency region and CPE1 is related to the surface property of the electrode. R4 denotes the Warburg resistance and C2 demonstrate the double layer capacitance caused by ion transfer in the electrode material. It is could be seen from the table that all the resistances for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 hybrid-ion batteries have increased when galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles from the 5th to 100th. However, the SEI resistance seemed not to enhance much compared with others which could illustrate that the SEI lm basically formed during the rst several cycles would change very little in the following cycles.29 In contrast, the charge transfer resistance is strongly inuenced by cycling increased from 171.8 U for the 5th cycle to 847.9 U for the 100th cycle. This factor might be mainly responsible for the capacity fading in cycling and high C-rate performances.29 In addition, the slopes of the Nyquist plots at low frequency changed obviously to be nearly 45 from the 5th to the 100th cycle, indicating an enhanced solid-state diﬀusion of ions in the active materials. This is likely because the three-dimensional channels of the NASICON framework has been activated to open smoothly during cycling accompanied by relatively appropriate structural reorganization.24 Furthermore, the characteristically sloping line of the 100th cycle could further conrm the electrochemistry process of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 to be diﬀusion-controlled rather than surface-controlled.

NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was prepared by an improved carbothermal reduction method with irregularly shaped particles distributed in the range of 0.5–1 mm. The produced particles were shown to be coated with carbon on the surface with the thickness between 25 and 32 nm, and the total residual carbon content was nearly 9.2% which were considered benecial for the improvement of the particles conductivity. The crystallographic planes (hkl) of this crystal Na3V2(PO4)2F3 were rstly suggested to be labelled based on DFT calculations with a good crystallinity  1 with an average of 94.4%. A specic capacity of 147 mA h g discharge plateau around 4 V vs. Li+/Li, as well as an excellent C-rate and cycling performances have been presented for  1 with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 lithium-ion batteries and 111.5 mA h g three discharge plateaus at 4, 3.5 and 3.3 V vs. Na+/Na for sodiumion batteries. By comparing the redox potentials from CV and charge/discharge curves, it is found that the inserted ions would be predominantly Li ions from the rst cycle and more favoured to migrate from/into the crystallographic sites of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 to obtain satisfactory properties by a two-step process. This multifunctional Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with three-dimensional open  11 cm2 framework has a fast ion diﬀusion with a magnitude of 10  1, which could be responsible for the excellent electrochemical s properties, and is capable to be used as a promising cathode in construction of high-energy batteries.
