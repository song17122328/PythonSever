Abstract: Nasicon type compounds of general formula Li1..3M0.3Ti1.7 (PO4)3 (M = Al, Cr, Fe) were prepared using melt quenching method. The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and infrared spectra. Thermal stability against crystallization was evaluated by DSC curve. All the compounds crystallize in hexagonal lattice with R-3c space group. The IR spectra show the characteristic PO4 vibrations. DSC curve reveals that the Li1.3Fe0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 glass-ceramics possesses the better thermal stability against crystallization. Conductivity studies indicate that the total conductivity is dominated by the grain boundary. Introduction Lithium secondary batteries are widely used as power sources for portable electronic devices because of their high energy density, light weight and long life. However, conventional lithium batteries systems usually use liquid electrolytes with organic solvents and need the safety mechanism to prevent liquid electrolytes from igniting and leaking.Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to develop all-solid-state lithium secondary batteries to improves safety and reliability of lithium batteries [1,2]. Glass-ceramics with the NASICON structure are known to present high ionic conductivity. Systems derived from the LiTi2(PO4)3 composition have been widely studied. In this structure, the partial substitution of the Ti4+ cation by a trivalent cation M3+such as Al3+, In3+,Ga3+, Sc3+, La3+or Y3+ generates a deficiency in positive charge, which is compensated by additional Li+ ions, leading to the Li1+xMxTi2−x(PO4)3 system.[3,4]. Previous studies have presented the substitution at the Ti site increases the conductivity of LiTi2P3O12. Further, this framework structure gives an opportunity to tailor properties such as ionic conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient and chemical stability[5]. The purpose of this work is to substitute the titanium in the system Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7 (PO4)3 partially by M(M = Al ,Cr and Fe) (here after LATP, LCTP, LFTP, respectively), so as to obtain the glass ceramic solid electrolytes with high lithium ion conductivity, good stability and even low cost. The preparation, characterization and the ionic conductivity of the glass ceramics will be mainly evaluated. Experimental Preparation and characterization. Glasses of the molar composition Li1..3M0.3Ti1.7 (PO4)3 (M = Al, Cr and Fe) were prepared by the melt quenching method. Reagent grade raw materials Li2CO3 (AR) , NH4H2PO4( 99%), Al2O3 (AR ) , TiO2(AR ) ,Cr2O3(AR) and Fe2O3(AR ) were weighed. The batch was thoroughly mixed and heated in an alumina crucible at 700 °C for 1 h in order to release volatile products. Then, it was melted at 1440°C for 1.5 h. The melts were poured into flowing water and quenching.  Advanced Materials Research Vols. 602-604

Glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) were determined using differential thermal analysis (DSC) at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis at room temperature using CuKa radiation. Infrared spectra were recorded in the form of KBr pellets in the wave number range 4000–400 cm–1 using Nicolet Avatar 360 FT/IR Spectrometer. Pellets of 13 mm of diameter and a thickness of 1-2 mm were prepared for conductivity measurements by pressing fine powder at 300 MPa. The pellets were sintered at 900°C for 12 h. Complex impedance measurements were carried out using a parstat 2263 advanced electrochemical workstation and frequency range is 10-2–106 Hz. Results and discussion Thermal behaviors.The DSC heating curves of all the glass samples are shown in Fig. 1.The glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) are determined from the curve. Some results are reported in Table 1. No peak corresponding to glass melting is observed up to 800°C, indicating the present material has high resistance to heating. The results show that the Tg and Tc values of  phosphate glasses have a ruleless decrease. The following sequence in Tg values is observed.                       Tg (Cr2O3)> Tg (Al2O3)> Tg (Fe2O3) The Tg value of phosphate glass is related to its chain length, cross-link density and bonding strength of the phosphate chains [6]. The decrease in Tg reflects an decrease in the cross-link strength of the glass network. Tc–Tg is one of the important measures of indicating glass stability against crystallization. Table. 1 shows that the values with a maximum of 70°C appear at the composition LFTP and suggests that the LFTP glass possess the better thermal stability against crystallization than the glass of LCTP and LATP.

Powder X-ray diffraction patterns. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the samples treated at 900°C for 12 h.. For the LATP sample, diffraction peaks attributable only to the conductive phase LiTi2(PO4)3 are observed. The LCTP and LFTP samples, however, shows the presence of an unknown phase with the slight peaks at 22◦ and 27◦ .Whereas, the LiTi2(PO4)3-type phase is dominant in all specimens and is rhombohedral lattice with space group R-3c. It proves that the M3+ ions replace theTi4+ ions in the present LiTi2(PO4)3. In addition, a difference in peak intensity is clearly visible. These observations corroborate that LATP sample has a higher structural order at the same heat treatment conditions, and may explain the difference in electrical conductivity of these samples.

All the compounds exhibit strong absorptions below 1500 cm–1. Lattice dynamics of phosphate-based materials can be assumed by the separation of the vibrations into internal modes of PO4 (or P2O7) units and external modes. The internal PO4 vibrations can be derived from the fundamental PO43− modes ν1–ν4. In the region of the internal modes of the phosphate anion, we identify the asymmetric stretching mode at ν1 =900-1000 cm−1, the doublet ν2 = 420–460cm−1, the triplets ν3 and ν4 in the regions 1000-1275 and 545–680 cm−1. The variation in ν3 mode in Nasicon systems could be attributed to the polarizing nature of the metal ion (size, charge). In the present series of compounds, the charge of the metal ion is same and therefore the polarizing power depends only on the ionic size of M3+. Since the ionic size of M3+ follows the order Al3+ < Cr3+ < Fe3+, the order of ν3 is expected to be LATP>LCTP >LFTP [7]. This trend is indeed observed for these compounds in the IR spectra(Table 2). The IR band positions of ν1, ν2, ν3 and ν4 modes observed in the present series are close to Nasicon type of compounds. The strong IR absorptions is observed in the region 635–640cm−1 and indicates Ti4+ in octahedral oxygen coordination [8]. The PO4 external modes corresponding to vibrational and translational motions of these groups are generally observed below 300cm-1. Due to the instrumental constraints the spectra could not be recorded below 400cm-1 and hence the corresponding measurement could not be made. Advanced Materials Research Vols. 602-604

Room temperature AC impedance spectra of the sheet specimen crystallized at 900°C for 12h is shown in Fig. 4. The impedance plots show the characteristics of an ionic conductor composed of bulk, grain boundary and electrode contribution. The total resistance (Rb + Rgb) and the bulk resistance (Rb) of the samples are obtained from the right and left intercepts of the semicircle with the real axis in the plots, respectively. Impedance behavior of LCTP and LFTP is similar.Two semicircles are observed for the LCTPand LFTP .The semicircle in the low-frequency range is attributed to the grain boundary (Rgb) and the semicircle in the high-frequency range is attributed to the bulk of the grains (Rb) [2]. However, only one distorted semicircle, which is composed of two semicircles mentioned above, is observed for LATP samples. The total resistance (Rb+Rgb) is used to calculate the conductivity of the samples with σ=d/AR, where d is the sample’s thickness and A is the electrode’s surface area and R=Rb+Rgb[9]. Conductivity data and Ea values are listed in Table 3.   Fig. 4. Complex impedance plots of room temperature for LMTP glass-ceramics  552

The conductivity decreases with the increase of the grain boundary (Rgb). This proves that the total conductivity is dominated by the grain boundary[10]. In addition, the AC conductivity of these samples is calculated from low frequency intercepts of semicircles and the plot as a function of inverse of temperature on semilog scale is straight lines. The activation energies (Ea) for conduction obtained from these plots are 0.241, 0.260 and 0.243 eV for LATP, LCTP and LFTP respectively. Conclusions Nasicons composition of Li1..3M0.3Ti1.7 (PO4)3 (M = Al, Cr, and Fe) is prepared and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and infrared spectra. Thermal stability against crystallization is evaluated by DSC curve. The LFTP glass possess the better thermal stability against crystallization than the glass of LCTP and LATP. The samples crystallize in rhombohedral lattice of Nasicon framework. These samples show characteristic PO4 vibrations. Complex impedance plots of the samples show the total conductivity is dominated by the grain boundary. The activation energies obtained from frequency independent conductivities are in the range 0.241–0.260 eV.
