NASICON structure solid electrolyte with the composition of Na3+xZr2-xMxSi2PO12(M=La, Y) were prepared by solid-state method.
The effects of La and Y doping on the densityand ionic conductivity of NASICON solid electrolyte were investigated.
The results show thatthe doping of La and Y can improve the ionic conductivity of NASICON structure solidelectrolyte because of the higher carrier concentration, migration efficiency, and higher density.
The Na3.3Zr1.7La0.3Si2PO12 has the highest ionic conductivity of 6.7×10-3 S/cm at 25 °C.
La-doped, Y-doped, and undoped NASICON samples were prepared by the solid state method at thetemperature of 1225 ℃.
It was found that the ionic conductivity of NASICON-type solid electrolytedoped by rare earth elements was higher than that of the undoped one.
La-doped NASICON exhibitsthe highest ionic conductivity of 6.7×10-3 S/cm at 25℃.
The doping of rare earth elements canincrease the density of NASICON, increase carrier concentration, improve the sodium ion channel,thereby increasing the ionic conductivity of these materials.
