A   compact   tubular   sensor   based   on  NASICON   (sodium   super   ionic   conductor)   and   ZnTiO3 sensing   electrode   was   designed   for   detection   of   C7H8.  The   NASICON   and   ZnTiO3 material   were  prepared   by   sol–gel method,   respectively.   ZnTiO3 thick   ﬁlm   was   prepared   to  investigate   characteristics   to  aromatic   hydrocarbon   gas-toluene   at   various   operating   temperatures.   The   sensor   using   ZnTiO3 gave   excellent   sensing properties   to   5–50   ppm   C7H8 in   air   at   300–400 ◦C.   The   EMF   value   of   the   sensor   was   almost   proportional −90   mV/decade   at   350 ◦C.  It   was  also to   the   logarithm   of   C7H8 concentration,   the   sensitivity   (slope)   was   seen   that  the   sensor   showed   a  good   selectivity   to  C7H8 against   H2S,   HCHO,   NH3,   CH4,  C6H5CH2CH3,   C6H6 and   C6H4(CH3)2.  The   sensor   had   speedy   response   kinetics   to  C7H8,  the   90%   response   time   to  5,   10,   20, 50   ppm   C7H8 was   15,   10,   8,   5   s,   respectively,   and   the  recovery   time   was   25,   39,   50,  90   s,  respectively. Finally,   a  sensing   mechanism   was   proposed.

The  steadily  increasing  use  of  hydrocarbons  in  industry,  for  heating  and  automobile  fuel  increases  the  danger  to  the  atmosphere  to be  polluted  from  leakages.  The  increased  concern  about  environmental  protection  has  led  to  continuous  expansion  in  searching  for new  volatile  organic  compounds  (VOC)  sensor  materials.  Among these,  toluene,  a  typical  bad-smelling  and  toxic  gas,  is  a  target  of detection  by  solid-state  gas  sensor.  Up  to  now,  micro  type  toluene sensor  based  on  adsorption/combustion-type  sensing  material  has been  studied  [1],  and  also  conductive  type  sensors  based  on  the metal  oxide  have  been  developed  [2–4],  e.g.,  development  of  a WO3 thick-ﬁlm-based  sensor  for  the  detection  of  VOC  [2].  Recently, phthalovyanine  [5],  PCS  ﬁbers  [6],  diamond  [7],  quartz  crystal nanobalance  (QCN)  [8],  PdO-decorated  ﬂower-like  ZnO  [9],  Sm2O3 doped-SnO2 nanoparticles  [10],  multi-walled  carbon  nanotubes [11],  SnO2/V2O5 composite  materials  [12],  TiO2-doped  ZnO  [13] have  been  investigated  for  the  detection  of  volatile  organic  compounds.  In  addition,  the  solid  electrolyte  planar-type  structure sensor  has  been  studied  combining  YSZ  and  modiﬁed  Pt  electrodes for  detection  ethanol  and  toluene  [14].  Among  these,  the  sensitivity  of  the  PdO-decorated  ﬂower-like  ZnO  based  sensor  [9]  to 100  ppm  toluene  was  35.  The  sensitivity  of  the  SnO2/10  wt%   V2O5 composite  based  sensor  [12]  to  50  ppm  toluene  was  5.5.  The response  time  of  TiO2-doped  ﬂowerlike  ZnO  based  sensor  [13]  to 50  ppm  toluene  was   10.9  s.  Nevertheless,  the  NASICON  solid  electrolyte  toluene  sensors  have  been  fewer  investigated.  In  addition, there  are  a  lot  of  advantages  for  the  solid  electrolyte  gas  sensor using  NASICON,  such  as,  subsize,  simple  technology,  low  price,  high sensitivity,  high  selectivity,  rapid  response  kinetics  etc.  That  is  why this  type  of  sensor  has  widely  application  prospect.  In  this  study, the  gas  sensing  properties  of  solid-state  potentiometric  gas  sensor based  on  NASICON  and  ZnTiO3 sensing  electrode  for  detection  of toluene  in  household  environment  have  been  investigated  in  detail.

NASICON  precursor  was  prepared  from  ZrO(NO3)2,  NaNO3, (NH4)2HPO4 and  Si(C2H5O)4 by  sol–gel  process  [15].  Here  the NH3·H2O  was   used  for  the  precipitant  and  HNO3 for  the  reverse solvent.  Then,  the  obtained  sol  was  dried  in  oven  for  3  h  at  100 ◦C to  form  xerogel.  The  resulted  gel  was  pre-sintered  at  500 ◦C  for  4  h, and  then  pressed  into  bulk  sample  and  sintered  again  at  1000 ◦C  for 12  h  to  obtain  the  powder  material.  ZnTiO3 compound  oxide  was synthesized  by  sol–gel  method  with  C16H36O4Ti,  ZnCl2,  C2H5OH, CH3COOH.  The  resulted  sol  was  dried  in  oven  for  12  h  at  80 ◦C  to form  xerogel.  The  obtained  gel  was   sintered  at  600 ◦C  for  3  h  to  form the  ZnTiO3 compound  metal  oxide.

A  sensor  device  was  fabricated  by  using  an  alumina  tube  of  6  mm long,  0.8  and  1.2  mm  in  inner  and  outer  diameter,  respectively,  as shown  in  Fig.  1.  A  thick  ﬁlm  of  NASICON  was  formed  on  the  outer surface  of  the  alumina  tube  by  dipping  it  in  NASICON  precursor paste  many  times.  For  increasing  the  density  of  NASICON,  the  layer of  NASICON  was  pre-sintered  at  600 ◦C  for  1  h  before  the  next  layer was  formed.  Finally,  the  thick  ﬁlm  of  NASICON  was   sintered  at 900 ◦C  for  6  h.  As  the  next  step  of  the  fabrication  process  for  the sensor  device,  a  Pt  electrode  and  Au  electrode  with  mesh-shape, respectively,  for  the  reference  and  sensing  electrode  were  made on  the  two  ends  of  the  NASICON  thick  ﬁlm  by  applying  Pt  and  Au paste,  and  then  were  sintered  at  1000 ◦C,  800 ◦C  for  20  min,  respectively.  For  forming  the  sensing  electrode  of  the  toluene  gas  sensor, ZnTiO3 oxide  was  mixed  with  pure  water,  and  the  resulting  paste was  applied  on  the  Au  electrode,  followed  by  sintering  at  500,  600, 700 ◦C  for  3  h,  respectively.  A  Ni–Cr  coil  was  set  in  the  inner  of  the alumina  tube  as  a  heater.

Gas  sensing  properties  of  the  sensor  device  were  measured  by  a conventional  static  mounting  method.  The  sample  gases  containing different  concentration  of  toluene  were  obtained  by  diluting  pure toluene  gas  with  O2 (21%)  and  N2 (79%).  When  the  sensor  device was  exposed  to  air  or  a  sample  gas,  the  electromotive  force  (EMF) was  measured  with  a  digital  electrometer  (Advanced,  TR8652)  and the  results  obtained  were  registered  with  a  computer  connected  to the  electrometer.

XRD  analysis  was  used  to  conﬁrm  the  crystal  structure  of  the obtained  powders.  Fig.  2  shows  the  XRD  pattern  of  NASICON  and ZnTiO3 compound  oxide  prepared  with  the  sol–gel  method,  and the  synthesized  NASICON  was  conﬁrmed  to  have  a  single  phase of  rhombohedral  and  the  mean  grain  size  of  the  NASICON  calculated  with  Debye–Scherrer  equation  was  about  22  nm.   The  obtained ZnTiO3 material  was  conﬁrmed  to  be  ZnTiO3 with  rhombohedral structure.  And  the  mean  grain  size  of  ZnTiO3 was  about  10  nm.

Here,  the  properties  of  the  sensors  sintered  at  500,  600,  700 ◦C attached  with  ZnTiO3 electrode  were  investigated  at  350 ◦C,  respectively,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  EMF   variation −43  mV/decade  to  5–50  ppm  toluene  for  the  senwas  sor  devices  sintered  at  500,  600,  700 ◦C,  respectively.  The  sensor device  sintered  at  600 ◦C  gave  the  largest  sensitivity  to  toluene  gas.

An  investigation  about  VOC  gas  sensor  [16]  has  been  developed  in our  previous  papers.  Similarly,  the  sensing  electrode  might  be  noncompact  and  inﬂuence  the  catalytic  activity  when  the  sensor  was sintered  at  500 ◦C.  However,  the  too  high  sintering  temperature such  as  700 ◦C  here  might  result  in  the  growth  again  for  the  particles  of  ZnTiO3 and  then  the  reducing  of  speciﬁc  surface  area  for ZnTiO3,  which  reduce  the  adsorption  and  response  of  target  gas. Therefore,  the  sensor  sintered  at  600 ◦C  attracted  us  much  more overall  consideration  and  the  discussions  followings  were  based on  the  sensor  which  was   sintered  at  600 ◦C.

Fig.  4  showed  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  to  toluene  gas  at different  operating  temperatures.  The  EMFs  were  almost  linearly to  the  logarithm  of  the  toluene  concentration.  The  slopes  were −30,  −15  mV/decade  at  300,  325,  350,  375,  400 ◦C, respectively.  With  increasing  the  operating  temperature,  the  slope tended  to  become  big.  At  350 ◦C,  the  largest  value  of  slope  occurred, but  above  350 ◦C  the  slope  tended  to  become  small.  This  might  be due  to  that  there  were  many  gas  molecules  adsorbed  on  the  surface  of  the  sensing  electrode.  However,  only  a  small  part  of  the adsorbed  molecules  participated  in  the  chemical  reactions.  The increased  operating  temperature  is  conducive  to  the  process  of  the chemical  reactions.  Therefore,  the  sensitivity  increased  along  with the  increasing  of  the  operating  temperature.  Whereas,  the  exorbitant  temperature  was  propitious  to  the  desorption  for  the  toluene gas  molecules  on  the  surface  of  the  materials.  Consequently,  the amount  of  the  molecules  participating  in  the  reactions  decreased and  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  device  declined.

In  addition,  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  to  other  various  possible  gases  in  the  household  environment,  i.e.  H2S,  HCHO,  NH3, CH4,  C6H5CH2CH3,  C6H6,  C6H4(CH3)2 each  in  the  concentration range  of  5–50  ppm  in  air  were  measured  at  350 ◦C.  The  results obtained  were  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  EMF   variations  of  the  sensor to  C7H8,  H2S,  HCHO,  NH3,  CH4,  C6H5CH2CH3,  C6H6,  C6H4(CH3)2 at −30  mV/decade. 5-–50  ppm  were  The  sensitivities  of  the  sensor  to  these  disturbing  gases  were smaller  than  that  to  toluene  gas,  indicating  its  excellent  toluene selectivity.

Meanwhile,  this  type  of  sensor  gave  speedy  response  kinetics  to dilute  toluene  as  shown  in  Fig.  6.  The  90%  response  and  recovery times  to  5,  10,  20,  50  ppm  toluene  at  350 ◦C  were  15,  10,  8,  5  s  and 25,  39,  50,  90  s,  respectively,  indicated  rapid  response  and  recovery rate  for  the  sensor  device  combining  NASICON  solid  electrolyte  and ZnTiO3 sensing  electrode.

The  inﬂuence  of  the  water  vapor  to  the  properties  of  the  sensor  is  another  important  factor  to  be  considered.  Here,  the  EMF responses  of  the  ZnTiO3 attached  sensor  (sintered  at  600 ◦C)  to 5–50  ppm  toluene  with  coexisting  vapor  (relative  humidity:  0,  40, 80%  RH)  at  350 ◦C  were  measured.  The  moisture  resistant  properties  of  the  sensor  device  were  shown  in  Fig.  7.  It  showed  that  the sensitivity  became  small  along  with  the  increasing  water  humidity.  This  could  arise  from  that  the  presence  of  water  restrained the  occurring  of  reaction  (2)  described  below.  This  kind  of  sensor  device  was   inﬂuenced  by  water  humidity  to  a  certain  extent. Nevertheless,  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  device  measured  in 5–50  ppm  toluene  gas  environment  with  80%  RH  water  humidity −80  mV/decade  indicated  that  this  kind  of  sensor was  as  high  as  device  could  be  used  in  some  extent  water  humidity  range.  This must  be  investigated  and  improved  in  the  future  experiment  and study.

At  last  the  effect  of  O2 on  the  sensing  properties  of  the  sensor  was  investigated.  Fig.  8  showed  the  sensitivities  of  the  sensor device  to  5–50  ppm  toluene  at  different  volume  ratio  of  O2 (5,  20, 90  vol.%)  at  350 ◦C.  Here  the  sample  gases  were  obtained  by  diluting the  mixed  gases  containing  toluene  and  oxygen  with  pure  nitrogen  gas.  It  could  be  seen  that  the  variation  for  EMF   of  the  sensor −98  mV/decade  when device  to  5–50  ppm  toluene  were  the  volume  ratio  of  O2 was   5,  20,  90  vol.%,  respectively.  The  sensitivities  to  toluene  increased  along  with  the  increasing  volume  ratio of  O2.  This  may   be  due  to  reaction  (3)  below  which  O2 had  participated  in.  The  existence  of  O2 could  speed  up  the  process  of  reaction (3).  In  addition,  the  reference  electrode  used  was  Pt  and  it  was  also likely  to  exhibit  certain  response  to  oxygen.  Hence  the  EMF   value  of the  sensing  and  reference  electrode  changed  simultaneously  when oxygen  concentration  was   changed.  Therefore  the  measuring  EMF (EMF  between  SE  and  RE)  of  the  sensor  demonstrated  minor  difference  at  different  oxygen  concentrations.  The  slopes  (variation  for EMF)  increased  along  with  the  sustained  increasing  volume  ratio  of O2.  Also  the  inset  ﬁgure  in  Fig.  8  exhibited  that  the  EMF   value  was linear  to  the  logarithm  of  O2 concentration  at  the  ﬁxed  toluene  concentration.  This  result  was   consistent  with  Eq.  (4)  below  very  well. In  conclusion,  this  type  of  toluene  gas  sensor  was  inﬂuenced  by  O2 to  some  extent.  However,  this  type  of  toluene  sensor  was   generally used  in  air  (The  concentration  of  O2 is  almost  constant.).  Hence, this  type  of  sensor  could  be  utilized  for  detecting  toluene  gas  in air.

For  explaining  the  sensing  behavior  of  the  sensor  device,  XPS was  applied  for  measuring  the  chemical  shift  of  the  toluene  sensor  (e.g.,  O1S,  Ti2p,  Zn2p)  on  the  surface  of  ZnTiO3 oxide  before (sample  1)  and  after  (sample  2)  exposure  to  5000  ppm  toluene  at 350 ◦C  for  12  h,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9.  It  was  found  that  the  chemical  binding  energies  of  O1S,  Ti2p,  Zn2p  also  did  not  change  before and  after  exposure  to  5000  ppm  toluene.  In  addition,  there  was  not C  and  H  element  in  the  ZnTiO3 oxide  electrode  after  exposure  to 5000  ppm  toluene  gas.  Based  on  the  XPS  spectrum  and  the  response to  toluene,  ZnTiO3 has  strong  catalytic  activity  toward  toluene.  It can  be  speculated  that  more  activation  sites  related  to  the  oxidation  of  toluene  may   be  possessed  by  ZnTiO3 and  the  adsorbed toluene  gas  molecules  are  oxidized  to  CO2 (gaseity)  &  H2O  (gaseity)  when  contacting  with  the  adsorbed  oxygen,  which  may   result  in highly  sensitive  and  selective  electrochemical  reactivity  of  ZnTiO3 electrode  toward  toluene  and  generate  high  sensitivity  &  selectivity  to  toluene  for  the  present  sensor.  Hence,  ZnTiO3 oxide  sensing electrode  could  enhance  the  oxidation  of  toluene,  as  a  catalyst,  at 350 ◦C.

As  described,  the  sensor  using  NASICON  and  ZnTiO3 electrode  could  give  a  good  linear  relationship  between  the  EMF value  and  the  logarithm  of  the  toluene  concentration  as  switching  on  dilute  toluene.  Lu  etc  have  established  a  sensing  mechanism involving  mixed  potentials  for  a  group  of  sensors  combining  stabilized  zirconia  with  oxide  electrodes,  such  as  CO,   NOx [17–19]. Also  the  H2S,  Cl2,  NH3,  SO2,  NO,  C7H8 [16,20–24]  sensors  involving  mixed  potentials  sensing  mechanism  have  been  investigated using  NASICON  and  oxide  electrodes  in  previous  papers.  Therefore,  a  similar  sensing  mechanism  would  be  attempted  to  apply for  the  present  sensor  devices.  Here,  NASICON  acts  as  an  ion for conductive  catalysis.

A  compact  solid  electrolyte  sensor  using  a  thick  ﬁlm  of  NASICON and  a  thick  ﬁlm  of  ZnTiO3 electrode  has  been  examined  to  show  well sensing  characteristics  to  toluene  gas.  The  slope  between  the  EMF −90  mV/decade and  the  logarithm  of  toluene  concentration  was  when  the  toluene  was  at  the  concentration  of  5–50  ppm,  and  the 90%  response  and  recovery  times  to  5,  10,  20,  50  ppm  toluene were  15,  10,  8,  5  s  and  25,  39,  50,  90  s,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  sensor  showed  excellent  selectivity  to  toluene  against the  disturbing  gases  (H2S,  HCHO,  NH3,  CH4,  C6H5CH2CH3,  C6H6 and  C6H4(CH3)2).  A  sensing  mechanism  involved  mixed  potential  was  applied  for  the  sensing  properties  of  the  toluene  gas sensor.
