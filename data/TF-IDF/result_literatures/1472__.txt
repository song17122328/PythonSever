FT-Raman and FT-IR spectra of ASnFe(PO4)3 [A = Na2, Ca, Cd] were recorded and analyzed. The bands were assigned in terms of the vibrational group frequencies of SnO6 octahedral and PO4 tetrahedral. The spectral analysis shows that the symmetry of corner shared octahedral (SnO6) and the tetrahedral (PO4) are lowered from their free ion symmetry state. The presence of Fe3+ ions disrupts the S–N–O–S–N chain in the structure. This causes distortion of SnO6 and PO4 in the structure of all the compounds. Also it is seen that there are two distinct PO4 tetrahedra of different P–O bond lengths. One of these tetrahedra is linearly distorted in all the title compounds. The PO4 frequencies and bond lengths are calculated theoretically and are in agreement with the experimental values. The presence of PO4 polyanion in the structure can reduce the redox energy and hence reduce the metal oxygen covalency strength in the structure.

Nasicon-type materials have been extensively studied as solid electrolytes, ionic conductors, electrode materials, low thermal expansion ceramics, sensors, etc. [1–3]. Jriﬁ et al. [4] reported the preparation, structural characterization and spectroscopic studies of Nasicon type arsenate. Phosphates within the Nasicon-type family have been the subject of intensive research due to their potential application as a solid electrolyte, electrode material and low thermal expansion ceramics [5–10]. These materials are having general formula AxBB 3)(PO4)3 and crystallizes into rhombohedral R3C(D6 3d) structure in which (B) 3)BO6 octahedra shares corners with PO4 tetrahedra. Within the Nasicon type structure, there are inter connected interstitial sites M1 (one per formula unit) and M2 (three per formula unit) between which the cation A can diffuse causing fast ion conductivity [7,10]. The choice of transition metal has a signiﬁcant effect on the cell voltage as it primarily depends on the redox couple of the metal atom present in the structure [8,11]. Phosphates within the Nasicon type structure containing elements like Ti, Nb, Sn, V, etc. are important due to the fact that these elements have more than one oxidation state [7]. Ionic conductivity of these compounds can be enhanced by the substitution of tetravalent elements like Ti with trivalent elements like Al, Fe, etc. [8,11]. The iron based phosphates are relatively economic and environmentally friendly ones [11]. The structure of ASnFe(PO4)3 [A = Na2, Ca, Cd] is determined with the help of powder diffraction data and Rietveld reﬁnement [7]. The analysis of vibrational spectra of these compounds can provide vital information on covalency strength and hence to understand its efﬁciency for battery applications [8]. The present study aims to investigate the internal structures of the title compounds by analyzing the Raman and FT-IR spectra.

Nasicon type phosphates ASnFe(PO4)3 [A = Na2, Ca, Cd] used in the present study were synthesized by the conventional solid state reaction technique[7]. Mixtures of carbonate ACO3 [A = Na2, Ca, Cd], oxides SnO2 and Fe2O3 and phosphate NH4H2PO4 were taken in stoichiometric proportion for the solid-state reaction. The heated product after the reaction gives powder crystalline samples [7]. Raman spectra (Fig. 1) of the compounds were

recorded by using Bruker FT-Raman spectrometer in the stokes region (50–4000 cm−1). The FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2) were recorded by using Bruker IFS-66v-FTIR spectrometer in the spectral region of 400–4000 cm−1 using KBr pellet method.

All the title compounds ASnFe(PO4)3 [A = Na2, Ca, Cd] abbreviated as NaSF, CaSF and CdSF respectively crystallise in the hexagonal system with space group R3C(D6 3d) with Z = 6 and ZB = 2 [7]. In NaSF, the sodium atoms, four in number occupy the C3 site, the Fe and Sn atoms two each in number occupy respectively the sites C3i and D3. All the six P atoms are accommodated in the C2 site whereas the 24 oxygen atoms to the general site C1. In ASnFe(PO4)3 [A = Ca, Cd], the A atom two in number is in the D3 site, whereas the Fe and Sn atoms, two each are occupying respectively the C3i and Ci sites. All the six phosphate atoms are in the C2 site. The general site C1 accommodates 24 oxygen atoms. The vibrational modes of these compounds were obtained by the group theoretical method by Fateley et al. [12]. The total irreducible representations excluding the acoustic modes are distributed as (Tables 1 and 2).

The Raman and FT-IR spectra of the title compound were analyzed in terms of the vibrational frequencies of SnO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The spectral band assignments are given in Table 3.

The structure of the NaSF belongs to the Nasicon type structure in which the structural frame work is built up by corner shared octahedra Sn(Fe)O6 and tetrahedra PO4. In this framework, each octahedron is surrounded by six tetrahedra and each tetrahedron by four octahedra. There are four interconnected cation sites usually labeled as M1 (one per formula unit) and M2 (three per formula unit) which can be represented by the crystallographic [M2]3[M1]BB 3)(PO4)3 formula. The occupancy of the cation in the M1 or M2 sites depends mainly on the nature and the number of A atoms in the compound and on the nature of the BB 3) elements within the Nasicon structure. In NaSF the Na+ ions are distributed in the M1 and M2 sites with one atom each and the Sn4+(Fe3+) are randomly distributed [7]. The structural reﬁnement suggests that Fe3+ ions are occupying the Sn4+ ion sites and hence the possibility of different Fe/Sn–O bonds. Hence the SnO6 octahedra is disturbed and distorted due to the presence of Fe3+ ions in the site. Also it is seen that the ionic radii of Fe3+ and Sn4+ are almost equal (rFe = 0.645 ˚A and rSn = 0.69 ˚A). Due to the equivalence of these ions in equivalent sites in the structure of the compound, there is the possibility of Fe3+ ions disrupting the Sn–O–Sn and Sn–O–P chains in the structure. The structure of CaSF and CdSF are similar to that of NaSF with slight change in occupancy of cations (Ca2+ and Cd2+). The cations Ca2+ and Cd2+ are located in the M1 site only.

Sn(Fe)O6 octahedra is one of the important building block in the title compounds with random distribution [7].The SnO6 octahedra with Oh symmetry in its free ion state has six fundamental modes of vibration similar to other metal oxygen octahedras like TiO6, NbO6, MoO6, etc. [13–17].These fundamental modes are symmetric stretching mode  2)1 (A1g), asymmetric stretching modes  2)2 (Eg) and  2)3 (F1u), asymmetric bending mode  2)4 (F1u), symmetric bending mode  2)5 (F2g) and the Raman and IR inactive mode  2)6 (F2u). The  2)1,  2)2, and  2)5 modes are Raman active, whereas the  2)3 and  2)4 modes are IR active [13]. In SnO2, the Sn atoms form octahedra with oxygen atoms and as a result above mentioned, fundamental modes of metal oxygen octahedra are expected. The A1g mode of SnO2 shows higher frequency as compared with TiO2, in spite of SnO2 being less compact than TiO2. In accordance to this concept, the Raman active modes of symmetries B1g and B2g of SnO2 are actually softer than the corresponding modes of TiO2 [18]. Further, the Sn–O bond strength is expected to be lesser in the title compounds as a result of incorporation of Fe3+ ion into the Sn site and the Raman active modes of SnO6 octahedra are likely to soften its intensity. In bulk SnO2, Raman bands are reported at 636.3 (A1g) cm−1 as an intense one, followed by the mode B2g at 780.9 cm−1 and the mode Eg at 474.1 cm−1 due to vibrations of SnO6 octahedra[19,20]. The fully symmetric A1g stretching vibrations of an isolated SnO6 give rise to A1g and B2g pair in the spectra. The A1g and B2g modes are in phase and out of phase phonons of the same vibration are along Sn–O bonds. Usually, the frequencies of these two phonons are very similar or even indistinguishable [21–23]. A comparatively weak band is observed in the Raman spectrum of CaSF at 657 cm−1 and its IR counterpart at 641 cm−1. Similarly a weak and broad band is present in the Raman spectrum of CdSF at 629 cm−1 and a relatively strong band in the IR spectrum at 645 cm−1. But the band in this region is absent in the Raman spectrum of NaSF. The B2g mode is present as a broad band at 788 and 784 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of CdSF and CaSF respectively. As per the structural information, the overall set of Sn(Fe)–O distances within the framework is slightly varied in the title compounds. Sn(Fe)–O(1) is 1.953(4) ˚A, Sn(Fe)–O(2) is 2.045(4) ˚A in NaSF, Sn(Fe)–O distances are 1.962 ˚A and 2.062 in CdSF. The Sn(Fe)–O in CaSF is found to be 1.968 and 2.054 ˚A[7]. These values show a distortion of the Sn(Fe)O6 octahedra in these samples. A linear increase of M1–O(2) distance versus A cation ionic radii (rA), is observed in ASnFe(PO4)3 (A = Na2, Ca, Cd) phases. This will lead to the relatively higher order distortion of SnO6 octahedra in CaSF and CdSF as compared to that of NaSF. This is evident from the activation of B2g modes in the Raman spectra and A1g modes in the IR spectra of CaSF and CdSF. The bands are also observed in the region corresponds to the Eg mode of SnO6 octahedra, an unambiguous assignment of this mode is limited due to the expectation of  2)2 modes of PO4 tetrahedra in this region. The Raman active  2)5 vibration is also stronger especially in the case of more distorted octahedral as reported in TiO6 octahedra of KTiOPO4 crystal [15]. Such a strong band proﬁle is not seen in the spectra of present samples below 250 cm−1, ruling out the possibility of higher order distortion of the SnO6 octahedra. The observed bands correspond to this mode of vibrations are assigned in Table 3 [24]. The broad Raman spectral nature of (SnFe)O6 shows a disorder in the structure of CaSF and CdSF. The presence of Fe3+ ions in the equivalent sites of Sn4+ ions disrupts the SnO6 octahedra, lowering its symmetry from its free ion state. Also the Sn–O–Sn and Sn–O–P chain in the structure is distorted and disrupted due to the inﬂuence of Fe3+ ions in the sites of Sn4+. In NaSF, metal oxygen octahedral vibrational bands are absent which is probably due to the low polarizability (Fig. 1).

The PO4 tetrahedra with Td symmetry in its free form have four fundamental modes of vibration. These modes are Raman active, but  2)3 and  2)4 modes are active in the infrared spectrum only [13–16]. The  2)1– 2)3 modes in NaSF is observed as a broad band extending from 946 to 1213 cm−1 with moderately intense peak at 1042 cm−1 in Raman spectrum. In the IR spectrum, a broad band from 850 to 1300 cm−1 with a very strong peak at 1088 followed by a shoulder at 1230 cm−1 is appeared. Similarly broad band is observed in the Raman spectrum of CaSF from 910 to 1213 cm−1 with very strong intensity peak at 1106 cm−1 along with shoulders at 977, 999 and 1046 cm−1 (Fig. 1). Correspondingly, the IR spectrum gives intense peaks at 1035 and 1092 cm−1 with shoulders at 954 and 1140 cm−1 . The Raman spectrum of CdSF gives a broad band from 920 to 1189 cm−1 with intense peak at 1083 cm−1 with shoulder at 1041 cm−1. But in the IR spectrum of CdSF, strong bands are observed at 1094 and 1142 cm−1 (Fig. 2). The P–O bond length is varied from 1.521 to 1.562 with a mean a mean distance of 1.54 ˚A in NaSF. This is of the order of 1.502 and 1.565 with an average distance 1.534 ˚A in CaSF and is having maximum variation among the compounds under investigation [7]. This variation in P–O distance is in agreement with the presence of shoulders in the Raman spectrum of CaSF at 977 and 999 cm−1. In CdSF also P–O distance shows variation which is in the range 1.508–1.538 ˚A.

The large size cations like Na in conducting channel may leads to compression of PO4 tetrahedra due to its relative size [25]. As a result, the PO4 tetrahedra are expected to be more compressed in 3− bending NaSF than that of CaSF and CdSF. The intramolecular PO4 modes ( 2)2 and  2)4) are more sensitive to conducting ion inser3− stretching modes ( 2)1 and  2)3) tion than the intramolecular PO4 as reported in Li3Ti2(PO4)3[26]. This is because  2)2 and  2)4 are less localized than  2)1 or  2)3 and are more susceptible to small structural changes in the unit cell. Usually, the doubly degenerate  2)2 mode appears at 420 cm−1 in regular PO4 tetrahedra [26]. In the present study, this band is shifted towards higher wavenumber side and appeared in the Raman spectrum of NaSF at 449 cm−1. In CaSF also this band is shifted in the higher frequency side and observed at 436 cm−1. In CdSF, this is appeared at 425 cm−1 which is near to its free state value. The ionic radii of Na2+, Ca2+ and Cd2+ are 1.02 ˚A, 1.00 ˚A, 0.95 ˚A, respectively [7]. The shifting of  2)4 mode towards higher wavenumber from its free state value is increased with increase of ionic radii of M1 ions. Thus the PO4 tetrahedra in NaSF are more distorted than those of CaSF and CdSF. The triply degenerate  2)4 mode appears in the Raman spectrum of NaSF at 530 and 571 cm−1 and its degeneracy is found to be partially lifted. In the IR spectrum also its degeneracy is partially lifted and two bands are observed at 536 and 568 cm−1. Almost similar observations are noticed in the other samples also, the detailed band assignments are given in Table 3.

The appearance of  2)1– 2)3 mode in the higher wave number region than that of its free state value suggests the linear distortion of the PO4 tetrahedra. Splitting observed in the spectral pattern of the title compounds in the  2)3 region of PO4 tetrahedra indicate the lifting of degeneracy of this mode and is due to the distortion [13–16]. Normally in Nasicon structure the PO4 tetrahedra Raman bands are intense, ruling out the metal oxygen chain [27]. Broadening of the spectral band also suggests the distortion of PO4 tetrahedra [16]. The occupation of Fe3+ ion in equivalent positions of Sn in Sn(Fe)O6 octahedra sharing corners with PO4 tetrahedra can also contribute disorder in PO4 tetrahedra.

The PO4 unit gives nine vibrational modes that are characterized by non-degenerage symmetric  2)s(PO), antisymmetric triply degenerate  2)as(PO) of phosphorous non-bridging stretching and the symmetric doubly degenerate ıd(OPO) bending [28]. Anantharamulu et al. [28] observed these in the frequency ranges 1270–1000, 1000–900, 670–540 and 450–440 cm−1. In order to facilitate the analysis of the vibrational spectra, we have performed ab initio calculations of the PO4 group theoretically using Gaussian 03 software [29] package. Internal modes involve the displacement of oxygen 3− anions and present frequencies atoms of the tetrahedral PO4 3−, the theoclosely related to those of the free molecule. For PO4 retical calculations give the frequencies as, 790, 789, 788, 730, 444, 443, 443, 309 and 308 cm−1 which are the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching mode of the P–O bonds and O–P–O symmetric and antisymmetric bending mode. The differences between experimental and calculated vibrational modes are observed, since the experimental results belong to solid phase and theoretical calculations belong to gaseous phase. In a solid, internal modes can split as a consequence of two effects: the site symmetry effect due to an electric crystal ﬁeld of symmetry lower than the tetrahedral acting on the molecule and the correlation effect due to the presence of more than one molecular group in the crystal unit cell. According to Winand et al. [30] for condensed phosphates, the intensity of P–O stretching Raman bands near 1000 cm−1 are always greater than those near 740 cm−1, assigned to the stretching of P–O–P bridges. Hatert [31] reported the P–O bond lengths in the range 1.533–1.538 ˚A and the O–P–O angles in the range 109.7–112.1◦ whereas in the present case the theoretical calculations give the corresponding bond lengths in the range 1.6275–1.6267 ˚A and the angle as 109.5◦. 3− shown to be lowering Me3+/Me2+ redox energy to useful levels in lithium cells in which Li based Nasicon phosphates are used. Polarisation of the electrons of the O2− ions into strong covalent bonding within the polyanion reduces the covalent bonding to the metal ion, which lowers its redox energy [9]. Similarly in Nasicon compounds, like 3− shown to lower the the title compounds the presence of PO4 redox energy of Fe3+/Sn4+ couple. The weak nature of spectral proﬁles ascribed to metal–oxygen octahedra in the title compounds indicate that its covalency strength is weak as compared to that 3− covalency strength. As a result, lower redox energy is of PO4 expected from the Fe3+/Sn4+ redox couple which can give a bet3− anion in CaSF and ter cell voltage. The covalency strength of PO4 CdSF is estimated to be of the order of 0.35 and as a result, these compounds are expected to give better performance for battery applications [8]. The redox energy of the redox couple Fe3+ /Sn4+ is anticipated to be less due to higher order covalency strength of 3− in CaSF and CdSF and low polarizability of (SnFe)O6 octahePO4 dra in all the title compounds.

The observed bands are assigned in terms of vibrations of PO4 tetrahedra and SnO6 octahedra. The SnO6 octahedra in NaSF are having less polarizability, in CaSF and in CdSF this octahedral are disordered and distorted. The PO4 tetrahedra are also distorted and disordered in title compounds. The PO4 frequencies and bond lengths were calculated theoretically and the values are in agreement with the experimental values. The covalency strength of 3− anion in CaSF and CdSF is estimated to be of the order of 0.35, PO4 and these compounds are expected to give better performance for battery applications.
