Nasicon type compositions Mn0.5MSb(PO4)3 (M = Al, Fe and Cr) are prepared by solid state method. All the compounds are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, infrared, Raman and electron spin resonance techniques. The crystal structures of these materials are refined by Rietveld and least square minimization programs using X-ray powder diffraction data. Among these compounds, Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3 and Mn0.5FeSb(PO4)3 crystallize in rhombohedral lattice with R ¯3c and R ¯3 space group respectively, while Mn0.5CrSb(PO4)3 adopts monoclinic lattice with P21/n space group. The 31P-MAS nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3 indicates only one type of phosphorous in the rhombohedral lattice. All the compounds exhibit characteristic PO4 vibrational bands in infrared and Raman spectra. The room temperature powder electron spin resonance spectra of these samples gave broad signal at g ≈ 2.0 for Mn2+. Frequency dependent impedance measurements are carried out. The thermal expansion of these samples is studied in the temperature range 30–500 ◦C and they exhibit near zero thermal expansion coefficients.

Nasicon type phosphates with skeleton structure have been extensively investigated due to their interesting properties [1–4]. Their high ionic conductivity, low thermal expansion behavior, host for radio active waste, fairly large surface area (hence used as catalyst supports) and ability to accommodate ions in the lattice make them worthy of investigation [5–12]. Nasicon is a solid solution of NaZr2P3O12 (NZP) and Na4Zr2Si3O12. Its composition is given by Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) and is generally represented as ABB?P3O12. The site “A” can be occupied by (i) monovalent alkali, Cu+, A g+, H+, H3O+, N H4+, or (ii) divalent alkaline earth ions, or (iii) divalent transition metal ions such as Cu2+, C o2+, Mn2+, N i2+ and Fe2+, while B and B? can be filled with tri, tetra or pentavalent transition metal ions. Phosphorous can be partially substituted by silicon. Thus the structure can be tailored by substituting at A, B, B? and P sites gives rise to a large number of compounds for comparative studies. The structure can be described as a network formed by the corner sharing of PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 (B?O6) octahedra (Fig. 1). Two BO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahedra constitute the basic unit of the frame work which is linked along the c-axis. Such ribbons along the c-axis are interconnected by PO4 tetrahedral units along the a-axis resulting in tunnels/interstitial spaces which are occupied by “A” ions [13]. The ions at “A” site can occupy 6b (type I) or 18e (type II) crystallographic positions. In type I site, the “A” ions are in distorted octahedral coordination and are situated between two BO6 octahedra along c-axis. On the other hand, “A” ions in type II sites have eight fold coordination and are located between the ribbons [13,14]. In NZP type systems, type I sites are completely occupied by “A” ions and type II sites are vacant while in Na4Zr2Si3O12, both types I and II sites are completely filled with “A” ions. Nasicon systems with monovalent cations at “A” site are extensively studied compared to systems containing divalent cations at this site [15]. Among the Nasicon family of compounds, structures with divalent manganese at the “A” site are unique. The existing literature on Mn-containing Nasicon materials shows (a) interesting distribution of Mn2+ ions in the available sites (types I and II) and (b) concentration (of Mn2+) dependence on the type of lattice adopted [16]. The present investigation deals with the preparation, characterization, ESR, impedance and thermal expansion studies of Nasicon type materials Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3, M n0.5FeSb(PO4)3 and Mn0.5CrSb(PO4)3 (hereafter MnASP, MnFSP and MnCSP respectively).

The compositions MnASP, MnFSP and MnCSP are synthesized by conventional solid state reaction using AR grade chemicals MnCO3, S b2O5, N H4H2PO4 and metal oxides (Al2O3, F e2O3 and Cr2O3). The calculated amounts of the starting materials for 5 g of desired sample in single batch are thoroughly mixed and ground together with spectral grade acetone in an agate mortar for 1 h to give homogeneous mixture. The ground mixture is placed in silica crucibles and heated slowly in an electrical furnace to 300 ◦C and kept for 4 h at that temperature to facilitate the decomposition of ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate. The mixtures are sequentially heated in silica crucibles at 500 ◦C (10 h), 700 ◦C (10 h), 800 ◦C (24 h) and finally at 925 ◦C (48 h) with intermittent grinding after each heat treatment. Powder X-ray diffractograms are recorded at room temperature on Philips X’pert Analytical X-ray diffractometer using Nickel filtered Cu K? radiation of wave length 1.5406 Å. The 2? ranged from 5◦ to 80◦ with increments of 0.003◦ and a counting time of 5 s. Rietveld refinement of the structures is performed using DBWS program [17]. Density of samples in the form of well-sintered pellets is experimentally measured by Archimedes principle using xylene as an immersion liquid. Calculated densities are obtained from lattice parameters. The 31P solid state MAS-NMR spectra are recorded at room temperature with a Bruker DSX-300 MHz high resolution spectrometer operating at 121.49 MHz with an 8 kHz spinning speed. The samples are packed in a 4-mm Zirconia rotor. Pulses of 90◦ with 6.62 ?s duration are employed with a recycle delay of 5 s between the pulses. The chemical shift values are given with respect to an 85% H3PO4 solution. Infrared spectra are recorded in the form of KBr pellets in the wave number range 2000–400 cm−1 using JASCO FT/IR-5300 spectrometer and the Raman spectra are recorded on RENISHAW 1000B spectrometer in the wave number range 100–1500 cm−1. The room temperature ESR spectra of all the samples are recorded on JEOL-JES-FA200-ESR-spectrometer equipped with a 100 kHz field modulation unit. AC Impedance measurements are carried out using HP4192A Impedance analyzer on the sintered pellets coated with silver paint. The temperature range of impedance measurements is 30–500 ◦C and frequency range is 102–106 Hz. The relative thermal expansions of the samples are measured using NETZSCH 402 PC dilatometer in air in the temperature range 30–500 ◦C. The samples are pressed into rectangular rods of size 25 mm × 6 m m × 6 mm for these measurements. The heating and cooling rates are 5 ◦C/min.

The room temperature powder X-ray diffractograms of all the three compounds are shown in Fig. 2. The peak positions of the XRD lines are similar to those observed for other Nasicon type compositions and free from lines due to unreacted reactants or undesired products. An attempt is made to fit these powder XRD patterns using Rietveld analysis. The d-lines of MnASP are similar to that of CaSb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3 [18] and therefore its structural parameters are taken as starting parameters for Rietveld analysis. This analysis gave a reasonable fit to rhombohedral lattice with space group R ¯3c. A typical Rietveld fitted XRD pattern for the MnASP composition is given in Fig. 3. The final reliability factors and atomic parameters are given in Tables 1 and 2. The d-lines of MnFSP and Rietveld refinement results are consistent with that of recently reported Mn0.5FeSb(PO4)3, crystallizes in rhombohedral lattice with space group R ¯3 [19]. All attempts to fit the powder XRD lines of MnCSP with rhombohedral lattice are unsuccessful. A close observation of the powder XRD of MnCSP shows the presence of (i) two weak d-lines in the region 2? = 15–17◦ and (ii) low intense d lines at 2? = 22–24 and 26–30◦. These lines are generally observed if the Nasicon phase crystallizes in the monoclinic lattice [20]. Assuming a monoclinic lattice with the space group P21/n for MnCSP, an attempt is made to fit the d-lines using a least square minimization program “POWD” [21]. The fit is reasonably good and all the d-lines are accounted [20]. The unit cell parameter values obtained for all the three compounds are given in Table 3 along with the unit cell parameters of related systems. Using the lattice parameters, Avogadro’s number and mass of the sample, theoretical (X-ray) densities are calculated. The theoretical and experimental densities agree well within the experimental error (Table 3). Hence the porosity of the samples is small indicates the well sintered nature of the pellets.

The 31P-MAS NMR is a good probe to find the local structure of phosphorous ions in Nasicon framework. It gives different signals for chemically/crystallographically inequivalent sites of phosphorous [22–26]. For instance the 31P-MAS NMR spectra of NaZr2(PO4)3, L i T i2(PO4)3 and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 gave only one symmetric peak and all the phosphorous atoms occupy at only one site at 18e position of the rhombohedral lattice with R ¯3c space group [16,24]. On the other hand, two peaks are observed in Na5Ti(PO4)3 suggesting the occupation of phosphorous at two crystallographically different sites [24] and in Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the spectrum has a shoulder indicating two different chemical environments [16]. Fig. 4 shows the 31P-MAS NMR spectrum of MnASP and it is characterized by a symmetric single peak around 13.38 ppm suggesting only one type of phosphorous in the rhombohedral lattice. This result supports the view that Mn2+ ions are completely filled in 6b of type I sites and type II being vacant in the space group R ¯3c. The chemical shift value of this compound is close to our earlier results observed in NaAlSb(PO4)3 (ı = 9.21 ppm) and LiAlSb(PO4)3 (ı = 9.12 ppm) [27], but higher than those observed in NaZr2(PO4)3, L i T i2(PO4)3 and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [16,24]. The observed difference in the chemical shift values of the present samples with NaZr2(PO4)3, L i T i2(PO4)3 and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 could be due to change in the electron density at phosphorous due to the electronegativity differences of M3+ and M5+ compared to M4+. We could not record the 31P-MAS NMR spectra of other two samples (MnFSP and MnCSP) due to their paramagnetic nature.

IR and Raman spectra of all the compositions under investigation are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively. The observed bands are in the region 1500–200 cm−1 which can be divided into five groups. The region of these groups are (a) 1300–1100 cm−1, (b) 1050–900 cm−1, (c) 740–500 cm−1, (d) 450–420 cm−1 and (e) below 400 cm−1. The vibrational modes of Nasicon phases can be assigned to internal and external modes of PO4 tetrahedra and to lattice modes including the motions of the metallic Sb5+ and M3+ (M = Al, Fe and Cr) in their octahedral coordination and Mn2+ ions in 6 and/or 8 coordination spheres. It is observed that phosphate group vibrations are strong compared to the lattice modes and metal-oxygen vibrations. Factor group analysis predictions give 9 vibrational modes for PO4 group [28–30]. They are (i) the symmetric non degenerate PO stretching (?s or ?1, observed in the range 950–1030 cm−1), (ii) antisymmetric, doubly degenerate PO stretching (?d or ?2, observed at 440–450 cm−1), (iii) symmetric, triply degenerate OPO bending (?d or ?3, observed at 1 100–1 160 cm−1) and (iv) triply degenerate, antisymmetric and harmonic OPO bending (?d or ?4, observed at 545–680 cm−1). Barj et al. have pointed out that the variation in ?3 mode in Nasicon systems could be attributed to the polarizing nature of the metal ion. The more polarizing the ion (small size, large charge), the more localized are the electrons on the P–O(M) bond and therefore higher will be the force constants and hence the frequencies [31]. In the present series of compounds, the charge of the metal ion is same and therefore the polarizing power depends only on the ionic size of M3+. Since the ionic size of M3+ follows the order Al3+ < F e3+ < C r3+, the order of ?3 is expected to be MnASP > MnFSP > MnCSP. This trend is indeed observed for these compounds in the IR and Raman spectra (Table 4). The Raman and IR band positions of ?1, ?2, ?3 and ?4 modes observed in the present series are close to those expected for Nasicon type of compounds. The Raman bands observed at 385 and 367 cm−1 (in MnASP), 359 cm−1 (in MnFSP) and 374 cm−1 (in MnCSP) could be assigned to M3+–O stretching modes of vibrations while weak bands observed below 280 cm−1 are due to translational and rotational modes of PO4 tehtrahedra [28,31,32]. The strong absorptions observed in the region 625–640 cm−1 in both Raman and IR of the present compounds indicate Sb5+ in octahedral oxygen coordination [30,33]. The low frequency modes below 100 cm−1 are generally attributed to metal ions occupied in “A” site of Nasicon framework and this is not recorded due to the instrumental constraints.

Fig. 7 shows the room temperature ESR spectra of all the three samples. A single broad ESR line with g ≈ 2.0 is observed for all these samples. Generally Mn2+ ion with 3d5 configuration is expected to give 30 line ESR spectrum for each of the chemically/crystallographically inequivalent site as a result of five unpaired electrons (S = 5/2) interacting with applied magnetic field and also with nuclear spin of 55Mn (I = 5/2). If the “zero field splitting”, which occurs due to axial distortions around Mn2+ environment is zero or very small, the fine structure lines would coalesce and result either in a six line (sextet) hyperfine spectrum with g = 2 or a single broad symmetric line with g = 2. Single and broad symmetric line would be observed if the paramagnetic ion (here Mn2+) is surrounded by similar ions (i.e., undiluted lattice). In the present samples, a single broad ESR line with g ≈ 2.0 indicates the absence of zero field splitting and the presence of interactions due to surrounding Mn2+ ions. To eliminate the interactions due to other Mn2+ ions, the sample is diluted with diamagnetic ions. For this purpose, we have chosen Ca0.5AlSb(PO4)3 which is isomorphous with Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3 and doped with Mn2+ to obtain Ca0.48Mn0.02AlSb(PO4)3, whose ESR spectrum is also shown in Fig. 7. A close comparison of the ESR spectra of Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3 and Ca0.48Mn0.02AlSb(PO4)3 shows the following: (i) the peak to peak distance of both the samples is around 50 gauss (ii) the spacing between the hyperfine lines of Ca0.48Mn0.02AlSb(PO4)3 is unequal and incompletely resolved. The hyperfine coupling constant is about 9 gauss which is small compared to the hyperfine coupling observed for Mn2+ doped in diamagnetic lattices [34]. The broadness of the ESR profile indicates considerable affinity of Mn2+ with surrounding paramagnetic ions leading to delocalization effects and hyperfine interactions. This correlates well with the observation of low conductivity at room temperature due to the sluggish movement of Mn2+ ions. The small magnitude of hyperfine interaction constant in MnMSP (M = Al, Fe and Cr) indicates that the electron delocalization is still dominant. The Mn2+–M3+ (M = Al, Fe and Cr) exchange interactions are strong in MnFSP compound compared to other resulting in sharp ESR signal.

Fig. 8 shows the complex impedance (Cole–Cole) plots of real (Z?) and imaginary (Z??) parts of impedance for all the three samples. For the samples MnASP and MnCSP, semicircle behavior of complex impedance is observed at the temperatures 400, 450 and Fig. 7. ESR spectra of (a) MnASP, (b) MnCSP, (c) MnFSP and (d) Ca0.48Mn0.02AlSbP3O12. 500 ◦C. These plots terminate at the origin indicating the absence of series resistance in the equivalent circuit model of the sample. All the semicircles start on the real impedance axis at the lowest frequency. This starting point is found to decrease with increase in the temperature. This behavior of Cole–Cole plots is characteristic of conducting nature of the samples. In case of MnFSP, elongated semicircle behavior of complex impedance is observed at the temperature 300 ◦C and above indicating the presence of second semicircle. Impedance behavior of MnASP and MnCSP is similar with a single semicircle in the temperature range 400–500 ◦C. At lower temperatures the complex impedance plots are straight lines with increase in curvature with the increase of temperature. The resistances and capacitances associated with all these impedance plots can be ascribed to inter grain and intra grain effects and electrode effects are not present. This is because observed resistivity is independent of sample geometry, electrode size and spacing. For MnFSP, the grain and grain boundary effects are seen as a flattened semicircle which can be resolved into two semicircles. The first semicircle could be due to inter and intra grain effects and the second one can be ascribed to grain boundary contributions. In MnASP and MnCSP such a separation of grain and grain boundary effects are not possible. The AC conductivity of these samples is calculated from low frequency intercepts of semicircles when plotted as a function of inverse of temperature on semi-log scale and are straight lines. The activation energies (Ea) for conduction obtained from these plots are 1.94, 0.80 and 0.97 eV for MnASP, MnFSP and MnCSP respectively. In all the three systems, the conductivity is attributed to Mn2+ ion and its motion is unfavorable in comparison to the motion of smaller ions like Li+ and Na+ in Nasicon channels. Accordingly, the observed conductivity of present samples is very low (≈10−8 mho cm−1) at room temperature. However, with increasing temperature from 30 to 500 ◦C, conductivity increased around 2–3 orders in magnitude (≈10−5 mho cm−1). Using Cole–Cole plots and the expression ω? = 1 (where ω is angular frequency and ? is the relaxation time), the relaxation times are calculated and plotted as a function of inverse of temperature on a semi-log graph (figure not presented). For all samples, relaxation time is decreasing with increase in temperature (Table 5). The activation energies (E) for relaxation are found to be 1.94, 0.78 and 1.00 eV for MnASP, MnFSP and MnCSP respectively. These values are very close to activation energy for conduction (Ea) of the same samples. It is also noticed that the conductivity is more for MnFSP and followed the order ?(MnFSP) > ?(MnASP) > ?(MnCSP). The frequency variation of conductivity (Fig. 9) shows two slopes at all the temperatures of the present measurements for MnASP. The low frequency and low temperature conductivity could be because of the intrinsic defects and charge agglomerations present in the sample. These graphs can be fit to the modified power law [35] ?(ω) = ?0 + Aωn1 + Bωn2.

The values of exponents n1, n2 are evaluated and these values indicate the disorder (entropy) present in the samples and nature of charge agglomeration. Similar behavior is observed in other samples also. To understand the electrical microstructure of the pellets and to find out whether the overall pellet resistances represent the bulk resistance of the grains, grain boundary or other external parameters, the experimental data are replotted as the imaginary parts of the impedance (Z??) and electric modulus (M??) against log frequency (Fig. 10) for MnASP. The data show single peaks in Z?? and M?? spectra and the peak frequencies are almost coincident, where semicircle behavior of complex impedance plot is observed. This result also agrees with the straight-line behavior observed in log ? versus 1000/T graph and it indicates Debye like behavior of dipoles responsible for the peak in Z?? versus frequency plots [26]. The height of M?? peak at various temperatures is found to be in the range 0.0008–0.0017. For an ideal Debye solid, M?? is given by M?? = C0 2C where C0 = (ε0 A)/d (A and d are area and thickness of the pellet, ε0 is permittivity of the free space), C is the capacitance of the pellet, which is calculated from the relation, ωRC = 1 (ω = 2?fmax, R = the resistance obtained at lower frequency on the Cole–Cole plot). The calculated M?? values from the above equation are found to be in close agreement with the observed values (Table 6) confirming the Debye like behavior of the present Nasicon compounds.

The bulk thermal expansion curves of all samples in the range 30–500 ◦C are given in Fig. 1 1. Thermal expansion coefficients (˛)are calculated using the equation, ˛ = l2 − l1 l1(T2 − T1) where l1 and l2 are lengths at temperatures T1 and T2 respectively. The ˛ values are tabulated in the Table 7 for all the samples along with the some reported values for similar systems. It is seen from Fig. 1 1 that all the samples show a near linear thermal expansion behavior. These samples have near zero thermal expansion coefficient values in the temperature range 30–500 ◦C. The observed thermal expansion may be due to bending and distortion of PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 (B?O6) octahedra as suggested by Alamo [36]. The thermal expansion coefficients of MnASP, MnFSP and MnCSP are 0.0029 × 10−6 K−1, 0.0022 × 10−6 K−1 and 0.0017 × 10−6 K−1 respectively which are nearly equal. The slight difference in thermal expansion coefficients of these compounds may be due to slight difference in their ionic sizes of differentiating ions Al3+ (5.4 nm), Fe3+ (5.5 nm) and Cr3+ (6.2 nm). 

Manganese containing Nasicon type compositions Mn0.5MSb(PO4)3 (M = Al, Fe and Cr) have been prepared and characterized. The compositions MnASP and MnFSP crystallize in rhombohedral lattice while MnCSP crystallizes in monoclinic lattice. The IR and Raman spectra of these samples show characteristic PO4 vibrations and correlate well with each other. The solid state 31P-MAS NMR spectrum of MnASP suggests only one type of phosphorous in the rhombohedral lattice. ESR spectra indicate the absence of zero field splitting and undiluted nature of the Mn2+ ions. Complex impedance plots of MnASP and MnCSP show only grain effects, while MnFSP has grain and grain boundary effects. The activation energies obtained for relaxation and AC conduction correlate well. The frequency variation of conductivity follows the modified power law. These compounds exhibit almost zero thermal expansion in the temperature range 25–500 ◦C.
