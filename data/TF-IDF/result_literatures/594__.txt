Redox flow battery (RFB) technologies have become play a significant role in the future for the storage of electrical energy produced from intermitted renewable energies such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric powers. Although the development of high-energy density RFB remains a challenging. Herein, we report the Na-aqueous-catholyte RFB (NaAqRFB) towards high-density electrical energy storage. Na-metal anode offers a high energy density and the use of an aqueous flowing catholyte decouples the energy and power. NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) is employed as a solid electrolyte in the NaAqRFB to separate the Na anode and a flowable aqueous catholyte. The constructed prototype NaAqRFB operates using a sodium-hexacyanoferrate solution as the aqueous catholyte with no added supporting salt/electrolyte, and yielded an average cell potential of ∼ 3.06 V (vs. Na/Na+), and an energy density of 54.16 Wh L−1 (based on the volume of catholyte) with high energy efficiency (∼ 92%, over 50 cycles), outperforming conventional RFB. The present work offers a new route for developing high-energy-density redox flow batteries.

The production of electrical energy from renewable power sources, like solar, wind, and hydroelectric, is increasing year by year; however, effective energy-storage systems (EESs) are critical for alleviating the output fluctuation of these renewable energy sources [1], [2]. There are myriad emerging EESs, including Li-ion batteries, Na-S batteries, and ZEBRA batteries. Amongst these EESs, redox flow batteries (RFBs) are regarded as particularly suitable for large-scale (up to MW/MWh) storage of electrical energy produced from renewable energy sources due to their uncoupled power and energy densities, design flexibility, and scalability [3], [4]. Existing conventional aqueous RFBs (i.e. vanadium aqueous RFBs (VAqRFBs)) suffer from the high cost of vanadium, and low energy densities (15–30 Wh L−1) originating from their low cell voltages (1.2–1.8 V), which impedes their widespread deployment [5], [6], [7].

A variety of RFB configurations have been explored in attempts to increase their energy density, including using a lithium-metal anode [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Li-aqueous catholyte RFBs (LiAqRFBs) are emerging high-energy-density RFB systems [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] that utilize a Li-metal anode (in an organic electrolyte) and a flowable aqueous catholyte separated by a solid ceramic electrolyte. LiAqRFBs have aroused considerable attention as they provide the combined benefits of state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and aqueous RFBs [16]. The Li-metal anode provides a high energy density and the use of an aqueous flowing catholyte decouples the energy and power, and lowers the system cost [1], [15], [19]. Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to employ Na anodes as an alternative to Li anodes, owing to the widespread availability of Na (extracted from seawater) and its low cost (Na costs 250–300$/ton and Li costs 5800$/ton) [20]. Indeed, the chemical properties of Na are akin to Li, though the redox potential of Na (Na/Na+ = − 2.71 V vs. SHE (standard hydrogen electrode)) is a little low compared with that of Li (Li/Li+ = − 3.04 V vs. SHE) [21], resulting in a lower cell voltage when using a Na anode. However, the low cost of sodium can eventually lower the energy cost ($/kWh, about 19–23 fold) of Na battery systems compared with Li battery systems. Shaw's group [22], [23] reported the Na-aqueous-catholyte RFB (NaAqRFB) and used a Na-β”-Al2O3 ceramic solid electrolyte, Na-Cs alloy anode (in an organic electrolyte), and vanadium aqueous catholyte (VOSO4/HCl/Na2SO4). This system showed poor cycling performance due to the instability of Na-β”-Al2O3 in an aqueous catholyte medium. Additionally, vanadium aqueous catholytes are known to be expensive, and corrosive and toxic, with regards to fabrication and disposal. Thus, future NaAqRFBs require: (i) a robust Na-ion-conducting solid ceramic electrolyte that is chemically stable in both a non-aqueous anolyte (organic or ionic-liquid-based electrolyte) and an aqueous catholyte over a wide range of pH values, and capable of preventing ions other than Na+ crossing between the catholyte and anolyte; and (ii) a user-friendly low-cost aqueous catholyte.

NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3–xO12 and Na1+xZr2–x/3SixP3–xO12–x/3) has been identified as a potential solid ceramic electrolyte for use in NaAqRFB cells. NASICON is an excellent ceramic Na+-ion conductor with a three-dimensional framework crystalline structure; therefore, it could provide high ionic conductivity, akin to state-of-the-art Na-β”-Al2O3 (10−3 S cm−1), and excellent stability in an aqueous medium [24], [25], [26]. Sodium hexacyanoferrate (Na4Fe(CN)6.10H2O, NaHCF) has been used to prepare aqueous catholytes [27]. The cyanide within NaHCF is bound very tightly (the formation constant, Kf, for Fe(CN)64− (ferrocyanide) is 1036) and, thus, NaHCF exhibits low toxicity [27]; NaHCF is also used as a food additive (where it is known as E535) [28] since it is one of the best anti-caking agents [29]. Moreover, NaHCF is non-volatile, and NaHCF aqueous catholytes are non-corrosive relative to bromine- and iodine-based aqueous catholytes, which makes them user-friendly. The aqueous catholytes used in the most studies were prepared using a redox mediator with added supporting electrolyte (e.g. K3Fe(CN)6/LiOH [12] and VOSO4/HCl/Na2SO4 [22]). Supporting electrolytes (e.g. LiOH and Na2SO4) are usually used to provide Li+ or Na+ ions for the anodic reaction, but they indirectly increase the catholyte cost. Herein, we attempted to use NaHCF as an aqueous catholyte without any supporting electrolyte; NaHCF should be able to supply ample Na+ ions for the anode reactions as well as [Fe(CN)6]4− for the cathode reactions. Thus, we expect that using multifunctional NaHCF will reduce the price of aqueous catholyte. NaHCF aqueous catholyte has a specific energy cost of $6∼ 12/kWh (Table S1) based on its specific chemistry, which creates significant scope for reaching an overall EESs cost of $150/kWh (U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target) for grid-level storage. In this work, our prototype NaAqRFB cell, using NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) as a ceramic electrolyte, displays an impressive cell voltage of 3.08 V (vs. Na/Na+) and an energy density of 54.16 Wh L−1 (NaHCF concentration = ∼ 0.68 M). This energy density is greater than that of state-of-the-art VAqRFBs (15–25 Wh L−1) [5] and recently reported Li-based RFBs [9], [14], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39].

Sodium metal (99.9%) and sodium hexacyanoferrocyanide decahydrate (>99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The organic electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) for the anode was prepared from NaCF3SO3 and TEGDME purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The coin-cell-type anode compartment was assembled using coin-cell components from 421 Energy Co., Ltd. Carbon felt was bought from Toyobo, Japan, and used after heat-treatment at 500 °C for 1 h, which significantly improved its hydrophilicity.

First, the coin-cell type anode section was assembled in a glove box, as depicted in Figure S1a. The assembled coin cell consisted of an organic electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in TEGDME), a Na-metal anode on a stainless-steel current collector, and a NASICON separator. A prototype Na-aqueous-redox-flow-battery (NaAqRFB) cell was then assembled, as schematically illustrated in Figure S1b. In brief, the coin cell was first fixed onto a metal plate on the bottom of a cylinder. A circular silicone rubber grip (outside diameter ~32.5 mm and inside diameter ~16 mm) was placed on the NASICON ceramic electrolyte of the coin cell, followed by the heat-treated carbon felt (effective area of ~ 2 cm2). The silicone rubber grip was used to prevent the catholyte coming into contact with the coin-cell metal body. The exposure area of the NASICON to the catholyte is ~ 2 cm2. Finally, a cylindrical cathode compartment was joined to the bottom of the cylinder. The cathode compartment contained two holes (inlet and outlet) on its head for the catholyte. Ti wire and metal screw were used as supporting substrates at the cathode and anode side, respectively. In static mode, 0.5 mL of NaHCF aqueous catholyte was injected through the cathode-compartment holes, which were then sealed with tape. In flow mode, 1.2 ml of NaHCF aqueous catholyte flowed between the cathode compartment and a catholyte reservoir using a pump. The prototype cell was assembled under ambient conditions. Figure S1c shows a digital image of the NaAqRFB prototype cell and the inset in Figure S2c is a digital image of the fabricated coin cell.

All electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature (∼ 25 °C). In static mode, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in a potential range of 2.5–3.85 V (vs. Na/Na+) at various scan rates from 0.01–0.2 mV s−1. For galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements the cut-off potential was set between 2.8 and 3.6 V (vs. Na/Na+). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz at the open-circuit voltage. In flow mode, GCD measurements were carried out using 2.5 and 3.8 V (vs. Na/Na+) cut-off potentials for charging and discharging, respectively. We calculated the volumetric capacity and energy density based on the catholyte. All GCD tests were performed using a Wonatech (WBCS 3000) electrochemical workstation. The CV and EIS measurements were performed using a multichannel Biologic (SP150) electrochemical workstation. The pH of the catholyte was measured using an Orion™ Star A216 pH Benchtop Meter (Thermo Scientific). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 V/PC with Cu Kα radiation (0.1542 nm) under a potential of 40 kV from 10° to 80°.

Fig. 1a shows a schematic illustration of the NaAqRFB cell structure, in which a sodium-metal anode in an organic electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in TEGDME) and a carbon-felt current collector in an aqueous catholyte containing NaHCF are separated by a NASICON ceramic electrolyte. In this system, the anode is static (non-flowable), while the catholyte is circulated between the catholyte tank and cathode compartment using a pump (flow-mode). During charging, Na+ ions from the catholyte are transported through the NASICON ceramic electrolyte and deposited into the Na-metal anode, while [Fe(CN)6]4− (ferrocyanide) is oxidized to [Fe(CN)6]3− (ferricyanide) (Fig. 1b). Upon discharging, [Fe(CN)6]3− is reduced back to [Fe(CN)6]4−, and Na+ ions are transported back into the catholyte through the NASICON ceramic electrolyte (Fig. 1b). The overall charge/discharge reaction for this system can be written as shown in Eq. (1).

In the NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) structure (Fig. 1b), three-dimensional framework comprising (Si/P)O4 tetrahedra that share the pocket corners with ZrO2 octahedral. Such structure makes a “hexagonal bottleneck” the shortest diameter of which is 4.6 Å, which is even twofold higher than the sum of Na+ and O2- ionic radii. This large space permits Na+ to move through and makes NASICON as Na+ conductive material [40], [41]. As shown in Fig. 1c, the oxidized [Fe(CN)6]3- and reduced [Fe(CN)6]4- species have similar octahedral structure (Oh geometry with a central iron atom) [42] but [Fe(CN)6]3- consist of FeIII with a nominal 3d5 configuration and [Fe(CN)6]4- consist of FeII with a nominal 3d6 configuration. Therefore, the 3d orbital of FeII/FeIII in [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− is responsible for its consecutive oxidation/reduction (i.e. electron release/electron gain) reactions during charge/discharge.

Figure S1 illustrates a prototype flow cell used in this study. The cell essentially comprises a Ti-wire supporting substrate, a carbon-felt current collector with an area of 2 cm2, and a coin-type anode compartment. The carbon felt was used after heat treatment thus tremendously improves their hydrophilicity nature (Figure S2). The coin-type anode compartment contains a Na-metal anode attached to a stainless-steel current collector in an organic electrolyte (1 M NaCF3SO3 in TEGDME), and is sealed with an exposed NASICON surface (area ∼ 2 cm2). The thickness and conductivity of the NASICON ceramic electrolyte were 0.8 mm and ∼ 8.9 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively (detailed procedures in the experimental section). The anode and cathode parts are independent, so it is easy to assemble this battery system. Moreover, it is possible to individually replace either the cathode or anode part and, therefore, this approach could further reduce the battery cost.

There is not much clear information of the solubility of NaHCF compounds, so we scrutinized the solubility of commercially available NaHCF compounds in water at room temperature. We directly dissolved varying concentrations of NaHCF in water at room temperature (∼ 25 °C). NaHCF was soluble up to 0.6 M, with a precipitate observed at 0.7 M (saturated), as shown in Fig. 2a. The concentration of this saturated NaHCF solution is about ~0.68 M. The pH of all prepared aqueous NaHCF solutions was ∼ 8. In theory, pH 8 water exhibits a stable electrochemical potential window between −0.47 and 0.76 V (vs. SHE). However, in practice water electrolysis (i.e. the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively)) typically does not occur at the limits of the theoretical potential window (−0.47 to 0.76 V) as the electrical energy input must provide the full amount of enthalpy required for the OER and HER, which widens the potential window to −0.87 to 1.13 V (vs. SHE) (Figure S3). Therefore, the flow cell using the NaHCF aqueous catholyte can be operated in a wide potential range of ∼ 1.84–3.84 V (vs. Na+/Na). The theoretical redox potential of the [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− redox couple is 0.36 V (vs. SHE); however, its formal redox potential varies with concentration/ionic strength of the solution and reaches a maximum of ∼ 0.40–0.51 V (vs. SHE) [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. Hence, a maximum cell voltage of ∼ 3.11–3.22 V (vs. Na+/Na) can be achieved with the NaHCF-based aqueous catholyte in our prototype flow battery system.

(a) Photograph of NaHCF aqueous catholyte at different concentrations (the red arrow shows the saturated NaHCF salt), (b) CV curves of the first 10 cycles measured at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 using a 0.4 M NaHCF aqueous catholyte, (c) galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles for various concentrations (0.1 to ~ 0.68 M) of NaHCF aqueous catholyte measured at a current of 0.5 mA (0.25 mA cm-2), and (d) a plot of NaHCF-aqueous-catholyte concentration vs. capacity.

The electrochemical properties of the prototype cell were first investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements in static mode. CV measurements were conducted using a 0.4 M NaHCF aqueous catholyte at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in a potential range of 2.5–3.8 V. The obtained CV curves are shown in Fig. 2b, with the well-defined redox peaks attributed to the [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− redox couple. No OER or HER peaks appear and, thus, this potential range (2.5–3.8 V) represents the stable potential window of the catholyte. Moreover, the CV curves for the first 10 cycles almost overlap with each other and there are no significant changes in the peak current (i.e., anodic peak current and cathodic peak current) and peak area during successive scans (Fig. 2b); this demonstrates the high reversibility and stability of the [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− redox couple. Theoretical calculations were carried out (see supporting information for details) using Gaussian 09 program to gain further insights on the [Fe(CN)6]4− and [Fe(CN)6]3− species. We performed a structural geometry optimization and found that the Fe-C and C≡N bond lengths are 2.099 Å (6 x Fe-C) and 1.191 Å (6 x C≡N), respectively, for [Fe(CN)6]4− and 1.996 Å (4 x Fe-C), 1.992 Å (2 x Fe-C), 1.180 Å (4 x C≡N) and 1.181 Å (2 x C≡N), respectively, for [Fe(CN)6]3− (Table S2). This confirms the presence of small Jahn-Teller distortion in [Fe(CN)6]3- [48], [49]. The net charge of [Fe(CN)6]4− (4−) decreases after oxidation into [Fe(CN)6]3− (3−) and the corresponding differences in charge distribution for [Fe(CN)6]4− and [Fe(CN)6]3− are shown in Table S3. The positive charge distribution change (∆qFe) on Fe is about 0.048 e Bhor-3 (Table S3). Figure S4a shows CV curves at scan rates of 0.01–0.2 mV s−1. At 0.01 mV s−1, CV curve shows 3.28 V and 3.09 V (vs. Na/Na+) for the oxidation and reduction peaks, respectively and the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks increased with increasing the scan rate. Besides, the anodic and cathodic peak currents (Ip) increase linearly with the square-root of the scan rate (Figure S4b), which shows that the [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− redox reaction is diffusion controlled. Fig. 2c shows first-cycle GCD profiles for various concentrations of NaHCF aqueous catholyte (0.1, 0.4, 0.6, and ∼ 0.68 M) at 0.5 mA (0.25 mA cm−2). The volumetric capacity (Ah L−1) increases with increasing aqueous-catholyte concentration: 2.6, 10.4, 15.3, and 17.3 Ah L−1 for 0.1, 0.4, 0.6, and ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF, respectively (for more details see Table S4). This reveals that using a concentrated catholyte leads to a high capacity (Ah L−1). Fig. 2d shows that ∼ 97% of the theoretical capacity was achieved for 0.1 M and 0.4 M NaHCF, and ∼ 95% of the theoretical capacity was attained for 0.6 M and ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF.

Cycling stability is very important for practical applications and, hence, the cell cycling stability was tested in static mode for all NaHCF-catholyte concentrations using the galvanostatic charge-discharge process (Figure S5). Fig. 3a shows the first ten galvanostatic charge-discharge curves for when using the ∼ 0.68 M aqueous NaHCF catholyte, with no significant potential degradation observed. In addition, there are no obvious changes in the discharge capacity over 100 cycles and ∼ 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE) was maintained after the first cycle (Fig. 3b). The good charge-discharge and cycle performance corroborate the feasibility of the constructed prototype NaAqRFB system. Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured before and after cycling to investigate the stability and compatibility of the cell with the ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF aqueous catholyte. Fig. 3c shows Nyquist plots before and after 100 cycles (Equivalent circuit for the simulation of the Nyquist plot is shown in Figure S6). The interface resistance, which is related to the grain-boundary resistance of the NASICON ceramic electrolyte and the interfacial resistance between NASICON and both electrolytes (NaCF3SO3/TEGDME anolyte/NaHCF aqueous catholyte), slightly decreases after 100 cycles (for details see Table S5). This might be caused by etching of the NASICON grain boundaries during cell testing [50].

Electrochemical performance of NaAqRFB in a static mode using ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF aqueous catholyte and characterization of the NASICON ceramic electrolyte and NaHCF aqueous catholyte before and after cycling. (a) Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles measured at 0.5 mA (0.25 mA cm-2), (b) plots of capacity and CE vs. cycle number at 0.5 mA (0.25 mA cm-2), (c) electrochemical impedance spectra before and after 100 cycles, (d) photographs and SEM images of NASICON before and after cycling (1. pristine NASICON, 2. aqueous cathode side of NASICON after cycling, and 3. non-aqueous anolyte side of NASICON after cycling), (e) XRD pattern of NASICON before and after cycling (1. pristine NASICON, 2. aqueous cathode side of NASICON after cycling, and 3. non-aqueous anolyte side of NASICON after cycling), and the bottom panel displays the reference XRD pattern of the NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) (JCPDS #35–0412), and (f) ionic chromatographic analysis of Na-ion concentration.

Fig. 3d shows photographs and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the NASICON ceramic electrolyte before and after cycling. There was almost no change in the color of the NASICON surface at the anode side after cycling, but the NASICON surface at the cathode side became slightly yellow, which could be due to some adsorption of the NaHCF aqueous catholyte. The SEM images show that the NASICON surface roughness changed after cycling, which might be caused by electrolyte etching. However, this surface corrosion occurred on the microscale and, thus, we hope it does not affect the cell performance and ability of NASICON to separate the aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. Both sides of the cycled NASICON were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and then compared with pristine NASICON, as shown in Fig. 3e. There is no phase changing and peak shifting for the cycled NASICON ceramic separator, compared with pristine NASICON, indicating that it is highly stable in both the aqueous catholyte and organic electrolyte. Ion chromatography analysis was used to determine the Na-ion concentration in the aqueous catholyte after cycling (Fig. 3f). The Na-ion concentration in the catholyte decreased very slightly (~ 0.056 mol L-1) after 100 cycles, which might be caused by first irreversibility cycle. However, overall the results indicate the stability and reliability of the aqueous catholyte over long cycling.

Finally, as a proof of concept, the performance of the NaAqRFB flow battery was tested whilst circulating a high-concentration NaHCF catholyte (~0.68 M) through the cathode compartment (Fig. 4). The prototype flow cell was tested using varying currents of 1.5, 3, 4, and 5 mA (0.75, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mA cm−2, respectively), as shown in Fig. 4a. At a current of 1.5 mA the flow cell exhibited a volumetric capacity of 17.7 Ah L−1, which is 97.14% of the theoretical capacity (18.22 Ah L−1), and a maximum average discharge potential of 3.06 V. However, on increasing the current rate to 5 mA, the discharge potential was reduced to 2.74 V. Nevertheless, this potential obtained at high current is still higher than those of previously reported non-aqueous RFBs and Li-based RFBs (Table 1). The cell shows an impressively high energy density of 54.16 and 33.92 Wh L−1 at 1.5 and 5 mA (0.75 and 2.5 mA cm−2), respectively. The energy density at 1.5 mA (0.75 mA cm−2) is evaluated to be about 96.71% of the theoretical energy density (56 Wh L−1). Furthermore, the cell showed high Coulombic, voltage, and energy efficiencies (CE, VE, and EE, respectively) of 98%, 92.7%, and 92%, respectively, at 1.5 mA (0.75 mA cm−2), and 99%, 70.2%, and 70%, respectively, at 5 mA (2.5 mA cm−2) (Figure S7). It is clear that the current does not affect the CE, but the VE and EE decrease with increasing current. The decrease in voltage, VE, and EE on increasing the current could be caused by slow redox-couple (ferrocyanide/ferricyanide) kinetics and the bulk resistance of this RFB system at high currents.

Electrochemical performance of NaAqRFB in a flow-through mode using ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF catholyte. (a) Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles at different currents (1.5–5 mA (0.75–2.5 mA cm-2)), (b) polarization curves, (c) representative charge-discharge curves measured at 3 mA (1.5 mA cm-2), (d) plots of capacity, CE, VE, and EE vs. cycle number measured at 3 mA (1.5 mA cm-2), (e) photograph of assembled flow-cell setup, and (f and g) charged flow-cell setup powering multi-colored glowing LEDs.

Polarization curves for the flow cell are presented in Fig. 4b. The maximum power density is 15.3 mW (7.65 mW cm−2), with a corresponding discharge potential of 2.05 V. The flow cell reaches its maximum power output shortly at 7 mA (3.5 mA cm−2); however, this value is higher than, or close to, those for non-aqueous/Li-aqueous RFBs reported elsewhere: cobaltocene-ferrocene in non-aqueous/non-aqueous, 1.8 mW cm−2 [51]; Li-1,4-naphthoquinone in non-aqueous/non-aqueous, 5.1 mW cm−2 [52]; Li-I/LiFePO4 in non-aqueous/non-aqueous, 0.5 mW cm−2 [8]; Li-S in non-aqueous/aqueous, 4 mW cm−2 [17]; and Li-[Fe(CN)6]3− in non-aqueous/aqueous, ∼ 5.9 mW cm−2 [12]. At low currents (up to 3 mA (1.5 mA cm−2), the kinetic polarization was not noticeable, because there is sufficient time for the fast reactions of the ferrocyanide/ferricyanide redox couple. A potential drop occurred at high current (>4 mA (2 mA cm−2)), which may be primarily attributed to the slow redox kinetics and the low Na-ion mobility in NASICON. Hence, the battery performance can be further improved by increasing the ionic conductivity of NASICON.

Representative GCD curves for the first seven cycles of the flow cell at 3 mA (1.5 mA cm−2) are shown in Fig. 4c. It is clear that the cell can be charged and discharged within the selected potential window. Noticeable color changes were observed in the catholyte during charging and discharging; the yellow NaHCF solution becomes nearly colorless (insets in Fig. 4c) during charging and then turns back into a yellow-colored solution during discharging. The capacity, CE, VE, and EE of the flow cell are plotted against the number of cycles in Fig. 4d. Impressively, after 50 repeated GCD cycles 98% CE, 79% VE, and 79% EE were maintained, along with a capacity retention of 99%. The obtained EE is higher than that of reported Li-based RFBs (Table 1) [11], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Fig. 4e shows the complete assembled flow-cell setup comprising a pump, catholyte reservoir, flow controller, and the NaAqRFB cell. On charging at 3 mA, the flow cell can power up ten multicolored glowing light emitting diodes (LEDs), as shown in Fig. 4f and g.

In conclusion, a proof-of-concept NaAqRFB cell was designed and constructed using a NASICON ceramic-electrolyte separator and an aqueous NaHCF catholyte without any supporting electrolyte. The aqueous NaHCF catholyte provides sodium ions and a redox couple for the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. When using a ∼ 0.68 M NaHCF catholyte, the NaAqRFB cell exhibited a potential of 3.08 V and an impressive capacity and energy density of 17.7 Ah L−1 and 54.16 Wh L−1 (calculated based on the volume of the catholyte), respectively. This energy density is much higher than that of previously reported Li-based RFBs. Besides, we expect that the energy density can be further improved by: (i) operating this battery system at ∼ 100 °C, as up to ∼ 1.5 M NaHCF salt can dissolve at this temperature (Figure S8), which provides a theoretical energy density of ∼ 123 Wh L−1, (ii) using an aqueous catholyte with multi-redox couples, and (iii) using a new high-concentration catholyte (possible redox couples are presented in Figure S9). However, this is critical in the current stage for the scalable NaAqRFB manufacture. Because, the optimization of flow cell engineering and cathode current collector design, optimization of flow rates, and conductivity enhancement of NASICON ceramic separator, and replacing sodium metal by safer anode are remaining for the future to significant performance enhancements and increase the safety. The unsafe sodium metal can be replaced with hard carbon suspension or semi-liquid sodium biphenyl. Thus, we expect that this NaAqRFB system will provide a framework for developing the next generation of high-energy-density RFBs.
