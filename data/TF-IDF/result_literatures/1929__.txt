The heat capacity investigation of crystalline pentasodium zirconium tris(phosphate) was carried out in a vacuum adiabatic calorimeter between 7 and 340 K and in a differential scanning calorimeter of the heat bridge type between 330 and 620 K. Between 389 and 424 K, an isostructural solid-to-solid phase transition of Na5Zr(PO4)3, has been found, the nature of which is connected with a centering of off-centered zirconium atoms in octahedral sites and an occupation transfer between sodium sites in the structure. The results were used to calculate the characteristics of the phase transition and the thermodynamic functions of Na5Zr(PO4)3: the transition temperature T ◦ ; enthalpy H◦(T) − H◦(0), entropy S◦ (T) and Gibbs function G◦(T) − H◦(0) over the range from 0 to 620 K. From hydroﬂuoric acid solution microcalorimetry, the enthalpy of solution of Na5Zr(PO4)3 at 298.15 K has been determined and the standard enthalpy of formation has been derived. 
By combining the data obtained by the two techniques, the Gibbs function of formation of Na5Zr(PO4)3 at 298.15 K has been calculated.
There is a strong need for knowledge on thermodynamic properties for the crystalline phosphates forming structures analogues to the NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) type family [1] because of the importance of NZP compounds in material science, technology and geochemistry.
NZP materials exhibit high thermal stability, resistance to radiation damage and to the action of aggressive media, low thermal expansion, high ionic conductivity and catalytic activity, and the ability to immobilize radioactive nuclides [2–6].
The basis of NZP structure is a three-dimensional framework of {[L2(TO4)3]p−}3∞ type, which consists of discrete L octahedra and isolated T tetrahedra. Two kinds of cavities (1:3 multiplicity), known as M1 and M2 are situated within this framework. In the prototypical structure the M1 site is occupied + by sodium ions (Na ), the M2 site remains vacant, the L site is occupied by Zr4+ and T site is occupied by P5+ . Four crystallographic sites with different coordination numbers allow the existence of a wide range of isoand heterovalent ionic substitutions in the framework and its holes. Due to the fact that cations of the same kind can occupy different positions in the structure and various cations are able to enter into positions of the same type, the formation of continuous isomorphous ranges is possible. For example, the concentration range for existence of the NZP structure for the system Na9−4xZrx(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2.25) corresponds to various compounds and solid solutions with 1 ≤ x ≤ 2.25 in the formula. 
The phosphate series are obtained by partial substitution of tetravalent Zr4+ ones. In the sodium-rich phosphate Na5Zr(PO4)3 (x = 1) sodium cations accommodate within crystallographic sites M1, M2 and L; that means, they are involved in building the framework (together with zirconium) and populate all framework cavities.
Till date there is a gap between the rapid accumulation of structural information for NZP compounds and the much slower rate of their thermochemical investigations. There are only a few references referring to the thermodynamic data of the NZP phosphates family [3,7–11]. The electrochemical (500 K < T < 1000 K) and calorimetric (4 K < T < 800 K) studies of the Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 solid solutions (sodium super ionic conductors) were reported in [7,8]. For Na3M2(PO4)3 (M2 = Fe2, Cr2, ZrMg) solid electrolytes, the temperature dependences of the heat capacity were measured in the range from 10 to 300 K [9,10]. We reported the results of a thermodynamic study on composition NaZr2(PO4)3 [11] and on the compounds MZr2(PO4)3 with M = K, Rb, or Cs [3]. The present investigation was performed in order to continue the study of thermodynamic properties of sodium containing NZP like structure phosphates. 
With this aim in view, the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and possible phase transformations on heating and cooling for the crystalline pentasodium zirconium tris(phosphate) were studied in the range from T → 0 to 620 K and the thermodynamic (T), G◦(T) − H◦(0) functions H◦(T) − H◦(0), S◦ calculated. Using a hydroﬂuoric acid solution calorimetric measurements and using the thermodynamic cycle proposed, enthalpy of reaction Na5Zr(PO4)3 synthesis at 298.15 K was calculated. The thermochemical parameters of formation of Na5Zr(PO4)3 were estimated at temperature T = 298.15 K and pressure p = 101.325 kPa.
The phosphate Na5Zr(PO4)3 was discovered by investigating of the subsolidus phase diagram of the NaZr2P3O12–Na5ZrP3O12 system [12]. It melts with decomposition. The peritectic horizontal line lies at temperature of 1433± 5 K. The X-ray structure determination of Na5Zr(PO4)3 single crystals was reported in [13].
The compound Na5Zr(PO4)3 was prepared by the sol–gel method based upon reactions taking place in aqueous solution. The following reactants were used: NaNO3, ZrOCl2·8H2O, H3PO4. A solution of phosphoric acid, taken in accordance with the stoichiometry of the phosphate, was dropped into the mixture of an aqueous solutions of an sodium nitrate and zirconium oxychloride taken in the stoichiometric ratios under stirring at room temperature. The formed gel was dried at 353 K, thermally treated in unconﬁned air access at 873 and 1073 K with at least 24 h plateau. The thermal treatment stages were alternated with careful grinding.
The obtained sample is colorless polycrystalline powder. Its phase purity was checked by X-ray diffraction (DRON-2.0 diffractometer, Co K␣ radiation), using PDF data. The X-ray pattern contained only reﬂections of the Na5Zr(PO4)3 phosphate. The symmetry of these crystals is rhombohedral (space group R32). The unit cell parameters for the synthesized phosphate were derived from least-squares reﬁnement of powder X-ray diffraction data: a = 9.162(9) Å, c = 22.15(2) Å, V = 1610 Å3. The IR spectrum (Specord75 IR) agrees with data presented elsewhere [14] and shows no evidence of condensed phosphate groups.
The chemical composition and homogeneity of the sample were checked with the aid of a Camebax microprobe analyzer. The results show the homogeneity of the sample and conﬁrmed the stoichiometry of the sample to be Na4.84Zr0.99P3.04O24 and is close to the theoretical composition Na5Zr(PO4)3. This sample was studied in an adiabatic vacuum calorimeter, in a differential scanning calorimeter, and in a Calvet-type microcalorimeter.
An automated thermophysical device (BKT-3.07), an adiabatic vacuum calorimeter, was used to measure the heat capacity of the Na5Zr(PO4)3 sample in the range from 7 to 340 K. The design of the calorimeter and the procedure of the heat capacity measurements have been described earlier [11,15]. From the calibration and testing results of the calorimeter it was found that the uncertainty of the heat capacity measurements at liquid helium temperatures is within to ±2%. As temperature rises up to 40 K, it decreases to ±0.4% and becomes approximately equal to ±0.2% between 40 and 340 K.
An automated differential scanning calorimeter (ADKTTM) operating by the principle of triple thermal bridge was used to measure the heat capacity, temperature and enthalpy of phase transition in the range from 330 to 620 K. The apparatus design and the measuring procedure were reported in [16,17]. The uncertainty of the measurements of C0 p in the above temperature interval was about ±2%, for the transition temperatures ±0.5 K and for the transition enthalpies about ±1.5%.
An automated isothermal differential Calvet-type microcalorimeter (DAK-1-1-A) was employed to measure the enthalpies of solution at 298.15 K. Design and the operation were described earlier [11,18]. For calibration, a known current was passed through the cell-assembly heater over a certain time. The reliability of the calorimeter operation was tested in experiments on the solution of reagent-grade KCl in bidistilled water. The value for the standard enthalpy of solution obtained by us solH◦ = 17.6±0.4 kJ mol −1 (average of 10 experiments) was in agreement with the published value solH◦ = 17.58 ± 0.34 kJ mol −1 [19]. The 298.15 K enthalpies (rH◦ ) of the reactions studied are averages of four to six replicates. In conformity with IUPAC recommendations [20], the uncertainty in rH◦ is given as a standard deviation of the average. The net uncertainty in the enthalpy of formation was evaluated as σ = ( i )1/2, where σi is the uncertainty in a single measurement.
The phase transition of Na5Zr(PO4)3 is reversible. The temperatures of start and end of the transition, named crystal I (crI) and crystal II ( crII) are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray scattering study [21] and high-temperature X-ray diffractometry [5]. The structural and calorimetric data allow characterize the transition from crI to crII, which is accompanied by an abrupt change of the cell parameters [5,21], its volume and absorbtion of a quantity of heat. The transition is of ﬁrst-order phase.
In other respect, the temperature dependence of the heat capacity (Fig. 1) does not exhibit any peculiarity. Below T < 389 K, it gradually increases as the temperature rises (curve AB, crystal I). Above T > 424 K, the C0 p values of the substance are nearly constant (curve DE, crystal II).
The characteristic data of the phase transition, obtained from the results of the measurements in the scanning calorimeter, are summarized in Table 2. The results are shown graphically in Fig. 2.
