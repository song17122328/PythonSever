New approach of phosphate–sulfate synthesis, preventing sulfur elimination was proposed.
It implies sulfur encasement into intermediate with heightened thermal resistance, thus the synthesis temperature of phosphate– sulfate could be increased, and crystallization can be performed.
This method is considered to be capable by example of obtaining of Pb2/3FeZr(PO4)7/3(SO4)2/3 ceramic.
It was synthesized by means of sol–gel method via formation of intermediate PbSO4, which encased sulfur and eventually led to formation of mentioned before phosphate– sulfate.
Obtained sample was characterized via Xray, IR, combined DTA–TG, SEM and microprobe electron analysis.
Crystal structure and unit cell parameters were derived from least-squares refinement of powder Xray diffraction data (NZP-type, sp.gr.R3c, a = 8.6339 A ° , c = 23.2991 A ° , V= 1504.1 A ° 3).
Thermal expansion (aa = 0.9610-6, ac = 3.24@10-6, aav = 1.76@10-6 K-1) of compound also has been studied.
There is a wide area of interest, due to development of ceramics with low thermal expansion.
We suggested new synthesis method of phosphate–sulfates and proved it by Pb2/3FeZr(PO4)7/3(SO4)2/3 formation.
Also we have determined the thermal expansion parameters of the phosphate–sulfate with NZP structure.
So, compound related to materials with ultra-low thermal expansion.
In accordance with represented method, it may be easily applied to other compounds, which synthesis can be performed via formation of intermediate sulfate with high melting temperature.
We are on a verge of the synthesis of the following row: Pb2-0.5xMgFe(PO4)3-x(SO4)x (0\x\4/3).
It is appealing because of the maintenance of lead excess in comparison with sulfur.
It offers an opportunity to completely bind sulfur in precursor and finally synthesize phosphate–sulfates.
