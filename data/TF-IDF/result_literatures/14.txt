The Li1.5Al0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3-coated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode material has been successfully fabricated by a sol-gel method. Combined with the results of XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS, the LAZP is coated closely on the surface of NCM and forms a ﬁlm with a thickness of approximately 4 nm. The LAZP coating layer can signiﬁcantly facilitate the Li+-ion diffusion rate at the interface of electrolyte/electrode on the NCM particle surface, decrease the degree of Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing, and preserve the structural stability of cathode material. The NCM@LAZP-1 cathode material maintains 78.3% after 300 cycles at 1C in voltage of 2.8e4.3 V. Furthermore, at the high cutoff voltage of 4.5 V, the modiﬁed NCM@LAZP-1 cathode is discovered to realize a sustained reversible capacities of 179.3 mA h g-1, corresponding to capacity retention of 84.8% after 200 charge/discharge cycles, while the pristine NCM cathode delivers only 112.1 mA h g-1, matching with capacity retention rate of 52.3%.
Conventional lead accumulator has been difﬁcult to meet the requirements of the electric vehicles (EV) or other electronic products. Contrarily, with high energy density and capacity, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become an indis-pensable part of our lives. Nevertheless, with the continuous development of electronic products, commercialized lithium-ion batteries such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4 will be replaced by more sophisticated batteries. Among these advanced cathode materials, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) has fascinated tremendous interest owing to its extra high capacity and reason-able price. Unluckily for NCM811, the terrible cycling and rate performance place restrictions on its further application, particu-larly under the condition of high rate and voltage. Furthermore, the residual lithium adhering to the NCM811 adsorbed H2Oor CO2 in the air, would cause the material performance descend. Moreover, the content of Co, Mn decreased caused by Ni increased can make the stability of the NCM811 decline seriously since Co, Mn play a role in stabilizing material structure. Nor is this all: common adverse effects between intercalation/deintercalation Li+ of NCM811 cathode materials and nonaqueous organic electrolyte inescapably lead to a decline in cathode capacity. Besides, due to the content of Ni increased maybe easily lead to Li+/Ni2+ disorders, causing structure collapsed and resistance increased or aggravating circumstances. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a smart tactic to deal with impediment to commerciali-zation of NCM811.Ion-doping and surface-coating are two main strategies con-ducted to gain better performance of cathode materials. Ion-doping is important for structural stabilization of cathode materials, broaden the intercalation/deintercalation routes of Li+, and enhancing the electrical conductivity of cathode. Normally, assorted elements, such as Zr, Ti, Ca, Al and Mg, have been densely investigated to improve the performance of substrate materials. And surface-coating, for the host materials is the role of the barrier, the barrier effect against the corrosion by electrolyte. Nowadays, kinds of oxides, for instance, Al2O3, MgO, TiO2, ZrO2, WO3,SnO2 and SiO2, have been served as cladding material. Unfortunately, most coating materials concentrated on preventing substrate material and organic electrolyte from contact with each other, and awfully neglected the lithium-ion electron transport, contributing to limited advancement to poor cycle performance. It is an enormous challenge for modiﬁed material to accomplish fast lithium-ion and high level of structural stability.Hence, fast lithium-ion conductor, regarded as one of outstanding cladding materials, is investigated by researchers, to remove obstacles to further development and application of layered lithium Nickel-based cathode materials. Li2SiO3, NaTi2(PO4)3, Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3, LiMnPO4, LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3 for instance, show excellent advantages in the aspect of performance improvement. It’s remarkable that NASICON-type solid electrolyte Li1.5Al0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 (LAZP), as a member of fast lithium-ion conductors, possessing high Li-ion conductivity (5.80 x10-7 Scm-1) at room temperature, is able to ameliorate lithium ion diffusion between substrate ma-terial and organic electrolyte and restrain adverse effects which reacted with electrolyte.Herein, This thesis tries to pay attention to properties improvement of NCM by coating with LAZP using sol-gel method. We made a carefully study of LAZP modiﬁed NCM about its crys-tallographic structure, surface morphology, chemical valence of critical elements and microstructure. And the result shows that LAZP enables the cathode maintain integrated and speed the lithium ion diffusion up.
The precursor Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1(OH)2 which used in this experi-ment was synthesised by coprecipitation method. In order to obtain LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2,Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1(OH)2 was blended with LiOH in a molar ratio of 1:1.05. After that, the admixture was heated for 5 h at 500 °C and then calcined for 15 h at 850 °C under O2 at-mosphere heated at 5 °C min-1.In order to acquire NCM@LAZP cathode material, NH4H2PO4, Al(NO3) ▪9H2O, CH3COOLi and Zr(NO3)4 at appropriate molar ratio were dissolved in 30 ml of ethanol, stirring to form a milky white gel. Then, the powder of NCM was added into the ethanol. Next, the admixture was churned for 2 h at 90 °C until transformed into sediment with ethanol evaporated and placed into a vacuum for 12 h at 70 °C. Then, the fabricated powder was calcined for 5 h at 850 °C under oxygen atmosphere heated at 5 °C min-1. Finally, the contents of LAZP with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 wt% are marked as NCM, NCM@LAZP-0.5, NCM@LAZP-1, NCM@LAZP-2.
Electrochemical performances of the cathode materials were investigated in representative CR2025 batteries. The cathode ma-terials were manufactured by sticking the admixture of active stuff, carbon black, and PVDF (polyvinylidene diﬂuoride) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The uniform slurry was taken shape after desirable N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was added into the admixture, then distributed it on the surface of the aluminum foil immediately. After desiccation for 10 h at 90 °C in vacuum for the sake of NMP removed, the Aluminum current collector was manufactured to tiny circles with a diameter of 12 mm, followed by desiccation for 2 h in order to keep drying. Lithium metal applied as opposite electrode. The electrolyte was produced with LiPF6 solved in the solution with EC: DMC: EMC (1:1:1 in volume ratio). The electric battery was assembled in the Vacuum Glove Box as a semi-lithium ion battery under the protection of argon atmosphere. The charging and discharging process of the lithium ion battery between 4.3/ 4.5 V (versus Li/Li+)at25 °C was carried out in the Neware battery test system. The CHI760E electrochemical workstation was served to survey the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) (frequency range, 100000e0.01 Hz) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the po-tential range of 2.6e4.3 V (scan rate, 0.1 mV s-1).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was served as a method to characterize the crystal structure of samples and investigate the inﬂuence of LAZP layer on NCM crystallographic structure, and the character-ization results are showed in Fig. 1a-1c and Figure S1. Fig. 1a has made it clear that XRD patterns of two powders possess similar curves and can be completely blended with the hexagonal a-NaFeO2 crystal structure. It is worth noting that no foreign material was observed in XRD patterns of NCM and NCM@LAZP-1, demon-strating that LAZP modiﬁcation can hardly affect the crystallo-graphic structure of NCM, which probably related to the small amount of LAZP layer coating on the NCM. Furthermore, the (003) peak of NCM@LAZP-1 moved slightly to higher angle compared with unmodiﬁed cathode, which might be attributed to rare Zr4+, PO43- entering the crystal structure of NCM, during the interaction between the LAZP and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2. Owing to similar semi-diameter, fewer contents of Zr4+ (0.072 nm) may inhabit the position of Mn4+ (0.053 nm) and PO43- (0.238 nm) would take up the site of O2- (0.140 nm). The strength ratio of (I003/I004) of each sample outnumbers 1.2, as shown in Table 1, and it’s obviously that the value for modiﬁed NCM@LAZP-1 (1.238) is much more higher than that of unmodiﬁed NCM (1.201), reﬂecting that the coating material LAZP can signiﬁcantly retrain the level of cation mixing. Moreover, the Rietveld reﬁnements of NCM and NCM@LAZP-1 were conducted with employing the GSAS software. As can be seen from Fig. 1ced and Table 1. With the low error factors (Rp and Rwp) for two prepared materials, the calcu-lated results are worth adopting. The speciﬁc values of c/a for NCM (4.943) and NCM@LAZP-1 (4.945) are greater then 4.9, providing further evidence that two preparations exhibit well-ordered layer structure and lower degree of cation mixing. Furthermore, lattice parameter c was increased from 14.152 to 14.176 Å, which further conﬁrm that Zr4+ and PO43- have incorporated into the substrate material.
SEM and TEM were utilized to observe the surface morphology of NCM and NCM@LAZP-1. As vividly shown in Fig. 2aeb, the sur-face of NCM@LAZP-1 particles got smoother with coating a LAZP layer, compared with coarse surface of raw NCM particles. This phenomenon might be caused by the chemical reaction between LAZP and lithium residual during the coating process, and the content of Li residual on the surface of NCM reduced. Moreover, the distribution of main chemical elements of NCM@LAZP-1 particles was obtained by EDS mapping (Fig. 2ced). Clearly, the major ele-ments of Ni, Co and Mn, particularly modiﬁed elements Zr, P and Al were equally distributed on the surface of NCM. To further explore the modiﬁed effect of LAZP, TEM was introduced to demonstrate the existence of LAZP coating layer. The original NCM particles displayed a bare surface with distinct crystallinity at their margins (Fig. 2eef). In Fig. 2f at margin area, the spacing of the lattice fringe is 0.472 nm, matching the (003) direction of NCM. As a contrast, a LAZP coating ﬁlm with a thickness of round about 4 nm on the surface of the NCM@LAZP-1 particles are subject to observation under TEM (Fig. 2geh). Besides, the lattice spacing of 0.208 nm is ﬁtted with the (003) direction of NCM@LAZP-1 (Fig. 2h). The test results of SEM and TEM obviously indicate that coating with LAZP forms an evenly layer and decreases the amount of lithium residual on the surface of NCM particles.To further conﬁrm the LAZP existed, XPS spectra measurement is introduced to investigate the chemical states and elements valence of two samples. As can be observed in Fig. 3bed, three major chemical elements, Ni, Co, and Mn, are probed in both two samples. Additionally, Modiﬁed elements Zr, P and Al were detec-ted on the surface of NCM@LAZP-1 in Fig. 3eeg. Owing to lower contents, the peaks of Zr, P and Al are harder to observe in XPS full spectra of NCM@LAZP-1 in Fig. 3a. Moreover, Fig. 3b distinctly de-picts the Ni XPS spectrum, which two main peaks at 872.8 and 855.3 eV are ﬁtting with Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2, and Ni 2p3/2 can be divided into two binding energy at 854.7 and 855.7 eV, matching with the valence of Ni2+ and Ni3+. As demonstrated by a number of research that the Ni2+ ions can easily substitute Li + ions in Li slabs, accompanied with the generation of cation mixing, caused by similar length of their radius. It is clearly shown in Fig. 3b that the content of Ni2+ for NCM@LAZP-1 is 16.9%, while the content of Ni2+ for NCM is 40.6%, much higher than NCM@LAZP-1 one, reﬂecting that the LAZP ﬁlm apparently decreases the Ni2+ content and noticeably ameliorates the electrochemical properties of NCM]. The reason lies in that the LAZP ﬁlm reduces the de-gree of Ni2+ connection in matrix material and inhibits the content of Ni3+ reduction. As exhibited in Fig. 3c, the Mn XPS spectrum for both two samples possess similar curve with few clear-cut distinctions about Mn 2p3/2 (642.3 eV) and Mn 2p1/2 (653.9 eV), indicating the tetravalent state for Mn. Furthermore, for both two samples Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 are corresponding to the two peaks at 794.8 and 779.8 eV, respectively, which obviously indicates that there is no change for valence of Co (Fig. 3d). Besides, the Zr 3d peaks of 179.4 and 181.6 eV (Fig. 3e) and P 2p peak of 134.5 eV (Fig. 3f) and Al 2p peak of 68.0 eV (Fig. 3g) are obviously probed, demonstrating the elements of Zr, P and Al on the surface of cathode material exist in Zr4+,P3+ and Al3+, respectively. In conclusion, XPS image for two samples demonstrate that the sur-face of NCM@LAZP-1 obviously possessed a low content of Ni2+, which noticeably inhibits Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing. Moreover, LAZP is detected on the particle surface of NCM@LAZP-1 which sub-stantially proves that a thin layer of LAZP was spread over the surface of NCM.To further investigate the function of LAZP on the electro-chemical properties of NCM, the galvanostatic charge/discharge of the batteries were measured in voltage from 2.8 to 4.3/4.5 V at 25 °C (1C), and relevant results are showed in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Fig. 4a displays discharge curves of two samples in 2.8e4.3 V at 1C, It is clearly observed that a sharply declining of capacity from 196.8 to 129.4 mA h g-1 for the pristine NCM material matches with the capacity retention rate of only 65.7% (200 cycles). On the contrary, the NCM@LAZP-1 electrode release a surprising amount of elec-tricity (153.1 mA h g-1) after 300 cycles with the capacity retention rate of 78.3% corresponding to its original capacity (195.4 mA h g-1). Furthermore, the LAZP has contributed more to enhancing the cycling stability of NCM in the potential range of 2.8e4.5 V. As presented in Fig. 4b, the electrode of NCM@LAZP exhibits a rela-tively high discharge capacity of 179.3 mA h g-1 with a capacity retention rate of 84.8% after 200 cycles. Unfortunately, the pristine NCM electrode presents an inferior capacity retention rate of 52.3%after 200 cycles compared to its initial capacity (214.3 mA h g-1). The dramatically decreasing of NCM discharge capacity may be associated with deterioration of base material structure, which hindered lithium ion diffusion between electrode and organic electrolyte, further demonstrating the signiﬁcant effect by coating with LAZP layer, which decreases resistance of interface for Li + -ion diffusion and enhances the stability of cathode structure during the cycling. Besides, the charge and discharge proﬁles in potential range from 2.8 to 4.5 V for bare NCM and NCM@LAZP-1 at various cycles obviously exhibit that the discharge voltage plateau for un-modiﬁed NCM descends sharply, only 3.96 V remained after 200 charge/discharge cycles, as showed in Fig. 4c. Surprisingly, the discharge voltage plateau for NCM@LAZP-1 is 4.15 V after 200 cy-cles, as displayed in Fig. 4d. The slower decline of discharge voltage plateau for LAZP modiﬁed NCM demonstrates that LAZP coating layer suppressed the phase transition of cathode material from layered to spinel-like phase. In addition, the initial charge/discharge proﬁles of the NCM and NCM@LAZP-1 at 0.1C in 2.8e4.5 V are presented in Fig. 4e, it can be found that the coulombic efﬁciencies of NCM@LAZP-1 is 83.90%, lower than 88.07% of unmodiﬁed NCM, that might be caused by the content of active chemical material of cathode decreased with LAZP modiﬁ-cation. Furthermore, the speciﬁc discharge capacity of pristine NCM and LAZP modiﬁed NCM samples were evaluated at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 0.1C in voltage range of 2.8e4.3 V (dis-played in Fig. 4f). Obviously, the LAZP modiﬁed NCM samples exhibit superior rate capacities compared with unmodiﬁed NCM, particularly at 10C, suggesting the LAZP coating layer improves the diffusion rate of lithium ions of the electrode/electrolyte interface. To further investigate the effects of LAZP coating layer on the electrochemical reversibility and stability of NCM, CV tests for NCM and NCM@LAZP electrodes were carried out in the potential range of 2.6e4.3 V with a scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1. The CV curves of NCM and NCM@LAZP for 1st, after 100th and 200th charge/discharge cycles under 1C (1C ¼ 200 mA g-1) are displayed in Fig. 5. Three oxidation peaks situated at 3.831, 4.036 and 4.238 V, matched with the corresponding reduction peaks at 3.696, 3.967 and 4.134 V, which are regarded as the phase transition from hexagonal to monoclinic (H1-M), monoclinic to hexagonal (M-H2), and hexag-onal to hexagonal (H2eH3), respectively. It is generally known that the spacing between the anodic peak (centered at 3.8 V) and cathodic peak (centered at 3.7 V) indicates the degree of polarization of electrode. Furthermore, the potential intervals (0.118 V) of the redox peaks of NCM@LAZP-1 during the ﬁrst cycle is lower than that of NCM (0.135 V), particularly at the 100th and 200th cycle, which proves the lower polarization of NCM@LAZP-1 electrode, demonstrating the LAZP coating layer can remarkably improve the electrochemical activity of NCM. Moreover, the surface morphology of NCM and NCM@LAZP-1 after 200 cycles in voltage of 2.8e4.5 V are displayed in Fig. 6, It is clear that the structure of pristine NCM damaged severely during the charge/discharge cycling, corresponding to its inferior electrochemical performance. On the contrary, the NCM@LAZP-1 maintained a relative complete structure, matching with its superior charge/discharge properties. In sum, the LAZP modiﬁcation can signiﬁcantly enhance the structure stability of NCM.Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was served to further investigate into the interfacial electrochemistry properties of both NCM and NCM@LAZP (frequency range, 100000e0.01 Hz). The EIS results of pristine NCM and NCM@LAZP) after 1, 100 and 200 cycles at 1C are shown in Fig. 7aec, which could be markedly described by applying an equivalent circuit model (Fig. 7d). Furthermore, each diagram of EIS consist of the semicircles which located in the high frequency region and middle frequency region, assigned to inter-facial ﬁlm resistance (Rf) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), and an oblique straight line in the low frequency region is associated with the diffusion impedance. Additionally, the values of Rs, Rf and Rct are listed in Table 3. It displays that the increasing Rct in-dicates the expanding potential barrier of the electrochemical re-action. The Rct values for unmodiﬁed NCM substantially increased from 53.13 U (1st) to 425.64 U (200th). In contrast, the sample of NCM@LAZP-1 exhibits relatively lower increase from 43.14 U (1st) to 117.15 U (200th), indicating the improvement of kinetic with LAZP modiﬁcation. Moreover, the continuously increase of Rf is associated with impurities settled on the surface of cathode, caused by reaction between the electrolyte and electrode interface. The Rf values for unmodiﬁed NCM rapidly increased from 51.77 U (1st) to 259.36 U (200th). Surprisingly, the slower growth of Rf for NCM@LAZP-1 from 51.38 U (1st) to 69.42 U (200th) indubitably indicates that the LAZP coating layer can totally restrain the degradation of cathode materials, and forms a steady ﬁlm with low impedance to maintain structural integrity of LixNiO2 based materials.
Besides, the lithium ion diffusion coefﬁcient (DLi+) are calcu-lated from the following formula:where R is the gas constant (8.314 J K-1 mol-1), T represents the absolute temperature (298 K), and A is related to the superﬁcial area of cathode (1.13 cm2), n represents the number of electrons dealing with charge/discharge cycling (n ¼ 1), and F represents the Faraday constant (96500), c stands for Li-ion concentration of electrode materials (0.0012 mol cm-3). Moreover, s represents the Warburg coefﬁcient estimated by the Z0 versus u-1/2 plots which is showed in Fig. 7d. Consequently, the ﬁnal results of DLi + for unmodiﬁed NCM and NCM@LAZP-1 are also listed in Table 3. Obviously, the LAZP modiﬁed NCM exhibits prominent Li + -ion diffusion coefﬁcient compared with the pristine NCM, no matter before or after ﬁnished 200 charge/discharge cycles. It is further demonstrated by above results that the LAZP coating layer signiﬁ-cantly enhance the structural stability of cathode material by mitigating the damaging HF etching reactions between based ma-terial and electrolyte.
The Li1.5Al0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3-coated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode material has been successfully fabricated by a sol-gel method.Combined with the results of XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS, the LAZP has successfully coated on the surface of NCM and forms a ﬁlm with a thickness of approximately 4 nm. Moreover, the LAZP as a member of fast lithium-ion conductors, possessing high Li-ion conductivity, is able to signiﬁcantly accelerate Li+ diffusion rate at the interface of electrolyte/electrode on the NCM particle surface. Furthermore, the cycle stabilities and rate properties of pristine NCM and LAZP modiﬁed NCM were carefully investigated, especially at the high cutoff voltage of 4.5 V. The modiﬁed NCM@LAZP-1 cathode is discovered to realize a sustained reversible capacities of 179.3 mA h g-1, corresponding to capacity retention of 84.8% after 200 charge/discharge cycles, while the pristine NCM cathode de-livers only 112.1 mA h g-1, matching with capacity retention rate of 52.3%. In sum, the outstanding electrochemical performance of NCM@LAZP-1 can be associated with decreasing the degree of Li+/Ni2+ cation mixing, maintaining the structural stability of cathode material, increasing the diffusion coefﬁcient of Li+-ion, and the protection of LAZP coating layer.
