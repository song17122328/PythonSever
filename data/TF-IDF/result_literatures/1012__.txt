Discovery of a sodium-ordered form of Na3V2(PO4)3 below  ambient temperature. 

The crystal structure of the NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 phase (NVP) has been investigated as a function of temperature.  Combining  laboratory  and  synchrotron  X-ray  powder  diffraction  with  single  crystal  X-ray  diffraction,  we  demonstrate the presence of four polymorphs of NVP from -30°C to 225°C. While the high temperature γ-NVP crystallizes  in the classical rhombohedral cell (S.G. R-3c, a=8.73382(4) Å, c=21.91438(17) Å), the low temperature α-NVP undergoes a  monoclinic distortion (S.G. C2/c, a=15.1244(6) Å, b=8.7287(3) Å, c=21.6143(8) Å, β=90.163(2)°) together with an ordering of  the Na atoms. In the middle temperature range, two incommensurate modulated structures (β and β’-NVP) are also reported. 

For more than 40 years, NASICON-type materials of general  composition  AxMM’(XO4)3  (where  A  is  a  host  ion,  often an alkali) have been heavily investigated mainly for  their  properties  of  fast  ionic  conduction  1  but  also  as  interesting electrode materials in Li and/or Na ion batteries  2-6.  One  of  their  remarkable  advantages  is  their  chemical  tunability  through  the  XO4  polyanion  (X  =  W,  P,  S,  Si,  Mo)  and/or  3d  metal  (M,  M’=Fe,  Ti,  Sc,  Hf,  V,  Ti,  Zr…)  substitutions. Their crystal structure is commonly defined  using  the  well-known  “lantern  units”  (formed  by  three  XO4 tetrahedra and two MO6 octahedra sharing corners)  together  with  two  cationic  sites  M(1)  and  M(2)  fully  or  partially  occupied  by  alkali  ions.  Owing  to  the  large  M(1)+M(2)  sites  multiplicity  (i.e.  up  to  x=6)  many   NASICON  compounds  undergo  several  reversible  phase  transitions upon heating / cooling reflecting disordering /  ordering  phenomena  between  the  alkali  ions  within  the  MM’(XO4)3  framework  of  the  structure.  A  few  years  ago,  in the Na3M2(PO4)3 (M=Ti, Fe) system, a complete cationic ordering at low temperature was highlighted 7.   

The  vanadium  based  compound  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  also  emerges  due  to  labile  Na+  ordering.  Its  crystal  structure  was originally reported by Delmas et al in 1978 8 using the  standard  rhombohedral  unit  cell,  SG  R-3c,  later  on  confirmed by Gopalakrishnan et al in 1992  9 and by Zatovsky   in  201010  .  Nevertheless,  in  his  original  report,  Delmas  pointed  out  that  a  monoclinic  distortion  could  not  be  excluded  (as  already  mentioned  by  Hong  11).  Since  then,  NVP has mostly always been reported to adopt the rhombohedral symmetry even though Masquelier et al. reported several times on the existence of a monoclinic distortion  at  ambient  temperature  with  complex  series  of  unidentified extra diffraction peaks  2,6, warning about possible supercell orderings. 

In  this  paper,  we  report  on  the  existence  of  hierarchical  phase transitions between -30°C and 225°C. An unambiguous superstructure was identified below 25.8°C driven by  Na+ ions ordering. Above 25.8°C, a complex incommensurate modulated structure was identified revealing that, for  decades,  the  reported  crystal  structures  of  NVP  were  inaccurate.  Those  findings  do  not  only  shed  light  on  the  exact  crystal  structure  of  NVP,  but  also  help  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  electrochemical  and  ion  transport  properties of this material.    

The knowledge of the precise crystal structure of a material is crucial for the full comprehension of their physical  properties. In the field of battery research,  it can help to  explain the operating potential of a given redox couple or  the  transport  mechanisms  of  the  cations.  Although  a  rhombohedral  R-3c  cell  is  commonly  reported  for  NVP,  whatever  the  temperature,  a  simple  DSC  measurement  (figure 1) clearly demonstrates that in the range  -30°C to  225°C,  NVP  undergoes  three  distinct  reversible  phase  transitions: α  1)  β  at 25.8°C (onset at 21.3°C), β  1) β’ at  118.6°C  (onset  at  108.1°C)  and  finally  β’   1)  γ  at  177.2°C  (onset  at  174.4°C).  Upon  cooling,  variable  hysteretic  thermal shifts can be observed between the three transitions. In addition, while the α  1) β and β’  1) γ phase transitions give rise to sharp thermal effects peaks, the β  1) β’  thermal peaks are weak and much broader, and are even  split into two overlapped contributions. 

These  series  of  phase  transitions  do  not  come  as  a  surprise;  they  are  reminiscent  of  the  thermal  behaviour  of  Na3Fe2(PO4)3  or  Na3Cr2(PO4)3  for  which  several  phase  transitions  were  observed.12  In  the  case  of  NVP,  the  two  last  transitions  had  already  been  reported  by  our  group  previously 6 but to our knowledge the β  α around  10 °C  on  cooling  is  highly  original  and  has  never  been  mentioned  previously.  This  transition  range  (12.2-25.8°C)  being close to the room temperature, the sample may be in  one  crystalline  form  or  the  other  depending  on  its  thermal  history  and  accurate  temperature  value.  This  motivated us to acquire temperature-controlled X-ray powder  and single crystal diffraction data. 

Because both Na sites are partially occupied, they participate  in  the  3D  ionic  conduction  process.  Close  examination  of  the  anisotropic  thermal  factors  on  the  Na  atoms  (table  2)  indicates  a  large  mobility  perpendicular  to  the  [001] direction for Na(1) (discus shape) and slightly tilted  from [001] for Na(2) (cigar shape) as already reported for  7,  other  NASICON  compositions  (e.g.  α-Na3Ti2(PO4)3 NaZr2(PO4)3 ).  It  is  reminiscent  of  the  well-known  M(2)M(1)M(2)  path  discussed  in  ref.  7  from single crystal data. As mentioned earlier, VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are connected by corners forming  the  “lantern  units”  along  the  c  direction  (figure  3,  right).  Along the [001]R-3c direction, above (or  below) the  lantern units, sits the Na(1) cation (yellow sphere in figure  3,  right)  being  surrounded  by  6  Na(2)  positions  forming  Na(1)[Na(2)6]  octahedra.  Sodium  cations  are  thus  completely  disordered  over  the  two  sites.  Those  results  were  further  confirmed  by  collecting  X-ray  diffraction  on  a  single crystal of Na3V2(PO4)3 at 200°C. 

The volume of this new C-centered superlattice (Z = 12) is  twice  larger  than  that  of  the  high  temperature  rhombohedral  form  (Z  =  6).  It  contains  31  independent  atomic  positions:    3  vanadium  atoms,  5  phosphorous  atoms,  5  sodium atoms and finally 18 oxygen atoms. All the atoms  sit on 8f Wyckoff positions except  for one  Na and one P  atoms  which  are  found  on  4a  and  4e  Wyckoff  positions.   All  thermal  factors  have  been  refined  anisotropically.  Finally  the  proposed  Na  distribution  is  similar  to  that  proposed  for  α-Na3Ti2P3O12  7  but  for  the  latter  further  distortion  results  in  a  triclinic  description.  The  data  collection details, agreement factors and refinement parameters are given in Table 1 and 3.    

The  Low  temperature  (below  10°C)  monoclinic  form: α-Na3V2(PO4)3  According to the DSC measurements, below 12.2°C (corresponding  to  the  top  of  the  transition  peak  β    α  upon  cooling),  one  should  expect  a  different  crystal  structure  compared  to  the  high  temperature  form.  Low  temperature  X-ray  powder  diffraction  data  (T=  −10°C)  were  thus  measured using our laboratory diffractometer. The corresponding  XRD  pattern  is  shown  in  figure  2a,  pattern  .  At first sight, the high and low temperature patterns (labelled   respectively in figure 2a, look quite similar except for the presence of a new weak peak at Q=0.88  Å-1  for  the  low  temperature  form.  However  a  closer  look  clearly  indicates,  for  instance,  a  splitting  of  the  (116)  and  (211) reflections of the rhombohedral cell as highlighted in  figure 2 b. 


  Table 3: Atomic coordinates of α-Na3V2(PO4)3 (data from single crystal diffraction at -10°C). The occupancy factors of the Na cations were also refined without any constraints. As deduced from the sum of refinements, the  final  nominal  composition  is  Na2.94V2(PO4)3,  very  close  from  the  nominal  composition.  Their  occupancy  was  then fixed to 1.

While  the  general  frame  of  the  NASICON  crystal  structure is retained (VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra forming the “lantern units” along the c direction), the lowering  of  symmetry  implies  an  increasing  number  of  independent  Wyckoff  sites.  As  a  consequence,  the  original  Na(1)  position  of  the  γ  phase  is  thus  split  into  2  Na  positions,  namely  Na(1a)  (4e)  and  Na(1b)  (8f).  Similarly,  the  Na(2)  position  of  the  γ  phase  is  in  turn  split  into  3  positions,  labelled Na(2a) to Na(2c) (all 8f positions). The occupancy  factors of the Na atoms were freely  refined and  range from 0.97 to 1.05. For the  final refinement, we then  considered that all the Na sites were completely filled. 

The low temperature structure of NVP (C2/c) can thus be  considered as an ordered form of the Na-disordered high  temperature  γ-NVP  (R-3c).  To  compensate  this  ordering,  vacancies  are  created  in  the  coordination  sphere  of  Na(1a,b)  cations  forming  trans  and  cis  Na1[Na24□2]  distorted  octahedra  respectively  (figure  3,  left)  similarly  to  previous reports on α-Na3Ti2P3O12.7 The Na(2)/□ ordering  is  depicted  in  figure  5  (left)  and  compared  to  the  γ-NVP (figure  5,  right).  Within  both  structures,  Na(2)  cations  form honeycomb layers in the (ab) plane perpendicular to  the c axis. But while in the γ-NVP (because of the disorder), hexagons are centered by a Na(2) cations, in the αNVP, they are centered by a vacancy leading to the loss of  the three-fold screw axis of the rhombohedral symmetry.  It  is  important  to  notice  that  those  honeycombs  do  not  represent diffusion paths of Na(2) atoms in the (ab) plane.  As it can indeed be seen from Figure 5, Na(2)-Na(2) interatomic distances are very large (ranging from ca 4.8 Å to  5.5  Å)  and  the  dash  lines  connecting  two  Na  atoms  are  drawn  only  as  a  guide  for  the  eye.  The  stacking  of  six  Na(2)/□ layers is necessary to fulfill the periodicity of the  c  axis.  Each  layer  is  shifted  from  the  previous  one  by  a  vector approximately equal to 1/6a;±1/6b;1/6c followed by  a rotation of ca 60° along the c axis. 

DSC measurements (Figure 1) not only show the presence  of  a  low  temperature  α-phase  but  also  suggest  the  existence of two other forms of NVP between ca. 30 and 110°C  (labelled β-NVP) and between ca. 125 and 170°C (labelled  β’-NVP).  This  observation  had  already  been  reported  by  Lalère  et  al  6  and  as  well  as  low  intense  superstructure  peaks. Actually a monoclinic cell was even given to try to  index all those extra peaks (a=15.112 Å, b=8.723 Å, c=8.824  Å, β=124.54°)2,  6. In order to  confirm this  monoclinic distortion,  we  combined  both  high  resolution  synchrotron  powder diffraction and single crystal diffraction. As it can  be seen on Figure 1 a and b, on patterns   measured at the synchrotron (11BM beam line), the monoclinic  distortion  upon  cooling  is  obvious.  The  (211)  and  (116)  reflections  of  the  high  temperature  rhombohedral  cell   are  clearly  split  into  2  and  3  reflections  respectively  at  20°C.  It  is  also  interesting  to  notice  that  even  with  a  standard diffractometer, this splitting is visible, especially  for the (116) reflection (figure 2 b pattern  ). The monoclinic  cell  proposed  in  refs.  2  and  6  can  indeed  explain  this  distortion,  but  cannot  index  all  the  tiny  superstructure peaks visible on  figure 1 c (marked with a black  circle).  Thanks  to  the  high  quality  data  measured  at  the synchrotron  combined  with  single  crystal  data,  we  were  able to fully index all reflections into an incommensurate  modulated  structure.  The  reﬁnement  of  the  modulation  vectors was done from the single-crystal XRD data using  JANA200619.  Concerning  the  β  phase  (a=15.113(2)  Å;  b=8.7297(6)  Å;  c=8.8346(11)  Å;  β=124.568(9)°  ;  V/Z=  239.947Å3 at 60°C), the modulation can be fully explained  using  two  vectors:  q1  =  (0.573(1),  0,  0.7143(7))  and  q2  =  (0.210(3), 0.787(2), 0.502(2)). For the β’ phase (a=15.119(2)  Å;  b=8.7347(4)  Å;  c=8.8543(7)  Å;  β=124.557(6)°  ;  V/Z=240.756  Å3  at  130°C)  the  situation  is  more  complex  since  three  different  vectors  are  needed  to  index  all  the  reflections:  q1  =  (0.567(4),  0,  0.732(3)),  q2  =  (0.219(2),  0.780(1),  0.516(2))  and q3  =  (0.784(2),  0.780(1),  0.484(2)).  Considering  the  narrow  existence  domains  of  β  and  β’NVP, it cannot be excluded that we are dealing with composite structures mixing two kinds of domains within an  incomplete transition context. It appears more consistent  than  to  be  in  case  of  a  3+3  dimensions  structure.  Complete  the  β-Na3V2(PO4)3 and β’-Na3V2(PO4)3 phases will be presented in a forthcoming paper.    

We  demonstrated  that  the  vanadium  based  NASICON  composition Na3V2(PO4)3 displays 4 distinct crystal structures  in  the  range  −30°C    225°C  namely  the  α-,  β-,  β’ and  γ-NVP.  Using  single  crystal,  synchrotron  powder  diffraction  but  also  laboratory  powder  diffraction,  we  showed that the rhombohedral high temperature form of  γ-NVP  undergoes  a  monoclinic  distortion  below  178°C.  Around  room  temperature,  the  crystal  may  adopt  two  structures:  either  a  monoclinic  incommensurate  modulated  cell  (a=15.113(2)  Å,  b=8.7297(6)  Å,  c=8.8346(11)  Å,  β=124.568(9)°)  or  a  monoclinic  supercell  (α–NVP:  c=21.5192(14),  β=90.241(2)°).  Nevertheless,  close  to  the  room  temperature, the NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 cannot be indexed in the  rhombohedral  unit  cell  as  it  is  most  commonly  reported  in  literature.  In  the  high  temperature  γ-NVP  form,  Na+  cations  are  statistically  distributed  over  two  partially  occupied  sites  (occNa(1)=  0.75;  occNa(2)=  0.70).  Upon  cooling,  Na+ cations tend to order and in the low temperature α– NVP  a  particular  ordering  of  the  sodium  cations  and  vacancies in the (a,b) plane can be found. This enables us to  envisage that electrochemical and Na-conduction properties at low temperature may behave differently compared  to the high temperature one.
