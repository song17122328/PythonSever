We constructed a Li3V2(PO4)3/Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3/Li3V2(PO4)3 symmetric all solid-state Li-ion battery. Since the rechargeable capacity of Li3√æxV2(PO4)3 anode is lower than that of Li3 xV2(PO4)3 cathode, the symmetric cell capacity is restricted by the anode capacity. So, the improvement of Li3√æxV2(PO4)3 anode properties was tried using mechanical milling to uniformly mix Li3V2(PO4)3 and carbon. The charge and discharge capacity of Li3V2(PO4)3/C using mechanical milling was greatly increased compared to Li3V2(PO4)3/C using hand milling. The structure change with the insertion and extraction of lithium conÔ¨Årmed using ex-situ XRD measurements. The Li extraction/insertion of Li3V2(PO4)3 with a NASICON structure can proceed to the reversible expansion/contraction of the lattice due to the structural strength and Ô¨Çexibility of NASICON framework with the corner-sharing matrix. The discharge capacity of the all  1 by good dispersion state of solid-state battery per Li3V2(PO4)3 in cathode weight achieved 92 mAh g Li3V2(PO4)3 and carbon using mechanical milling.

Lithium-ion batteries have been used as compact power sources in portable devices. However, before Li-ion batteries can be used as large-scale power sources in electric vehicles, their performance needs to be improved with regard to battery cycle life, production costs and safety. In particular, several safety issues must be addressed to make Li-ion batteries suitable as reliable power sources. One Li-ion battery safety issue is that at elevated temperatures, charged oxide cathodes such as LixCoO2 easily release oxygen gas, which could react with organic electrolytes exothermally [1,2]. To improve the safety of Li-ion batteries, the thermal

stabilities of the electrodes and electrolyte needs to be enhanced by suppressing these exothermic reactions. All solid-state Li-ion batteries, which use an incombustible solid electrolyte instead of an organic liquid electrolyte, have been proposed as strong candidates for such safety-sensitive batteries.

A number of studies have reported on all solid-state Li-ion batteries using glass ceramics, which have high Li-ion conductivity, such as Li1√æx√æyAlxTi2 xSiyP3 yO12, 80Li2Se20P2O5, and Li10GeP2S12 [3e5]. As reported, all solid-state Li-ion batteries, Li4/3Ti5/3O4/ Li1√æx√æyAlxTi2 xSiyP3 yO12/LiCoO2 cell gave a discharge capacity of  1 at 1/12 C rate at 60 C [6]. In/80Li2Oe20P2S5/LiCoO2 150 mAh g  2 at cell showed a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g room temperature [7]. However, the ionic conductivity of a solid electrolyte is lower than that of a liquid electrolyte, and the former shows a larger interfacial resistance with the other solid components such as the electrode. Hence, solid electrolytes cannot be easily put into practical use.

We developed all solid-state Li-ion batteries that use NASICONtype materials for both the electrolyte and the electrodes;

speciÔ¨Åcally, Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) and Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) were used for the solid electrolyte and the electrodes, respectively [8]. NASICON-type LAGP has been known as a fast Li-ion conductor, and  1 at room temperature [9]. In Li-ion conductivity is 2.4  10 addition, NASICON-type LVP is also promising cathode material for Li-ion batteries [10]. The reaction formulas for Li insertion/extraction of LVP are as follows [11]; Li3V2(PO4)3 / LiV2(PO4)3 √æ 2Li redox couple) Li3V2(PO4)3 √æ 2Li redox couple)

Therefore, LVP can be used as both cathode and anode active materials for the symmetrical cell. Such a symmetrical cell has some unique advantages: (1) it can be discharged down to 0 V, (2) the cell volume change can be compensated by the opposite behavior of the cathode and anode electrode, and (3) the processing costs of the coating electrode can be reduced by dip coating. However, the Ô¨Årst discharge capacities of LVP/LAGP/LVP all solid 1, which corresponds state Li-ion batteries at 25 C is 42 mAh g to 32% of the theory based on the assumption that 2Li reacts with  2. This suggested that the LVP (132 mAh g Li-ion battery has large internal resistance, and the redox couple of √æ3 for LVP has a large irreversible capacity due to quite low √æ2/V V electroconductivity.

In this paper, the improvement of electroconductivity for Li3V2(PO4)3 anode properties was tried using mechanical milling to mix Li3V2(PO4)3 and carbon, uniformly. In addition, we investigated the anode properties and structure changes during the Ô¨Årst chargeedischarge cycle. The electrochemical properties of the LVP/ LAGP/LVP all solid-state Li-ion batteries were improved based on the obtained results.

LVP and LAGP were synthesized according to the previous reports [8,10]. LVP was prepared from a mixture of very pure Li2CO3 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), V2O5 (Nacalai Tesque) and NH4H2PO4 of Li:V:PO4 ¬º 3:2:3. The mixture was sintered at 300 C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere. The sintered mixture was ground, and was again sintered at 860 C for 12 h under a mix gas (Ar √æ 5% H2).

The crystalline LAGP was prepared from a mixture of Li2CO3, GeO2 (Shinko Chemical), NH4H2PO4, and Al2O3 (Nippon Light Metal) at a stoichiometric ratio. The mixture was sintered at 500 C

for 2 h in air using an electric oven. The sintered mixture was ground, and was sintered again at 800 C followed by sintering at 900 C for 2 h in air. To prepare amorphous LAGP, the crystalline powder was place in a Pt crucible and heated in a furnace at 1200 C for 1 h in air. The melted LAGP was quenched in ice water, still in a Pt crucible. The obtained materials were identiÔ¨Åed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, RINT2100HLR/PC, Rigaku; Cu-Ka, 50 kV, 300 mA).

The 70 wt.% obtained LVP powder was hand milled and dry ball milled with 25 wt.% acetylene black (AB, Denki Kagaku Co.) in air. Cathodes were prepared by mixing the LVP/C composite powder with a 5 wt.% PTFE binder (PolyÔ¨Çon PTFE F-103, Daikin Industries). The electrochemical performance of the LVP was evaluated with a 2032 coin-type cell using a non-aqueous electrolyte (1 M LiPF6/ EC √æ DMC (1:1 in volume), Kishida Chemical Co.) and a polypropylene separator (Celgard 3501) against Li metal (Honjo Metal Co.).

All of the cells were assembled in an Ar-Ô¨Ålled glove box. The chargeedischarge measurement was performed in galvanostatic  2) in the potential window mode at a rate of 7.5 mA g between 1.5 and 3.0 V. The test temperature was 25 C. The electrodes were carefully taken out from the cells in the Ar-Ô¨Ålled glove box, washed, and immersed in dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for one night to remove the electrolyte, and dried prior to being set in an Ar-Ô¨Ålled cell for XRD.

The solid electrolyte was prepared by pressing crystalline LAGP powder at 49 MPa into a pellet with a diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 0.5 mm. The pellet was heated at 840 C for 2 h in air. The electrode was made from LVP (49 wt.%), amorphous LAGP (49 wt.%) and vapor-grown carbon Ô¨Åber (VGCF, Showa Denko; 2 wt.%). To increase the interface area between the active materials of LVP and the LAGP electrolyte, we used not crystallized but

amorphous LAGP, which was added to the LVP powder. The mixture (97 wt.%) was added to BL-S polyvinyl alkyl acetyl alcohol (BL-S, Sekisui Chemical Co.; 3 wt.%) and 2,2,4-trimethyl-2,4-pentanediol mono isobutyrate (CS-12, Chisso Corp.). The slurry was screen-printed on both sides of the LAGP pellets, and then was heated at 600 C for 40 h by hot pressing in Ar atmosphere. Fractured cross-sections of the resultant pellets were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the thickness of the electrode. The surface of the pellet was analyzed by XRD. The pellets were sealed in a coin-type cell after drying at 110 C overnight in a vacuum. The chargeedischarge measurement  1 was performed in galvanostatic mode at a rate of 6.1 mA g  2) in the potential window between 0 and 2.4 V at 25 C. (8.8 mA cm

The XRD pattern of LVP conÔ¨Årms that the sample is pure phase and well crystallized. Fig. 1 shows the Rietveld reÔ¨Ånement result, and the crystal parameters are summarized in Table 1 [12]. All diffraction peaks are indexed in a monoclinic system with the space group P21/n.

The structure consists of a 3D framework of VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing common corner oxygens. Based on the bond distance calculation, it is found that the vanadium atoms are located in the distorted VO6 octahedra, with the VeO distances ranging from 1.86 to 2.17 A.

The Ô¨Årst discharge (Li inserted) and charge √æ  1 and 28 mAh g  1, (Li respectively, and LVP/C-HM had the large irreversible capacity at  1. In contrast, the Ô¨Årst discharge and charge of LVP/C-MM 36 mAh g  1, respectively. The theoretical were 135 mAh g capacity was achieved experimentally, with the complete reduction of the V3√æ ions. During the Ô¨Årst discharge process at LVP/C-MM, the cell voltage gradually decreased down to 1.5 V through an inÔ¨Çection point around 1.9 and 1.7 V at a rate of  2). These discharge reaction formulas for Li 7.5 mA g insertion into LVP are as follows [11]; Li3V2(PO4)3 √æ 0.5Li Li3.5V2(PO4)3 √æ 0.5Li Li4V2(PO4)3 √æ 0.5Li Li4.5V2(PO4)3 √æ 0.5Li

was also smaller than that of LVP/C-HM. These results suggested that the electroconductivity of LVP has been improved by increasing the connected area due to uniformly mixed LVP and carbon. We investigated the structure change of LVP/C-MM for the Ô¨Årst charge and discharge cycle with V3√æ redox couple by ex-situ XRD measurements. The XRD measurements were performed on three samples of LVP/C-MM pellets during the charge and discharge cycle, as shown in Fig. 2.

In addition, the charge and discharge voltage of LVP/C-MM were higher than those of LVP/C-HM, and the overpotential of LVP/C-MM

Fig. 3 compares the XRD proÔ¨Åles of LVP/C-MM cathode pellets at (a) the initial state, (b) the charge end point (4.2 V) and (c) the discharge end point (3.0 V). All XRD diffraction peaks shifted to a higher 2q angle from that of the initial state in the initial charge process, and moved back to almost the original position after the Ô¨Årst discharge process. In particular, the XRD diffraction peaks of (0 2 0) and (0 0 4) moved markedly to a higher 2q angle from that of the initial state in the Ô¨Årst charge process. The lattice constants of LVP during the Ô¨Årst chargeedischarge process were calculated using PDXL program (Rigaku), as shown in Table 2. These results suggest that the a-axis in LVP structure was unchanged, while the band c-axes contracted. The unit cell volume change during the initial charge cycle was  2.9%.

Fig. 4 compares the XRD proÔ¨Åles of LVP/C-MM anode pellets at (a) the initial state, (b) the charge end point (1.5 V) and (c) the discharge end point (3.0 V). The XRD diffraction peaks of (0 2 0), (0 2 1) and (0 0 4) moved to a lower 2q angle from that of the initial state in the initial discharge process. This result means that the band c-axes in the LVP structure were extended by the insertion of lithium. In contrast, the a-axis was hardly seen to extend and contract with the insertion of lithium, as shown in Table 2. Two Li ions insert into Li3V2(PO4)3 with the reduction from V3√æ . On the other hand, according to Voronoi diagram, a Li3V2(PO4)3 molecule has six empty 4e sites larger than lithium ion radius (0.76 A). Among the six empty 4e sites in Fig. 5, the most possible Li insertion sites during the V3√æ redox reaction are site 5 and site 6 with the largest cavity. Because, the unit cell volume of the electrode was hardly changed even after 2Li insertion as shown in Table 2.

The initial charge and discharge a rate of 7.5 mA g  1 and capacity per cathode weight for LVP/C-HM were 111 mAh g  1, respectively, with a 39% discharge/charge efÔ¨Åciency. In 43 mAh g  1, contrast, these for LVP/C-MM were 145 mAh g respectively, with a 79% discharge/charge efÔ¨Åciency. These Ô¨Åndings demonstrated that the irreversible capacity of the LVP symmetric

cell was improved as well as LVP versus Li metal by mechanical milling process.

Based on these results, we constructed an LVP/LAGP/LVP symmetric all solid-state battery, as shown in Fig. 7. The initial charge and discharge curves of the LVP/LAGP/LVP symmetric all solid-state battery with the cathode/anode weight balance 1:1 is shown in Fig. 8. The electrochemical measurements were carried out with  1 the potential window between 0.0 and 2.4 V at a rate of 6.1 mA g  2). The initial discharge capacity per cathode was (8.8 mA cm  1. In a previous study [8], we fabricated an LVP/LAGP/LVP 92 mAh g symmetric all solid-state battery using hand milling; the discharge  1 at a rate of capacity per cathode weight was only 40 mAh g  2). The improvement of the electrochemical 6.4 mA g properties of the LVP/LAGP/LVP all solid-state Li-ion battery has succeeded by increased electroconductivity.

We could improve the anode properties (V2√æ

redox couple) of LVP by carbon coating using mechanical milling. The irreversible capacity of LVP during the Ô¨Årst discharge and charge cycle was greatly decreased compared to that of carbon-coated LVP using hand milling. Based on these results, we constructed an LVP/LAGP/  1 LVP symmetric all solid-state battery, which shows 96 mAh g  1 (dis(charge capacity based on cathode weight) and 92 mAh g charge capacity based on cathode weight), respectively. In addition, XRD measurements proved that LVP could proceed to Li extraction/ insertion by the reversible expansion/contraction of lattice due to the structure strength and Ô¨Çexibility of the corner-sharing NASICON matrix.
