Neutron di4raction pro5les at high resolution (HRPD, ISIS Facility, U.K.) were collected on powder samples of LiZr2(PO4)3 at 203C (b@phase, monoclinic P21/n, Z 5 4; a 5 8.81277(4), b 5 8.94520(5), , b 5 90.801(1)3) and at 3503C (b phase, orthorhombic Pbna, Z 5 4; a 5 8.84303(5), b 5 8.94120(6 ), c 5 12.41301(8) A ). All Li sites were located by di4erence Fourier maps in tetrahedral coordination, and both structures were Rietveld-re5ned to wRp 5 0.0353 (b@) and 0.0429 (b). The b@ structure is a distortion of b, with a [100] pseudo-twofold axis x, 1/22 y, 2 z relating all atoms but lithium, which is fully ordered (SLi+OT 5 2.02 A ). In the b phase, Li is disordered over four sites, of which two (Li1 and Li2) are symmetry-independent with occupancies 0.34(1) and 0.16(1), respectively, and SLi+OT 5 2.17 and 2.16 A . The disorder fully explains the higher Li1 mobility in the b with respect to the b@ phase observed from ionic conductivity data. Mechanisms of ion transport are proposed, and the relationship to the NASICONtype a@/a phase of LiZr2(PO4)3 is analyzed in detail. ( 2000
Within the large family of AM2(XO4)3 ionic conductors with NASICON-related crystal structures, LiZr2(PO4)3 has long been known to be one of the compounds displaying the most complex polymorphism (1}4). As the ionic conductivity behavior is usually di!erent for every crystalline modi"cation, this system is potentially a rich source of data connecting Li‘ ion mobility and structural features, so as to provide challenging tests for models of ionic transport mechanisms. Only a full understanding of the atomistic basis for ionic conduction would allow us to design new materials with superior performances as solid electrolytes (5, 6), cathodes for rechargeable batteries (7), and electrochemical gas sensors (8).

When prepared by solid state reaction at 12003C, LiZr2(PO4)3 forms the rhombohedral NASICON structure

We have thus undertaken a study of the crystal structures of b@and b-LiZr2(PO4)3 at room temperature and 3503C, respectively, with the primary goals of determining the crystal-chemical environment of lithium atoms in both phases and of relating it to the ionic conductivity behavior. In fact, it is expected that the b@%b transition might have an order}disorder character, and that would be the key to explain the corresponding jump of activation energy observed in the

The synthesis of b@-LiZr2(PO4)3 (F.W."474.29) was carried out by solid state reaction (1). Reagent-grade Li2CO3, ZrO2, and NH4H2PO4 were mixed in stoichiometric ratios in a Pt boat and heated for 1 h at 5003C, then for 20 h at 8003C in a tubular furnace. The sample obtained was ground, pelletized, and again heated at 8003C for 18 h. Powder X-ray di!ractometry (Siemens D500 apparatus, CuKa radiation) proved the product to be pure monoclinic b@ phase, but for the presence of a small quantity of ZrP2O7, which could not be removed by further thermal treatments; no traces were found of the triclinic a@ phase, obtained at higher temperature. The transition to the orthorhombic b phase was con"rmed to occur reversibly at about 3003C both by di!erential thermal analysis (Perkin}Elmer DTA 1600) and by high-temperature powder X-ray di!raction (Buehler HT-attachement to the D500 di!ractometer).

Neutron di!raction data were collected on the time-of#ight high-resolution powder di!ractometer (HRPD), equipped with a furnace, at the ISIS spallation pulsed source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, U.K.). The 2-cm3 sample was contained in a vanadium can under vacuum. By use of the back-scattering counter bank at S2hT"168.33, full intensity pro"les were recorded in the dhkl range 0.9 to 2.5 A (with an instrumental resolution of *d/d+4]10~4) at room temperature and at 3503C, out-

side and within the furnace, respectively. A preliminary data reduction was performed, including merging of outputs from single counters in the bank and correction for detector e$ciency as a function of neutron wavelength.

The Rietveld re"nements of the b@ and b crystal structures were performed by the GSAS computer package (9). Chebyshev polynomials of "rst kind with 14 (b@ ) and 20 (b) coe$cients were used to model the intensity background, and the peak shape was represented by a convolution of a pseudo-Voigt function (linear combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian compoents, with p and c half-widths, respectively: sample contribution) with two back-to-back exponentials (instrumental and moderator contributions) (10). Linear dependences of the p and c parameters on dhkl were assumed: p"p 1dhkl. The mixing coe$cient and the full width of the pseudo-Voigt function depend on p and c according to equations given in Ref. (11).

Starting from the atomic coordinates of the P21/n structure of Fe2(SO4)3 (12), the isotropic re"nement of the b@ phase converged successfully, and subsequent di!erence Fourier maps showed unambiguously the position of a single Li atom as the strongest negative peak (the neutron scattering length of Li is negative, unlike Zr, P, and O). This was included in the re"nement, and convergence was attained with the agreement factors and unit-cell constants reported in Table 1. The re"ned weight fraction of the impurity phase ZrP2O7 was 6.4%. No evidence of disorder or partial occupancy of the lithium site was given by either the "nal di!erence Fourier map or the re"nement of the Li occupation factor.


Experimental (including background), calculated, and difference pro"les for both the b@ and b phases are shown in Fig. 1. The same impurity peaks appear in both patterns. The quality of both "ts (cf. Table 1) is similar and very satisfactory, as far as the fully pro"le agreement indexes (R1, wR1, and s2) are concerned, while the R(F2) value for Bragg intensities is not as good in the case of high-temperature experiment (b phase). This should be surely ascribed to the neutron absorption of the furnace metal walls, which does not a!ect the room-temperature results. Attempts to re"ne the absorption coe$cient according to the GSAS routine failed because of high correlation with several re"nement parameters. However, it should be taken into account that R(F2) values are usually larger than the corresponding full pro"le indexes R1 or wR1 in most Rietveld re"nements, so that the R(F2)"0.10 value of the b phase is not bad at all on an absolute scale.

This scheme is consistent with the known structures of similar compounds containing three Li atoms per formula unit, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (14), Li3Sc2(PO4)3 (14, 17), and Li3In2(PO4)3 (18), which are monoclinic P21/n at room temperature. Upon transforming the unit cells and asymmetric units reported in the original papers appropriately, one can recognize that all these phases are isostructural with b@-LiZr2(PO4)3, except for the two Li atoms out of three which are missing in the present structure. In particular, the Li(3) and Li1 atoms of the indium and iron compounds, respectively, are located in the same position as Li of our phase (Table 2). This result is important, because it was (14) that Li2 and Li3 in b@shown by Bykov et al. Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (called a phase in the original paper) pass to a disordered state in the b-type high-temperature Pbna superionic phase (called c by the authors), and they are thus believed to be responsible for the enhancement of lithium mobility, while Li1 should not be involved in this process. The Li location in b@-LiZr2(PO4)3 being not particularly favorable for a high Li‘ mobility is con"rmed by

comparison with a@-LiZr2(PO4)3: there a much more distorted Li coordination tetrahedron is observed, and the average Li}O bond distance is larger (2.09 against 2.02 A ) than in the b@ case, consistent with the higher ionic conductivity of the a@ phase at room temperature (1).

Therefore, subsequent hoppings along the 2}Li1@}Li2} Li1}Li1@}2 pathway are able to propagate the Li‘ motion throughout the structure, with an activation energy determined by the larger energy barriers of the Li1}Li1A and Li2}Li1@ steps. This mechanism explains the drop of activation energy observed at the b@%b phase transition.

By comparison with the high-temperature structure of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 determined at 3003C, it turns out that the present Li1 and Li2 positions roughly correspond to the analogous positions in that case (their atomic coordinates in our reference frame are 0.289, 0.218, 0.324 and 0.075, 0.087, 0.296, respectively). However, in that case the Li1 site has full occupancy, and Li2 has 0.25; furthermore, the Li1 to Li2 distance is larger than in b-LiZr2(PO4)3 (2.19 against 1.56 A ), so that a direct transfer of Li‘ between the two positions seems to be less favored. The ionic conduction mechanism appears to be quite di!erent, mainly because the third lithium site Li3 plays an important role (14) in Li3Fe2(PO4)3, but it is absent in the present case.

In order to understand the di!erent coordination environments and mobilities of the Li‘ ion in the b@ and a@ polymorphs of LiZr2(PO4)3, it is important to investigate the general crystal-chemical relationships between the two structures. First, the two lattices are quite similar, and the original a@ unit cell (I) can be transformed into the b@-type unit cell (II) according to [010/001/101] (Table 1). The a@ space group changes from C11 to I11 . The most striking di!erence between the unit cells of the two phases concerns their volumes, as the a@ cell is larger than the b@ cell by 3.6%. We can thus expect a a@Pb@ phase transition by applying pressure. Second, comparison of the [100] projections of the two structures (Figs. 2 and 6) shows strong similarities. We can recognize the presence of c/2 wide (001) slabs of PO4 (T) and ZrO6 (Oc) polyhedra, which are isostructural but di!erently stacked with respect to one another in the two phases. The Li atoms are located in hollows at the interface between pairs of adjacent layers. Each slab is built up by centrosymmetrical pairs of the typical NASICON unit Oc2T3, which are translated by the a and b lattice vectors (Fig. 3). Every Oc2T3 unit is characterized by a pseudo-symmetry twofold axis parallel to [100], so that the layer symmetry is 11 , and the pseudo-symmetry is 2/b. In the a@ phase, adjacent slabs are related by a lattice translation, i.e., the centering vector (a#b#c)/2 of space group I11 . In the b@ case, on the other hand, the relation between neighboring slabs is given by the n glide plane of space group P21/n and by the a pseudo-glide plane of pseudo-symmetry Pbna. The latter way of packing layers is more e$cient than the former method, leading to a smaller unit-cell volume and more compressed holes in the interlayer region where lithium can be accommodated. In both phases, neighboring layers are linked by sharing the
The origin is shifted by z"0.25 with respect to coordinates in Table 6 (cell II). O5 atoms between Zr octahedra and P1 tetrahedra, and O5@ between the Zr@ and P1@ polyhedra. Thus, only 2 out of 12 independent O atoms are involved in the interlayer linking, con"rming the weaker character of this connection with respect to the intralayer linking.

In order to show these structural relationships quantitatively, the asymmetric unit of the a@ phase has been changed with respect to Ref. (3) and the corresponding atomic coordinates have been transformed consistently with the I to II unit-cell change, including an origin shift by 0, 1/2, 0: x(II)"y(I), y(II)"z(I)!x(I)#1/2, z(II)"x(I). The results are reported in Table 6. Upon comparing the transformed atomic coordinates (II) of the a@ phase with the corresponding coordinates of b@ (Table 2), the full similarity appears clearly for all but the lithium atoms. Therefore, we can conclude that the b@ phase and the a@ distorted NASICON structure di!er just by the way symmetry relates the same layer-like structural unit. This is crucial, however, for the lithium environment and mobility in the interlayer region, because the Li‘ holes are signi"cantly larger in the a@ than in the b@ case. Statistical distribution over two Li sites, longer SLi}OT distances, and larger ionic mobility ensue in the former with respect to the latter phase. Analogous results hold by comparing the corresponding hightemperature structures a and b.
