Crystal chemistry and ion conductivity of the Na1zxTi22xAlx(PO4)3 (0¡x¡0.9) NASICON series

The original ‘‘Na super ionic conductors’’ NASICON materials were solid solutions derived from NaZr2P3O12 by partial replacement of P by Si with extra Na to balance the charges. The is Na1zxZr2P32xSixO12 (0¡x¡3).1,2 Since then, a large number of related materials has been synthesised, mainly phosphates. Related phosphate series are those obtained by partial substitution of tetravalent MIV cations by trivalent MIII ones to yield Na1zxMIV 22xMIII limit, xmax, depends on the nature and ionic radii of the octahedral cations.3–8 These compounds have been extensively studied because of the high conductivity shown by some compositions. They are versatile materials and can tolerate a wide range of compositional variation.

x(PO4)3.

The NASICON structure has a negatively charged 3Dframework, of general formula M2X3O12, within which the Naz cations reside in fully or partially occupied sites. The framework is built of XO4 tetrahedra linked by corners to MO6 octahedra. Each XO4 tetrahedron shares each corner with one MO6 octahedron and conversely, each MO6 octahedron shares each corner with a different XO4 group. The interstitial voids generated within the network are of two types known as M1 and M2 sites (1 : 3 multiplicity). The large charge-compensating Naz cations are located in these positions. An initial approach to correlate electrical parameters (ionic conductivities and activation energies) with generic average structural parameters (unit cell constants) was followed by scrutiny of speciﬁc structural factors such as the size of the bottleneck that connects the M1 and M2 sites.9 However, to establish possible correlations of this type, full crystal structure information is required. This may be obtained either by single crystal diffraction or by Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data.10,11

On the other hand, there are few reports of NASICON materials containing Al cations. These works mainly deal with

lithium based ionic conductors. The small octahedral ionic radius of Al3z is likely in the tolerability limit of the NASICON framework. Furthermore, in the ceramic synthesis of these compounds, ALPO type side-compounds can be easily formed. Phases such as berlinite, with tetrahedral AlO4 groups, are very stable and once formed do not react to yield the desired material. So, well characterised series are lacking but some have been published, e.g. A1zxMIV 22xAlx(PO4)3 where xmax~0.4, and A~Li12,13 or Na.14 One of the reasons for the low Al content in the reported NASICONs, so far, is the conditions of the ceramic syntheses with very high temperatures that result in a mixture of phases.

The aim of this work is to establish the synthetic conditions to enhance the Al content of NASICON materials. We have chosen the Na1zxTi22xAlx(PO4)3 series because of the low cost of the elements, the non harmful nature of the chemicals and the relative similarity of the ionic radii. We have characterised the resulting compounds by different techniques.

The materials have been prepared by solid state reaction. Stoichiometric quantities of Na2CO3, activated TiO2, c-Al2O3 and (NH4)2HPO4 were heated to give the following overall reaction:

Activated TiO2 was prepared by slow hydrolysis of commercial Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 with a 1 : 4 water-to-propanol solution. The resulting white suspension was centrifuged, washed thoroughly with water, and heated at 300 ‡C for 24 h.

The synthesis of these materials has been optimised by studying the choice of reagents and heating temperatures, rates and times. The ﬁnal synthetic procedure is as follows: 1) the reagents were weighted and ground in an agate mortar for 3 h using acetone to help their homogenisation; 2) the mixtures were heated at 0.5 ‡C min21 up to 400 ‡C and held at that temperature for 8 h; 3) after 10 min of grinding, a second thermal treatment was carried out at 550 ‡C for 12 h which resulted in the complete loss of H2O, NH3, and CO2; 4) ﬁnally, the mixtures were ground for another 3 h, pelletised and heated at 725 ‡C for 48 h. The studied compositions were Na1zxTi22xAlx(PO4)3 (x~0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 0.9).


X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were collected on a Siemens D5000 automated diffractometer with (h/2h) Bragg–Bretano geometry using graphite monochromated CuKa1,2 radiation. The XRD patterns were recorded between 12‡ and 50‡ 2h for indexing purpose and to follow the chemical reactions. Patterns were collected between 14 and 125‡ (2h) with 0.03‡ step size for 14 s (counting time) in order to reﬁne the crystal structures by the Rietveld method.15 Thermodiffractometric data were recorded with the same diffractometer but in a second goniometer permanently equipped with a HTK10 heating chamber. The patterns were scanned over the angular range 10–38‡ (2h), with a step size of 0.04‡ and counting 1 s per step. A delay time of 10 minutes, before any data acquisition, was selected to ensure sample thermal stabilisation.

Lower ﬁnal temperatures were also tested in order to extend the compositional range to xw0.9. These attempts were also unsuccessful. However, by heating the x~0.9 composition at 550 ‡C for 24 h, a single phase with a powder pattern similar to those of R3¯c NASICON materials but with many low intensity diffraction peaks was obtained. All peaks were autoindexed in a monoclinic cell using the TREOR90 program. The resulting

b~8.712(1) A˚ , were parameters and b~106.60(1)‡ with ﬁgures of merit c~14.347(3) A˚ M14~22 and F14~23. Its powder pattern is clearly related to that of the high temperature rhombohedral NASICON compounds but with some type of distortion. However, the low temperature synthesis leads to a compound with low crystallinity, without sharp peaks, that precludes the structure determination from powder diffraction data. A thermodiffractometric study of this materials indicated that it changes to the rhombohedral NASICON structure above 800 ‡C.

The X-ray diffraction study shows that the samples obtained at 725 ‡C were polycrystalline phases. The powder patterns could be fully explained by the typical R3¯c NASICON type structure. In some syntheses, a minor side phase, NaAlP2O7, was detected. The crystal structures of the six phases, Na1zxTi22xAlx(PO4)3 (x~0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9), were reﬁned by the Rietveld method15 using the GSAS suit of programs.16 The structure of NaTi2(PO4)3 was used as a starting model.10 The nominal Ti/Al composition was randomly distributed in the octahedral site. The extra Na content, to compensate the Ti substitution by Al, was placed in the M2 site. Firstly, the common overall parameters, histogram scale factor, background coefﬁcients, unit-cell parameters, zeroshift, error and pseudo-Voigt coefﬁcients were reﬁned. Then, the positional parameters were optimised. After convergence, the Ti/Al fractions were allowed to vary but constrained to full occupancy. The deviations of the occupation factors from the nominal composition were very small and so, they were ﬁxed to the nominal values. Hence, the occupation factors of Na(2) site were also ﬁxed to the nominal values. Reﬁnements of the Na(1) site occupancy indicated no vacancies for any compositions. Isotropic temperature factors for each site were reﬁned.

The unit cell parameters and the R-agreement Rietveld factors are given in Table 1 for the full series. The weight fractions of the side-phase, NaAlP2O7, are also given in Table 1 and they do not depend on the composition. The structural parameters are given in Table 2. Selected inter-atomic distances and bond angles are given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The powder pattern of Na1.9Ti1.1Al0.9(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 1 as an example.

It can be seen in Table 1 that the volume decreases steadily along the series. The ionic radius of Al3z (0.535 A˚ ) is smaller than that of Ti4z (0.605 A˚ ) which explains the volume contraction with Al.17 However, this cell variation is not isotropic as the a-axis parameters remain almost constant with x and the c-axis parameters markedly decrease along the series. On the basis of the structural data obtained by the Rietveld reﬁnements, the anisotropic contraction can be rationalised as follows. The decrease in c-axis with x is due to a diminution of the average M–O bond distances, Table 3. The intra-lantern P– O(1)–M angles change little from 153.8‡ for Al0 to 152.2‡ for Al0.9 and the inter-lantern P–O(2)–M angles do not change appreciably, Table 4 and Fig. 2. Consequently, the M…M intra-lantern and M…M inter-lantern distances [both along the c-axis] decrease along the series. This is different behaviour than that observed in the Na1zxZr22xInx(PO4)3 series11 where the contraction of the c-axis took place with a decrease of the M…M intra-lantern distances and an increase of the M…M inter-lantern distances, Fig. 2. This behaviour is explained because In3z is larger than Zr4z and here, Al3z is smaller than Ti4z.

The ﬁlling of the M2 sites produces also a modiﬁcation of their oxygen environment. For Al0, the M2 sites are vacant and the void is very anisotropic with four long distances to O(1) (262.92 A˚ and 262.62 A˚ ) and four shorter distances to O(2) (262.24 A˚ and 262.31 A˚ ). As this site is progressively ﬁlled, the environment becomes more regular, Table 3, Na(2)–O(1) bond distances become shorter and Na(2)–O(2) distances larger. For Al0.9, the distances are 262.80 A˚ and 262.58 A˚ for O(1) and 262.38 A˚ and 262.29 A˚ for O(2). The main

structural change produced along the series is the movement of O(1) towards the M2. This results in an slight opening of the O(1)–M–O(1) angles and a small closing of the P–O(1)–M angles, Table 4 and Fig. 2. The more important degree of freedom, which adjusts along with the incorporation of Na on the M2 site, is the ﬂexibility of the MO6 octahedra which distort by opening the O(1) face thus allowing these oxygens to

move towards Na(2). This O(1) movement counteracts the M– O bond decrease which results in a very small variation of the aaxis along the series. For Na1zxZr22xInx(PO4)3 series11 the same mechanism took place, but as In3z is larger than Zr4z the O(1) movement was not counteracted and a large a-axis increase was measured.

More likely, these endotherms may be due to the reaction of amorphous unreacted compounds. impedance of Na1.8Ti1.2Al0.8(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 4, 5 and 6. These data are typical for all compositions and they allow one to characterise the electrical properties of these samples. The complex impedance plane plot, Fig. 4, shows that these pellets are ionic conductors. At high temperatures, for example 473 K, the spike due to the blocking electrode effect is clearly shown at the lowest frequencies, see inset of Fig. 4. At lower temperatures, i.e. 350 K, this plot points out a set of high frequency overlapped semicircles. This set of semicircles indicates that

lattice parameters with temperature several effects are involved in the electrical response of the pellets, including bulk and grain-boundary contributions.

Fig. 5 shows conductivity data in the frequency range 20 Hz– 1 MHz at several temperatures for Na1.8Ti1.2Al0.8(PO4)3 which is representative of the behaviour of the series. The absence of a clear plateau at the possibility of extracting the bulk conductivities values. This is due to the similar nature of the conductivity of the grain boundary and in the bulk of the grains. This thermal behaviour is typical of poor sintered ionic conductors.

A deeper insight into the electrical microstructure of the pellets can be obtained from the spectroscopic plots of the impedance imaginary part, Z@, and the complex electric modulus, M@. These plots are shown in Fig. 6 for Na1.8Ti1.2Al0.8(PO4)3 at 350 K. The Z@ plot shows a broad peak with a pronounced shoulder at lower frequencies and the M@ plot a broad single peak. The capacitances of selected points in this graph are also shown. The maxima of both curves are separated by about one decade in frequency. Hence, these maxima are associated with the bulk/intrinsic response of the sample. The shoulder in the overall Z@ plot, with an associated capacitance of y33 pF, is very likely due to a grain-boundary impedance. Because its capacitance is quite high it is not readily seen in the M@ it makes an important contribution to the overall pellet impedance. This complex response is mainly due to the poor sintering of the pellets. This is a consequence of the thermal stability of the material as it can not be heated above 800 ‡C without partial decomposition. The porosity of the pellets decreases as the Al content increases, see Table 5.

The Na1zxTi22xAlx(PO4)3 solid solution has been prepared and the compositional limit was determined. The diffractometric study showed that these compounds crystallise in the R3¯c NASICON type structure and the structural changes along the series have been elucidated. These compounds have the highest Al content in a NASICON series reported so far. They display low anisotropic thermal expansion that was measured by powder thermodiffractometry. The ionic conductivities of Naz are low as is expected in a NASICON framework built up by small octahedral metals. The resulting bottleneck sizes are small for Naz hopping but it may be suitable for the Liz cations. We are preparing Li derivatives by ion-exchange to test this hypothesis.
