Glass-ceramics of the titanium-, germanium- or tellurium-containing Na5RSi4O12-type (R = rare earth; Y) Na+superionic conductors (N5YXS) were prepared by crystallization of glasses with the composition Na3+3xY1−xXySi3−y O9 (X = Ti; NYTiS, Ge; NYGeS, X = Te; NYTeS), and the effects of X elements on the separation of the phase and the microstructural effects on the conduction properties of glass-ceramics were discussed. The combination of x and y was most varied in N5YGeS and more limited in the order of N5YTeSN N5YTiS. Their conductivities and activation energies are of the order of 10−2 S/cm at 300 °C and of 15 to 24 kJ/mol, respectively. The conductivity of the glass-ceramic N5YXS decreases giving the order N5YGeSNN5YTeSNN5YTiS . It is considered that this order corresponds to the N5 single phase region. Large enhancement of electrical conductivity was observed in the glassceramics as the grain growth was promoted with increase of heating temperature and heating time for crystallization.

Glass-ceramics of the phosphorus containing Na5RSi4O12-type (R = rare earth) [1,2] Na+-superionic conductors (N5RPS) [3,4] have been developed by crystallization of glasses with the composition Na3+3x−yR1−x PySi3−yO9 (NRPS) [5–19]. These materials are reportedly comparable to the conventional ceramic Na+-conductors such as Nasicon, β- a n d β″aluminas (e. g., NaAl11O17 and NaAl5O8). The R elements have a significant effect on the crystallization of glasses [6], as well as on the conduction properties [1]. To date, polycrystalline N5RPS has been obtained with Sc, Y, Gd or Sm as the R element. It is currently assumed from the analogy with Na5RSi4O12 that all the R ions can be octahedrally coordinated with the non-bridging oxide ions of the (SiO4, P O4)tetrahedra of the 12-membered rings. The reported results on the silicate ceramics [1] show that the conductivity of N5RPS increases with increasing size of its R ions. Our phosphorus containing compositions have been confirmed superior to the mother composition of Na5RSi4O12, especially in the production of the single-phase glass-ceramics. Considering the inference, our main work has recently been focused on the synthesis of various glass-ceramics with single-phase Na5RSi4O12. In the present study, the glass-ceramics of the titanium-, germanium- or tellurium-containing Na5RSi4O12-type (R = Y) Na+superionic conductors (N5YXS) from the glasses with the composition Na3 + 3xY1 − xXySi3 − yO9 (X = Ti; NYTiS, Ge; NYGeS, X = Te; NYTeS) were prepared, and the effects of X elements on the separation of the phase and the microstructural effects on the conduction properties of glass-ceramics were discussed.

The glass-ceramics have been obtained under the appropriate sets of the parameters x and y of the composition formula Na3 + 3xY1 − x XySi3 − yO9 ranging in x=0 . 1–0.55 and y=0 . 1–0.45. The precursor glasses were made by melting stoichiometric mixtures of reagent-grade powders of anhydrous Na2CO3, Y2O3, ( T i O2, G e O2 or TeO2) and SiO2 at 1300–1400 °C for 1 h, followed by annealing for several hours at an optimum temperature (ca. 25 °C below the glass transition temperature (Tg) determined by DTA analysis). The temperatures employed for nucleation (Tn) and crystallization of glass specimens were also determined by DTA analysis. Tn was chosen in all the specimens as Tg+c a . 30 °C. The annealed specimens were heated up to 850–1000 °C for 5–24 h for crystallization. Crystalline phases were identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. Ionic conductivities of sintered disks were measured by the ac two-probe method with Au-sputtered blocking electrodes with a LF impedance analyzer. The temperature dependence of the conductivity was measured in a similar way at several temperatures ranging from room temperature to 350 °C.

The N5YXS ionic conductors were successfully produced by crystallization of glasses. Most of the N5YXS compounds were obtained as uncracked glass-ceramics. Two other kinds of compounds are also known, and they are sometimes observed as the precursor or the impurity phase in the synthesis of Na5RSi4O12-type (N5) conductors.

These will be mentioned as Na3RSi3O9-type (N3), and Na9RSi6O18-type (N9) in the following. The ionic conductivity was strongly dependent upon the composition and the type of structure. Of these three kinds of compounds, N5 phase was the most conductive. Representative XRD patterns of the prepared glass-ceramics with NYTiS (Na3.6Y0.8Ti0.2Si2.8O9 glass-ceramics heated at 900 °C (a) and 1000 °C (b) for 5 h) were given in Fig. 1. Figs. 2–4 show the diagrams of phase-composition-crystallization temperature of NYTiS, NYGeS and NYTeS glass-ceramics, respectively. The phase formed was dependent on composition and crystallization temperature. N5YTiS, N5YGeS and N5YTeS are obtained as a stable phase at high-temperatures. The crystallization of N5 single phase is strongly dependent both on the contents of yttrium and (titanium, germanium or tellurium) ions (or the values x and y correspond to the composition parameters in Na3 + 3xY1 −xXySi3 −yO9). N3 and N9 phases can be crystallized as the high-temperature stable phases at the regions of higher [Y] and rather lower [Y], respectively. The effect of sodium content seems insignificant, because the value of [Na] is subordinately determined as [Na] = 6−3[Y] (=3 + 3x) depending on the content of yttrium. The combination of x and y was most varied in N5YGeS and more limited in the order of N5YTeSNN5YTiS. The complex admittance diagram of the N5 glass-ceramic specimen Na3.6Y0.8Ti0.2Si2.8O9 is shown in Fig. 5 as an example. Those admittance diagrams were analyzed with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6. The complex admittances of the measured glassceramic specimens consisted of two semicircles below 300 °C. The two intercepting points on the real axis are interpreted as the resistance of crystallized grains (RG(c)) and the total resistance of grains and remaining glassy grain boundaries (RGB(g)). Assume the complex admittance diagram shown in Fig. 7, where the parameters L1 and L2 are set here as the radii of Therefore, in an ideal grass-ceramic where residual glass would have negligible influence on the total, arc 2 would be much smaller than arc 1, since L2/L1→0. Fig. 8 shows examples of the temperature dependence Arrhenius plots made on the basis of the calculated conductivity values of grains and grain boundaries of the glass-ceramic specimens with the composition Na3.6Y0.8Ti0.2Si2.8O9, in which the geometrical ratios of thickness to surface area for grains were also used for convenience for those of grain boundaries because of their undefinable shapes. The conductivity of the total bulk (T) is as close as to that of grains (G) a t higher temperatures, while the resistance of grain boundaries (GB) dominates the whole conductance at lower temperatures. It should be noted that, concerned with the conduction properties of grain boundaries, only the activation energies are significant, since the conductivity of grain boundaries were calculated using the geometry ratio of surface area to thickness of the whole glass-ceramic bulk. Table 1 summarizes the conduction properties of the N5 glass-ceramics with Na3.6Y0.8Ti0.2Si2.8O9, Na4.2Y0.6Ge0.3Si2.7O9 and Na4.2Y0.6Te0.3Si2.7O9 compositions. Their con ductivities and activation energies are of the order of 10−2 S/cm at 300 °C and of 15 to 24 kJ/mol, respectively. The conductivity decreases giving the order N5YGeSNN5YTeSNN5YTiS. It is considered that this order corresponds to the N5 single phase region. Fig. 9 shows SEM photographs of the microstructure of the Na4.2Y0.6Ge0.3Si2.7O9 glass-ceramics heated at 900 °C for 5 h (a), at 1000 °C for 5 h (b) and at 1000 °C for 24 h (c), and the grain sizes of the specimens were about b1 µ m ( a ) , 4 µm ( b ) and 5 µm ( c ) , respectively. Their conductivities of the specimens were 4.0 × 10−2 (a), 4.5 × 10−2 (b) and 6.7 × 10−2 (c) S/cm at 300 °C, respectively (Table 1). The grain growth is promoted with increase of heating temperature and heating time for crystallization. It was found that grain growth cause high conductivity.

We have successfully produced the glass-ceramics of the titanium-, germanium- or tellurium-containing N5 superionic conductors from the glasses with the composition Na3 + 3xY1 − xXySi3 − yO9 (X = Ti, Ge, Te). The main features of this work are as follows: 1. The combination of x and y was most varied in N5YGeS and more limited in the order N5YTeSNN5YTiS. 2. Their conductivities and activation energies are of the order of 10− 2 S/cm at 300 °C and of 15 to 24 kJ/mol, respectively. 3. The conductivity of the glass-ceramic N5YXS decreases giving the order N5YGeSNN5YTeSNN5YTiS. This order corresponds to the above result 1. 4. The grain growth is promoted with increase of heating temperature and heating time for crystallization. 5. Grain growth cause high conductivity.
