Effect of the addition of MgO, along with Li2O, as sintering aid on the densification and ionic conductivity of Li-analogues of Nasicon has been studied. For this purpose, a series of compounds, LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) + x(MgO) + y(Li2O), x = y = 0 – 0.7; x = 0.2, 0.5 and y = 0; x = 0 and y = 0.2, 0.5 and Li1.4[Ge1.6Al0.4](PO4)3 (LAGP) + x(MgO) + x(Li2O), x = 0 – 0.3, have been synthesized and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density, porosity and microstructure (by scanning electron microscope, SEM) of the sintered pellets. Results show that the additives do not get incorporated in to the crystal lattice of the Nasicon but act as a binder and drastically reduce the porosity of the pellets and improve connectivity between the grains. 
Some crystalline and glassy solids exhibit ionic conductivities comparable to that of liquid electrolytes and are known as ‘Fast or super ionic conductors’ or solid electrolytes. Generally, in such solids, only one kind of ions migrate under the influence of electric field and the other constituent ions are fixed and maintain the rigid backbone skeleton of the solid matrices. During the last three decades, extensive research has been carried out on the solid electrolytes with Nasicon (Na super ionic conductor) structure on account of its 3D back-bone skeleton favoring high ionic conductivity (rionic) due to the mobile sodium (Na) or lithium (Li) ions. The Li-analogues of Nasicon are of importance for the development of all-solidstate Li-batteries [1 – 5]. Since Li is highly electro-positive and has lower atomic weight and ionic radius than Na, Li-batteries result in higher cell voltage and energy density.
The original Nasicon compound namely Na1 + x Zr2SixP3   xO12, x = 2 has Na+ ion as the mobile charge carrier. The general formula of Nasicon-type compounds is A[M2(PO4)3], where A and M are monovalent and tetravalent cations, respectively, and consist of linked AO6 and MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The resulting hexagonal structure gives rise to channels running along the three crystallographic directions consisting of Type I and Type II sites for the mobile A ions to occupy. The structure is versatile in that chemical substitution is possible at Aand M-sites by a variety of metal ions, still retaining the hexagonal symmetry [1 – 4]. In A[M2 (PO4)3], the A ions occupy Type I sites (octahedral 3+] O-coordination), whereas in A1 + x[M(I)2 x (PO4)3, 0 < x V 0.7, the xA ions occupy the Type II sites, which have 10-fold O-coordination [1,2]. 
The Li-analogues with A = Li; M(I) = Ti, Ge, Hf, Ta; M(II) = Al have been extensively studied in the form of polycrystalline ceramics and glass-ceramics for their rionic behavior as a function of frequency and temperature [1,2,5 – 13]. Results show that in the   7 S above series, the rionic varies from 10   1 at room temperature (RT) when x = 0. It cm increases by two to three orders of magnitude when x varies from 0.1 to 0.7 and there is a corresponding decrease in the energy of activation, Ea [1,2,11 – 13]. However, a similar enhancement of rionic has also been observed by using non-interacting and lowmelting additives, like Li2O, Li3PO4 and Li3BO3 during the high-temperature synthesis of the phases, LiM(I)2P3O12, M(I) = Ti, Ge and Hf. These additives enable densification of the ceramic by decreasing the porosity of the virgin ceramic, from about 30 – 40% to 5 – 10% for M = Ti and Ge [1,2,8]. 
These observations gave rise to the contention that the mechanism of enhancement of rionic in the substituted systems (x>0; M(II) = Al) mainly involves the densification of the ceramic by the formation of a glassy and/or crystalline second phase(s) at the grain boundaries and thereby reducing the grain-boundary resistance [1,2,11 – 15]. Densification and Na-ion conductivity enhancement in Na4Zr2Si3O12 by the addition of TiO2 was reported by Takeuchi et al. [16].
It is well-known that the total rionic of the polycrystalline ceramics at a given temperature (T) is the sum of bulk or intra-grain or grain interior conductivity (rB) and the grain-boundary or inter-grain conductivity (rGB). In the phases LiM(I)2(PO4)3, the rionic below 250 jC is mainly controlled by the rGB [1,2,8]. Detailed studies [1,2,8,11 – 15,17] have shown that in LiM(I)2(PO4)3, M(I) = Ti, Ge and Hf, and other   3 – iso-structural analogues, the rB at RT is high (10   4 S cm   1) and Ea = 0.3 – 0.4 eV. On the other 10   8 S   6 – 10 hand, the rGB at RT is in the range 10   1 and Ea is high and varies from 0.5 to 0.9 eV. cm the series Among the Li-analogues of Nasicon, 3+)(PO4)3, 0 V x V 0.7, are of particuLi1 + x(Ge2 x lar interest since these are stable in the presence of Limetal and hence are prospective candidates for the allsolid-state Li-rechargeable batteries [1 – 5,11 – 13]. 
Since the ionic radius of Ge4 + and Al3 + ions are almost equal (0.530 and 0.535 A˚ , respectively, for octahedral coordination [18]), the bottle-neck configuration for the mobile Li-ions will not be affected much by the Al-substitution for Ge in the lattice and the variation of the hexagonal lattice parameters (a and c) will also be small. In addition, this substitution allows an increase in the mobile ion concentration with the extra (x) Li-ions occupying the Type II sites. Hence, the optimization of rionic – T behavior in this system is of great interest for practical applications.
Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a well-known sintering aid for the densification of oxide [19 – 23] and nonoxide [24] ceramics. In the present work, we have studied the effect of MgO addition (x mole), along with Li2O ( y mole), on the rionic – T behavior of LiGe2(PO4)3, x and y from 0 up to 0.7, and of Li1.4[Ge1.6Al0.4](PO4)3, x = y = 0 to 0.3. Results show that Mg ions do not get incorporated in to the crystal lattice and MgO has the beneficial effect in increasing the rionic and sinterability on the above compounds.
Stoichiometric amounts of high purity lithium carbonate (Li2CO3; Fluka, Germany), magnesium and aluminium hydroxides (Mg(OH)2; Aldrich, USA), (Al(OH)3; Merck, Germany), germanium oxide (GeO2; Alfa, USA) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ((NH4)H2PO4; Merck) were weighed to give about 10 – 15 g of the product. The precursors were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar grinder and heated in air initially at 600 jC in alumina crucibles for 6 h. The initial heating decomposes Li2CO3 and (NH4)H2PO4 with the emission of ammonia, carbon dioxide gases and water vapor. The mixture was then cooled, reground, pressed into thick pellets and heated for 24 h and cooled to room temperature at the rate of 5 jC/min. The synthesis temperature was maintained in the range 800 – 900 jC, depending on the composition, since the composition with high Mg concentration (x 0.4) slightly melted at higher temperature (T>850 jC). The pellets were then ground to fine powder. 
For impedance measurements, pellets of thickness 0.2 – 0.6 mm and diameter 1.1 cm of the various compositions were prepared and heated at the rate of 2 jC/min up to 725 jC and sintered at that temperature for 24 h and cooled at the rate of 2 jC/ min to RT. Dense pellets with smooth surface were obtained.
The compounds were characterized by powder Xray diffraction (XRD, Siemens D5005 system; Cu-Ka radiation; 2h = 10 – 70j). Scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM 6700F) pictures were taken on the cross-section of the freshly broken sintered pellets. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were done using a VG ESCALAB MK II spectrometer; Mg-Ka radiation. The samples were vacuum dried and loaded for XPS measurements. The spectra were fitted using the standard XPSPEAK software and corrections to the binding energies were done using the difference between the adventitious C(1s) peak and the standard C(1s) value of 284.6 eV. All curve fittings were done using 80% Lorentzian and 20% Gaussian curves. The binding energies are accurate to F 0.1 eV. 
The pellets were gold coated on either side using JEOL, JFC-1100 ion sputtering unit for impedance measurements, which were carried out using a Solartron 1470 battery test unit in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 1 MHz, with temperature ranging from 25 to 120 jC. Density measurements were done at RT ( f 27 jC), by the helium displacement method using Micromeritics (USA) pycnometer, model accupyc 1330. For this purpose, thick pellets were prepared from the powders of the respective compositions and sintered as above. The density (qapparent) of the compounds (LGP + x(MgO) + x(Li2O), where x = 0 – 0.7) was calculated by weighing the pellets and the volume calculated from their physical dimensions (diameter and length). Porosity of the pellets is then calculated from the density data.
The synthesized compounds namely LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) + x(MgO) + y(Li2O), where x = y = 0 – 0.7 (LGP 0 to LGP 7), x = 0.2, 0.5; y = 0 (LGPM 2 and LGPM 5) and x = 0; y = 0.2, 0.5 (LGPL 2 and LGPL 5) and Li1.4[Al0.4Ge1.6](PO4)3 (LAGP) + x(MgO) + x(Li2O), where x = 0 – 0.3 (LAGP 0 to LAGP 3) are crystalline, white and are stable in air. The Li-Nasicon phase formation is clearly seen in the XRD patterns. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for select compositions. Addition of the binder (MgO + Li2O) results in the formation of impurity phases. These are not clearly discernable in the XRD patterns for x = 0.1 (LGP1), possibly due to the limit of detection by XRD ( V 5 wt.% with respect to the main Nasicon phase). However, the compositions with x 0.3 definitely show lines due to the impurity phases, LGP3, LGP5 and LGP7 in Fig. 1. The impurity phases were identified as the crystalline Mg2(PO3)4 [JCPDS 70-1803] and LiMgPO4 [JCPDS 84-0342]. These are indicated in Fig. 1. 
For the present series of compounds, XPS wide scan spectra were obtained and the peaks identified. In Fig. 4, the high resolution Li(1s) XPS spectra of select compositions are shown. The low signal-tonoise ratio in the spectra is due to the low scattering factor of lithium. Deconvolution of the Li spectra resulted in a single peak for the unadditive composition LGP 0 and two overlapping peaks for LAGP 0. For the compositions with the binder, MgO + Li2O, one more peak was obtained, Fig. 4. The single peak obtained in LGP 0 is due to the Li-ions at the Type I sites in the Nasicon structure with a binding energy (BE) of 55.3 eV. This value is in the range for Li-ions in the Nasicon structure reported in the literature [12,17]. In the case of LAGP 0 and LAGP 2, the asymmetric spectra were deconvoluted into two peaks, with BEs of 55.5 and 56.8 eV. The peak with higher BE is assigned to the Li-ions in the Type II sites of the Nasicon structure. 
The higher BE signifies higher ionicity of the Li O bonds in the Type II sites and hence are weakly attached to the back-bone structure. With the addition of the binder, one more Li(1s) peak was observed in the XPS spectra at the low BE region (LGP 5 and LAGP 2 shown in Fig. 4). This peak with a BE of 50.5 eV is assigned to the Li(1s) of the binder Li2O or LiMgPO4. Addition of the binder has hardly any influence on the Li(1s) BEs of LGP 5 and LAGP 2 possessing the Nasicon structure. This is an additional evidence for the binder (MgO + Li2O) forming a secondary phase and the extra Li and Mg ions not entering into the Nasicon crystal structure.  
A similar trend is seen in the variation of the bulk conductivity (rB) versus T with the addition of binders, Fig. 6b. The composition LGP 5 exhibits the maximum rB similar to rT. It is well known that at lower temperatures (T < 200 jC), the rionic of the polycrystalline Li-ion conducting oxides is mainly dictated by the grain-boundary impedance which controls the Li-ion mobility and hence the ion migration into the bulk. Hence, by the addition of binder, the grains are well fused increasing the Li-ion mobility between the grains and accordingly increasing the rB.
Effect of addition of MgO, along with Li2O, as sintering aid on the densification and ionic conductivity (rionic) of Li-analogues of Nasicon, has been studied by the synthesis and characterization of a series of compounds, LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) + x(MgO) + y(Li2O), x = y = 0 – 0.7; x = 0.2, 0.5 and y = 0; x = 0 and y = 0.2, 0.5 and Li1.4[Ge1.6Al0.4](PO4)3 (LAGP) + x(MgO) + x(Li2O), x = 0 – 0.3. Powder X-ray diffraction, XPS, density, porosity and microstructure by SEM of the sintered pellets show that the additives do not get incorporated into the crystal lattice of the Nasicon but act as a binder and bring about a drastic reduction in the porosity of the pellets and improved connectivity between the individual grains. The impurity phases have been identified as Mg2(PO3)4 and LiMgPO4. 
However, this beneficial sintering effect, occurring at as low a sintering temperature as 725 jC, is seen only up to a specific binder content, viz., 0.4 – 0.5 mol each of MgO and Li2O per mole of LGP, where a porosity of only f 2% is encountered. Impedance measurements on the dense sintered pellets in the range 25 – 120 jC enabled the determination of the Li-ionic conductivities, both bulk (rB) and total in the series, LGP0 ! LGP7. As can be (rT), expected, binder addition enhances the rB and rT at any given temperature by an order of magnitude with the addition of 0.1 mol each of MgO and Li2O. The rT reaches a maximum value of 1.2 10   1 at 100 jC in LGP 5, which is three orders of magnitude higher than that shown by LGP 0 at the same temperature. Similar enhancement of rB is also seen in the LGP series. However, the respective energies of activation, Ea(T) and Ea(B), behave differently with the binder addition. 
While Ea(T) goes through a minimum at x = y = 0.5 (LGP 5), Ea(B) remains almost unaffected in the range x = y = 0.1 – 0.7. The Al-substituted compositions (LAGP series) also show an enhancement of rT by the binder addition, but only by a factor of two and the Ea(T) remains almost unchanged. It has not been possible to extract rB and Ea(B) in the LAGP series due to the limitations in the impedance measuring equipment. The present study shows that MgO indeed acts as a binder and helps in reducing the porosity and improving the rionic of the Li-Nasicon phases.
