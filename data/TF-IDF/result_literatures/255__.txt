Due to its high theoretical capacity and stable structure, Na3V2(PO4)3 has gained much attention as a potential cathode for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) in large-scale energy storage applications. However, poor electronic conductivity usually results in the low rate capacity and poor cyclability, which has limited its application. Herein, we successfully introduce Fe3+ to substitute V3+ through doping engineering. Compared with Na3V2(PO4)3/C, an excellent initial high-rate capacity of 91.2 mAhg-1 (77.5% of the theoretical capacity) at 20 C (2.35 A g-1) has been achieved in Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C+rGO due to the improved electronic conductivity introduced by Fe doping and rGO modification, and a stable cyclability with 88.7% capacity retention after 100 cycles, implying the perfect structure stability of the composites. It is expected that the results obtained will grasp new insights into designing the optimal cathode and realizing the commercial synthesis for the large-scale rechargeable sodium energy storage devices. 

Urgent development of large-scale electrical energy storage (EES) has become a big challenge in the modern society because of the transition from traditional fossil fuels (like coal et al.) to renewable energy[1-3]. Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been successfully used in smart portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage and conversion devices[4], various challenges (like high cost, limited lithium resources et al.) still need to be addressed before their real applications. 

Therefore, developments of new types of batteries such as sodium ion[5, 6], aluminum ion[7], magnesium ion[8] batteries based on cost-effective and sustainable electrode materials have been regarded as potential alternative approaches.

Since cathode is the source of mobile ions, development of cathode materials with high capacity, high rate capability, and long cyclability become critical[12, 13]. Many different types of cathode are therefore developed such as layered transition metal oxides[14, 15], phosphates[12, 16, 17], and ferrocyanides[18, 19]. Among them, Na+ super-ionic conductor (NASICON) structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with a robust 3D framework can provide fast Na+ insertion/extraction tunnels. Unfortunately, poor electrical conductivity (~10-12 Scm-1) usually results in low rate performance and poor cyclability, which limits the actually gained capacity[20]. 


Numerous strategies including carbon coating[21, 22], ions doping[22, 23], and morphology construction[12, 24] have been proposed to enhance the electronic conductivity. For example, Saravanan et al. developed porous NVP/C possessing an extremely excellent cyclability of 30000 cycles at 40 C with an initial capacity of 61 mAhg-1 and 50% capacity retention[25]. However, it is difficult to modify micron-sized NVP with a uniform carbon coating. The complicated synthetic process is still unable to ensure homogeneity. In contrast, doping engineering is a more effective and practical method to satisfy the requirement of electrochemical properties enhancement and large-scale synthesis’s homogeneity simultaneously. 

Considering the same valence and similar ionic radius between iron ions (Fe3+: 0.645 Å) and vanadium ions(V3+: 0.64 Å), the partial substitution of Fe3+ in V3+ sites of Na3V2(PO4)3 has been synthesized. To further improve the extrinsic electrical conductivity, the Fe substituted NVP was coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). 

Compared with NVP/C, a remarkable initial high-rate capacity of 91.16 mAhg-1 (77.5% of the theoretical capacity) at 20 C (2.35 Ag-1) of Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C+rGO has been achieved. The stable cyclability with retention of 88.7% after 100 cycles implied good structure stability of Fe doped NVP. These results indicate Fe substituted NASICON-structured Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C+rGO would be a potential cathode for SIBs, which provides insights into designing the high-performance electrodes and realizing the large-scale commercial synthesis upon doping engineering for the large-scale rechargeable sodium energy storage devices. 

All of the chemicals with analytical grade were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. In a typical processing, NVP was synthesized via a hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method. 

Firstly, 0.02 mol V2O5 and 0.03 mol ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) were added into 70 ml deionized water at a molar ratio of 2:3 (according to 0.02 mol Na3V2(PO4)3), the above solution was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h in air until a dark blue suspension was formed. The ascorbic acid worked as chelating agent, reductant and carbon source. Subsequently, Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3 and NH4H2PO4 were mixed into the above solution and kept under stirring at 70 °C for 2 h. The molar ratios of V2O5, Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4 were designed at 1:1.5:3. Finally, The above solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 40 h. The obtained brown sol was dried at 120 °C for overnight in vacuum, then, the dried sol was ground into resultant lime-green powders and preheated at 350 °C for 4 h in argon (Ar) atmosphere. After that, the as-heat treated black powder was ground again and annealed at 750 °C for 6 h in Ar/H2 (vol. 95:5) atmosphere to produce the final Na3V2(PO4)3/C, named as NVP/C. 

Na3V2(PO4)3/C-rGO (NVP/C+rGO) was synthesized using a facial process, where deionized water was replaced by GO (2 wt.%) aqueous solution. For Fe-doped NVP/C+rGO, a stoichiometric amount (Fe:V=x:2-x in molar ratio; x=0.05, 0.10, 0.15) of Fe(NO3)3▪9H2O was used as the cation precursors to the solution, Firstly, 0.02(2-x) mol V2O5 and 0.03(2-x) mol ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) were added into 70 ml GO (2 wt. %) aqueous solution at a molar ratio of 2:3 (according to 0.02 mol Na3V2-xFex(PO4)3), the above solution was stirred at 70 °C for 1 h in air until a dark blue suspension is formed. Subsequently, 0.02x mol Fe(NO3)3▪9H2O powders was added into above solution. 0.03 mol Na2CO3 and 0.06 mol NH4H2PO4 were also mixed into the above solution and kept under stirring at 70 °C for 2 h. Finally, The above solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 180 °C for 40 h. 

The obtained brown sol was dried at 120 °C for overnight in vacuum, then, the dried sol was ground into resultant lime-green powders and preheated at 350 °C for 4 h in argon (Ar) atmosphere.


Structures of the as-synthesized materials were characterized through X-ray Diffraction (XRD) by X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu 6000) with a CuKα radiation source (λ=1.5418 Å). High-quality XRD patterns were also recorded in the fixed time scan mode at 0.002° s-1. Rietveld refinement was calculated and analyzed using the GSAS software[26]. Morphologies were examined using a Hitachi-scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4300). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was examined using a JEOL-scanning electron microscope (JSM-6010PLUS/LV). To achieve more detailed morphologies, a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2010, 200 kV) was employed. The chemical state of synthesized powders was studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Axis UltraDLD spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd), with monochromatic AlKα radiation (hν = 1486.69 eV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to measure the carbon content (wt.%) using a SHIMADZU Differential Thermal-Thermogravimetric Analyzers (SHIMADZU, DTG-60H), where the samples were heated from room temperature to 950 °C at 10 °C min-1 in air. 


A homogenous slurry consisting of active material, binder (Polyvinylidene difluoride), and conductive additive (Super-P carbon) at a weight ratio of 8:1:1 was homogeneously blended in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. Then, the slurry was manually cast on the Al foil and dried at 120 °C for 12 h in vacuum. After drying, the electrode was compressed in a rolling press and cut into φ10 mm circle with a loading mass density of about 2.6 mg cm-2. Glass microfiber filters (Grade GF/A-Whatman, φ18 mm) were used as separators. The electrolyte is 1M NaPF6 in EC:DEC=1:1 vol%. 

All the components were assembled in CR2016 coin cells in the glovebox (MBraun UNILab Glove Box) whilst ensuring that the O2 and H2O levels were maintained lower than 0.1 ppm. Sodium metal was employed as the count and reference electrode. 

The galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle and rate performance with the potential from 2.5 to 4.0 V (vs Na+/Na) were measured by C-rates using Land CT2001A battery testing stations at room temperature (T=25 ℃), the current density corresponding to 1 C is 117.6 mAg-1. the cyclic voltammetry curves (CV) were measured at 0.05 mV s−1 and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was tested from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz by Solartron electrochemical workstation.The electronic conductivity of NVP/C and Fe doped NVP/C-rGO pellets were tested by the potentiostatic method using Solartron electrochemical workstation, in which we cold-press the 100 mg powders to φ 10 mm pellets under 5 tons pressure. The thickness of the pellets was 0.80 mm. Following, we dried the pellets under vacuum at 120 ℃ for 5 h before testing. 


Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using commercial versions of the density-functional programs CASTEP available from Materials Studio 7.0[27]. For the band structure calculations, generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method was used with Perdew-Burke-Ern-Zerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional[28]. The wave-plane cuto℃ energy was 410 eV and a regular Monkhorst-Pack grid of 2×2×2 points was used in all of the calculations. The convergence criteria for structural optimization and energy on each atom were set to 0.01 eV/Å and 10-5 eV. A 2×1×1 supercell was used in the simulation. 

The effects of Fe doping on the crystal structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 are categorically investigated by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) in the continuous mode and fixed time scan mode as shown in Figure 1 and Figure S1. Control experiments show graphene oxide (GO) can be reduced to reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in Na3V2-xFex(PO4)3/C+rGO (Figure S2). Figure 1(a) shows the XRD spectra of NVP/C and Fe-x-NVP/C+rGO (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15), in which all peaks can well be matched with the diffraction peaks of NASICON-structured Na3V2(PO4)3 (JCPSD #01-078-7289). No additional peaks were detected, indicating there are no other impurities (like Fe2O3, Na3Fe2(PO4)3 et al.) formed during the high-temperature calcination and Fe has been successfully doped into V sites without altering the NASICON structure (Figure 1(b))[29], which was further confirmed by the cyclic voltammetry curves (CV) result (Figure S3) and EDS mapping (Figure S4). In order to achieve detailed cell parameters, Rietveld refinement was performed in Figure 1(c)-1(d) and Figure S1. 

In summary, a series of Fe doped Na3V2-xFex(PO4)3/C+rGO (x=0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) have been synthesized via a hydrothermal-assisted sol-gel method. It has been found that the electronic conductivity of Na3V2-xFex(PO4)3/C+rGO can be significantly enhanced upon Fe doping, which enhances the transfer of Na+ efficiency, resulting in a dramatic improvement of the rate performance and cyclability. At the same time, the tightly covered by rGO with remarkable mechanical stretching could suppress the volume expansion and maintain the aggregation of NVP particles during charge/discharge cycling. Compared with Na3V2(PO4)3/C, a remarkable initial high-rate capacity of 91.16 mAhg-1 (77.5% of the theoretical capacity) at 20 C (2.35 Ag-1) was gained in Na3V1.9Fe0.1(PO4)3/C+rGO. Moreover, a stable cyclability with a capacity retention of 88.7% after 100 cycles implied the superior structure stability of our designed composites. Our work demonstrates that doping engineering is a feasible strategy to design the high-performance electrodes and realize the large-scale commercial synthesis for the application in large-scale electrical energy storage
