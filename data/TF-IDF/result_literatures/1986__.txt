The magnetic structures of the monoclinic (P21/n, A-LFP) forms of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 have been determined using neutron powder diffraction at 1.5 K on polycrystalline samples. Magnetic peaks appear in the neutron diffraction patterns below 25 K for both structures, and they can be indexed with a k = (000) propagation vector. The magnetic moments are found to be collinear and perpendicular to [001] in both structures. The obtained magnetic moments are 4.7 and 3.9 µB per iron atom for A-LFP (ferrimagnetic ordering of the two iron sublattices) and 4.7 µB for the NASICON (B-LFP) form. The Fe atoms are oriented antiparallel within the [Fe2(PO4)3] “lantern units”, while there is a parallel orientation of the Fe atoms that do not belong to the same [Fe2(PO4)3] lantern unit. The magnetic structure of B-LFP is explained in terms of exchange integrals.
Three-dimensional polyanionic structures built of interconnected MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra providing an interstitial space partially occupied by alkali cations have been the subject of intense research over the last 20 years, for their unusual ionic conductivity, thermal expansion and electrochemical properties. Of the most widely investigated is the NASICON family AxM2(PO4)3 [1, 2], which offers extensive versatility towards chemical substitutions in the [M2(PO4)3] polyanionic framework, into which between 0 and 5 alkali cations may be accommodated. These materials could be used as a cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries.
Li3Fe2(PO4)3 may adopt two distinct crystallographic forms, denoted A-LFP (monoclinic, P21/n) and B-LFP (rhombohedral R-3, NASICON), which differ by the way the [Fe2(PO4)3] “lantern units” are connected. The A form is the stable form, prepared via solid state reaction, while the B form is obtained through ion exchange from the NASICON sodium analogue Na3Fe2(PO4)3. In this paper, we discuss the magnetic structure of these two analogs.
The monoclinic (A-LFP) and rhombohedral (B-LFP) forms of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 were prepared as previously described [3]. Neutron diffraction experiments at 300 K and 1.5 K were performed at the Orph´ee reactor at the Laboratoire L´eon Brillouin in Saclay, France, on the neutron powder diffractometer G4.2 (λ = 2.3433 Å). The program FullProf [4] was used for crystal-structure reﬁnements using the Rietveld method [5].
The stable form of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, A-LFP, is monoclinic at room temperature (α-form, space group P21/n). Its crystal structure was previously determined from single-crystal, X-ray diffraction by Bykov et al. [6] and Maksimov et al. [7]. Neutron diffraction patterns recorded when A-LFP is cooled below TN = 25 K show the appearance of some extra reﬂections. Additionally, the intensity of some peaks already present at high temperature is increased (Fig. 1). 
All these reﬂections can be indexed with the propagation vector k = (000), which indicates that the magnetic unit cell is the same as the nuclear unit cell, and, consequently, the space group remains P21/n, with lattice parameters a = 8.5599(2) Å, b = 11.9965(3) Å, c = 8.6096(2) Å, and γ = 90.559(2). The 8 magnetic Fe3+ ions of the cell are distributed on two different crystallographic sites, at general position 4e with the follwoing coordinates: for Fe(1): x = 0.246, y = 0.108, and z = 0.462; and for Fe(1s): x = 0.754, y = 0.395, and z = 0.471. We determined the magnetic structure using symmetry analysis [8]. Reﬁnement of independent magnetic moments for Fe(1) and Fe(1s) led to an antiferromagnetic coupling along the x-axis. Of all the possibilities, the collinear solution FX = S1 X (Γ 3), with opposite magnetic moments for Fe(1) and Fe(1s) gives the best agreement between observed and calculated patterns. No component of the magnetic moment exists along the yand z-directions. 
We ﬁrst tried the reﬁnement with an equivalent magnetic moment amplitude for Fe(1) and Fe(1s), and at the last stage of the reﬁnement, we allowed the magnetic moments of Fe(1) and Fe(1s) to be completely independent. The reﬁned values for the magnetic moment are 4.68(32) µB for Fe(1) and 3.96(30) µB for Fe(1s), respectively. The structure we found by neutron diffraction conﬁrms experimentally the prediction of Goni et al., the magnetic interaction in each sublattice being ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetically coupled between the two Fe(1) and Fe(1s) sublattices [9]. Figure 2 represents the magnetic structure found by neutron diffraction. The solid squares correspond to a negative magnetic moment of 3.96(30) µB in the x-direction, whereas the open circles correspond to a positive moment of 4.68(32) µB in the x-direction. In each “lantern unit”, Fe(1) and Fe(1s) are antiparallel, whereas two neighbouring lantern units are parallel.
The rhombohedral B-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (B-LFP) compound presents the NASICON structure with space group R-3, and its structure was presented in one of our previous papers [3]. Prepared from ion exchange from Na3Fe2(PO4)3, this compound is based on the same [Fe2(PO4)3] lantern units as in A-LFP, but the relative positions of these lanterns are different. Although the magnetic properties of the Na analogue B-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (with a monoclinic C2/c space group) has been widely studied [10], those of B-LFP have scarcely been mentioned, apart from a very recent publication that appeared during the course of our study [11].
As for A-LFP, all the magnetic reﬂections observed in the neutron diffraction pattern below 25 K can be indexed within the nuclear cell, indicating that the propagation vector for the magnetic structure is k = (000). The magnetic structure was solved by testing the different basis functions of the irreducible representation for R-3 with k = (000). There are 2 different crystallographic sites for iron in B-LFP, both in the 6c Wyckoff position with atomic coordinates of the atoms within a primitive cell, (0, 0, z) and (0, 0,−z). The structure  2) is very well reﬁned using the collinear model FX (1), FX (2) . The values of the magnetic moments of Fe(1) and Fe(2) were constrained to be equal; otherwise the reﬁnement leads to an unrealistic value for one of them (over 5 µB). The obtained value for Fe(1) and Fe(2) is reﬁned to 4.76(3) µB. 
We solved the magnetic structure of two lithium iron analogs, A-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and NASICON B-Li3Fe2(PO4)3, that differ by the way the [Fe2(PO4)3] lantern units are connected. Both structures are collinear, and in both cases magnetic moments are oriented antiparallel in the same lantern unit. Magnetic phase diagrams, using exchange integrals as Cartesian axes, are an efﬁcient way to explain and, why not, predict magnetic structures.
