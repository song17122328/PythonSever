An LiTi2(PO4)3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite with a NASICON-type structure was synthesized using a simple microwave-assisted one-pot method followed by calcination. The LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on rGO substrates, and the size of LiTi2(PO4)3 particles in the composite was 30–40 nm. Electrodes prepared from the nanocomposite delivered a reversible capacity  1 at a 0.1 C-rate and the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Li+ in the anode, as calculated of 138 mA h g  1. The electrode exhibited good charge/ from the cyclic voltammetry curves, discharge cycling stability, retaining over 93.2% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles at 1 C-rate and reaching a coulombic eﬃciency of approximately 99.8%. This excellent cycle stability is further conﬁrmed by TEM analysis, which reveals that almost all of the LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles remain unchanged after 200 cycles.

With the rapid growth in the use of portable electronics and electric storage systems are in great demand.1,2 The lithium-ion battery (LIB) has attracted considerable attention as one of the most capable power sources because of the highest energy density among any rechargeable batteries, as well as good power density and cycle life.3–5 At present, various forms of graphitic carbon are used as anode materials in LIBs. However, these materials have drawbacks such as poor cyclability and high reactivity with electrolyte solutions.6–8 For these reasons, the search for new electrode materials that possess improved electrochemical performance and safety has become paramount.9,10 LiTi2(PO4)3

an outstanding potential anode material for LIBs because of the rapid Li+ diﬀusion in the bulk and on surface of LiTi2(PO4)3.11–15 LiTi2(PO4)3 can reversibly accommodate two additional lithium ions, operating on the Ti4+/Ti3+ at 2.48 V, via a two-phase mechanism that and Li3Ti2(PO4)3. The crystal structure of LiTi2(PO4)3 is a three dimensional network in which TiO6 octahedra share all their converts.

The interstitial and conduction channels are aligned along the c-axis, and the Li+ can be found occupying interstitial sites, thus it can move easily along the conduction channels.11 In addition, the LiTi2(PO4)3 framework is well preserved during Li+ extraction.16 The phase transformations are mainly due to the Li+ re-ordering in diﬀerent sites, not causing changes in the lattice framework so that it leads to long cycle life and safety performance. Despite these advantages, LiTi2(PO4)3 suﬀers from intrinsically poor  1), which leads to poor electronic conductivity (10 charging/discharging rate performance of LIBs.

Various approaches for improving the rate capability and cycling performance, such as the reduction of particle size, the addition of a surface coating11,13,14 and the synthesis of composite materials with conductive carbons12,17 have been applied. For example, Luo et al.11 reported the synthesis of LiTi2(PO4)3 using a sol–gel method followed by 12 wt% carbon 1 at coating which provided a discharge capacity of 130 mA h g 0.1 C between 1.5 and 3.5 V vs. Li+/Li. Wessells et al.15 reported the electrochemical properties of 4 wt% carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3 Pechini's method with discharge capacities of 115 and 96.6 mA h g  1 at the rst cycle and aer 100 cycles, respectively, between 2.0 and 3.0 V vs. Li at 1 C-rate. Zhou et al.17 reported the synthesis of LiTi2(PO4)3/ acetylene black nanocomposites using a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) assisted sol–gel method, which showed a discharge capacity of  1 at 0.1 C-rate between 1.5 and 3.5 V vs. Li. To 129.4 mA h g examine the behavior of carbon additives, they prepared the pure-LiTi2(PO4)3 initial discharge capacities of both pure-LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3/C  1 at 0.5 C-rate, respectively. In are 90.3 and 112.8 mA h g and LiTi2(PO4)3/C samples. The synthesized using summary, structuring LiTi2(PO4)3 at the nano-scale typically increases the eﬀective interfacial area between the active also material and the electrolyte. Furthermore, a smaller particle size helps shorten the lithium-ion diﬀusion path, thereby improving the electrochemical utilization of LiTi2(PO4)3 at high discharge/charge rates that increases the overall capacity. Additionally, hybridization with conductive carbonaceous materials improves the electronic conductivity of the nanostructured electrodes and enhances the rate capability.

Among the carbonaceous electrode materials available, graphene and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have great potential as electroactive materials and conductive agents in energy storage applications given their high surface-to-volume ratio, superior electron transport, and excellent mechanical properties.18–21 Electrically conductive rGO akes can not only be used as a conductive template for metal oxide precipitate in the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticle/rGO composites but can also eﬀectively prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles into larger particles during the charge/discharge cycling process.22–24 In addition, the nucleation and growth of metal oxides on rGO templates can eﬀectively reduce restacking of the graphene akes, maintaining their high active surface areas. This improves the electrochemical utilization of oxide nanoparticles, and thus metal oxide nanoparticle/rGO composite materials provide much better rate capabilities than other types of composites.

Although some metal oxide/rGO composites (e.g., CuO/, NiO/, Mn3O4/, Co3O4/, Fe2O3/rGO) have been synthesized,25–29 to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the synthesis of LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composites.30 Most recently, Kim's group reported the synthesis of an LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite using a solid-state method with rGO as a conducting reinforcement. This composite exhibited a capacity retention of 85% aer 200 cycles at 5 C-rate between 1.5 and 3.5 V vs. Li, however, it is still challenging to improve the cyclability.30 Additionally, their synthesis of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite was a traditional two-step procedure consisting of rst the formation of a TiO2–GO hybrid material, and a subsequent lithiation stage to form the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO hybrid. Finally, this product was heated to form the NASICON-structured LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite. In this two-step method, however, the lithiation and heat treatment steps unfavorably aﬀect the size, morphology, and homogeneity of the resulting LiTi2(PO4)3 particles. Moreover, the complicated and time-consuming nature of this two-step approach results in an inhomogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles on the rGO surface.

Here, we report a simple one-pot synthesis of LiTi2(PO4)3/ rGO nanocomposites via a microwave-assisted solvothermal method that combines the advantages of simplicity and eﬃciency. Electrodes prepared from the nanocomposites provide excellent cycling performance and rate capability, indicating great potential for their use in LIBs.

The LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite was synthesized from an Li– Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate precursor via a microwave-assisted solvothermal method using one-pot and subsequent heat treatment. GO akes (100 mg), prepared using the modied Hummers' method,31 were dispersed in 100 ml of diethylene glycol (DEG) with sonication for 30 min, then 0.42 ml of Ti(OC2H5)4 was added to the above dispersion under stirring. 40 ml of this solution was loaded into each of two Teon vessels, aer which 5 ml of 2 M LiOH solution and 4 ml of 3 M NH4H2(PO4)3 solution were added. The resulting mixtures were treated in a microwave oven (MARS, CEM Corp.), the reaction product was washed with ethanol and distilled water several times, and then freeze-dried for 24 h. The resulting Li–Ti–P–O/ rGO precursor was calcined under an argon gas atmosphere at 800 C for 10 h to obtain a well-crystallized LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite. Additionally, “bare” LiTi2(PO4)3, without rGO or any carbonaceous materials, was prepared using the conventional Pechini method32 for comparison purposes as shown in Fig. S1.† The crystalline phases, structures and the morphology of the materials were characterized by X-ray diﬀractometer (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2200V/PC with Cu Ka radiation (l ¼ 1.54178 ˚A), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) using a FEI Tecnai F20 at 200 kV, and Raman spectrometry using a Jobin Yvon-Spex, LABram. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) using a Thermo Electron Corporation ESCA Lab 250 at 15 kV and 150 W was employed to analyze the degree of reduction of the graphene oxide. To estimate the loading of LiTi2(PO4)3 in the composite, elemental analysis (2400 Series II, PerkinElmer) and a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Bruker TGA-DTA2010SA) was performed.

The electrochemical experiments were performed using a CR2032 coin cell incorporating a metallic lithium foil counter electrode. The working electrode was prepared from a mixture of 90 wt% LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite, 5 wt% carbon black as a conductive additive, and 5 wt% polyvinylidene uoride dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone as a binder. This slurry was spread onto copper foil and then dried at 100 C for 12 h. The  2 for each working loading of dried slurry was 2–3 mg cm electrode. 1 M LiPF6 was dissolved in a mixture of ethyl carbonate and dimethyl carbonate in a volume ratio of 1 : 1 and used as the electrolyte.

Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted using a Princeton Applied Research VMP2 potentiostat/galvanostat. CV was performed at scan rates  1 in a potential window of 2.0–3.0 V ranging from 0.1 to 5 mV s vs. Li+/Li. The EIS measurements were performed at room temperature aer three charge/discharge cycles and subsequently conducted at 2.46 V vs. Li+/Li with a 5 mV voltage amplitude over frequencies ranging from 100 kHz to 10 mHz.


Scheme 1 illustrates the microwave-assisted synthesis of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite. First, an Li–Ti–P–O intermediate precursor is formed in situ on partially reduced GO from a mixed solution of GO, titanium, phosphate, and lithium precursors in a microwave-assisted process. This microwaveassisted solvothermal approach oﬀers several advantages compared to the conventional solvothermal methods.33 The dielectric microwave heating leads to direct interactions between the microwaves and reactants inside the sealed reaction vessel, which reduces the reaction time and provides energy savings.34–36 Moreover, the conductive rGO template absorbs microwaves and is selectively heated within a short period of time under microwave irradiation, resulting in a higher temperature on the rGO surface than in diethylene glycol solution. This facilitates the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the precipitates on the surface of rGO rather than the homogeneous nucleation and growth in the bulk solution, so that extremely small Li–Ti–P–O precursor particles can be uniformly decorated on the surface of the rGO substrate.37,38 Finally, aer calcination at 800 C, the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposites were synthesized as nal products, during which the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate precursor could be completely transformed into well-crystallized LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite without morphological changes.

Powder X-ray diﬀractometry (XRD) results for both the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate precursor and the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 1(a). The XRD pattern of the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate precursor indicated the formation of an amorphous phase. When calcined at 800 C under an argon atmosphere, the amorphous Li–Ti–P–O/rGO precursor could be completely converted into the crystalline LiTi2(PO4)3/ rGO nanocomposite; this is consistent with the Raman data (Fig. S3†). The major characteristic peaks of (012), (104), (113), (202), from LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composites, unlike those of the amorphous Li–Ti–P–O/rGO, could be indexed to the rhombohedral NASICON-type structure with a space group of R3C (JCPDS 35-0754). A broad (002) reection appearing over a 2q range of 25–27 corresponds to the formation of the rGO akes. All of these diﬀraction peaks are strong and narrow, indicating highly crystalline LiTi2(PO4)3. The morphology and structural features of LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite were observed by high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) and eld-emission SEM (FE-SEM). As shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution in the range of 30–40 nm are uniformly decorated on the rGO template, which prevents the agglomeration of individual LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles.

During the calcination heat treatment to transform the Li–Ti– P–O/rGO intermediate precursor into the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite, particle size growth or morphological changes were not observed as determined by TEM and SEM (Fig. S2†). The clear lattice fringes observed in the HR-TEM image in Fig. 1(d) demonstrate the high crystallinity of the LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles in the composite, which is consistent with the XRD results. The lattice parameter (a0) of the NASICON-structured LiTi2(PO4)3 is 0.36 nm, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(d). This is consistent with the d-spacing of the (202) planes calculated based on the diﬀraction angle using Bragg's law.

The LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the spectrum was analyzed using the Gaussian tting method. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the elements present were Ti, P, O, and C, as expected for an LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite. The Ti 2p, P 2p and O 1s XPS signatures conrm the presence of LiTi2(PO4)3. The expanded C 1s regions shown in Fig. 2(b)–(d) indicate a degree of reduction of the GO, with four components corresponding to carbon atoms in diﬀerent functional groups: C–C, C–O, C]O and O–C]O. It is clearly seen that the peak at 284.7 eV (C–C) for the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite peak at [Fig. 2(d)] increased, while the peaks at 286.2 eV (C–O), 287.7 eV (C]O), and 290.3 eV (O–C]O) decreased drastically aer calcination. The intensities associated with these oxygen-bearing functional groups were reduced substantially in the composite as compared to the GO and Li–Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate, indicating the complete reduction of GO to rGO.

Fig. 3(a) shows peak-shaped cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite measured at increasing  1 in the potential range potential scan rates from 0.1 to 5 mV s 2.0–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). The cathodic current peak in the CVs corresponds to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, which is responsible for the electrochemical lithiation of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode, and the anodic current peak corresponds to the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+, which is responsible for the electro 1 chemical delithiation process. The CV obtained at 0.1 mV s clearly shows a set of well-dened peaks at 2.43 and 2.51 V.14  1, Even when the potential scan rate was increased up to 5 mV s the initial shape of the CV was well retained, with little increase in peak potential separation. This suggests facile electrochemical kinetics of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode.

A linear dependence of the peak current (Ip, peak for the Ti4+/ Ti3+ redox reaction) on the square root of the scan rate (n1/2) was observed as shown in Fig. S4.† From this relation, the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Li+ ions in the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite was calculated from the CV data using the Randles– Sevcik equation,

It should Dapp is the apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (in cm2 s be noted that surface area used in the calculation was for the LiTi2(PO4)3 particles aer the rGO had been burnt out in air, since only the LiTi2(PO4)3 in the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite is electrochemically active in the potential window of 2.0–3.0 V.

From the slope of the linear t (R-square of 0.999 and 0.987 for anodic and cathodic lines, respectively), the Dapp values were calculated to be 1.55  10 C for the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively. These obtained values agree well with previously reported results.46–48 the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite obtained between 2.0–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a C-rate of 0.1 to 100, where each set of charge/charge/discharge behaviors of shows discharge tests was performed at the same C-rate. LiTi2(PO4)3 in the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite (75 wt% from thermogravimetric analysis as shown in Fig. S5†) shows the specic  1 based on the weight of discharge capacity of 138 mA h g LiTi2(PO4)3 at 0.1 C-rate. The specic discharge capacity of 49  1 was achieved even at 50 C-rate, which is 35% of the 0.1 mA h g C-rate specic capacity. The distinct voltage plateaus around 2.48 V are consistent with the CV measurements and correspond to the two-phase reaction that transforms LiTi2(PO4)3 to Li3Ti2(PO4)3. Examination of the voltage proles measured at low C rates, however, clearly shows a short voltage plateau around 2.8 V. Kim's group reported the similar charge curve with a short voltage plateau around 2.8 V, however, with no explanation.30 Careful examination of the CVs at the potential  1 also shows a small broad hump around scan rate of 0.1 mV s 2.8 V during the anodic scan that corresponds to the short voltage plateau around 2.8 V in the charge curves. It has been reported that TiP2O7 shows a plateau from the two-phase reaction around 2.6 V vs. Li+/Li upon discharging between LiTiP2O7 and Li0.8TiP2O7 with good structural stability during cycling.49,50 Though the short potential plateau for the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite is observed at the potential slightly diﬀerent from that for TiP2O7, it is speculated that TiP2O7 might be formed during the calcination of the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO intermediate precursor, considering the chemistry used to prepare the composite.

From the aforementioned XRD analysis, as-synthesized LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite is well-matched to the previously reported NASICON-type XRD patterns,17 however, the absence of diﬀraction peaks corresponding to TiP2O7 compounds suggested from the charge/discharge curves and CVs might be due to the fact that the concentration of TiP2O7 was very low in the composite. Its formation during the synthesis of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite needs further investigation.

The LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite shows much improved Li+ ion storage capacity and rate capability than other electrodes prepared from a physical mixture with an equal amount of conductive carbon. Fig. 3(c) shows the rate performance of the electrode incorporating the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite and two other electrodes in which the LiTi2(PO4)3 was physically mixed with an equal amount of carbon black (CB) or microwavereduced graphene (mrGO). The LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite provides much better rate capability that the others. In particular, the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite retains 56.5% of its initial capacity at 10 C-rate, whereas capacities of the physically mixed CB and mrGO samples drop dramatically to only 0% and 3%, respectively, of the initial capacity at the same rate. This could be attributed to the large eﬀective surface area of the small LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles in comparison with that of submicron particles prepared using sol–gel methods (Fig. S6†), which promotes shorter pathways for the solid-state diﬀusion of the LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles and rGO, both of which result in a better rate capability.

In order to verify that the rGO in the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite is primarily responsible for the improved electrochemical performance from the view of electrical wiring,51,52 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed. Fig. 3(d) shows the Nyquist plots of the three diﬀerent electrodes. The intersection of these curves with the real axis at high frequency is related to the total resistance (Rs) of the electrolyte, active materials, current collectors, and separator. The radius of the semicircle in the middle frequency region typically represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface.53,54 The LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode has the smallest radius with Rct ¼ 36 U, whereas the “bare” LiTi2(PO4)3 samples mixed with CB (Rct ¼ 205.29 U) or mrGO (Rct ¼ 154.462 U) showed larger charge transfer resistances. This indicates that an intimate electrical connection between the LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles and the rGO template can eﬀectively create more active sites for lithium intercalation/ deintercalation and improve the charge transfer reaction, thereby enhancing the rate capability.

The cycling stability of the prepared nanocomposite was also analyzed. Fig. 4(a) shows that the specic capacity of the  1 aer 100 LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode reached 98.76 mA h g cycles at 1 C-rate, a 93.2% retention of the initial capacity. Furthermore, the coulombic eﬃciency remained constant at 99.8% during the repeated cycling, implying excellent electrochemical the nanocomposite.

were analyzed aer 200 cycles by HR-TEM, the results of which are shown in Fig. 4(c). The rectangular area shows clear lattice fringes observed in the HR-TEM image with a d-spacing of 0.301 nm, which corresponds to the (024) plane spacing of LiTi2(PO4)3, demonstrating that the high crystallinity of the LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles was well retained in the composite during the repeated cycling at 10 C-rate.


An LiTi2(PO4)3/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite was prepared using a simple one-pot method, in which an Li–Ti–P–O/rGO precursor was synthesized in situ using a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. Subsequent calcination of the Li–Ti–P–O/rGO precursor yielded a highly crystalline LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite, which showed good rate capability and cycling stability. The EIS measurements and post-mortem analysis of LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO nanocomposite conrmed the structural and electrical the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite even aer 200 cycles at 10 C-rate.

To further explore the cycling stability of the nanocomposite, EIS was performed aer certain numbers of charge/discharge cycles at 10 C-rate, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Aer 200 cycles, the charge-transfer resistance of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode shows little increase, which conrms the good cycling stability of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO electrode. This suggests both the structural and electrical integrity of the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite prepared in this study. To further investigate any structural changes of LiTi2(PO4)3 in the LiTi2(PO4)3/rGO composite aer the repeated cycling, the composite materials in the coin cell
