NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite decorated with graphene (NTPeCeG) was prepared via a facile sol-gel method and subsequent high-temperature calcination, and applied in sodium ion battery. Three-dimensional continuous mixture was formed by NaTi2(PO4)3/C and graphene, and the graphene had no obvious eﬀect on the crystal form of NaTi2(PO4)3/C. Compared with NaTi2(PO4)3/C (NTPeC), NTPeCeG showed outstanding rate performance. NTPeCeG delivered discharge capacity of 156.3 and 72.1 mAh g−1 at current density of 0.2 and 2 A g−1, respectively, 45.5 and 47.0 mAh g−1 larger than those of NTPeC. Moreover, cycling performance of two composites was evaluated by long-term galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and NTPeCeG demonstrated better cycling performance compared with NTPeC. NTPeCeG delivered discharge capacity of 63.9 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 after 1000 cycles, increasing by 45.1 mAh g−1 compared with NTPeC. Excellent electrochemical performance may be ascribed to the continuous conductive network formed by graphene, which increases the conductivity of electrons and sodium ions. Our work proves that NaTi2(PO4)3/C modiﬁed with graphene exhibits excellent sodium storage performance, and it can act as a promising electrode for sodium ion batteries.

The demands for energy and food have increased continuously with the rapid development of modern society and the growth of global population [1–6]. Because burning of traditional fossil fuels can cause serious environmental pollution problems, more and more renewable energy sources are being developed, such as wind, solar, tide, and geothermal energy [7–12]. However, these energies depend on time and space, instability and discontinuity [13,14]. In order to develop more practical energy supply system, electrochemical energy storage as an option has been extensively studied [15,16]. Among various secondary batteries, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been extensively used in electric vehicles and portable electronics over the past two decades because of its high energy density and long cycling life [17–20]. But lithium resource reserve is decreasing and the price is a bit expensive. Sodium with rich reserves and cheap similar physicochemical properties and intercalation price has mechanism to lithium because of belonging to the same main group in periodic table of element [21,22]. Therefore, developing sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is a suitable alternative for large-sized energy storage system [23–25].

SIBs are mainly composed of electrodes, electrolyte and membrane separator. The separator is usually glass ﬁber, and the electrolyte is mixture, generally consisting of sodium salt (NaClO4, NaPF6, etc.), organic esters (ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, etc.) and additive (ﬂuoroethylene carbonate). Moreover, electrode materials are the core of the batteries. Layered transition-mental oxides, such as NaxCoO2 [26], NaxMnOy [27,28], NaxNi0.5Mn0.5O2 [29], are commonly employed as cathodes for SIBs because they exist broad channel for high-speed intercalation/deintercalation of sodium ions. D'Arienzo et al. [26] prepared Na0.17CoO2 with 2D sheet-like morphology through high temperature solid-state reaction. The stable discharge speciﬁc capacity for Na0.17CoO2 at 5 and 40 mA g−1 are 120 and 80 mAh g−1, respectively. In addition, anode materials which have

NaTi2(PO4)3 is one of the polyanionic phosphates, and its theoretical capacity at around 2.1 V (vs. Na/Na+) is 133 mAh g−1 [39,40]. NASICON structured NaTi2(PO4)3, which framework is formed by PO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra sharing common oxygen atoms, provides broad pathways and exhibits high sodium ion conductivity [41,42]. This advantage allows fast electrochemical kinetic process for sodium ions with large radius. In addition, the structural stability and thermal stability of NaTi2(PO4)3 are also outstanding, only resulting in slight volume expansion when sodium ions are embedded [43]. Liu et al. [44] synthesized NaTi2(PO4)3@C microsphere through a way of spraydrying and put it into the use of sodium ion batteries. It shows excellent capacity retention more than 92% at 10C after 500 cycles. Zhou et al. [45] designed hierarchical NaTi2(PO4)3 microﬂowers with carbon coated. Ultralong cycle performance and remarkable rate capability are obtained from this special structure. However, the NaTi2(PO4)3 faces a serious problem that its intrinsic electronic conductivity is poor. This directly leads to unsatisfactory rate performance at high current densities. So far, several methods have been explored to solve this issue [46,47].

It is well known that incorporation of conductive additives is an eﬀective way to enhance the rate performance of electrode. Graphene is a typical additive which possesses large speciﬁc surface area, ultra high conductivity, and superior stability [48,49]. Apart from this, graphene can form a conductive network between mutually independent particles, which has an important eﬀect on the improvement of conductivity [50]. For example, Zhou et al. [51] synthesized graphene decorated LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite as anode in aqueous lithium ion battery. Graphene can raise conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3@carbon composite, leading to improvement in rate and cycling performance. Hu et al. [39] designed NaTi2(PO4)3 modiﬁed with N-doped graphene, and applied in sodium ion battery. Graphene forms conductive network in composite, and facilitates electron and ion transport. The anode shows excellent rate performance, and delivers discharge capacity of 126.0 and 95.6 mAh g−1 at 0.5 and 10C, respectively. So, we designed and successfully synthesized NaTi2(PO4)3/C modiﬁed with graphene via solgel method, as showed in Fig. 1. Nano-scale NaTi2(PO4)3 particles connected by graphene were obtained by this method, and electrochemical performance of anodes was examined systematically.

The phase purity and structure of NTP-C and NTPeCeG were studied by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) using Rigaku D/MAX2500PC diffractometer with Cu Kα irradiation. Morphology characterization of asprepared products was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to examine carbon content of two prepared composites by thermal analyzer (STA 449 F3, Germany).

Active materials (NTP-C and NTPeCeG), adhesive agent (polyvinylidene ﬂuoride), and conductive agent (super P) were mixed (mass ratio of 7:1.5:1.5) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent. Afterwards, the mixture was uniformly coated to copper foil, and put into a vacuum oven to dry at 80 °C for 8 h. Then, this ﬁlm was cut into round piece of 12 mm in diameter. CR2016 coin-type half cell was assembled in the glove box which is full of argon gas. The cell was composed of Na disk as counter electrode, prepared electrode as working electrode, NaClO4 mixture as electrolyte, and glass ﬁber membrane as separator. NaClO4 mixture consisted of 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, and ethylene carbonate (1:1:1 volumetric), and the additive is 5% ﬂuoroethylene carbonate. Charge-discharge tests were conducted on CT-3008W Neware battery testing system with test voltage from 0.01 V to 3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed with a scan rate of 0.4 mV s−1 on CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China). And its potential range is as same as charge-discharge tests. Electrochemical impedance spectra was obtained on CHI660E electrochemical workstation in the frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz. The cell was charged to 2.1 V and then held for 2 h before testing.

XRD was employed to evaluate the crystal structure of the as-synthesized composites, and the patterns are exhibited in Fig. 2. These strong diﬀraction peaks of NTP-C and NTPeCeG could be indexed well to NASICON type NaTi2(PO4)3 (PDF #01-084-2008). The result demonstrates that two samples have the pure phase. There is no detected impurity phase, indicating that graphene has no eﬀect on lattice frame of NaTi2(PO4)3.
