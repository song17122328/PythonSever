In the ﬁeld of solid state ionics, many kinds of mono-,1–4 di-,5–7 and trivalent ions8,9 have been reported to conduct in solids, and it is generally accepted that ionic conduction is strongly inﬂuenced by the strength of electrostatic interaction between the conducting ion and surrounding counter ions. Therefore, high-valency (e.g. tetravalent cations) have been regarded as extremely poor migrant species due to their considerably strong electrostatic interaction with surrounding counter anions. However, since high valent cation can carry much higher electric charges than the lower valent cations, tetravalent cation conducting solid electrolyte is expected to become a candidate for the electrochemical devices such as rechargeable batteries and chemical sensors. Therefore, the development of the tetravalent cation conducting solids is a challenging task for realizing the high performance of these devices. Based on this consideration, we have previously developed the tetravalent Zr4+ ion conducting MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf)10–12 solids. The MNb(PO4)3 (M = Zr, Hf) solid has a three-dimensional NASICON-type structure,3 and the introduction of -O2− pentavalent Nb5+ interand the Hf4+ action by the strong attraction of O2− ion migration in solid lattice can be realized. Both Zr and Hf exhibit only the stable tetravalent state, and Zr4+ and Hf4+ rather than a covalent bond due to the signiﬁcant difference in electronegativity between Zr (1.33) or Hf (1.3) and O (3.44). However, other tetravalent cations can assume various valence states, which causes the appearance of electronic conduction by valence change, and/or results in high electronegativity values that lead to the formation of strong covalent bonds, so that these cations have been considered to be inappropriate migrant candidates in solids. However, we have recently demonstrated tetravalent Ti4+ ion conduction in the NASICON-type Ti(Nb0.8W0.2)5/5.2(PO4)3 solid,13 although Ti has two valence states (+3 and +4). In addition, we have also demonstrated Ge4+ conduction in the Ge41/40NbP2.9Si0.1O12 solid,14 where Ge has higher electronegativity (2.01) than the previously reported tetravalent cations (Zr: 1.33, Hf: 1.3, Ti: 1.54). These results suggest that cations previously considered as unsuitable candidates as migrant species in solids can become migrating species by strict design of the solid electrolyte components. ion as a new tetravalent cation species for conduction in solids. Tin has two valence states (+2 and +4) as well as having a high electronegativity of 1.96; therefore, it would be of scientiﬁc interest to realize Sn4+ ion migration in a solid. NASICON-type SnNb(PO4)3 was selected as a mother solid for the development of a tetravalent Sn4+ ion conducting solid, and the Nb5+ ion sites in SnNb(PO4)3 were partially substituted with higher valency W6+ ions, which can efﬁciently weaken the strong interaction between the Sn4+ anions, similar to the case for the

Ti4+ ion conducting properties of the Sn(Nb1−xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids prepared were then investigated.

Sn(Nb1−xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids were synthesized by the solidstate reaction method. SnO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and (NH4)2HPO4 powders were mixed using a planetary ball milling apparatus (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch GmbH) in an agate pot at a rotation of 300 rpm for 3 h, and ◦ C for 6 h in an air atmosphere. the mixture was then heated at 600 The resulting powder was shaped into a pellet (12 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness) by uniaxial pressing at 10 MPa and calcined at ◦ C for 12 h in an air atmosphere. The resulting pellet was ground 1200 in a mortar, pelletized again, and then reheated at the same condition. The crystal structures of the samples were identiﬁed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, Multiﬂex) analysis using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Ulvac, 5500MT) was measured at room temperature using Mg Kα radiation (1253.6 eV) to determine the valence state of the Sn ion in the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 (x = 0.35) solid. Electrical conductivity measurements were conducted using samples pelletized and C for 12 h in air. The AC conductivity (σAC) of the sintered at 1200 sintered pellets were measured using the complex impedance method (Hewlett-Packard, Precision LCR meter 4192A) at temperatures be◦ −16 to tween 600 and 300 105 Pa, which were controlled by mixing O2, He, and CO-CO2 mixture gas. The DC conductivity (σDC) was estimated using a DC current of 1 μA applied to a sample pellet between two Pt electrodes and monitoring of the generated voltage. DC electrolysis of the sintered Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 pellet was conducted by application of a ◦ DC voltage of 6 V for 360 h at 800 C, and the elemental distribution inside the electrolyzed pellet was determined by cross-sectional line analysis using an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX; Shimadzu, SSX-550).

XRD patterns of the Sn(Nb1−xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids obtained are presented in Figure 1. The samples with x ≤ 0.35 have single phase NASICON-type structures, whereas the samples with x > 0.35 are a two-phase mixture of NASICON-type phosphate and SnP2O7.

Figure 2 shows the lattice volume of the NASICON-type phase in the prepared samples. In the compositional region with a single phase of NASICON-type structure (x ≤ 0.35), linear lattice shrinkage was evident due to the partial replacement of Nb5+ (ionic radius: 0.078 nm15) sites in SnNb(PO4)3 with smaller W6+ (ionic radius: 0.074 nm15) ions. When the W content (x) was above 0.35, the lattice volume of the NASICON-type phase maintained the same value as the sample with x = 0.35, which indicates that the solid solubility limit composition forming the single phase NASICON-type structure is x = 0.35.

Figure 2 also depicts the compositional dependence of the AC ◦ C for the Sn(Nb1−xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 solids. The conductivity at 600 conductivity was enhanced with increase in the high valency W6+ content, due to a reduction in the strength of the bonding between Sn4+ ions, and the highest conductivity was obtained for the solid solubility limit composition (x = 0.35). In the two-phase mixture region of x > 0.35, the conductivity decreased compared to that of Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 (x = 0.35), due to the appearance of the less conductive SnP2O7 impurity phase. The valence states of the Sn, Nb, P, and W ions were conﬁrmed by XPS analysis for the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 (x = 0.35) solid, which exhibits the highest conductivity among the prepared samples. The XPS spectra of the Sn 3d, Nb 3d, P 2p, and W 4f core-levels are shown in Figure 3. The binding energies of Sn 3d3/2 (495.5 eV) and Sn 3d5/2 (487.0 eV) can be assigned to those for tetravalent Sn4+ ion.16 The Nb peaks (3d3/2: 210.4 eV, 3d5/2: 207.7 eV) can be attributed to

Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 was increased, due to the appearance of electronic conduction associated with the reduction of tin ions. Furthermore, the DC conductivity was almost the same as the AC conductivity (σDC/σAC = 0.99), even after 30 min at Po2 = 10 −14 Pa, which indicates that this high DC conductivity was caused by the ﬂow of electrons in the sample.13 In order to conﬁrm the reduction of tin ions at such a low Po2 atmosphere, XRD measurement was conducted for the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid exposed to a COCO2 atmosphere (Po2 = 10 C. With exposure of the sample to a reducing atmosphere, the formation of an additional NASICON-type phase (Figure 4b) with a lattice volume of 1.479 nm3 was observed, which is signiﬁcantly larger than those of the sample prior to CO-CO2 treatment (lattice volume = 1.420 nm3, i.e., the increase of lattice volume by CO-CO2 treatment was 4.2%) and the mother SnNb(PO4)3 solid (1.425 nm3). The additional NASICON-type phase was also observed for the SnNb(PO4)3 solid after CO-CO2 treatment, and the lattice volume expansion (3.6%) was similar to the that for Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3; therefore, it can be concluded that the additional phase is the result of Sn4+ (0.083 nm15) reduction to the larger ionic size Sn2+ ion (0.102 nm20). On the other hand, no signiﬁcant deviation in the AC conductivity was observed for the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid in the Po2 −13 Pa, which suggests that the conducting species are range above 10 − ), but ions. In addition, the σDC/σAC ratio after not electronic (e 30 min was 0.01, even in an oxygen (Po2 = 105 Pa) atmosphere, so that the possibility of O2− anion conduction in the solid was also eliminated.21 These phenomena strongly support that cation species , and W6+ of Sn4+ are the predominant migrating species in the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid in the oxygen partial pressure −13 and 105 Pa. region between 10 identiﬁcation of the conducting cation species in the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid was conducted by DC electrolysis with application of a constant DC voltage of 6 V, which was higher than the preliminarily determined decomposition voltage (1.4 V) of Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3. During the DC electrolysis, the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid decomposed to conducting Sn4+ cation, oxygen gas, and the other cation oxides, such as Nb2O5, WO3, and P2O5 at anodic side. The Sn4+ ions produced are forced to macroscopically migrate toward the cathode according to the potential gradient. The Sn4+ ions, reached to the cathodic surface where contacts

with an ion-blocking Pt cathode electrode, are successively reduced to Sn metal. Since the DC electrolysis is performed at elevated temperatures under atmospheric air, the Sn metal at the cathodic surface is immediately oxidized by oxygen. Although the DC current gradually decreased due to the generation of oxides at the cathodic side (SnO2) and at the anodic side (Nb2O5, WO3, and P2O5), the decomposition occurred continuously by applying DC voltage higher than the decomposition one, so that the mobile cations are supplied sustainably and segregate at the cathodic surface. After the electrolysis, EDX line scan analysis was performed for the sample pellet and the results are presented in Figure 5. A clear segregation of Sn was evident near the cathodic surface, while the other cationic species (Nb, P, and W) were distributed homogeneously throughout the sample. This result explicitly indicates that only tin ions were conducted in the solid. The tin ion in the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid is conﬁrmed to maintain −13 Pa; therefore, the tetravalent state in atmospheres with Po2 > 10 the conducting species in the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid can be conﬁrmed as the tetravalent Sn4+

the ionic conductivity for the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid with corresponding data for the SnNb(PO4)3 solid. The conductivity of the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid was ca. 3.8 times higher the the SnNb(PO4)3 solid at 600 than that of Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid exhibited a lower activation energy of 68.5 kJ· mol −1 for ion migration than that for the SnNb(PO4)3 solid (72.4 kJ· mol −1). Both the enhancement in conductivity and the decrease in activation energy are caused by a reduction of the strong electrostatic interaction between Sn4+ ions due to introduction of high valency W6+

ion conducting solid electrolyte of Sn(Nb1−xWx)5/(5+x)(PO4)3 was successfully developed using the NASICON-type SnNb(PO4)3 as a mother solid, although tin ions are generally considered to be an extremely poor conducting species in solids due to high electronegativity and the possibility of valence change. Among the solids prepared, the Sn(Nb0.65W0.35)5/5.35(PO4)3 solid exhibited the highest Sn4+ ion conductivity without any electronic conduction in a wide oxygen partial pressure region between 10
