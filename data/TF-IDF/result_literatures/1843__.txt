In this work, we present the synthesis and the characterization of ionic conducting ceramics of NaSICON-type (Natrium super ionic conductor). The properties of this ceramic make it suitable for use in electrochemical devices. These solid electrolytes can be used as sensors for application in the manufacturing of potentiometric gas sensors, for the detection of pollutant emissions and for environment control. The family of NaSICON that we studied has as a general formula Na2.8Zr2 ySi1.8 4yP1.2+4yO12 with 0pyp0.45. The various compositions were synthesized by produced using the sol–gel method. The electric properties of these compositions were carried out by impedance spectroscopy. The results highlight the good conductivity of the Na2.8Zr1.775Si0.9 P2.1O12 composition. r 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
Since the work of Hong and Goodenough, many studies have been carried out on a conductive membrane using sodium ions, NaSICON (acronym for Natrium super ionic conductor), for its applications in the ﬁelds of the NaSICON-type (Na1+xZr2SixP3 xO12, with 0oxo3) has a rhombohedral symmetry, except in the interval 1.8oxo2.2, where a small distortion of monoclinic symmetry takes place. Compounds in this composition range have a structure made by a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and PO4 tetrahedra corners shared with MO6 octahedra, in which Na ions occupy the interstices. 
Outside the ''classical'' composition Na3Zr2Si2PO12, the structural studies and the electric properties were compositions studied (Na1+xZr2 x/3SixP3 xO12 2x/3). the highest conductivity values were observed in the range 1.6<=x<=3.0.
The aim of the present work is to study the NaSICON family with general formula Na2.8Zr2-ySi1.8-4yP1.2+4yO12 (0<=y<=0.45) in order to determine the existence of same conductivity areas and to understand the conductive mechanism. The synthesis was made using the sol–gel method; the synthesized precursors were characterized by coupled DTA-TGA. The oxides obtained after pyrolysis of the precursors were identiﬁed by X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the sintered ceramic samples were characterized by electric conductivity. Impedance spectroscopy, used to separate grain from grain boundary impedances, showed that the grain boundary contribution is often the major contribution to the overall impedance [9]. Moreover, this technique enabled us to evaluate the inﬂuence of porosity on conductivity. In the ternary diagram delimited by the compositions NaZr2P3O12–Na4Zr2Si3O12–Na4Zr1.25P3O12 the studied samples are located on the line with general formula Na2.8Zr2 ySi1.8 4yP1.2+4yO12 (0pyp0.45) as shown in Fig. 1. 
In particular we selected those compositions, which have a constant stoichiometric of Na+ ions in general formula. The synthesis method of the precursors described in this contribution was used in order to improve the sintering conditions of NaSICON compounds.

In particular we selected those compositions, which have a constant stoichiometric of Na+ ions in general formula. The synthesis method of the precursors described in this contribution was used in order to improve the sintering conditions of NaSICON compounds.
In this study, 5 compositions are explored: y=0; 0.075; 0.225; 0.375 and 0.45, represented by points on Fig. 1. The corresponding samples are respectively noted A (Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12), B (Na2.8Zr1.925Si1.5P1.5O12), C (Na2.8Zr1.775Si0.9P2.1O12), D (Na2.8Zr1.625Si0.3P2.7O12) and E (Na2.8Zr1.55P3O12). Taking into account the difficulty in obtaining pure ceramics of NaSICON by reactions in solid phase, the precursors were synthesized by the sol–gel process in order to obtain the preliminary formation of an amorphous solid (xerogel). The higher reactivity of these precursors leads more easily to monophasic compositions, without impurities at the grain boundary, and at the same time produces very small grains which are sintered more easily. The synthesis was performed in three stages 
The first stage consisted in mixing at ambient temperature distilled water, ethanol, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and nitric acid. The proportions of these compounds were selected in the miscible area of TEOS–ethanol–water phase diagram in order to better homogenize the reactants and try to limit the segregation of zirconia. The pH was adjusted to one after addition of an HNO3 solution.
The second stage consisted in simultaneously dissolving stoichiometric quantities of NaNO3 and ZrO(NO3)2 in distilled water at ambient temperature and adding them to the previous solution while stirring until a clear phase was obtained. Finally, the last stage consisted in quickly adding the di-ammonium-hydrogeno-phosphate solution, a white gelatinous precipitate appeared. The mixture obtained was dried at 100 1C until the solvent was eliminated and a dehydrated compound was obtained. 
Many works show that the procedures of the powder preparation and the later heat treatments strongly affect the ceramic properties containing NaSICON. All the studied samples were submitted to the same calcinations and sintering treatments. The precursors were calcined at 1000 1C for 3 h under air. The powders were uniaxially pressed (120 MPa) into pellets of 13 mm in diameter and sintered under air at 1050 1C for 70 h. The heating-cooling rates were equal to 5 1C min-1. 
The final density of the ceramics was obtained from their geometrical dimensions and their masses. The diameters of the NaSICON samples were 13 mm and the thicknesses were in the range of 1–1.5 mm. 
For all the studied compositions, the optimum conditions for calcination of the precursors were determined by DTA-TGA coupled (Setaram TGA92) between room temperature and 1100 1C, and the heating rate was 10 1C min-1 . After pyrolysis, the calcined powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction at room temperature (Siemens D5000, lCu=1.5406 A). 
The electrical properties of ceramics were determined by ac impedance spectroscopy measurements (HewlettPackard 4194A) between 25 and 110 1C under air, in the frequency range 100–4  107 Hz. An applied voltage was fixed at 100 mV. The sample was allowed to equilibrate for 2 h before measurements could be obtained of the reproducible impedance spectra. The measurement electrodes were made of platinum deposited by cathodic sputtering at room temperature (Plassys MP300) 
The five thermograms obtained are similar and present three successive mass losses associated with thermal phenomena (endothermic or exothermic). Fig. 2 presents the results obtained for the composition y=0.225:
A first loss occurs between 40 and 230 1C: the endothermic phenomenon observed corresponds to the loss of water and residual solvent.  
A second loss occurs between 230 and 335 1C: the exothermic peak was attributed to the removal of a residual organic group.  
A third loss occurs between 335 and 575 1C: the departure of the water and solvent trapped in closed pores (endothermic phenomenon). The exothermic peak at 730 1C, note accompanied by weight losses represents the crystallization phase of NaSICON. 
Fig. 3 shows the crystallization temperature evolution (peak exothermic noted (1)) according to the NaSICON composition. For sample A (y=0), the crystallization temperature value of the precursor is in agreement with those obtained in the literature for zirconium non-deficiency compositions elaborated using the sol–gel method. For solid solutions of general formula Na3Zr2x/4Si2xP1+xO12 (with 0oxo2), the crystallization temperature decreased [9,19]. The stage of crystallization occurs between 650 and 750 1C (Fig. 3). It is important to note that any considerable variation of the crystallization temperature for the NaSICON phase with the zirconium concentration (DT=300 1C between y=0 and y=0.45) has not been described, to our knowledge, in the literature.
The different oxides obtained after pyrolysis of the precursors were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The Xdiagrams obtained at room temperature for the compositions y=0, 0.075 and 0.225 showed only the presence of the NaSICON single-phase. We presented in Fig. 4 one example of three representative samples, corresponding to the composition y=0.225. The analysis shows that, for y values in range 0 and 0.225, the dominant phase after pyrolysis is NaSICON without any detected trace of ZrO2. No other phase such as SiO2, ZrSiO4, Na3PO12, Na2SiO3 or Na2ZrO3 could be detected in these samples. The low full widths at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peaks indicate that the crystallization of the NaSICON phase is effectively under the experimental conditions, in agreement with the results of thermal analysis (Fig. 3). The results obtained for these three compositions suggest that a decrease in the zirconium concentration does not modify the stability of the NaSICON phase. 
In the absence of any ZrO2 trace (Fig. 4), we can suggest that no volatilization phenomenon of Na and P occurred up to 1000 1C.
For the weakest zirconium concentrations (y=0.375 and 0.45), the stage of calcinations at 1000 1C involves the appearance of the additional phases, which were identified as ZrO2 and Na3PO4 (Fig. 5). The presence of ZrO2 seems to correspond to a phase separation of NaSICON at high temperature. This result is surprising because the thermal decomposition of NaSICON is generally observed at higher temperatures above 1000 1C. However, Yang and Liu detected the presence of ZrO2 after a thermal treatment at 780 1C during 1 h of an Na3Zr2Si2PO12 powder synthesized by the sol–gel process. The results of this study indicate that a heat treatment carried out at temperatures of 200 1C higher than the crystallization temperature of the NaSICON phase led to the thermal decomposition of this compound.
One of the interests of the impedance spectroscopy resides in its capacity to separate the electric contributions from the matrix grains of NaSICON and the microstructural defects (grain boundary, second phases). 
When yo0.3, the geometrical pace of the impedance experimental diagrams is similar (Fig. 6). The contribution described at the low frequencies characterizes the response of the NaSICON/ electrode interface. 
In the absence of the second phase, the semicircle observed at average frequency translates the blocking effect of the charge carriers at the grain boundaries. At high frequencies, the impedance diagram, described partially according to the temperature measured, corresponds to the specific response of the matrix grains of NaSICON. For temperatures typically higher than 50 1C, this part is not described in the range of the experimental frequency (Fig. 6). However, the different values between the relaxation frequencies of the respective answers of the grains and the grain boundaries (corresponding to at least the imaginary part of each material contribution) allow a sufficient separation between the two electric contributions. Under these conditions, it is always possible to determine the resistance of the grains of the NaSICON phase by intercepts on the axis of extrapolation realities at high frequencies of the blocking contribution. 
Whatever the composition, the clear separation between the response of the grain boundaries and the electrode characteristic allows us to measure without any ambiguity the total resistance of a sample. As Fig. 7 shows, the presence of second phases (for example, insulating like ZrO2) and of a more significant porosity results in an additional contribution, which strongly interferes with the response of the ceramic grains. Under these conditions, respective resistances of the various material contributions could not be given with sufficient precision. The electric behavior of the samples D and E will be described, in the continuation, only starting from total conductivity.
The effect of blocking typically represents 40% of the total resistance of material for the samples A and B (Fig. 6). In the case of the sample C (y=0.225), 70% of the total resistive contribution of material is due to the blocking resistance. Taking into account the dominating influence of the microstructure on the amplitude of the blocking effect of the charge carriers, all comparison with other materials must be carried out with caution. 
The evolution of total conductivity (stot) in Arrhenius coordinates is represented in Fig. 8. The corresponding activation energy (Ea) is given in Table 1. For the studied compositions, Ea varies between 0.24 and 0.37 eV. These values are in agreement with the literature data for NaSICON conductors by sodiumions
From a general point of view, the reduction in the amount of zirconium is accompanied by a notable degradation of the electric properties of studied materials only for y values higher than 0.3 (Fig. 8) in general formula Na2.8Zr2-ySi1.8-4yP1.2+4yO12, in agreement with the results of Bohnke et al.. For example, the total conductivity at 27 1C is ten times less for sample E than for sample A (Table 1). In the absence of any precise conductivity determination of the ceramic grains when y40.3, it is not possible, at this stage of the study, to quantify the influence of the microstructure compared to the possible reduction in the concentration of charge carriers on the total variation stot. For samples D and E, the strong conductivity reduction can be mainly linked to an increase in porosity and the presence of second insulating phase ZrO2 .
For temperatures typically lower than 100 1C, the stot variations are lower than a factor of 2 when yo0.3. Bohnke et al. showed that the total conductivity ofNa3Zr2-x/4Si2-xP1+xO12 compounds decreases by a factor 4 when x varies between 0 and 1. In the same way, the total conductivity of dense ceramics (95% of the theoretical density) decreases by a factor of more than 10 between the samples Na3Zr1.833Si1.333P1.667O12 and Na3Zr1.667Si0.667P2.333O12.
The comparison of the grain and grain boundaries conductivities for compositions such as yo0.3 (Table 2) is also in favor of this assumption. Indeed, in absence of any modification of the chemical nature of the grain boundaries in these dense samples, the conduction properties in the grain volume and on the level of the grains must vary in a similar way. Thus, the conductivity values of the grain sg and the grain boundaries sjg decrease respectively by a factor of 1.5 and a factor of 2 at 50 1C when y varies between 0 and 0.075. 
On the other hand, when y increases from 0.075 to 0.225, sg increases by a factor of 4.5 whereas sjg is multiplied only by a factor of 1.5. This variation type was already observed for nanometric anion conductors (ZrO2–M2O3) whose blocking effect due to the grain boundaries is prevalent. It was interpreted in terms of the M3+ ions segregation to the grain boundaries. Under these conditions, the weak increase in sjg, compared to sg, could be connected to a Zr4+ ion segregation of the grain boundaries due to the presence of a vitreous phase without notable precipitation of ZrO2. An increase in the y value leads simultaneously to a more important variation of the zirconium concentration in the grain volume due to a vitreous phase and to ZrO2 precipitation. The total conductivity of material then decreases notably.
One of the significant parameters of the electric properties optimization for the studied compounds is the grain conductivity sg. As it was observed for the total conductivity stot, the sg value is a maximum for the Na2.8Zr1.775Si0.9P2.1O12 sample. In spite of an increase in the amplitude of the blocking effect due to the microstructural defects for y=0.225, the NaSICONtype compounds showing the best conductivities are the ones whose intragranular conductivities are the highest at temperatures lower than 100 1C.
The sol–gel method used allows us to synthesize the precursors of NaSICON-type compounds with general formula Na2.8Zr2-ySi1.8-yP1.2+yO12 at temperatures lower than 1000 1C. The relative densities higher than 90% of the theoretical density were reached for broad compositions range (0pyp0.225) by classical sintering at 1000 1C. The characterizations undertaken suggest that the sintering process implies a liquid phase at high temperature. For y values higher than 0.3, this liquid phase seems to induce the zirconia segregation of grain boundaries. The total electric conductivity strongly depends on the nature of the microstructural defects (grain boundary and additional phases). The highest total conductivity is obtained for the composition, which shows the strongest intragranular conductivity (y=0.225). The conductivity of this composition (y=0.225) should be improved increasing the density. These works are in progress and will be published in a future paper.
