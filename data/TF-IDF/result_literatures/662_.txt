Lithium ion conducting NASICON material of the form Li1.3Al0.3-xYxTi1.7(PO4)3 (where x = 0, 0.01 and 0.07)considered as promising electrolyte materials for solid state lithium ion batteries [1, 2] were synthesized via solid statereaction method.
The compound was found to have a rhombohedral symmetry with space group R-3c from the x-raydiffraction studies.
Further, a partial replacement of Y3+ in the lattice increased the lattice parameters.
The roomtemperature Li+ ion conductivity of the yttrium doped samples deduced from the impedance spectroscopy, in thefrequency range 20 MHz to 1 Hz is found to be ~ 10-5 S/cm.
The mode of ionic relaxation in grain boundary region wasfound to be different in yttrium doped samples compared to nominal composition.
Core level x-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) was performed for Al and P.
While Al was found to be in single coordination state, P was found topossess two coordination environment – both of which were in tetrahedral configuration.
Al MAS NMR studies suggested distortion at tetrahedral and octahedral sites due to partial replacement of Al3+ and Ti4+ cations by Y3+.
It wasfound that yttrium enhanced the overall density of the ceramic material – which however did not help increase the bulkLi+ ion conductivity due to blocking effect by aluminum and yttrium phases at grain boundary.
Yttrium doping decreases the overall Li+ ion conductivity (compared to nominal composition LATP) by distortingthe lattice within grain and also by accumulating as parasitic phases at grain boundaries.
However yttrium doping inoptimized LATP system leads to larger grain size, a higher density, a better sinterability and chemical stability of thematerial along with a reasonable Li+ -ion conductivity of ~ 10-5 S/cm which can prove to be good electrolytecandidate in solid state Li-ion batteries.
