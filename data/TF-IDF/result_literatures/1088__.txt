The sensing materials of potentiometric CO2 sensors utilize alkali/alkali-earth metal carbonates or their combinations. However, lithium carbonate easily responds to humidity resulting in incorrect information regarding CO2 concentration. Herein, the authors report a new sensing material combination (Li2CO3/BaCO3/LiOH/Ba(OH)2 (1:2:0.05:0.1 molar ratio)) for a potentiometric CO2 sensor that is not affected by humidity. The electromotive force (EMF) of the sensor using a combination of Li2CO3, BaCO3, LiOH, and Ba(OH)2 drifted by 1.5% when the relative humidity was changed from 25% to 70%, which is superior to a drift of 6% of a sensor using Li2CO3 and BaCO3, as this sensing material is known to be robust to changes in humidity.

International interest exists on CO2 sensing and the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere, mainly owing to global warming phenomena and climate change. Gas sensors have become commercialized and integrated into many types of instruments such as sensor nodes.1–4 An accurate and robust sensing of CO2 gas is needed to resolve the above issues internationally. There are several types of CO2 sensors including optical, semi-conductor, and potentiometric types. Owing to a high selectivity and the possibility of miniaturization, potentiometric CO2 sensors based on solid electrolytes have been intensively investigated.

A potentiometric CO2 sensor based on a solid electrolyte consists of a reference, a sensing material, and a solid electrolyte. The sensing material in this type of CO2 sensor has utilized alkali/alkali-earth metal carbonates or  1) is one of their combinations. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3 the most common examples of a sensing material. The lithium carbonate is decomposed into CO2 and O2 at a sensor operation temperature.

The decomposition reaction is affected by the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Lithium ions resulting from a decomposition reaction migrate through a sensing electrode to a reference electrode owing to the chemical potential, and generate an electric signal that can be converted into information on the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

However, Li2CO3 is known to be vulnerable to humidity, which provides incorrect information on the CO2 concentration. There have been several researches on developing potentiometric CO2 sensors that are not affected by environmental noise such as humidity. Researchers have applied a mixture of BaCO3 with Li2CO3 to overcome the humidity sensitivity of the sensing material.9–11 In addition, Dutta et al. reported that Li2CO3 coated by BaCO3 is effective in developing a CO2 sensor robust under humid conditions.12 The intentional decomposition of the sensing material by water under a harsh environment was found to be effective in stabilizing the sensor signal under various humidity conditions.13 Other research on the encapsulation of a sensing material with porous Al2O3 was reported to be an effective method for improving the durability during the operation of a CO2 sensor.

Herein, we report a new sensing material for a solid electrolyte CO2 sensor that is not affected by humidity, and describe the CO2 sensing results achieved using the new sensing material under various types of humid atmospheres. We demonstrate that the intentional addition of decomposed products of the sensing material by water vapor to the sensing material is effective in stabilizing the sensor signal under various humidity conditions.

The sensing and reference materials were prepared in paste form to deposit the materials on alumina substrates using a screen-printing method. The sensing materials were prepared into three compositions. Li2CO3 and BaCO3 were mixed at 1:0.2 and 1:2 ratios. The other sensing material was prepared by mixing Li2CO3/BaCO3 with LiOH/Ba (OH)2 as additives with a 1:2:0.05:0.1 molar ratio. The sensing materials were ground overnight, and mixed with a binder solution such as ethyl cellulose dissolved in alphaterpineol to make them into a paste.

The sensors were prepared by following a common sensor fabrication method based on alumina substrates.15 A 1 2)m thick Li3PO4 solid electrolyte was deposited onto the alumina substrate through thermal evaporation, followed by annealing at 700 C. Au electrodes for the reference and sensing sides were screen printed with a coplanar conﬁguration, and ﬁred at 700 C. The reference material consisting of Li2TiO3 with 5 mol% TiO2 was deposited on top of the reference electrode, followed by annealing at 700 C for 1 h. Finally, the sensing materials were screen printed on the other Au electrode, and annealed at 580 C for 1 h (Fig. 1).

The characteristics of the gas sensors were measured using a ﬂow-through technique at a constant ﬂow rate of 1,000 cm3/min in a tube furnace. The air was used as a balance gas, while a 10% CO2 gas was used as an analyte, and mixed with the balance gas to achieve a desired analyte concentration of 500 to 10,000 parts per million (ppm) using mass ﬂow controllers (MFCs). The responses of the sensors were investigated at concentrations of 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm, respectively, for 2 min in a sequential manner by monitoring the EMF. The recovery of the sensor was also investigated in reverse by decreasing the gas concentrations from 10,000 to 500 ppm.

Carbon-dioxide sensors based on a solid electrolyte have used single-carbonate compounds such as Li2CO3 and Na2CO3, or combinations of carbonates such as Li2CO3 with BaCO3 and Na2CO3 with CaCO3.

The combinations of carbonates have shown improvements of the sensor responses and the stability of the sensors against humidity variations.17 We investigated the optimum composition of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 for a humidity stability of the solid electrolyte CO2 sensors. The sensing materials were prepared using combinations of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 with 1:0.2 and 1:2 molar ratios, and their CO2 sensing behaviors were compared with that of simple Li2CO3 (Fig. 2). The CO2 sensor using Li2CO3 as the sensing material shows a  3)EMF/decade (mV) of 52 mV at C. However, CO2 sensors using mixtures of Li2CO3 500 and BaCO3 with 1:0.2 and 1:2 molar ratios show 62 mV and 60 mV, respectively. The combinations of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 were found to be more effective than Li2CO3 in terms of the sensor response ( 3)EMF/decade).

The characteristics of the sensors composed of different sensing materials were monitored under different humidity conditions (Fig. 3). The electromotive force (EMF) of the sensor using Li2CO3 at a 75% relative humidity (RH) was reduced by 20% compared with the EMF value at 20% RH. However, the combinations of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 (1:0.2 molar ratio) as the sensing materials showed decreases of less than 6% at 75% RH compared with the value at 20% RH. The sensing material composed of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 with a 1:2 molar ratio was the most robust against humidity variations of 20% to 75%. The EMF at 75% RH of a sensor using a combination of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 with a 1:2 molar ratio fell to 95% of the EMF value at 20% RH.

The sensor values drifting as much as 5% under humidity conditions of 20% to 75% RH may give incorrect CO2 concentration values because the sensor converts the EMF value into the CO2 concentration as below. where E is the electromotive force, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of reacted electrons, and F is the Faraday constant. Therefore, the development of a more robust sensing material against humidity is required to achieve an accurate CO2 sensor.

Based on a combination of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 with a 1:2 molar ratio, LiOH and Ba(OH)2 were added at 5 mol% with respect to the corresponding carbonate compounds, which were expected as by-products of the reactions between the carbonates and water vapor in the atmosphere. We expected that the intentional addition of a byproduct from a side reaction with the carbonates and water vapor would suppress the side reaction during the sensor operations. Kida et al. demonstrated that a CO2 sensor containing a by-product, Na3PO4, from a degradation reaction with NASICON (Na super-ionic conductor) and water exhibited stability under humid conditions.

The sensor composed of Li2CO3, BaCO3, LiOH, and Ba(OH)2 with a 1:2:0.05:0.1 molar ratio exhibited a sensor response of 58 mV/dec, which is comparable to the response (60 mV/dec) of the sensor consisting of Li2CO3 and BaCO3 with a 1:2 molar ratio (Fig. 4). The addition of LiOH and Ba(OH)2 did not change the sensor response, and showed a greater effect on the durability of the sensor signal to variations in humidity.

The sensor consisting of Li2CO3, BaCO3, LiOH, and Ba(OH)2 with a 1:2:0.05:0.1 molar ratio showed a slight EMF drift of within 1.5% in a humidity range of 25% to 70% (Fig. 5). A minimization of the EMF drift is considered useful for the development of an accurate potentiometric CO2 sensor.

We reported a sensing material combination for a solid electrolyte CO2 sensor that is not affected by humidity, and compared the CO2 sensing results using a new sensing material combination of Li2CO3/BaCO3/LiOH/Ba(OH)2 at a 1:2:0.05:0.1 molar ratio under various humidity conditions with the sensing results from known sensing materials. The sensor adopting the new sensing material combination exhibited a comparable response to a CO2 gas of 58 mV/dec, and demonstrated minimized EMF drifts of less than 1.5% under various humidity conditions of 25% to 70%. The long-term stability as an important factor for the real application of a sensor is under investigation. The new sensing material combination is expected to be utilized for an accurate and robust potentiometric CO2 sensor.
