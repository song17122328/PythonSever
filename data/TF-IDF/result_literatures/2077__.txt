The lithium conductors Li2FeTi(PO4)3 and Li2FeZr(PO4)3, synthesized by solid-state reaction and characterized by X-ray powder di4ractometry, were studied structurally at room temperature by neutron powder di4raction at high resolution (HRPD, ISIS Facility, U.K.). By trial-and-error and Rietveld re5nements (Rp 5 0.111, R(F2) 5 0.112), the 5rst compound (orb 5 8.6229(1), thorhombic c 5 23.9116(3) A_ ) was shown to have a complex superstructure sharing features of both the a and b NASICON-type phases of LiZr2(PO4)3. Four (001) layers of PO4 and (Fe, Ti)O6 polyhedra are present per unit-cell, and they are related both by 11 inversion centers (a structure) and by a glide planes (b structure). Ti41 and Fe31 order in the two interlayer regions, respectively. Owing to the structure complexity, only half of the lithium atoms could be re5ned in tetrahedral coordination with SLi+OT 5 1.99 A_ . (orthorhombic Pbna, Z 5 4; a 5 8.70559(8), Li2FeZr(PO4)3 b 5 8.78572(9), c 5 12.2202(1) A_ ) proved to be similar to bLiZr2(PO4)3; however, by Fourier synthesis and Rietveld re5nement (Rp 5 0.0618, R(F2) 5 0.0574) Li was located in a fully ordered tetrahedral con5guration with SLi+OT 5 2.01 A_ , instead of being disordered as in the b phase of LiZr2(PO4)3.

In the search for new materials to be employed either as electrodes or as solid electrolytes in rechargeable lithium the NASICON-type system Li1‘xM@MA batteries (PO4)3 has been playing a major role for several years (2}4). Improving the electrical and electrochemical performances of such materials requires a full knowledge of the atomistic mechanisms of lithium transport, and hence of the crystal structure details of the phases involved, with a special stress on the coordination environment and order}disorder state of lithium atoms.

With this aim, a research program was undertaken to elucidate the structural properties of this complex system by the technique of high-resolution neutron powder di!raction. As a "rst step, LiZr2(PO4)3 was reconsidered and the structural aspects of its polymorphism were fully clari"ed (5}7), so as to account for the di!erent ionic conductivities of its four modi"cations on an atomistic basis. In particular, 3 (Oc"ZrO6 octaall polymorphs contain slabs of Oc2 hedron, „"PO4 tetrahedron) units with orientations (102) and (001) in the high-temperature polymorphs a (trigonal R31 c) and b (orthorhombic Pbna1), respectively. The a and b structures di!er simply by the way the slabs are stacked: adjacent layers are related by 11 inversion centeres in the former case, and by a glide planes in the latter; in both cases the interlayer link is provided by some O atoms shared between Oc and „ units belonging to neighboring slabs. Lithium ions are located in a disordered manner at the interface between slabs.

No account of the latter structure, however, was reported to our knowledge. Recently, the compounds Li2M@MA(PO4)3 with M@, MA"Fe, Ti, Zr were presented (14), showing that some of them would present a Pbca unit-cell similar to that referred to above. Some preliminary electrical conductivity measurements on these componds have also been reported (15).

In the frame of our research on lithium conductors, a structural study of Li2FeTi(PO4)3 and Li2FeZr(PO4)3 by high-resolution neutron powder di!raction has been carried out, with the aim of determining the crystal structure of the phase with Pbca symmetry and locating the extra-lithium atoms with respect to the usual NASICON-type phases. Results of conductivity measurements by complex impedence spectroscopy on these materials are reported elsewhere (16).

EXPERIMENTAL (F.W."402.543) and Li2FeZr(PO4)3 (F.W."445.863) were synthesized by solid-state reaction (14), starting from reagent grade Li2CO3, NH4H2PO4, Fe2O3, and TiO2 or ZrO2 mixed in stoichiometric ratios. The samples were put in a Pt boat and heated for 4 h at 6003C in a tubular furnace; then they were ground and pelletized and heated for 8 h at 10903C. Powder X-ray di!ractometry (Bruker D8 Advance apparatus with h}h geometry, CuKa radiation, graphite monochromator on the di!racted beam) was used to characterize the compounds obtained, with the following experimental conditions: "xed divergence (0.53), scattering (0.53), and detector (0.033) slits, counting time 10 s/step, step width *(2h)"0.023. The Li2FeZr(PO4)3 sample proved to be pure b-type ortho-

rhombic Pbna phase, with the following unit-cell constants: a"8.693(2), b"8.774(2), c"12.208(2) A_ . Li2FeTi(PO4)3 turned out also to be single-phase, and its X-ray powder pattern (Fig. 1) was indexed by identifying superlattice Bragg peaks corresponding to a doubled c cell edge, in addition to peaks analogous to those observed in the previous compound. The unit-cell parameters were leastsquares re"ned on the basis of the 2h values of 25 peaks, using a homemade computer routine, and obtaining the following values: a"8.557(3), b"8.624(3), c"23.919(6) A_ . Systematic absences were consistent with space group Pbca; the list of observed and calculated dhkl values, and of the relative Bragg intensities, is given in Table 1.

Neutron di!raction data were collected on the time-of#ight High Resolution Powder Di!ractometer (HRPD), equipped with a furnace, at the ISIS spallation pulsed source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, U.K.). For each of the two compounds, a 2 cm3 sample was put in a vanadium can under vacuum. By use of the backscattering counter bank at 2h"168.33, full intensity pro"les were recorded in the dhkl range 0.7 to 2.5 A_ (instrumental resolution *d/d+4]10~4) at room temperature. A preliminary data reduction was performed, including merging of outputs from single counters in the bank and correction for detector e$ciency as a function of neutron wavelength.

All computations, including the Rietveld re"nements, were performed by the GSAS computer package (17). Chebyshev polynomials of "rst kind with 12 coe$cients were used to model the intensity background, and the peak shape was represented by the convolution of a pseudo-Voigt

The crystal structure of Li2FeZr(PO4)3 was re"ned straightforwardly (except for Li atoms) in space group Pbna, on the base of isostructurality with the b phase. At convergence, di!erence Fourier atoms showed the presence of the missing Li atom in an ordered position with full occupancy, which was included in the re"nement. The re"ned occupancies of Fe and Zr in the only available site did not deviate signi"cantly from the nominal value 0.5, so that they were kept "xed. Re"nement results are reported in Table 2, and the atomic coordinates and displacement factors are in Table 4. The experimental, calculated, and di!erence di!raction pro"les are shown in Fig. 2.

occupancies of Fe and Ti in the two available independent "0.120. At this stage, a di!erpositions, was attained at R1 ence Fourier map was computed in order to locate lithium atoms. Only one negative peak (b(Li)"!0.21]10~12 cm) with satisfactory distances to neighboring atoms appeared; the corresponding Li1 atom was included in the re"nement, and the "nal cycles converged to results reported in Tables 2 and 3. The experimental, calculated, and di!erence di!raction pro"les are shown in Fig. 2.

The crystal structure of Li2FeZr(PO4)3 (Fig. 3) is based on a superlattice of the b orthorhombic unit-cell, whose c edge is doubled. The four (001) slabs contained in the supercell are related in pairs by the a glide plane (as in the b phase) and by the 11 inversion center (as in the a phase), so that the overall arrangement can be de"ned as a superstructure of both the a and b con"gurations. The coexistence of both structural patterns in the same unit-cell proves that a very subtle energetic balance controls the relative stability of the a and b NASICON-type modi"cations. An important role is probably played, in this respect, by Li atoms which are located at the interface between slabs and thus contribute to the interlayer binding. The twofold pseudo-symmetry is not consistent with the real symmetry, in the sense that there is no supergroup of space group Pbca which would contain that symmetry operation. This is peculiar to the present structure, because in the a@ and b@ cases the pseudotwofold axis corresponds to a real symmetry axis in the more symmetrical a and b phases.

There is a slight overall unbalance of chemical composition, as total Fe and Ti are 1.075 and 0.925 atoms, respectively, from the nominal stoichiometry (Table 3). We believe that this is related to di$culties in re"ning the parameters of site 1’ (cf. the very large e.s.d.’s of Fe@, Ti@ atomic coordinates), which are due to the peculiarly unfavorable composition of the site with respect to neutron scattering lengths. As b(Fe)"0.954 and b(Ti)"!0.344]10~12 cm, a composition of site 1@ with o.f.(Ti) ranging from 0.67 to 0.74 would give a b value for that site in the range 0.086 to !0.020]10~12 cm, i.e., very close to zero. This brings about a very small contribution to total scattering from site 1’, causing in turn larger than usual uncertainties of the related structural parameters. Such di$culties add to the noteworthy complexity of the present crystal structure and to signi"cant correlations between structural parameters due to pseudosymmetry, so as to explain the larger R values (Table 1) and di!erences between experimental and calculated pro"les (Fig. 2) with respect to those obtained for Li2FeZr(PO4)3 and for the polymorphs of LiZr2(PO4)3 (5}7). This may also account for the failure to locate all lithium atoms in the unit-cell.

An insight into the crystal-chemical meaning of bond lengths ri (Table 5) is favored by consideration of the corre"exp sponding bond valences [(r0 is an empirical parameter related i to the pair of chemical species (21). The most striking feature which di!erentiates the two pseudo-symmetrical moieties of the asymmetric unit is the bonding of O5 and O5@. These oxygen atoms bridge pairs of adjacent slabs related by the a plane and pairs related by the inversion center, respectively; O5 is bonded to Li1, while O5’ has no lithium bonding. The ensuing underbonding of O5’ is only partially compensated by a much shorter P}O bond length (1.47(1) A_ for P1@}O5@ against 1.62(1) A_ for P1}O5), so that the corresponding sums of bond valences give 1.79 e (O5@) and 1.87 e (O5). Interestingly, both O atoms are still underbonded: this supports our belief (cf. above) that the missing lithium is preferentially accumulated in the interlayer region close to inversion centers and to O5@ atoms, but is also present in minor amounts in the other interlayer region where the a glide plane and the O5 atoms are present. The Li1 atom has a distorted tetrahedral coordination with quite regular Li}O bond distances, so that its bond valence balance closes up to 0.99 e.

The content of two unit-cells of the crystal structure of Li2FeZr(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 4, so as to make the comparison with the superstructure of the Fe, Ti compound (Fig. 3) easier. All parallel slabs are related by a glide planes, and interlayer inversion centers are absent. Interatomic distances and O}Li}O angles are reported in Table 6. Li

Indeed, the only Li atom located in the structure lies right in the neighborhood of the a glide plane. However, this accounts only for half of the lithium content in the unit-cell, according to nominal chemical composition. The missing lithium should probably be located mostly in the hollows surrounding the inversion centers (cf. the structure of a@LiZr2(PO4)3 (5)). A couple of minor broad negative peaks (with height of !0.13]10~12 cm) were actually present in that region of the last Fourier map, with fractional coordinates 0.42, 0.10, 0.01 and 0.17, 0.39, 0.10. However, in each case a too short distance (1.3 A_ ) with an O atom was observed, and it was not possible to re"ne their positions.

A new structural type has been determined and characterized by neutron di!raction in the family of NASICON-like FIG. 3. Crystal structure of Li2FeTi(PO4)3, projected onto the (100) plane. The PO4 tetrahedra, (Fe, Ti)O6 octahedra, and Li atoms (spheres) are
