Single crystals of the title compound, aluminium niobium triphosphate, Al0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3, have been synthesized by a high-temperature reaction in a platinium crucible. The AlIII and NbV atoms occupy the same site on the 3 axis, with disorder in the ratio of 1:3. The fundamental building units of the title structure are isolated Al/NbO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra (. 2 symmetry), which are further interlocked by corner-sharing O atoms, leading to a three-dimensional framework structure with infinite channels along the a axis.

The mixed phosphates AM2(PO4)3 family (A = alkali metals; M = Ti, Zr, Ge, Sn) which usually belong to the NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12: Boilot, et al., 1987) or the NZP (NaZr2(PO4)3: Hong, 1976) structure-type have been extensively investigated for the low thermal expansion behavior of some members. The crystal structure that features a flexible three-dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra sharing comers with MO6 octahedra, is amenable to a wide variety of chemical substitutions at the various crystallographic positions, thus yielding a large number of closely related compounds, such as Na3MgZr(PO4)3 (Chakir, et al., 2006), Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (Masquelier, et al., 2000), NaFeNb(PO4)3 (Zatovskii, et al., 2006), NaTi2(PO4)3 (Rodrigo, et al., 1989) and NaGe2P3O12 (Zhao et al., 2009). The three-dimensional network consisting of PO4 and MO6 octahedra delimit two different types of channels in which the A atoms are usually located to compensate the negative charges. It is reported that the A atoms can completely empty in some areas, such as Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 (Trubach, et al., 2004) and Fe0.5Sb1.5(PO4)3 (Aatiq & Bakri, 2007), Nb2(PO4)3(Leclaire, et al.,1989) and Fe0.5Ti2(PO4)3(Benmokhtar, et al., 2007), etc. In order to inrich this type of compounds, we synthesis the compound Al0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 by a high-temperature reaction and determine the crystal structure from single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the asymmetric unit of Al0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 contains a single P and Al/Nb atoms. The P atom is four coordinated by four oxygen atoms, forming isolated PO4 tetrahedron. Al and Nb atoms are in mixed occupancy disorder locating at the 3 axes with the moral ratio of 1: 3, being coordinated by six oxygen atoms to form Al/NbO6 octahedra. Al/NbO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are further interconnected via corner-sharing O atoms to form the three-dimensional framework of Al0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3, as shown in Fig. 2. The Al/Nb—O bonds have two groups of different distances, that is, 1.913 (3) and 1.949 (3) Å. The PO4 tetrahedra are regular with two groups of P–O bond distances of 1.521 (3) and 1.529 (3) Å, and O–P–O bond angles weak dispersion from 107.91 (16) to 111.3 (2)o, which is about the ideal value of 109.48°. On the other hand, this structure can be viewed as a NZP structure, in which the Na atom sites empty and the Zr atoms site are replaced by Al and Nb atoms in disordered manner on the principle of aliovalent pair combination Zr4+ → 0.25 A l3+ + 0.73 N b5+.

The finely ground reagents K2CO3, Al2O3, Nb2O5 and NH4H2PO4 were mixed in the molar ratio K: Al: Nb: P = 1: 3: 10: 20, were placed in a Pt crucible, and heated at 573 K for 4 h. The mixture was then re-ground and heated at 1473 K for 20 h, then cooled to 973 K at a rate of 3 K h-1, and finally quenched to room temperature. A few colorless crystals of the title compound with prismatic shape were obtained.

The structure contains substitutional disorder in which Al1 and Nb1 occupy the same position. The atomic positional and anisotropic displacement parameters of Al1 and Nb1 atoms were constrained to be identical by using EADP and EXYZ constraint instructions (SHELXL97; Sheldrick, 2008). The ratio of Al1 and Nb1 was fixed to 1: 3 to achieve charge balance.

All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes. Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating Rfactors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
