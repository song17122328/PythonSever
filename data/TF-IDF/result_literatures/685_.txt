Solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical stability are of prime significance toenable the application of solid-state batteries in energy storage and conversion.
In this study, solid compositepolymer electrolytes (CPEs) based on sodium bis(trifluorosulfonyl) imide (NaTFSI) and poly (ethylene oxide)(PEO) incorporated with active ceramic filler (NASICON) are reported for the first time.
With the addition ofNASICON fillers, the thermal stability and electrochemical stability of the CPEs are improved.
A high conductivityof 2.8 mS/cm (at 80 °C) is readily achieved when the content of the NASICON filler in the compositepolymer reaches 50 wt%.
Furthermore, Na3V2(PO4)3/CPE/Na solid-state batteries using this composite electrolytedisplay good rate and excellent cycle performance.
In summary, a flexible composite polymer electrolyte composed ofNASICON and NaTFSI-PEO14 has been obtained via solution castmethod.
A high ionic conductivity of 2.8 mS/cm can be achieved at80 °C.
The composite polymer electrolytes are also found to exhibitgood thermal stability and electrochemical stability.
The NVP/CPE/Nasolid-state cells assembled with the composite polymer electrolytesdeliver high reversible capacity and maintain good capacity retention at80 °C.
This verifies the promising prospect of using composite polymerelectrolytes in developing high safe and high energy density batteries.
