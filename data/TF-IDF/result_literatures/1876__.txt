Among  crystalline  zirconium  compounds  of  complex  composition,  framework  orthophosphates  of  the type ( Zr PO , where   = 1/   ( ) M z x M 3 4 2 x cation)  have  been  studied  in  sufﬁcient  detail  to  date. The structure of these compounds consists of a mixed  framework formed by discrete zirconium Zr PO [ ( ) ] 3 3 4 2 octahedra and phosphate tetrahedra (the discreteness of coordination polyhedra is governed by the cation ratio Zr : P = 2 : 3 [1]). In framework structures of this type, it  is  possible  to  distinguish  a  characteristic  fragment (unit) [Zr ], which is formed by two zirconium– (PO ) 3 4 2 oxygen octahedra linked together by three bridging tetrahedra (a “lantern”). The number of structural types in which  the    phosphates  can  crystallize Zr PO ( ) M 3 4 2 x depends on the character of the joining of these groupings and is limited under the condition of discreteness of the coordination polyhedra.
The  packing  of  fragments  in  the  above  modiﬁcations determines the number and type of holes in their structures.  In  the  trigonal  or  rhombohedral  structure, 1 and  there exist holes of the  2 types, which correM   and  18 spond  to  the  6   crystallographic  positions, e b respectively. The  1 holes are formed by lateral trigoM nal faces of two adjacent lanterns of the same column and have the shape of a distorted octahedron (the coordination  polyhedron  is  a  trigonal  antiprism,  and  the 2 coordination number is 6). Larger sized holes of the  M type are located between the adjacent columns around 2 1  holes.  The  quantitative  ratio  between  the  the  M and  1 holes is 3 : 1 in accordance with the chemical formula  of  compounds  with  an  NZP-type  structure:  is the position occupied ( L M by zirconium with a coordination number of 6 in the framework. 
In the structure of monoclinic phosphates, holes in the framework have the shape of a distorted tetrahedron (the coordination number is 4) [20]. An analysis of the structural features of the known rhombohedral  and  monoclinic  modiﬁcations  shows  that  com  =  0.71–1.67  Å) pounds  with  large-sized  cations  ( r kt crystallize with the formation of an NZP-type structure in which cations have a more favorable octahedral coordination.  Phosphates  with  singly  or  doubly  charged  = 0.57–0.66 Å) small-sized compensating cations ( r kt predominantly crystallize with the formation of a monoclinic structure. For these cations, the tetrahedral environment of oxygen atoms is most preferable.
At the same time, a number of multiply charged cations, such as magnesium, scandium, lanthanide, zirconium, and other cations (  = 0.72–1.03 Å), can fulﬁll r kt a  framework-forming  function.  As  regards  multiply charged  cations  of  smaller  sizes,  they  fulﬁll  only  a framework-forming  function  in  compounds  with  the Zr  framework. The question of their possiPO ( [ ) ] 3 3 4 2 ble incorporation into holes remains open.
In the present work, we synthesized iron zirconium phosphate of the composition Fe  and eluciZr PO ( ) 4 3 2 dated the role played by iron in the structure formation. [22,  23],  Earlier  in  xFex(PO4)3 iron phosphates, iron and zircoZr Na 2  1 +  x nium play the role of a framework-forming cation.
The  iron  zirconium  phosphate  Fe1/3Zr2(PO4)3  was synthesized by the sol–gel technique [24]. The initial reactants used in the synthesis were 1 M aqueous solutions  of  iron  chloride  FeCl3,  zirconium  oxychloride ZrOCl2, and orthophosphoric acid H3PO4. All the reactants  were  chemically  pure.  The  synthesis  was  performed in several stages. At the ﬁrst stage, phosphoric acid  (in  the  amount  calculated  from  the  reaction  stoichiometry) was slowly added with vigorous continuous stirring to a mixture of aqueous solutions of iron chloride and zirconium oxychloride taken in stoichiometric amounts. The gel formed was dried at a temperature of 85 176) C for 24 h, ground in an agate mortar, and heat treated at T = 600, 800, and 1000 176) C (the heat treatment time at each temperature was one or two days). Each annealing stage alternated with dispersion.
The compound synthesized was identiﬁed and then studied using a combination of physicochemical methods, such as electron probe microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray structure analyses. The electron probe microanalysis was carried out on a Camebax microanalyzer equipped with a Link AN-100 energy-dispersive detector. The compositions were  calculated  by  the  ZAF  correction  method  (the accuracy in determining the composition was equal to 2.5 mol %). The IR absorption spectrum of the sample prepared in the form of a ﬁnely disperse ﬁlm on a KBr substrate was recorded on a Specord-75 IR spectrophotometer  in  the  frequency  range  1800–400  cm–1.  The phase composition of the sample in the course of the synthesis was checked using X-ray powder diffraction analysis (DRON-2.0 diffractometer, ﬁltered C 238)Ka  radiation). The structure was reﬁned on an ADP-2 diffractometer (l CuKa ; Ni ﬁlter; 2q  scan mode; step width, 0.02¡; exposure time, 10 s). 
The X-ray diffraction patterns were processed according to the WYRIET (version 3.3) software package [25]. The peak proﬁles were approximated  by  the  Pearson VII  function.  The  peak asymmetry was reﬁned in the range 2q  < 60¡. The ion scattering curves were used for all elements. The crystal  structure  was  reﬁned  by  progressively  adding reﬁned parameters with continuous graphic simulation of the background until the R factors became equal to a constant value.
The sample prepared had the form of a yellow powder. As follows from the X-ray powder diffraction data, the crystalline product was formed at a temperature of 800 176) C (after heat treatment at 600 176) C for 48 h, the sample remained X-ray amorphous).
According to the electron probe microanalysis, the composition  of  the  sample  was  as  follows  (wt  %): Fe2O3, 5.46; ZrO2, 45.35; and P2O5, 44.04 (S  = 94.85). This  composition,  when  expressed  in  terms  of  12  O– anions, corresponds to iron zirconium phosphate of the chemical  formula  Fe0.34Zr1.85P3O12,  which  is  close  to the calculated formula Fe1/3Zr2P3O12.
An analysis of the X-ray diffraction data obtained revealed the similarity of the structure of the iron zirconium phosphate under investigation to the structure of the  nickel  zirconium  phosphate  Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3  (structural type of scandium tungstate Sc2(WO4)3) [12]. On this basis, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample was indexed in space group P21/n.
For the F 229)1/3Zr2( 144) 142)4)3 samples subjected to either isothermal treatment at 800 176) C for a day or short-term treatment (for a few hours) at 1000 176) C, the X-ray diffraction  the a -(ZrO)2P2O7  and  ZrP2O7  crystalline  phases  and  an unidentiﬁed  the F 229)1/3Zr2( 144) 142)4)3 phosphate undergoes decomposition.
The results obtained suggest that the F 229)1/3Zr2( 144) 142)4)3 and  Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compounds  (monoclinic  unit  cell, space group P21/n) are isostructural to each other. Both compounds contain a complex radical anion, namely, [Zr2(PO4)3]. Consequently, the crystal structure of iron zirconium phosphate, like nickel zirconium phosphate, involves a three-dimensional mixed framework of the Sc2(WO4)3 (S) type [12]. In the structure of these compounds, the framework is formed by isolated zirconium octahedra  and  phosphorus  tetrahedra  joined  through their vertices. Each zirconium octahedron is bound to six phosphorus tetrahedra (Fig. 2) [27]. In the framework, holes have the shape of a distorted tetrahedron and  are  partially  occupied  by  trivalent  iron  cations (Table  2).  
It  should  be  noted  that  phosphate  with  an S-type framework in which holes contain triply charged cations with a radius smaller than the radius of cations in known compounds with a similar structure [18–20] is synthesized for the ﬁrst time.
In  the  structure  of  iron  zirconium  phosphate,  the polyhedra are slightly distorted: the P–O bond lengths fall in the range 1.49–1.58 Å, the Zr–O bond lengths lie in  the  range  1.98–2.15  Å,  and  their  mean  values  are close to standard values (Table 3). The interatomic distances  in  zirconium–oxygen  and  phosphorus–oxygen polyhedra in the iron zirconium phosphate under investigation  are  close  to  those  in  the  Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compound studied previously: the differences in the interatomic distances are within the limits of experimental error.
Thus,  our  experimental  results  demonstrate  that polyhedra in the [Zr2(PO4)3] anionic frameworks of the Fe1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compounds are characterized  by  similar  insigniﬁcant  distortions.  This implies that the difference in the nature (sizes, charges) of cations located in holes of the S-type structures virtually do not affect distortions of the S framework.
As regards the nearest oxygen environment of these cations (nickel, iron), the reﬁned data indicate that the maximum  differences  between  the  M–O  distances  in the iron–oxygen tetrahedra FeO4 are somewhat larger than  tetrahedra: D (FeO)max =  0.45  Å  and D (Ni—O)max  =  0.37  Å.  It  is obvious  that  the  FeO4  tetrahedra  are  distorted  to  a greater extent. Judging from the results of the structure reﬁnement of the phosphate studied and the available data  for  the  Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compound,  the  crystal chemical formula for the iron zirconium phosphate can be represented in the form Fe1/3[Zr2(PO4)3].
From  analyzing  the Fe1/3[Zr2(PO4)3] compound (Fig. 3), we can draw the conclusion that this phosphate belongs to the class of orthophosphates. The bands in the range 1215–930 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations and the bands in the range 640–435 cm–1 are attributed to the bending vibrations of the P–O bonds in phosphorus tetrahedra. The positional symmetry of the PO4 ionic complex in the structure with space group P21/n (C2h) lowers from Td  to  C1. The  data  presented  in Table  4  illustrate  the changeover from a regular tetrahedron with Td symmetry to a tetrahedron with C1 symmetry and then to the factor  group  C2h. As  the  symmetry  of  the  PO4  ionic complex  is  reduced  to  C1,  the  n 1  inactive  symmetric vibrations  become  active.  The  degeneracy  of  doubly (E)  and  triply  (F2)  degenerate  vibrations  is  removed. 
Two  bands  should  be  attributed  to  the  n 2  symmetric stretching  vibrations,  and  three  bands  should  correspond to the n 3 asymmetric stretching vibrations and n 4 asymmetric bending vibrations. The changeover to the factor group C2h leads to separation of vibrations into symmetric  (g)  and  asymmetric  (u)  vibrations  with respect to the inversion center. For three independent positions of phosphorus in the unit cell, the number of bands  is  trebled.  Since  the  bands  of  g  vibrations  are observed  only  in  the  Raman  spectra,  the  IR  spectra should  involve  three  bands  of  the  n 1  vibrations,  six bands of the n 2 vibrations, nine bands of the n 3 vibrations, and nine bands of the n 4 vibrations.
In the IR spectrum, six out of the nine bands allowed by the selection rules (1215–1035 cm–1) are attributed to  the n 3  asymmetric  stretching  vibrations. The  highfrequency bands assigned to the P–O vibrations at 1215 and 1150 cm–1 are not characteristic of orthophosphates and can be explained by the contribution from the electron  density  of  (small-sized,  multiply  charged)  Zr4+ ions to the P–O (Zr) bond, which results in large force constants  of  this  bond.  The  n 1  symmetric  stretching vibrations are represented by two (out of three allowed) bands at 975 and 932 cm-1. In the range of the n 4 asymmetric bending vibrations (937–553 cm–1), the IR spectrum  contains  four  bands.  The  band  at  435  cm–1  is assigned to the n 2 symmetric stretching vibrations. The other lower frequency bands of the n 2 vibrations cannot be  recorded  on  the  spectrophotometer  used.  
The  IR spectrum described above is similar to the IR spectra of zirconium  orthophosphates  with  bivalent  d  elements and magnesium, which crystallize in space group P21/n [28]. Since Fe3+ ions occupy their positions in the structure incompletely and statistically, the IR spectrum of the  Fe1/3[Zr2(PO4)3]  compound  is  more  diffuse  (contains more poorly resolved bands) than the IR spectra of zirconium and bivalent d metal phosphates.
Thus, the results of the complex investigation of a new phosphate, namely, Fe1 /3Zr2(PO4)3, and their comparison with the data available in the literature on the structure formation of known framework phosphates of the MxZr2(PO4)3 family allowed us draw the following inferences. (1)  The  iron  zirconium  phosphate  Fe1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which was synthesized and studied in this work, complemented the class of known double zirconium phosphates  of  the  general  formula  MxZr2(PO4)3  with  a framework  structure,  including  those  crystallizing  in the structural type of scandium tungstate. (2)  The  phosphate  with  an  S-type  framework  in which holes are occupied by triply charged cations was synthesized for the ﬁrst time. (3) The minimum radius of M compensating cations in MxZr2(PO4)3 phosphates is determined by the radius of Fe3+ cations and is equal to 0.49 Å. Previously, the minimum size of M cations was thought to correspond to the radius of Mg2+ cations and assumed to be equal to 0.57 Å.
