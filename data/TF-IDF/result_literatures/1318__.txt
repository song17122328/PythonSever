Tin-based materials have been demonstrated to be a promising alternative to carbon for use as a negative-electrode material  1, as because of their high theoretical capacity of 990 mAh g  1 for graphite. However, the one major compared to 372 mAh g problem that prevents their use in commercial applications is that they undergo large volume changes during cycling, which results in disintegration of the electrodes and subsequent rapid capacity fading [1e4]. One of the effective strategies is to Ô¨Ånely disperse tin into an inactive matrix. This matrix can be an electronic conductive metal, M, or ionic conductive materials such as Li2O and Li2S. The lithium alloying reaction typically occurs as follows: SnM √æ xLi ¬º LixSn √æ M where M is a metallic element, for example, Cu or Co

SnM‚Äô √æ √∞x √æ y√ûLi ¬º LixSn √æ LiyM‚Äô where M0 is a nonmetallic element, for example, O or S. The ‚Äúinactive phase M‚Äù is mainly to play the role of a ‚Äúmatrix-glue‚Äù to hold the particles together and to provide a matrix that will absorb the massive volume changes occur within the electrode during the lithiation (expansion)/delithiation (contraction) process, thereby improving the cycling performance of the anode material compared to pure Sn.

Based on this principle, many types of ‚ÄúSn/matrix‚Äù systems have been investigated in recent years, such as tin composite oxide (TCO) glasses [5,6], SnSO4 [7], SneCoeC [8,9], SnS2 [10], Cu6Sn5 [11] and CoSn [12]. The results from these works show that the matrix has a great effect on the electrochemical performance of tin composites.

In SnO2, the Li2O matrix formed during the Ô¨Årst discharging cycle deÔ¨Ånitely binds, to some extent, the lithiumetin regions together and smoothes the large volume changes associated with alloying and dealloying during reversible charge and discharge reactions [13,14]. The situation in chlorides and sulÔ¨Ådes is almost

the same, and Li2S seems to be a better matrix material than Li2O because of the higher Li ion conductivity. However, capacity fading upon cycling is still observed, which is most likely caused by the aggregation of tin atoms into clusters with the growth in size [15,16].

It is suggested that a proper matrix should keep the tin well dispersed during cycling while simultaneously having good Li ion conductivity. Li3PO4, which has a Li ion conductivity of  1, is a promising matrix material with better 8.62  10 properties than Li2O. Recent work reported by Lu‚Äôs group shows improved cyclability of LiGe2(PO4)3 compared to GeO2 [17].  1 at LiGe2(PO4)3 possesses a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g  1 and a good capacity retena charge/discharge rate of 150 mA g tion of 92% after 25 cycles, compared to 28% for GeO2. These results suggest that Li3PO4 should be a more stable conductive matrix than Li2O for buffering the volume expansion during the Li-alloy process. However, according to Irvine‚Äôs work, the Li3PO4 used in tin phosphate-based anodes showed unsatisfying performance [18].

In this work, which focuses on improving the electrochemical performance of tin phosphate, a systematic study of the synthesis and electrochemistry process of LiSn2(PO4)3 was presented. The NASICON-structured LiSn2(PO4)3, which has good cyclability when using nano-SnO2 as precursor, was prepared using a solid-state reaction. Additionally, the insertion/extraction mechanism and the thermal stability of LiSn2(PO4)3 were investigated through exsitu X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements.

lithium carbonate anhydrous (Li2CO3, 98%), diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4, >98%) and ethanol were analytical reagents purchased from the Shanghai Chemical Company. All chemicals were used as received without further puriÔ¨Åcation. Deionized water was used in all experiments.

The nano-SnO2 precursor was prepared according to a reported hydrothermal method [19]. A solid-state method was used to prepare LiSn2(PO4)3. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, nano-SnO2, and (NH4)2HPO4 were thoroughly mixed and calcined in an aluminium oxide crucible at various temperatures between 700 C and 1000 C in air for 10 h. The obtained powder was ground before each measurement.

The particle morphologies and sizes were characterized using a JEOL JSM6390 scanning electron microscope (SEM). For the SEM examination of the electrodes following charge/discharge, the electrode Ô¨Ålms were washed using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and then dried in a vacuum at room temperature prior to characterization [20,21]. Thermogravimetric (TG) measurements and differential thermal analysis (DTA) was performed using a Per 1 kineElmer TGA 7 thermal analyzer at a heating rate of 10 C min  1 Ô¨Çow of air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were in a 40 mL min recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer at a scan rate of 0.2 deg sec

The changes in the crystal structure of LiSn2(PO4)3 during charge/discharge were investigated using ex-situ X-ray diffraction. The air-sensitive samples, at various charged states, were prepared

inside a glove box by carefully opening the cells and then placing the products onto a glass sample-holder with an Al foil covering. The diffraction patterns were recorded under dynamic vacuum to avoid undesirable reactions with air. The obtained XRD data were analyzed using the Material Data Jade 5.0 software.

Electrochemical tests were performed in a CR2016-type coin cell. Metallic lithium was used as the negative electrode. The working electrodes were prepared by mixing 80% sample powders, 10% carbon black, and 10% polyvinylidene Ô¨Çuoride (PVDF) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP). The slurries of the mixture were applied to a Cu foil. After coating, the electrodes were dried at 80 C for 10 min to remove the solvent before pressing. The electrodes were cut into sheets 1 cm2 in area, vacuum-dried at 100 C for 24 h and then weighed before assembly. The typical mass load of the  2. The cell assembly active material was approximately 8 mg cm was operated in a glove box (model 100G, MBraun, Germany) Ô¨Ålled with pure argon that had a moisture and oxygen pressure below 0.1 ppm. The electrolyte solution was 1 M LiPF6/ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1 by volume). The cells were assembled with the as-prepared cathodes, lithium metal anodes, and separators made from a Celgard 2300 Ô¨Ålm. The chargeedischarge experiments were performed using  1 between 2.0 V and 0.0 V a constant current density of 100 mA g with a LAND CT2001A Battery Cycler (Wuhan, China). Lithium insertion into the working electrode was referred to as discharge, and the extraction was referred to as charge. The cell capacity was determined by only the active material.

Lithium-ions transfer at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in a three-electrode cell. The experiment was using a Solartron Instrument model no.1287 electrochemical interface and 1255B frequency response analyzer in the frequency range between 1000 kHz and 0.01 Hz at different lithium intercalation states. The AC oscillation was 5 mV, and all of the tests were performed at 25 C. The cell was charged or dis 1). Then, the charged to a given potential at 0.25 C (100 mA g potential was maintained for 2 h to fully reduce polarization before testing [22].

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using a powder microelectrode to evaluate the apparent diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient of the Li ion (DLi) at 25 C. The preparation of the powder microelectrode which contains a groove with a diameter of 100 mm and 5 mm in depth was described in our previous work [23]. Before the electrochemical tests, the prepared powder microelectrode was compacted with the electrode material powder (LiSn2(PO4)3) by grinding for 15 min to serve as a working electrode. Lithium-metal foils were used as the counter and reference electrodes. The electrolyte solution was 1 M LiPF6/ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1 by volume). The cell was assembled into a glass container inside of an argon-Ô¨Ålled glove box for the cyclic voltammetry tests. The series of experiments were conducted using different scan rates with a Solartron Instrument model 1287 controlled by a computer.

For the DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measurements, the cells were cycled 5 times to reach a stable capacity and ended at 0 V when the cathode discharged to a fully lithiated state. The cells were disassembled in a glove box. Approximately 2 mg of the electrode materials were scraped from the copper current-collector without removing the electrolyte. The obtained materials along

with the same amount of electrolyte were transferred and sealed into a high-pressure stainless-steel pan with a gold-plated copper seal. The DSC scans were performed using a DSC 200 F3 instrument  1. The (NETZSCH, Germany) with a scanning rate of 10 C min weights of DSC pans were measured before and after the DSC measurements to guarantee that there was no leakage during the experiment [24].

To investigate the effect of the heat-treatment temperature on the synthesis of LiSn2(PO4)3, the TG/DTA curve was recorded from a mixture of stoichiometric amounts of SnO2, (NH4)2HPO4, and Li2CO3, as shown in Fig. 1. The TG curve shows a soft slope before 200 C and a steep slope in the range of 200e600 C, with a weight loss of 27.0%. According to the reaction Eq. (3), the formation of LiSn2(PO4)3 from stoichiometric amounts of SnO2, (NH4)2HPO4, and Li2CO3 must be accompanied by an overall weight loss of 27.9%, which is in good agreement with the experiment results. 6√∞NH4√û2HPO4 √æ 4SnO2 √æ Li2CO3 /2LiSn2√∞PO4√û3√æ12NH3 √æ CO2 √æ 9H2O

(3) At temperatures above 600 C, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant weight loss, which suggests that the gases (NH3, CO2 and H2O) are mainly produced below 600 C and that the reaction at high temperature does not result in further weight loss. Three distinct endothermic peaks are observed in the DTA curve. Taking into account the possible reactions that occur during the heating process, the peak at 190 C can be attributed to the decomposition of (NH4)2HPO4, and the peaks at 555 C and 870 C can be ascribed to the formation of SnP2O7 and LiSn2(PO4)3, respectively [25].

The phase composition of LiSn2(PO4)3 prepared at different temperatures was determined from X-ray diffraction analysis. Fig. 2aed show the X-ray diffraction patterns of LiSn2(PO4)3 synthesized at various temperatures, for 10 h using a typical solidstate method. These Ô¨Ågures show that all of the patterns have the same peaks at 2q ¬º 14.5, 19.9, 21.1, 24.2, 29.3, 32.1, and 36.2, which can be indexed to crystalline LiSn2(PO4)3 (JCPDS 49e1175, phase I) with a NASICON-type structure and monoclinic Cc symmetry. At a low synthesis temperature of 700 C, the lower intensity of the main peaks indicates low crystallinity of the LiSn2(PO4)3 particles. In addition, the peaks of LiSn2(PO4)3 appear

along with some impurities. The impurity peaks at 20.3 and 20.6 can be assigned to another LiSn2(PO4)3 NASICON-structure (JCPDS 87e2078, phase II) with rhombohedral R3c symmetry, and the peaks at 26.6 and 33.9 can be indexed to unreacted cassiterite SnO2 (JCPDS 77e0447). It has previously been reported that SnO2 and the two phases of LiSn2(PO4)3 coexist at temperatures below 700 C, and at temperatures above 700 C, phase II gradually transforms to phase I [26]. Fig. 2b and c clearly show that the intensity of the phase I peaks increased with the decrease of phase II in both samples. A slight impurity of SnO2 still exists at 800 C. When the temperature is increased to 900 C, a pure, wellfurther crystallized NASICON structure increasing the temperature to 1000 C, an extra second phase, SnO2, emerges because of the Li loss at high temperature, as shown in Fig. 2d. Therefore, to obtain the pure phase of LiSn2(PO4)3, the appropriate synthesis temperature is 900 C.

Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the LiSn2(PO4)3 synthesized at various temperatures. The difference in particle sizes can be easily observed from the morphology images. At 700 C and 800 C, the samples obviously consist of small particles with rough surfaces, which are not fully crystallized because of the relatively low synthesis temperature. Nevertheless, the sample prepared at 900 C reveals partly agglomerated particles that have well-shaped, smooth surfaces with clear edges. The primary particle size ranges from 0.5 to 1 mm, which is in agreement with the sizes calculated from the XRD patterns using the Scherrer formula: D ¬º Kl/bcosq. Additionally, when the synthesis temperature is increased to 1000 C, the particles show clear edges and corners with the particle size dramatically increasing to 2e5 mm. The large grains in this size may cause considerable polarization during the charge/ discharge process. The results suggest that the sample morphology is highly dependent on the synthesis temperature. Taking the size factor into consideration, the optimal synthesis temperature is 900 C.

The charge/discharge proÔ¨Åles of LiSn2(PO4)3 and nano-SnO2 are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the cycling test proÔ¨Åles are shown as insets in each of the Ô¨Ågures. As demonstrated in Fig. 4a, a clear plateau appears at approximately 1.2 V and ends at  1 approximately 1.0 V, with a discharge capacity of 415 mAh g this during the Ô¨Årst

transformation should be 410 mAh g is consistent with our result. LiSn2√∞PO4√û3 √æ 8Li

Because the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) Ô¨Ålm will not form in this voltage range, this plateau can be ascribed to the irreversible reduction of Sn(IV) to Sn(0) accompanied with the formation of Li3PO4. It is noteworthy that a minimum voltage is obtained at the beginning of the plateau, which is in good agreement with the Ô¨Åndings of Irvine‚Äôs work where the electronic conductivity is improved as tin metal begins to form and is believed responsible for this phenomenon [18]. Additionally, a sloping discharge/charge  1 is obtained when the behavior with a capacity of 605 mAh g voltage ranges from 1.0 V to 0.0 V. This corresponds to the sequential partial reversible Li ion insertion that will terminate until the full lithiation Li4.4Sn is reached. Additionally, a capacity of  1 that exceeds the theoretical capacity in this region can 162 mAh g undoubtedly be ascribed to the SEI formation. After the Ô¨Årst discharge, the electrochemical process, which is shown as sloping lines in the Ô¨Ågure, is mainly dependant on the reaction of the reversible lithiation of Sn. The capacity and the coulombic efÔ¨Åciency versus cycle numbers are plotted in the inset of Fig. 4a. Starting at the second cycle, LiSn2(PO4)3 exhibits good cycling  1 after 50 cycles, with performance with a capacity of 320 mAh g the capacity retention maintained above 85%.

Fig. 4b shows the charge/discharge proÔ¨Åles of nano-scale SnO2, which exhibits a sloping discharge/charge behavior with an initial  1 and charge capacity of discharge capacity of 1230 mAh g  1. However, this material exhibits poor cycling perfor600 mAh g mance. The capacity and the coulombic efÔ¨Åciency versus cycle numbers are plotted in the inset of Fig. 4b. Nano-sized SnO2, using a Li2O matrix during charge/discharge, delivers a capacity of only  1 and shows an 82% loss from the Ô¨Årst charge capacity 110 mAh g after 50 cycles, which is caused by the aggregation of nanoparticles and the formation of inactive tin clusters during subsequent cycling [27]. The coulombic efÔ¨Åciency of the nano-sized SnO2 increases from 49% in the Ô¨Årst cycle to 99% in the 50th cycle, which indicates that the irreversible capacity from the formation of a large amount

of surface solid electrolyte interface (SEI) Ô¨Ålm mainly affects the Ô¨Årst cycle. This is because of the large surface area of the nano-scale material and the reaction with functional groups that exist on the particle surface after the low-temperature synthesis process [28]. The decay of other cycles is attributed to alloy aggregation and pulverization.

In general, LiSn2(PO4)3 demonstrates good cycling stability compared to that of the nano-sized SnO2. The distinct difference in cyclability between these two compounds is mainly due to the different matrix materials. As mentioned above, it can therefore be concluded that the electrochemical processes of highly dispersed nano-Sn particles in Li3PO4 matrices formed in LiSn2(PO4)3 are more stable than in the Li2O matrix formed in SnO2. In addition, the high reversibility also beneÔ¨Åts from the high Li ionic diffusion rate of LiSn2(PO4)3 and Li3PO4 compared with SnO2 and Li2O because high Li ionic diffusion rates make the lithiation of the LiSn2(PO4)3 particles much easier [29,30].

The surface morphologies of the prepared LiSn2(PO4)3 electrode Ô¨Ålm following several charge and discharge cycles were investigated using SEM, as shown in Fig. 5. Before discharge, the LiSn2(PO4)3 particles are clearly visible, and they are all surrounded and connected by carbon black and the binder. However, as shown in Fig. 5b, after 2 cycles, a thin Ô¨Ålm is formed on the surface of the active material particles that Ô¨Ålls the gap between them and makes the particles smoother and tighter. This effect becomes more signiÔ¨Åcant as the number of cycles is increased, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. After 50 cycles, an even smoother surface is formed and exhibits no cracks, which is very different from the reported results obtained for tin oxides [17]. This result indicates that the compact Li3PO4 matrix has formed and that this matrix is so stable during the charge and discharge cycles that the tin volume expansion during lithiation can be effectively alleviated to obtain improved cyclability.

Ex-situ XRD experiments were used to conÔ¨Årm the Li reaction  1 mechanisms of LiSn2(PO4)3. The cell was discharged at 100 mA g to 0.0 V for the Ô¨Årst cycle. The results obtained during the Ô¨Årst cycle of a Li/LiSn2(PO4)3 cell at OCV (open circuit voltage), 1.0 V and 0.0 V are presented in Fig. 6aec, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6a, the

undischarged electrode exhibits clear peaks for the crystallized LiSn2(PO4)3. (JCPDS 49-1175, the peaks at 2q ¬º 43.3, 50.4and 74.1 can be indexed to the copper current collector.) As shown in Fig. 6b, when the cell is discharged to 1.0 V, the intensity of the diffraction peaks of LiSn2(PO4)3 is greatly reduced, which suggests the transformation of LiSn2(PO4)3 to Li3PO4. A small peak at 22.20 corresponds to Li3PO4 (JCPDS 45 0747), according to previously reported work [16], and the low density is probably due to the low crystallization and the small sizes of the formed Li3PO4. Additionally, the patterns from the electrode that was discharged to 0.0 V, as shown in Fig. 6c, show no sharp peaks; instead, these patterns show broad peaks between 22 and 24, which are ascribed to the product of amorphous Li3PO4 and LixSn. These results provide clear evidence that the insertion of lithium ions into LiSn2(PO4)3 results in the complete destruction of the materials‚Äô crystallinity. This phenomenon is in agreement with the results of many tin-based glass systems [31,32], and the large irreversible capacity during Ô¨Årst discharge is caused by this matrix formation reaction.

The ex-situ XRD patterns of the cycled LiSn2(PO4)3 electrode after 10 cycles at 3.0 V and 0.0 V are shown in Fig. 6d and e. A comparison of these two patterns reveals that the difference is the broad peaks for LixSn, which are apparently not present in the pattern collected at 3.0 V. Additionally, the pattern shown in Fig. 6e is almost the same as the pattern in Fig. 6c. This Ô¨Ågure shows that only the lithiation reaction of nano-scale tin particles that are embedded into a stable amorphous Li3PO4 matrix occurs during the charge and discharge process. It is noteworthy that, in a previous work reported by French [33], metallic tin was detected in the fully discharged products of LiSn2(PO4)3. However, only LixSn was found in the fully discharged products in our experiment, which is mainly because of the nanosize of the precursors that reduce the bulk resistivity of material and makes it easier for the product to be fully lithiated.

To gain a better understanding of the kinetic mechanism of Li ion transportation in the electrode materials, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed at various voltages. LiSn2(PO4)3 was used as the working electrode, and metallic lithium foil was used as the counter and reference electrodes. As shown in Fig. 7, the EIS collected at the open circuit voltage (OCV) is

transport [36]. To eliminate the inÔ¨Çuence of the binder and the electronic conductivity, the powder microelectrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique was used to determine the Li ion diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient. CV tests were performed at various scan rates (0.1, 0.2,  1) in 1 M LiPF6 EC/DMC/DEC electrolyte, and the 0.5, 1, and 2 mV s √æ scanning potential ranges were set between 0 and 2.0 V vs Li /Li. Because of the inconvenience caused by the irreversible process during the Ô¨Årst cycle, only the second cycles using various scan rates were recorded, as shown in Fig. 8. A pair of redox peaks clearly appeared in every curve, which is attributed to the lithiation/delithiation process of tin. The details of the CV proÔ¨Åle are illustrated in Fig. 9a and b, which show a liner relationship between jEp   E0j and log v (the values of jEp   E0j are calculated as half the difference between the potential peak values in the anodic and the cathodic sides, and the value of jEp   E0j obtained is larger than 28 mV at all of the examined rates) and between ip and v1/2, where Ep is the peak potential, E0 is the formal potential, v is the scan rate and ip is the peak current. These results indicate that the lithiation/delithiation process of tin phosphate could be regarded as an irreversible electrochemical reaction [37].

where Ep, E0, v and ip are as mentioned above, a is the transfer coefÔ¨Åcient, n is the number of electrons involved in the ratedetermining step and k0 is the standard rate constant (cm s

According to Eq. (5), DLi can be obtained from the slope of a plot of ip vs v1/2 with the knowledge of transfer coefÔ¨Åcient, a, and the change in the Li-ion concentration ADC. Because of the small current of the microelectrode, the potential drop caused by the uncompensated resistance, iRu, has no affect on our measurement. The value of the transfer coefÔ¨Åcient, a, and ADC can be estimated from the slope of the line in Fig. 9a and b, according to Eqs. (5) and (6).

Assuming that the cavity of the microelectrode is a cylinder and that the particles inside the cavity are in closely packed structures with an interspaced rate of 25.9%, the volumes are estimated to be

a semicircle at high frequency and a straight line at low frequency, which corresponds to a typical Li ion blocking process. When the cell is discharged to 1.0 V, the only change in the EIS is the increase in the diameters of the semicircle at high frequency. According to the widely accepted explanation, this increase is attributed to the interface resistance, which comes from partial SEI (solid electrolyte interface) and the formation of the Li3PO4 matrix, and the straight line is caused by the bulk Li ion diffusion process [34,35]. The EIS obtained at 0.0 V during the Ô¨Årst discharge and the 10th discharge exhibit a new semicircle at a middle frequency. From consideration of the possible reactions at this potential, it is believed that the lithium alloying with freshly formed tin is responsible for these semicircles. The slight decrease in the semicircle diameter shown in Fig. 7d is probably due to the more compact Li3PO4 matrix and better contact between the particles after cycling. These results indicate that Li3PO4 is a stable matrix during the electrochemical process and guarantees that the tin particles are well dispersed during the reversible charge/discharge.

The diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient (DLi) expresses information on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the electrode process and mass

It is now widely accepted that phosphate-based materials have excellent thermal stability, and they have been regarded as potential safety battery materials for electric vehicles [39]. Herein, the thermal stability of LiSn2(PO4)3 was investigated using DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measurements, and the results are presented in Fig. 10. The common commercial electrolyte consists of EC/DMC/DEC (1:1:1 by volume), and LiPF6 was Ô¨Årst tested, as shown in Fig. 10a. There is no obvious reaction until the temperature rises to 250 C. The broad exothermic peak that spreads from 250 C to 325 C corresponds to the decomposition of LiPF6 with the formation of LiF and PF5. In contrast, the DSC curve acquired from fully lithiated, pure tin exhibits two signiÔ¨Åcant exothermic peaks, from 95 C to 140 C and from 200 C to 220 C. According to a previous study, these two peaks are related to the breakdown of the SEI at lower temperatures, and the reaction between LixSn and the electrolyte after the SEI decomposition at higher temperatures [40]. The reactions are summarized in the following equations: √∞CH2OCO2Li√û2/Li2CO3 √æ C2H4[ √æ CO2[ √æ 0:5O2[ (7) 2LixSn√æC3H4O3/xLi2CO3√æC2H4[√æ2SnOy√æ√∞1 x√ûCO2[ (8) Similar to Fig. 10b, Fig. 10c shows the DSC curve that was obtained from the fully lithiated LiSn2(PO4)3. However, the two peaks that appear in the DSC curve in Fig. 10c have higher beginning temperatures at 104 C and 215 C compared with the curve in Fig. 10b, which suggests the fact that LiSn2(PO4)3 has higher thermal stability than pure Sn. The Li3PO4 matrix seems to play an important role in this improvement.

In summary, we have systematically studied the synthesis and electrochemical process of LiSn2(PO4)3. A NASICON-structured LiSn2(PO4)3 using nano-SnO2 as a precursor was prepared at 900 C, with particle sizes of approximately 0.9 mm, using a typical solid-state method. Compared to SnO2, this material exhibits better  1 after 50 cycling performance, with a capacity of 320 mAh g cycles. To gain a better understanding of such an improvement, a process that consists of the formation of a Li3PO4 matrix and the lithiation of tin particles has been conÔ¨Årmed using ex-situ XRD and EIS tests. Meanwhile, the apparent Li ion diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient (DLi)  1 was calculated using the powder microof 9.02  10 electrode CV technique. Additionally, the DSC measurements suggest excellent thermal stability of LiSn2(PO4)3. These results reveal the improved cycling performance of LiSn2(PO4)3 is due to the Li3PO4 matrix, which can better limit the volume change and prevent the aggregation of tin clusters during cycling. This work also offers a potential phosphate-based tin anode for a safer battery and helps us better understand the relationship between matrix materials and electrochemical performance.

In Fig. 9b, the peak currents, ip, increase with  5 mol cm 1.39  10 v1/2 and exhibit good linearity. Therefore, the slope could be easily identiÔ¨Åed. Consequently, the value of for  1. This value is LiSn2(PO4)3 is calculated to be 9.02  10 close to the reported value in a previous study [38], which agrees with our hypothesis that the existence of the Li3PO4 matrix with a high Li ion diffusion coefÔ¨Åcient has no inÔ¨Çuence on the Li ion diffusion in the active tin component. Additionally, the Li3PO4 matrix provides steady ion channels and maintains the integrity of electrode structure during cycling. This is the key factor for realizing the good electrochemical performance of LiSn2(PO4)3.

Controlling the thermal runaway problem of the cell is considered a crucial technology in the commercial use of Li-ion batteries.
