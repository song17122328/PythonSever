Lithium-ion conduction in mixed-metal phosphates, LiMVMIII(PO4)3 [MV=Nb, Ta; MIII=Al, Cr, Fe], possessing the rhombohedral (R39c) NASICON structure has been investigated. Among the phosphates investigated, LiTaAl(PO4)3 exhibits the highest conductivity, s#1.0×10−2 S cm−1 at 350 °C (Ea=0.47 eV ), comparable to the conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3. Unlike LiTi2(PO4)3 which contains lithium-reducible TiIV, LiTaAl(PO4)3 contains stable TaV and AlIII oxidation states and hence deserves further attention towards tailoring new lithium-ion conductors for application as electrolytes in solid state lithium batteries.

At present, there is a great interest to develop solid lithiumion conductors for use as electrolytes in all-solid-state-lithium batteries.1 Availability of a suitable solid electrolyte material that could replace the currently used liquid electrolytes in lithium batteries would greatly contribute to the development of lithium battery technology by enabling fabrication of ﬂexible, compact and leak-proof batteries of desired geometry.1 Two approaches are pursued for this purpose. One approach2 is to render liquid polymer electrolytes [such as polyethylene oxide (PEO)–lithium salt complexes] into solid composites by adding solid plasticizers (such as TiO2 or Al2O3) without loss of conducting properties. The other approach is to synthesise lithium-containing solid compounds possessing the desired conducting properties.3 Among the several families of inorganic solids exhibiting lithium-ion conduction,3 framework oxides based on the NASICON structure (Fig. 1) are of special interest, because materials exhibiting high conductivities combined with low activation energies have been reported for this structure.4 For the titanium–aluminium system,5 Li1+xTi2−xAlx(PO4)3, exhibits a high conductivity (7.0×10−4 S cm at 25 °C ) example, and a low activation energy (Ea=0.2–0.3 eV ) for x=0.3. Despite these attractive features, there are several materialsproblems to be overcome before a lithium-ion conductor based on the NASICON framework could ﬁnd application as electrolyte material. For instance, it is not clear whether the high conductivity of Li1+xTi2−xAlx(PO4)3 and other such trivalent metal-substituted systems are intrinsic to the structure or due to formation of secondary phases that favour sintering and eliminate grain-boundary resistance.3 More importantly, for electrolyte application, the TiIV in the material should be replaced by other metal ions that would not undergo reduction by lithium. Towards this end, we examined lithium-ion conducthe formula,6 tion of mixed-metal NASICON-phases of LiMVMIII(PO4)3, where MV=Nb, Ta; MIII=Al, Cr, Fe. We believed that once we obtain a stoichiometric NASICONphase possessing intrinsic conducting properties similar to LiTi2(PO4)3 but without TiIV, extraneous factors such as sinterability, grain boundary resistance, etc., could be tailored by appropriate means to obtain a favourable conducting material for application. Our results, which are reported in this paper, investigated, LiTaAl(PO4)3 exhibiting a total (bulk+grain boundary) con30 °C and ca. 1.0×10−2 S cm−1 at 350 °C deserves further attention. It must ductivity of

Results and discussion In Table 1, we list the compositions of LiMVMIII(PO4)3 (MV= Nb, Ta; MIII=Al, Cr, Fe) phosphates, their lattice parameters and conductivity data. For comparison, we also give the corresponding data for LiMIV2(PO4)3 for MIV=Ti and Zr. All the LiMVMIII(PO4)3 phosphates investigated by us crystallize in the rhombohedral (R39c) NASICON structure (Fig. 1)6,10 similar to LiMIV2(PO4)3.11 In this structure, lithium atoms occupy the A1 (6b) sites within the M2(PO4)3 framework, the other possible A2 (18e) sites being empty. Since we do not see evidence for a superstructure in the XRD patterns (Fig. 2) of LiMVMIII(PO4)3, we believe that both MV and MIII atoms are randomly distributed in the (12c) positions of the NASICON structure. Since the structure of LiMVMIII(PO4)3 (MV=Nb, Ta; MIII=Al, Cr, Fe) is closely similar to that of LiTi2(PO4)311 which is a good lithium-ion conductor,5 we expected that members of LiMVMIII(PO4)3 would also exhibit similar lithium-ion conduction. Fig. 4 shows the Arrhenius plots for the lithium-ion conductivity of LiMVMIII(PO4)3 members and in Table 1, conductivity values at room temperature and at 350 °C are given together with activation energy (Ea) values. We see that, between NbVMIII and TaVMIII members, the TaVMIII members show a higher conductivity. Among the TaV-containing members, the TaAl-compound, LiTaAl(PO4)3 which has the smallest cell volume (1315 A˚ 3) shows the highest total ionic (bulk+grain boundary) conductivity (stotal=6.5×10−7 S cm−1 at 30 °C and Table 1 Chemical composition, lattice parameters and total ionic conductivity data for NASICON-type phosphates LiMVMIII(PO4)3 (MV=Nb, Ta; MIII=Al, Cr, Fe)

From a comparison of the corresponding literature data for LiTi2(PO4)3 (Table 1), we see that the conductivity of LiTaAl(PO4)3 is indeed higher than that of LiTi2(PO4)3 at LiTaAl(PO4)3 is 1.0×10−2 S cm−1 and stotal for LiTi2(PO4)3 higher for is 6.3×10−3 S cm−1), albeit the activation energy for conduction of LiTaAl(PO4)3 (Ea=0.47 eV ) is higher than that for LiTi2(PO4)3 (Ea#0.30 eV ). In the literature,4 a correlation between unit cell volume (V ) of NASICON phosphates and activation energy, Ea, has been pointed out; Ea has been found to be a minimum (ca. 0.30 eV ) when V=1310 A˚ 3, corresponding to that of LiTi2(PO4)3. Among the LiMVMIII(PO4)3 investigated here, LiTaAl(PO4)3 has the smallest V=1315 A˚ 3 and the Ea for this phase also happens to be the smallest (ca. 0.47 eV ), although this value is considerably higher than that of LiTi2(PO4)3. This observation reveals that, while the activation energy for lithium-ion migration depends on the cell volume (optimal tunnel size), it also depends on the identity of M atoms constituting the M2(PO4)3 framework.
