New glass ceramic nanocomposites based on the Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 (LFGP) are successfully synthesized, by crystallization of LFGP parent glass, and studied as anode materials for lithium ion battery (LIB). The appropriate temperature for crystallizing the LFGP parent glass is determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). XRD pattern asserted the amorphous essence of LFGP parent glass. XRD results also affirmed the creation of the NASICON phase in the investigated LFGP glass ceramics obtained by heat treatment (HT) for different durations. Additionally, the structure refinement parameters of LFGP glass ceramic samples are determined. Moreover, TEM, SEM and FTIR confirmed the creation of NASICON phase. The electrical conductivity of LFGP glass ceramic nanocomposites fabricated by HT ≥ 6 h significantly increased up to 10-3 order. The galvanostatic cycling (GC) and cycling voltammetry (CV) techniques were implemented for the assembled batteries to investigate the specific capacity and redox reactions during Li+ ions insertion/extraction processes. Therefore, it is suggested that the improved storage capacity and capacity retention (97.9 %) for the LFGP HT12h electrode after 50 cycles could be attributed to the synergistic action of cation vacancies formed in the NASICON structure and the glass material shells around the LFGP nanoparticles which prevent further oxidation of Ge into GeO2. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) estimations affirmed the excellent cyclic stability of the optimum LFGP anode owing to the enhanced ionic conductivity and fast diffusion rates of Li+ ions. 
Nowadays, energy shortage represents serious challenges all over the world. Therefore, the technological and scientific challenges of discovering new devices that can store energy and replace energy sources have supported the advancement of batteries operating at changed temperatures [1]. Rechargeable metal-ion batteries exemplify the most recent energy-storage devices [2]. In general, such batteries are utilized in electronic devices, including notebooks and cell phones. Different electrode compounds have scrutinized to fabricate powerful batteries. As for cathodes, most cathode compounds are categorized to two classes: close-packed metal oxide structures, for instance layered oxides [3] and more-open three dimensional (3D) framework structures, for instance polyanionic materials [4]. A famous instance of the last category is NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor)-structured compounds. NASICON structured compounds are predominantly charming, since they offer more structure stability, and higher ionic conductivity. The formula of NASICON structure is A1+xNxM2-x(XO4)3, where octahedral NO6 and MO6 participate all their nooks with tetrahedral XO4. NO6 and MO6 octahedra link to three XO4 tetrahedral groups, which form a fundamental group, and are called a lantern. Every lantern combines other six lanterns, producing a great interstitial area that can suit 0 into 5 alkali ions per structural formula. Several alkali ions rely on the oxidation states of M and N and the element X [4]. Some likely components in NASICON compounds are as per the following: i)  A = K, Li, Mg, Ca, Na; ii)  M or N = V, Fe, Zr, Ti, Mn, Sc, In, Nb; and iii)  X = P, S, As, Si.  In fact, NASICON structured solid electrolytes were first investigated by Hong and Goodenough in 1976 [5,6] in the study of composition Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12. NASICON compounds were observed to have higher ionic conductivity due to migration pathways of 3D ion in the structure. Nonetheless, altering alkali ions from Na+ into Li+ in the composition Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 outcomes a phase transition and Li+ delocalization, that significantly decreases ion conductivity [7,8]. To realize greater Li+ ion conductivity without disorganizing the NASICON phase structure, Hiromichi et al. widely studied the Li+ conducting NASICON compounds using various tetravalent ions. This study described an abnormal relation between lattice parameter and activation energy, and the prime cell volume offered lesser activation energy (~ 0.3 eV) of Li+ ion diﬀusion [9].
Actually, higher ion conductivity is realized by replacing tetravalent by trivalent ion, as reported via formula, Li1+xNxM2-x(PO4)3 (M: tetravalent element; N: trivalent ion). The replacement of M4+ by N3+ presents extra interstitial Li+ in the LiM2(PO4)3 structure and generate new powerfully-favored position that drops activation energy of diﬀusion [10]. Fruitful replacement of tetravalent element by trivalent ion needs slight change in ionic radius, as an instance, Cr3+, Al3+, Fe3+, La3+, Ga3+, In3+ and Sc3+ can replace Ti4+ and Ge4+ positions in LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3  NASICON phase. In this respect, the greatest ion conductivity was originated in Al3+ replacing Ti4+ crystals and was estimated to be 1.3×10−3 S/cm by J. Fu [11], and 7×10−4 S/cm by H. Aono [12]. Further study exhibited the compositional variation by a liovalent replacement can highly affected the conductive material crystallization and determined the promising of NASICON glass ceramic as electrode for LIB [13]. Besides, glass and glass ceramics based electrodes are more safe and able to be produced via melt-spun or thin ﬁlms processing. Such electrodes possess a great electrochemical stability along with selective ion conduction. The NASICON structured glass ceramics can be fabricated by different techniques, for instance melt quenching followed by thermal treatment, sol-gel processing with following sintering, etc. Thereby, the obtained crystal structure can give high interfacial compatibility along with high Li+ ion conductivity [10, 14-16].  Moreover, more studies are reported to investigate the crystallization behavior of NASICON structured glass ceramics to realize higher ionic conductivity. For instance, Kumar and Thokchom stated the greatest ion conductivity in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass crystallized at 825 °C and reached about 4.22×10−3 S/cm [17]. As a result, the ability of sintering of Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 increases dramatically at the temperature > 850 °C which outcomes the enhancement in conductivity to be 5.08×10−3 S/cm [18]. Maldonado-Manso et al. investigated the dual tetravalent NASICON compound and realized an amazing conductivity that reaches about 10−3 order in Li1+xAlxGeyTi2-x-y(PO4)3 (x from 0.2 to 0.8, y = 1.0 or 0.8) HT at 950 °C. The correlation between size of oxygen bottle neck and activation energy needed for Li+ movement in LiM2(PO4) crystal is reported [19]. Furthermore, Zhao et al. stated the greatest ion conductivity of 7.8×10−4 S/cm in NASICON structured Y doped Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolytes. NASICON-type Y containing Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolytes provided a great effect on electrical conductivity along with electrochemical properties of electrolytes [20]. X. Xu et al. investigated that further Li2O could be nucleating agent to Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 NASICON phases, the total and the bulk conductivity with further Li2O achieve 7.25×10−4 S/cm and 1.18×10−3 S/cm on account of enhancing the linking on grain boundaries [16]. In our previous work [21-23], the structure along with electrical properties of NASICON compounds of the compositions Li1.3Nb0.3V1.7(PO4)3, Li1.3Nb0.3Fe1.7(PO4)3 and LiFe(BaTi)(PO4) are investigated. Recently, Pershina et al. [24] investigated the greatest ion conductivity of 3.9×10−4 S/cm in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic NASICON type electrolytes obtained by glass crystallization. It is found that glass ceramics of composition Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 are unchanging chemically when interacting with Li metallic [24].  Furthermore, a well crystallized NASICON-type LiSn2(PO4)3 exhibited high initial discharge capacity ~ 1000 mAh.g-1 and good cyclic performance with specific capacity of 50 mAh.g-1 after 50 cycles [25]. On the other hand, glass ceramic NASICON-type electrode can realize enhanced kinetics, great speciﬁc surface area can offer extra storage positions and the free volume can adjust to great lattice deformation, which are useful for electrochemical cycling. Therefore, the electrochemical performances of NASICON-type materials provide better results than that of other materials. Chae et al. [26] reported that the electrode achievement of the non-crystalline materials generated via a precipitation technique was far superior to that of the crystalline materials because of the absence of irretrievable transitions and Li confining, besides many vacancies that allow Li+ ions diffusion effortlessly.    In this regard, higher ion conductivity can be achieved by replacing Fe3+ with Ge4+ sites in Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 NASICON-type glass-ceramic. Therefore, this work reports the synthesis of Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 glass and its glass ceramic NASICON-type electrodes. To the best knowledge of the authors, the substitution of Ge4+ by Fe3+ in Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 NASICON-type glass ceramic is still untrodden. Accordingly, this investigation shed new light on the creation of NASICON-type compounds with higher Li+ ionic conductivity. Hence, Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 glass and its glass-ceramic NASICON-type electrodes are generated via melt quenching and controlled crystallization, respectively. Out of this point, the authors of such study attempt to investigate the electrochemical properties of Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 glass and its glass ceramic NASICON-type compounds. Therefore, such work is aimed to prepare new Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 glass and its glass ceramics NASICON-type and to investigate their structural features. In addition, the practicality and limitation of these compounds as anode materials for LIB are investigated. This  is  significant  not  only for such  investigation  regarded to  Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 glass and glass ceramic NASICON-type compounds,  but  also  for  the upcoming usage  of  the  glass and glass ceramic NASICON-type electrodes.  
The primary materials used for synthesizing glass sample of Li1+xFexGe2-x(PO4)3(x = 0.6) via melt quenching process were Li2CO3 (99%, Aldrich), GeO2 (99%, Aldrich), Fe2O3 (99%, Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Aldrich).  These reactants were mixed thoroughly (according to appropriate molar composition) and pounded in agate mortar and then heated for 6 h to temperatures range from 300 into 600 °C to take out volatile complexes (CO2, NH3, H2O) from the Li2CO3 and NH4H2PO4 raw materials. Posteriorly the resulting mixture is cooled, pounded again and smelted at 1250 ◦C in a silica crucible for 30 min to ensure the entire homogeneity in a furnace in air. Afterwards, the glass melt is promptly quenched by pouring it on a copper plate. Once the quenching process is carried out, the melt is constrained by a copper plate to constitute a thin glass disk of almost 1.51 mm thickness [21-23].   Depending on thermal data, observed by DSC, the double heat treatments were applied in a furnace in air to obtain glass ceramics. The double heat treatment implies two-steps heat treatment; a nucleation step for 2 h at the  appropriate temperature between  the  crystallization  temperature  (Tc) and glass  transition temperature  (Tg) succeeded by a growth step at Tc for different periods of 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 h [21-23]. The resulting LFGP glass ceramics samples were symbolized as HT3h, HT6h, HT12h, HT18h, HT24h and HT30h. 
The typical temperatures of the LFGP parent glass were identified at 10°C/min of heating rate by Shimadzu (DSC-60) instrument. LFGP glass and its glass ceramics (HT for varying durations) structure nature (amorphous or crystalline) were famed by XRD with BRUKER AXS D8 ADVANCE X-Ray Powder Diﬀraction system with Cu radiation source (λ = 1.541 Å). The data were recorded in Bragg’s angle ranges from 5° to 80° by step 0.02. The collected data was administered with FULLPROF program [27]. FTIR spectroscopy of LFGP samples was carried out in the wavenumber region from 400 to 2000 cm-1. Spectra carried out through JASCO (FT-IR-300E) FTIR spectrometer. As well, the surface morphology for the LFGP glass and its glass ceramic samples is characterized via Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) (Quanta FEG 250, and FEI, USA). Furthermore, the nanostructure of LFGP glass ceramic samples was also characterized via High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-TEM) [Philips, FEI Tecnai G2 S-Twin, worked at 200 kV].
Firstly, the conductive slurries for the four tested LFGP anode materials (HT 6h, HT 12h, HT 18h, HT 24h) can be prepared by blending the as-prepared active material with polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), conductive carbon black (super p) in the ratio of 80:5:15 wt.% with adequate quantity of conducting solvent N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). Secondly, the working electrode (WE) for each battery was fabricated by plating the homogenous slurry on the surface of copper foil current collector using controlled thickness film coater. The coated electrodes were thoroughly desiccated under vacuum at 80°C for the duration of a night, pierced and weighed. The mass loading of each active material on the electrode was almost equal 3.5 mg cm−2. Meanwhile, the punched Li chips (Sigma Aldrich, >99.9%) were employed versus the working electrode acting as reference and counter electrodes. In addition, Celgard® C2400 (micro-porous polypropylene) functioned as a permeable membrane and a suitable electrolyte drops of composition (1 M LiPF6 in Ethylene Carbonate (EC): Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC) with concentration ratio (1:1 vol.%) was properly added. The half-cells were collected inside button cells type CR-2032 inside an argon-filled glove box with moisture content < 1 ppm. The electrochemical measurements for the collected batteries were performed using battery cycling station (Bio-Logic MPG-205, France). Typically, the galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling was implemented for the coin cells at 50 mAg-1 current density within the potential ranges from 0.05 to 3.0 V. Moreover, cyclic voltammetry results of Li-ions insertion/extraction processes were clearly obtained within the potential limits (0.005 – 3.0 V) vs. Li+/Li at 0.1 mVs−1 scanning rate. Finally, the electrochemical impedancespectroscopy of each cell was clearly investigated in the ranging (10 kHz -100 mHz) frequency with almost 10 mV of amplitude value.  
To prepare glass ceramics, the crystallization temperature (Tc) of the LFGP parent glass sample should be identified. Consequently, the DSC curve of LFGP glass sample is offered in Fig. 1. It is remarked that glass transition temperature (Tg) is not identified clearly, whereas crystallization temperature observed clearly. To recognize T obviously, focused DSC curve around the Tg is shown as inset in Fig. 1 and Tg of 510 oC was observed. The amorphous essence was affirmed by finding the Tg in the DSC curve (Fig. 1) for LFGP glass sample. Further, the glass sample exhibited the onset crystallization temperature (Ts) at 595 oC, and a clear exothermic peak matching to Tc at 618 oC succeeded by two endothermic bands matching to melting temperatures (Tm1 and Tm2) at 937 oC and 1050 oC. The values of Tg, Tc, Tm1 and Tm2 of LFGP glass sample are valued in Table 1. Moreover, the DSC curve of the LFGP parent glass sample show one sharp crystallization peak only, signifying the creation of one crystalline phase only and a high trend to crystallize easily.  The thermal stability parameter (ΔT) is commonly utilized to evaluate the LFGP parent glass stability which is offered via ΔT = Ts - Tg [21,28]. The marked difference that occurs between the Tg and Ts reveals the thermal stability of the LFGP parent glass. In addition, there is another parameter (S) for thermal stability as stated by Poulain and Saad [21] which provides the resistance for devitriﬁcations of LFGP parent glass and is offered via S = (Tc – Ts)( Tc - Tg) / Tg. As observed in Table 1, such parameter suggests that the LFGP parent glass possesses high thermal stability. The Hruby’s parameter, Kgl, is valued from thermal data which represents the glass forming ability and is given by [29]; It is well known that the values of Kgl ≥ 0.1 for good glass forming systems [29]. It is remarked that the LFGP glass sample offers the Kgl of 0.34, indicating that such glass composition has a great glass creating ability. Furthermore, the factor Tgr = Tg/Tm1 provides the inclination of the glass to nucleate regularly in the volume and has an ideal value of about 0.66. As observed in Table 1, the LFGP parent glass sample offers Tgr of 0.54, signifying that such glass composition can potentially nucleate homogeneously.  
XRD patterns of the LFGP glass and its glass ceramics (HT for varying durations) samples are displayed in Fig. 2. Such figure reveals that a broad and halo band at 25o angle of diffraction without any diffraction peaks for as LFGP parent glass, signifying that the LFGP glass sample is amorphous. Additionally, the XRD patterns of all glass ceramics samples are good correspond with archetypical rhombohedral NASICON-type structure LiGe2(PO4)3 (LGP) (Code: 80-1922) with R− 3c space group, which indicates that NASICON-type structure Li1.6Fe0.6Ge1.4(PO4)3 samples are successfully prepared. As apparent, with changing HT durations no new crystallite creation occur in the glass matrix accordingly affirming the creation of a glass-ceramic NASICON-type electrode where LGP crystallites are clearly observed with long range order. The structural of LFGP glass ceramics samples explained via Rietveld refinement executed via Fullprof software. In Fig. 3(a-f), the calculated and observed diffraction patterns are embodied by solid black lines and red hollow circles, respectively. Besides, the solid blue lines and the green bar lines indicate difference between calculated and observed patterns and the Bragg positions, respectively. It is found that the rhombohedral crystalline structure was not changed by varying the HT durations confirmed from Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns of LFGP glass ceramics.  Various structure refinement parameters extracted from Rietveld reﬁnement of XRD patterns for LFGP glass ceramics are summarized in Table 2 and 3. The lattice parameters slightly increase with increasing HT durations up to 12 h and then decrease with further increasing HT durations. The cell volume of LFGP glass ceramics exhibit a tendency to reduce with further increasing HT durations as shown in Fig. 5. The HT process reduces the M–O distance along the c-axis that is mirrored in the restriction of the “c” parameter, whereas the “a” parameter still not changes. The Williamson–Hall (W–H) plot for LFGP glass ceramics was executed to differentiate between the outcome of crystallite size induced broadening and microstrain at full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD patterns and is offered in Fig. 4. The crystallite size for such samples can be determined via W–H method via the relationship [21,30]; where  c represents  the correction factor (c ≈1),  β  represents  FWHM,  D  represents the  crystallite size, θ represents  the  Bragg angle,    ε  represents  the  lattice  strain and λ  symbolizes  the x-ray wavelength. Crystallite size dependence of HT durations for LFGP glass ceramics is offered in Fig. 5. As observed in Fig. 5, the D augmented progressively from 54 into 87 nm with augmenting HT durations. According to XRD result, there are some crystallites in nanoscale embedded in the glass matrix during glass ceramics formation. This result indicates that the present LFGP glass ceramic samples can called glass ceramic nanocomposites. 
Atypical surfaces, appreciated by FE-SEM, of the LFGP glass and its glass ceramics samples (HT for varying durations) are illustrated in Fig. 6. For comparison, the SEM photo of the LFGP parent glass was also offered. A marked change in the microstructure was noticed. As observed in Fig. 6, a typical black area in the background was observable which is characteristic of the glass. When the LFGP parent glass was heated for 3 h, creation of spherical crystalline grains prospective with NASICON network structure was detected in Fig. 6(b). When the treatment period is increased, the spherical-like grains developed further and some pores happened along the grain boundary as displayed in Fig. 6(c, d, e). The promising microstructure of the LFGP glass ceramics can elucidate the greater conductivity and lesser activation energy comparing to LFGP parent glass. SEM remarks suggested the movement of Li ions was preferred by the creation of spherical crystalline grains with NASICON structure and intense microstructure. The difference in microstructure between the LFGP materials is also inspected by HR-TEM. Atypical TEM images of LFGP glass ceramics samples (HT12h and HT24h) are illustrated in Fig. 7. LFGP glass ceramic HT12h sample displays nanospheres of crystallite size ranges (42–53 nm) embedded in the glass matrix (Fig. 7 (a)). Some remnant glassy phase is also observed. Most of these nanocrystals embedded in the glass matrix are developed for LFGP glass ceramic HT24h sample (Fig. 7 (b)). The dimension of the crystallite size for HT24h sample is around 68 nm. This consequence is well-matched with the XRD and SEM results.  
To further investigate the network of the LFGP glass and its glass ceramics samples, FTIR spectroscopy is used. Such strategy permits obtaining data of the structural group present inside the LFGP glass and glass ceramic nanocomposites and the assembled spectra are displayed in Fig. 8. For as LFGP parent glass, the broad peak at ~ 542 cm-1 is allocated to non-symmetric bending mode of O–P–O groups [21,31,32]. After HT glass for varying durations, such broad band is divided into three bands at 432, 578 and 650 cm-1. The first band (432 cm-1) is accredited to O–P–O symmetric bending mode [33]. The second one (578 cm-1) is accredited to non-symmetric bending mode of O–P–O groups [21,31,32], whereas the third one (650 cm-1) is allocated to harmonic bending vibration of O–P–O [21,32,34]. Obviously, allthe HT samples have identical such three bands at the similar positions. For as LFGP parent glass, a shoulder at 765 cm-1 followed by a weakly band at 921 cm−1 is detected. The detected shoulder at 765 cm-1 is official to symmetric stretching vibration of P–O–P bridging bond in pyrophosphate (P2O7)4– groups [21,35], whereas the  weak peak at 921 cm−1 is connected to non-symmetric stretching vibrations of P–O–P linkages [36]. Such shoulder and weak band are not observed after HT for varying durations. The bands ranging 1026–1112 cm-1 represent the (PO4)3− ionic group vibration [21,32,37]. Accordingly, the attendance of the (PO4)3- group denotes the creation of NASICON phase. Normally NASICON compounds vibrational modes can be allotted to PO4 tetrahedral and to lattice mode of octahedral metal. But the nature of spectral proﬁles of the M–O octahedra in such compounds is very weak in comparison with the (PO4)3− group, signifying its covalency strength (redox energy) is a weak in comparison with the (PO4)3− covalency strength (redox energy). Consequently, lesser redox energy is anticipated from the Fe3+/Ge4+ redox couple, owing to greater order covalency strength of (PO4)3− and thus cell voltage can be well offered [38]. For as HT glass for different durations, the observed shoulder at 1282 cm-1 is owing to (P–O)(−) ionic vibration [21,32,39]. For as LFGP parent glass, strong two bands at 1426 and 1641 cm-1 are owing to H2O bending vibration [21,32, 40]. After HT glass for different durations, such two bands intensity decreases and finally vanishes. For as LFGP parent glass, the strong bands in region 2848–3430 cm-1 is associated to OH stretching vibration [21,40]. Such bands intensity reduces after HT glass for changed durations and finally vanishes. Similar observations are perceived in the other samples [33]. FTIR observations are matching with the outcomes of XRD, SEM and TEM. 
The conductivity data of LFGP parent glass and its glass-ceramic nanocomposites were attained in 300-510 K temperature range and plotted in Fig. 9. As expected, the conductivity provides a linear conduct in such temperature range. The pre-exponential factor (), activation energy (E) and electrical conductivity at 300 K ( ) were estimated from the conductivity data in Fig. 9 via the subsequent Arrhenius equation [21,41] The pre-exponential constant, , is correlated to the ionic charge (Ze, where e, the electron charge and Z is the ion valence), the hopping frequency ((), the hopping distance ()) and the total ions concentration (N) based on relation(4) [41]:
The computed pre-exponential factors for the glass and its glass-ceramics studied here is in good covenant with typical values for solid electrolytes (10 ≤  ≤103) in most cases [6,15–17]  and they are matching with a jump relaxation model forion transport. As offered in Fig. 10, both   and E follow an opposite behavior, where   (E) of glass-ceramics increases (decreases) with increasing HT durations up to 6 h, then does not exhibit significant variations with further increase of HT durations. As predictable, the creation of NASICON phase after HT enables the transfer of Li+ ions, attributable to its structure with 3D paths, accordingly affecting a reduction in the activation energy needed for ions movement. However, it is noticed that the conductivity does not enhance for samples HT durations > 6 h (HT12h, HT18h, HT24h and HT30h). It is potential that the size of conduction path is not appropriate for the movement of Li+ ions for samples HT durations > 6 h, i.e., an extremely tight path, which is due to the reduction of the NASICON unit cell perceived in XRD section. The glass ceramic NASICON-type electrode generated by HT for different durations causes the conductivity to increase up to 10-3 order. 
Fig. 11 displays the galvanstatic cycling profile for the initial charge-discharge processes at 50 mAg-1 current density of LFGP glass ceramic nanocomposites prepared after different HT times 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. The four discharge curves demonstrated assending values of specific discharge capacities about 180, 400, 720 and 1260 mAhg-1 corresponding to the LFGP electrodes prepared at HT durations of 6, 12, 18 and 24 h, respectively. Despite the LFGP HT24h electrode exhibited the maximum storage capacity of Li+ ions at 0 V of discharge, the charge curve ends at 1.2 V, indicating that the irrevesible extraction 8 Li+ ions (410 mAhg-1) is occurred according to the the following reaction: 
The formed Ge metal is easily reacted with the formed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer of Li2O casuing the capacity fading and loss of contact in the subsequent cycles due to the forming insulating layers of GeO2 between the active material and SEI layer as well as the active material and current collector, respectively according to the following predominating equation: 
Meanwhile, the essential equilibrium between the active LiGe2(PO4)3 NASICON structure and in active glass matrix are properly achieved with other three LFGP electrodes prepared at lower HT time. Therefore, these three cells are fully charged at high potential 3 V, suggesting the possibility of the following reversible reaction during the discharge processes. 
Accordingly, the obtained discharge capacity of LFGP HT24h is 2.3 times higher than the theoretical capacity of LiGe2(PO4)3 (~ 540 mAhg-1), while the obtained charge capacity of LFGP HT24h typically indicate the formation of GeLi4 alloy during the charge process [43]. On the other hand, the introduction of Fe3+ plays a similar role of reduced graphene oxide and Ni foam substrate by enlarging the stability of LiGe2(PO4)3 anode to work up to 3 V which better than reported potentials 1.5 and 2 V [43, 46, 48, 50].  The presence of two plateaus is highly apparent in the charge curve of LFGP HT24h cell that could be attributed to two oxidation process of Ge and Fe cations in the formed LixGeO2 or LixFeO2 layers.   
The cyclic voltammetry technique could provide a comprehensive investigation for the redox reactions occurring during the first five charge-discharge cycles at scanning rate 0.1 mV.S-1 for both LFGP electrodes HT12h and HT24h as illustrated in Fig. 12( a and b). Fig. 12 (a) reveals the first CV scan for the LFGP HT12h electrode which comprises the evolution of three cathodic bands at 0.5, 0.37 and 0.05 V. The first weak cathodic band at 0.5 V is attributed to the creation of SEI layer Li2O due to the irreversible lithiation process [42,43]. Meanwhile, the second cathodic band at 0.37 V is matched to the decrease of Ge4+ or Fe3+ forming the amorphous LixGeO2 or LixFeO2 layers [44–46]. In addition, the third cathodic band at 0.05V could be assigned to reversible alloying reaction of Ge with Li forming Li-Ge alloy [47, 48]. With respect to the reverse scan, two anodic peaks are clearly observed around 0.45 and 1.1 V which can be related to the delithiation of Li from the Li-Ge alloy and the decomposition GeO2 layer [49, 50]. It is worthy to point out that cathodic band at 0.5 V vanished in the succeeding cycles as it is only responsible for the SEI layer formation. It is also noted that the subsequent CV cycles showed super-imposed anodic and cathodic peaks suggesting the good cyclability and coulombic efficiency improvement as result of redox reactions reversibility. This behavior could be explained by the presence of nanosized LFGP spherical particles embedded in the glass matrix which increase the electronic conductivity and protect the formed Ge in the active material from further oxidation process as well as hindering the common pulverization problem [51, 52]. On the other hand, the CV profile of the LFGP HT24h electrode is shown at Fig. 12 (b). Obviously, the first cathodic scan direction showed the formation of the same three peaks at 0.43, 0.35 and 0.05 V. As previously discussed, both weak bands appeared at 0.43 and 0.05 are related to the formation of SEI layer and Li-Ge alloy, respectively. The most intense current peak at 0.35 V suggests the conversion of higher extent of Ge4+ into undesired amorphous LixGeO2 layer. The positive scan confirmed the strength of the electrolyte reaction of with Ge forming amorphous LixGeO2 by evolution of anodic peak  at 1.1 V. Notably, very weak anodic bands appeared at 0.46 V during the first and subsequent cycles suggesting the hardness of delithiation of Li+ ions from the Li-Ge alloy. Besides, the appearance of new anodic peak at 1.9 V during the 2nd and 3rd cycles as a result of absence of glass matrix which allow the re-oxidation of Ge metal into GeO2 again [50, 53].  
The ionic conductivity of the synthesized LFGP anodes can sufficiently studied by measuring the AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for the assembled cells (HT12h and HT24h) vs. Li/Li+ and cycled at room temperature as depicted in Fig. 13. In general, the EIS spectra (Nyquist plot) consists of two semicircles and an inclined straight line, where the first small semicircle at high frequency refers to the bulk resistance of electrode material (RS), the second large semicircle observed at medium frequency indicates the charge movement resistance (RCT) and the inclined line at low frequency corresponds to the Li+ ions diffusion from the electrolyte to the electrode/electrolyte interface (e.g. Warburg impedance, ZW) [54–56]. Fig. 13 (a) represents the Nyquist plots for the LFGP anodes after the 5th cycle. It is also known that the storage capacity and rate capability are mainly depend on the Li+ ions diffusion kinetics between the electrolyte the electrode interface. Therefore, it can be noted that the LFGP HT24h cell shows the EIS spectra with the lowest values of RS, RCT and ZW which indicates the best ionic conductivity during the first five charge-discharge cycles among other LFGP electrodes.  Table 4 summarizes the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy fitting parameters for the assembled LFGP cells after 5th cycles. Apparently, the LFGP HT12h cell exhibits the second order after LFGP HT24h cell in terms of RS and ZW that could be related the nanosized spherical particles and efficient coverage with glass matrix that contributes in improved the electrochemical performance upon cycling. Therefore, to explain the enhanced cycling stability of the LFGP HT12h cell, the EIS results are compared after cycling the cell for 1, 5, 20, 35 and 50 cycles as illustrated in Fig. 13 (b) and listed in Table 5. It is found that the diameter of medium frequency semicircle decreased by further cycling up to 20 and 35 cycles, which indicates the enhancement in the charge transport characteristics resulting in better reversibility and improved coulombic efficiency upon galvanostatic cycling. Such observation is explained by the enhanced electronic and ionic conductivity of LFGP by cationic substitution with Fe3+ and the structural stabilization of active material caused by glass matrix protection that could be beneficial for excellent energy storage behavior [50, 51, 57].     Accordingly, the cyclability and coulombic efficiency of LFGP glass ceramic anode obtained by HT for 12 h are evaluated for 50 cycles at 50 mAg-1 current density is given by Fig. 14. It can be concluded that LFGP HT12h cell displays good reversible capacity retention about 57.5, 91.4, 94.7 and 96.4 and 97.9% after the 1st, 5th, 20th, 35th and 50th charge-discharge cycles, respectively. Therefore, the enhanced cyclability and high capacity retention are associated to many reasons including the presence of large cell volume, nanosized crystals and cation vacancies which allow huge and fast Li+ ions diffusion as well as the existence of glass phase shells around the LFGP crystals which hinder the structure pulverization problems.   
New glass ceramic nanocomposites of LFGP NASICON-type structure were successfully synthesized by crystallization of LFGP parent glass for different durations to develop the electrochemical performance of glass ceramic LFGP NASICON-based anode materials for LIBs. The amorphous essence of the LFGP parent glass was affirmed via XRD technique. XRD results also affirmed the creation of the NASICON phase in the investigated LFGP glass ceramics obtained by HT for different durations. Additionally, the structural of LFGP glass ceramics samples explained via Rietveld refinement executed via Fullprof software and the structure refinement parameters are determined. Furthermore, TEM, SEM and FTIR affirmed the creation of NASICON-type structure. The glass ceramic NASCON-type electrode generated by HT for various durations caused the conductivity to increase up to 10-3 order. The LFGP HT24h anode delivered the highest specific discharge capacity of about with 78.8% capacity retention of its initial theoretical capacity. The CV curves manifested the enhanced cyclability of the LFGP HT12h anode in comparison with the LFGP HT24h anode. The co-existence of cation vacancies and glass matrix in the LFGP sample HT for 12 h significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance, accelerated the Li+ ions diffusion rates and hindered the active materials pulverization problems. The LFGP HT12h anode retained about 24% of its initial discharge and possessed excellent coloumbic efficieny of about 97.9 % after 50 charge-discharge cycles at 50 mAg-1 current density.
