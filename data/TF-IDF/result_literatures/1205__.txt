A new solvothermal strategy combined with calcination has been developed to synthesize NaTi2(PO4)3‚Äì graphene nanocomposites. X-ray diÔ¨Äraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Ô¨Åeld-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were performed to characterize their found that NASICON-type structured NaTi2(PO4)3 microstructures and morphologies. nanoparticles with highly crystallinity were homogeneously anchored on the surface of conducting graphene nanosheets, forming a two-dimensional hybrid nanoarchitecture. A possible growth mechanism was also discussed based on time-dependent experiments. When used as anode materials for Na-ion batteries, the nanocomposites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with highrate capability and excellent cycling stability in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The electrode delivered  1 at 2, 5, 10 and 20 C, respectively, and still retained high speciÔ¨Åc capacities of 110, 85, 65, 40 mA h g 90% of the initial capacity after 100 cycles at 2 C.

Li-ion batteries have become prime candidates for applications such as portable electronics and electric vehicles owing to their high energy density and output voltage among all rechargeable battery technologies currently in use.1‚Äì4 Recently, Na-based compounds have made a comeback because of controversial debates regarding the basis of elemental abundance in the Earth's crust and higher cost to obtain Li.5‚Äì7 A variety of anode carbon-based compounds,8 organic materials, compounds,9 oxides,10 sulÓÑÉdes11 and alloys,12 have been reported for application in Na-ion batteries. However, only a few reports have been published for storage properties of sodium in NASICON-type titanium phosphate,13,14 which has a structure similar to a well-known family of Na+ superionic conductors with an open 3D framework structure having the formula AnM2(XO4)3 (A ¬º alkali, M ¬º transition metal, X ¬º Si4+, P5+, S6+, Mo6+, etc.).7,15

The NASICON-type phase consists of an open 3D framework of TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, where 2 TiO6 octahedra are separated by 3 PO4 tetrahedra, with which they have shared all their corner oxygens but no edges or faces. The structure can form the so-called ‚Äúlantern‚Äù units, all along the c-axis direction, and conduction channels are generated along the same direction.13,16 In the structure, alkali ions can occupy two diÔ¨Äerent sites. At low alkali content (n # 1) in an octahedral site, A(1) is preferably occupied, whose coordinates are 6b (0, 0, 0). However, when n > 1, the alkali ions are distributed among the A(1) and three 8-coordinate sites, A(2), whose coordinates are 18e (x, 0, 1/4).7,17‚Äì19 The NASICON-type structure allows easy ions between A(1) and A(2).7,13‚Äì19 migration of Although the open 3D framework of NASICON-type structure is suitable for Na+ diÔ¨Äusion, its poor electronic conductivity restrains slow transport of Na+. To improve the electrochemical performance of NaTi2(PO4)3, two common methods of tailoring the particle size of electroactive materials to reduce both the ionic and electronic transporting path and enhancing their electronic conductivity with surface carbon-coating layers have been tried.

The electrochemical performance of the NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode for sodium extraction/insertion has been reported,13 in which the large voltage diÔ¨Äerence between charge and discharge curves indicates that strong polarizations occur, partially due to low electronic conductivity. Tremendous eÔ¨Äorts have been made to overcome the obstacles of NaTi2(PO4)3, such as applying nanostructured materials and surface coating with conductive materials.14,20,21 Recently, mechanical milling and carbothermal treatment have been used for improvement of the electric conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3, which has a similar positive  1) eÔ¨Äect on the initial speciÓÑÉc capacity (approx. 143.0 mA h g  1).14 compared with that of bulk samples (only 129.3 mA h g Nanostructured materials lead to a decrease of the current density per unit surface area and an increase in the charge‚Äì discharge rate, because the high surface areas increases the electrolyte/electrode areas. Moreover, nano-size provides a shorter path for ion and electron transport, which facilitates improved kinetics.

Graphene, a new two-dimensional carbon material, has been considered to be a potential material for use in energy conversion and storage because of its superior electrical conductivity, high surface area, chemical tolerance, ultrathin thickness and structural ÓÑÑexibility.23,24 Among these applications, graphene has been used by forming composites or hybrids as a highly electronic conductive network in the ÓÑÉeld of rechargeable batteries.20‚Äì22 Recently, improvement on cycling stability and rate performance was reported when some anode materials and Na3V2(PO4)3 were supported by graphene.

In this work, we present the preparation of NaTi2(PO4)3‚Äì (NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS) nanocomposites graphene nanosheets through a solvothermal method. In this method, for the ÓÑÉrst time, highly crystalline NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs with an optimal particle size are homogeneously anchored on the surface of conducting GNS. The eÔ¨Äect of diÔ¨Äerent reaction times on the physico-chemical properties of NaTi2(PO4)3 was studied, and a possible growth mechanism was also proposed. Electrochemical results show that only 3.4 wt% of graphene in the nanocomposites leads to remarkable improvement of speciÓÑÉc capacity, rate performance and cycling stability.

All reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powders (SP-1) by a modiÓÑÉed Hummers method,30 in which pre-oxidation of graphite is followed by oxidation with Hummers' method (see ESI‚Ä†). For the synthesis of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites, 100 mg of GO was dispersed into 40 mL of ethylene glycol (EG) aÓÇùer ultrasonication for 4 h to form the mixture. Then, 10 mL of NH3$H2O (28 wt%) and 3.4 mL of tetrabutyl titanate (TiOB) were added to the mixture under constant agitation (denoted as Ti‚Äì O/GNS). AÓÇùer stirring for 1 h, 1725.5 mg of NH4H2PO4 in 10 mL of distilled water and 265 mg of Na2CO3 in 10 mL of distilled water were added (denoted as Ti‚ÄìP‚ÄìO/GNS and Na‚ÄìTi‚ÄìP‚ÄìO/ GNS, respectively). The resulting white gel was then transferred into an 80 mL TeÓÑÑon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at C for 24 h. AÓÇùer cooling to room temperature (RT) natu140 rally, the obtained product was separated by centrifugation and washed several times with de-ionized (DI) water and ethanol to remove excess hydroxides before drying at 80 C for 12 h. Subsequently, the dried sample was calcinated at 700 C for 2 h  1 in a nitrogen atmosphere to at a heating rate of 2 obtain highly crystalline NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS powders. The pure NaTi2(PO4)3 was prepared in a manner similar to that of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS, except for the absence of GNS in the process.

The crystalline phase of the prepared samples was characterized by powder X-ray diÔ¨Äraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 advance) with Cu Ka radiation and Sol-X detector from 2q ¬º 10‚Äì80 at 40 kV and 40 mA. The XRD proÓÑÉles were reÓÑÉned by the Rietveld program RIETAN-FP.31 Schematic illustrations of the crystal structures of NaTi2(PO4)3 phase were drawn using the program VESTA.32 Microstructural properties were obtained using ÓÑÉeld-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, FEI Nova Nano SEM 430), transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS, JEM-2100, JEOL), and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Seiko Instrument, SPA-300HV). Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses were performed on a TG instrument (NETZSCH STA 409 PC) using a heating rate of 5 C min scanning

The electrochemical performances of the synthesized samples were measured with a beaker-type three-electrode cell. The working electrode was fabricated by compressing a mixture of 80 wt% active materials, 15 wt% acetylene black and 5 wt% polytetraÓÑÑuoroethylene binder by weight onto a graphite electrode with 1 cm2 area. Graphite electrode was selected as the current collector because of its high overpotential for hydrogen evolution. A commercial saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode, and a piece of platinum foil (1 cm2) was used as the counter electrode in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution purged with N2 before use as electrolyte (made  1 electrical resistivity). Cyclic from DI water with 18 MU cm voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (ChenHua, Shanghai, China). Galvanostatic charging‚Äìdischarging experiments were conducted on LAND tester (Wuhan, China) at RT.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of pure NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS. The pure NaTi2(PO4)3 (Fig. 1(a)) has several very sharp diÔ¨Äraction peaks at 2q ¬º 14.52  , 20.98 ,   24.30 , corre, 46.70 sponding to (012), (104), (110), (113), (202), (024), (116), (300), (128) and (226) planes of well-crystallized rhombohedral space group: R3c (167), respectively, which is the same as that of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS (Fig. 1(b)). This conÓÑÉrmed the successful synthesis of highly crystalline NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 (JCPDS no. 85-2265) phase through the solvothermal method combined with a short post-annealing. However, typical diÔ¨Äraction peaks of reduced graphite oxide (RGO) were not observed in the XRD pattern of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites. This may be due to the low content of RGO and the high crystallinity of NaTi2(PO4)3 in the nanocomposites. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was used to determine the amount

NASICON-type structure in space group R3c (no. 167); cell parameters: a ¬º 8.4845 (3) ÀöA, c ¬º 21.8117 (5) ÀöA, V ¬º 1359.809 (8) ÀöA3 and Z ¬º 6; Rwp ¬º 8.79%, Rp ¬º 6.73%, RI ¬º 2.54%, S ¬º 1.44

Scheme 1 shows the schematic illustration of the NASICONtype structure. As shown in Scheme 1, two positions of interstitial spaces (A1 and A2), in which conductor cations are distributed inside the channels can be distinguished: one (A1) in elongated octahedral oxygen environment at the intersection of three conduction channels, and the other (A2) among the (A1) and three 8-coordinate sites environment at each bend of the conduction channels.13‚Äì19 In the absence of motion, Na+ preferably occupies the octahedral A1 site, whose coordinates are 6b (0, 0, 0). When a reversible chemical intercalation of Na+ in NaTi2(PO4)3, Na+ actually occupies octahedral A2 site, whose coordinates are 18e (0.6368, 0, 0.25).17‚Äì19 Two Na+ can be reversibly intercalated in the 3D framework of NaTi2(PO4)3. As a matter of fact the NaTi2(PO4)3 phase could be considered as the charged form of a positive intercalation electrode with Na3Ti2(PO4)3 playing the role of the discharge species.

The morphology of the synthesized samples was observed by FESEM. Fig. 3 displays the morphological features of pure NaTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS. As observed from Fig. 3(a) and (b), the NaTi2(PO4)3 sample prepared in the absence of GNS consisted of irregularly aggregated NPs with size in the range of 100‚Äì200 nm. These irregular NPs were interconnected with each other and formed numerous inter-particle mesopores and/or macropores. In Fig. 3(c) and (d), it can be seen that NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs were homogeneously anchored on conducting GNS, forming a two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure, and the GNS were separated by the NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs. It is worth noting that such a combination will perfectly facilitate the transport of Na+ and increase the electrolyte/electrode contact area.34 Moreover

The result indicates that the hybrid materials have a chemical composition of 96.6 wt% NaTi2(PO4)3 and 3.4 wt% GNS.

The Rietveld method was performed to reÓÑÉne the crystal structure of pure NaTi2(PO4)3 by RIETAN-FP soÓÇùware. Initially, the common overall parameters, zero shiÓÇù, unit-cell parameters, half-width, background, scale fact and pseudo-Voigt coefÓÑÉcient were reÓÑÉned. The atomic positions of Ti, P and O atoms were reÓÑÉned in the 12c (0, 0, z), 18e (x, 0, 1/4) and 36f ((x, y, z), (x, y, z)) WyckoÔ¨Ä positions, respectively. Na+ was assumed to occupy the A1 site (6b (0, 0, 0) position). Then, all reÓÑÉnements give a small value for factors Rwp, Rp and S, indicative of a good and reliable structural analysis. The resulting Rietveld reÓÑÉnement pattern and the resultant parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively. The NASICON-type phase has the lattice parameters of a ¬º 8.4845 (3) ÀöA, c ¬º 21.8117 (5) ÀöA, V ¬º 1359.809 (8) ÀöA3. The atomic positions of Ti (0, 0, 0.1451), P (0.2873, 0, 1/4), O1 (0.1738, 0.9715, 0.1921), and O2 (0.1941, 0.1652, 0.0859) were obtained from the reÓÑÉnement, and the values are close to those reported in earlier references.33

ions.36,37 To further investigate the distribution of NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs and GNS, a bright ÓÑÉeld STEM image and elemental mapping of the corresponding region are shown in Fig. 3(g), indicating spatial distribution of C, P, O, Ti and Na. The P, O, Ti and Na were uniformly distributed over the surface of the NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs and the images overlapped with each other. Moreover, the distributions of these chemical elements were in the range of the EDS mapping of C, which were consistent with targeted NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS structure. EDS mapping indicated that the atomic ratio of Na to Ti is 1 : 2. The Na/Ti ratio of the NPs is the same as that of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS.

In order to investigate the formation mechanism of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites, each process in the experiment was carefully conducted. The experimental details are presented in the materials synthesis section. The overall fabrication procedures of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites are schematically illustrated in Scheme 2. Firstly, GO with a thickness of 2.0 nm (Fig. S2, ESI‚Ä†) was dispersed into the EG under ultrasonication. Next, NH3$H2O and TIOB were added successively to the solution under constant agitation. The anatase and rutile TiO2 phases (Fig. S3a, ESI‚Ä†) can be detected for the product obtained aÓÇùer solvothermal treatment, and then following calcination at 700 C for 2 h. Thus, TiO2 NPs were anchored on RGO by controlled hydrolysis of TIOB in the presence of GO (Fig. S3b, ESI‚Ä†). Then, NH4H2PO4 aqueous solution was subsequently added. It can be found that the typical diÔ¨Äraction peaks of anatase and rutile TiO2 phases disappear, while the Ti5P4O20 phase (JCPDS no. 49-1139) appears aÓÇùer calcination, which indicates that the starting TiO2 completely converted in situ into a ternary Ti5P4O20 phase (Fig. S4a, ESI‚Ä†). The Ti5P4O20 NPs were also anchored on RGO by solvothermal treatment, followed by calcination (Fig. S4b, ESI‚Ä†). Finally, the intermediate Ti5P4O20 product in situ transformed into the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS precursor (a quaternary Na‚Äì Ti‚ÄìP‚ÄìO) with the addition Na2CO3 aqueous solution. In order to further the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites, oÔ¨Ä-stoichiometric Na2CO3 was taken into consideration in the process. Surprisingly, the main NaTi2(PO4)3 phase (JCPDS no. 85-2265) and the small amount of TiPO4 phase (JCPDS no. 38-1468) can be detected in the product (Fig. S5a, ESI‚Ä†). The diÔ¨Äerence in the structures of the ternary Ti5P4O20 and TiPO4 phases is caused by Na2CO3. Similarly, the NaTi2(PO4)3 and TiPO4 NPs were also anchored on RGO by the same process (Fig. S5b, ESI‚Ä†).

To examine the eÔ¨Äectiveness of GNS for improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode, the Na+ extraction/ insertion properties of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS nanocomposites and pure NaTi2(PO4)3 were investigated. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were taken in 1 M Na2SO4 at a voltage ranging from  1.0 to  0.5 V at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s  1. As shown in Fig. 4(a), a pair of redox peaks located at  0.89 (red.) and should be pointed out that during the solvothermal process, the NPs are strongly anchored on the surface of GNS with a high density, suggesting a strong interaction between NPs and GNS. The strong anchoring of NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs on GNS enables rapid electron transport through the underlying GNS to NPs, resulting in superior rate capability.35 To examine the microstructure of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS more clearly, the sample was further investigated by TEM. As observed in Fig. 3(e) and (f), a very large quantity of NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs with sizes of 50 nm are uniformly dispersed onto the GNS, and some of them aggregate together, which is in good agreement with the SEM observation (Fig. 3(c) and (d)). This result strongly indicates that GNS plays a significant role in controlling the morphology by acting as the nucleation site for deposits through interaction with metal


Scheme 2 Schematic illustration of the synthesis of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS.

 0.75 V (ox.) (vs. SCE) were observed for NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS, and similar peaks were observed at  0.85 V (red.) and  0.79 V (ox.) for the pure NaTi2(PO4)3, which indicates the reversible insertion/extraction reaction of Na+ in the NaTi2(PO4)3 lattice. The redox potential was consistent with the previous report on NaTi2(PO4)3.38 When NaTi2(PO4)3 is charged and discharged, it undergoes the following reaction: √æ √æ 2e  

The smaller potential diÔ¨Äerences between oxidation‚Äìreduction peaks of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS compared with pure NaTi2(PO4)3 could be attributed to the variation of cell impedance. Corresponding to the extraction/insertion process of Na+ in the NASICON-type structured NaTi2(PO4)3, a couple of strong and well-deÓÑÉned oxidation‚Äìreduction peaks for Ti3+ and Ti4+ can be easily observed for the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS,14,38 but not for pure NaTi2(PO4)3. The peak currents of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS are about 6.0 and 4.5 mA, which are much higher than those of pure NaTi2(PO4)3. Indeed, the Na+ diÔ¨Äusion coeÔ¨Écient is propor2) in the CV proÓÑÉles; tional to the square of the peak current (ip thus, higher peak current means higher Na-ion diÔ¨Äusion coefÓÑÉcient and consequently, better electrochemical performance of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS anode material. The obvious peaks in the CV curves of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS were due to the functionality of GNS. Moreover, the good overlap of the curves for the subsequent cycles suggests that NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS is more stable than pure NaTi2(PO4)3 in aqueous electrolytes.

In addition, it was found that the redox reaction could take place at potentials much more positive than the H2 evolution potential of water, which generally occurs below  1.16 V vs.

SCE, in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte at pH ¬º 7.14 The low Na+ insertion/extraction potential is located at the lower limit of the electrochemical window of the aqueous electrolyte. Thus, it should be suitable to use the NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS as a promising anode material for Na-ion batteries.14,20,21,38

Based on the abovementioned results, only the NaTi2(PO4)3‚Äì GNS electrode was further investigated for the charge‚Äìdischarge cycling performance at 2 C for 100 cycles (shown in Fig. 4(b)). The NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS exhibited excellent cycling performance. The  1, and discharge capacity in the ÓÑÉrst cycle was 104.4 mA h g aÓÇùer 100 charge‚Äìdischarge cycles, the capacity remained at  1, which indicates that the discharge capacity loss was 99.9 mA h g less than 4.3%. However, pure NaTi2(PO4)3 samples synthesized in the absence of GNS presented poor electrochemical performances (inset, Fig. 4(b)). The discharge capacity of pure NaTi2(PO4)3 in the  1 and decreased steeply with ÓÑÉrst cycle was only 18.1 mA h g increasing cycle number. Calculated from the discharge capacity‚Äì charge capacity, the coulombic eÔ¨Éciency in this long cycle period almost remained constant at about 90%. This result may be attributed to the stability of NASICON-type crystal structure of NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS,13,14 which possesses good crystallinity, the electronic conductivity of the GNS and the high ionic conductivity,23 which was consistent with that of the extraction/insertion reaction in the aqueous electrolyte as expected in CV curves.

Above 100 cycles at 2 C, the morphology of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚Äì GNS samples aÓÇùer discharge was observed. As can be seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b), the samples maintained the previous morphological features of NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs, in sizes in the range from 40 to 60 nm, and they were still strongly anchored on the surface of GNS with a high density. To further examine the structure of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS, the samples were investigated by STEM and EDS mapping, as shown in Fig. 5(c). The results suggested that the chemical elements of P, O, Ti and Na were homogeneously distributed over the range of the C element aÓÇùer 100 cycles. In addition, the EDS analysis indicated that the atomic ratio of Na : Ti is close to 3 : 2, which was consistent with the reaction mechanism mentioned above. The discharge product of NaTi2(PO4)3 was also in accordance with previous reports.13,20

Moreover, the high-rate capabilities of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS electrode was investigated (Fig. 6(a)). The electrode was progressively charged‚Äìdischarged in serial stages with the diÔ¨Äerent current rates from 2 to 20 C. A speciÓÑÉc discharge capacity is  1 obtained at a rate of 2 C, and the speciÓÑÉc around 110 mA h g  1 at rates of 5 and discharge capacity reduced to 85 and 65 mA h g 10 C, respectively. At the high rate of 20 C, the speciÓÑÉc discharge  1. AÓÇùer 120 cycles, the capacity decreased to about 40 mA h g

anode materials for Na-ion batteries. BeneÓÑÉting from the good conductivity, high surface area of GNS and the good stability of NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs with high crystallinity, the unique structures endow the composites with ultra-fast charge capability, high reversible capacity and long cycle life. Furthermore, the characteristics of natural abundance and operating in safe, inexpensive and highly conductive aqueous electrolytes make the nanocomposites especially desirable for use in high-performance energy storage devices.

 1, electrode can still deliver a reversible capacity of 105 mA h g which was further charged‚Äìdischarged at 2 C for another 30 cycles. The galvanostatic charge‚Äìdischarge curves of the NaTi2(PO4)3‚Äì GNS electrode at diÔ¨Äerent current rates from 2 to 20 C are shown in Fig. 6(b). The charge and discharge capacity was approximately  1 at a rate of 2 C, respectively. In addition, 100 and 117 mA h g the electrode had a clear discharge voltage plateau at a potential of around  0.85 V vs. SCE, which was consistent with the CV curves as shown in Fig. 4(a). With increasing current density, the electrode voltage decreased steeply and the speciÓÑÉc discharge  1 at rates of 5, 10 and capacities were 86.7, 62.4 and 41.5 mA h g 20 C, respectively. The NaTi2(PO4)3‚ÄìGNS exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with high-rate capability, which may be attributed to the NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs being well dispersed onto GNS as spacers to eÔ¨Äectively prevent the agglomerative NPs in the nanohybrids and consequently, to keep their large active contact area between the electrode and electrolyte.24

In summary, we report a simple solvothermal route to fabricate NaTi2(PO4)3 NPs composed of RGO, and their use as advanced
