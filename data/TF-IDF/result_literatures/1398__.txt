The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical workstation were employed to study the structural, morphology and electrical properties of the samples heat-treated at different temperatures. The results showed that: the glass-ceramics consist of the dominating LiTi2(PO4)3 phases, trifle AlPO4, TiO2 and unknown phases. With the heat-treatment temperature increasing from 700 °C to 1100 °C, the structure of glass-ceramic become denser and grain grew, lithium ion conductivity increased quickly and subsequent cut down gradually. While the specimen was obtained by crystallization at 900  °C for 12 h, the total conductivity of glass-ceramic material come up to the maximum (5.85 ×10-4 S·cm-1) at 25  °C. This inorganic solid electrolyte has a potential application in lithium batteries or other devices. Introduction With the development of solid ionic devices such as CMOS, FE-RAM, liquid crystal displays, microelectronics devices and smart windows, more and more people are concerned about the micro-power devices with high energy density. In order to improve the security and reliability of the devices, solid electrolytes as a key material of all-solid-state energy devices have extensive potential applications and arouse people’s attention and research, such as oxide fuel cell, proton exchange membrane, humidity sensitive cells, chemical sensors, high density rechargeable battery and electrochromic devices. In the nearly three decades, application of inorganic solid electrolyte materials in battery is a hot spot of research in the worldwide, especially the system of lithium conductive ion. Compared with liquid electrolyte, chalcogenide glass and polymer electrolyte, inorganic solid oxide electrolytes have the advantages of high temperature resistance, water stability, non-toxic, no pollution to environment, non-radioactivity, high energy density and high open circuit voltage [1-4]. Recently, the lithium titanium phosphate (LiTi2(PO4)3) lithium-ion conductor analogies to the structure of NASICON (NaZr2P3O12) have been extensively studied, mainly because of their many potential advantages such as high ionic conductivity, easy to manufacture, electrochemical window stability [5, 6], especially suitable for high energy density lithium ionic battery [7-9]. In this structure, the partial Al3+ replacement for Ti4+ offers more lithium ion tunnel and the ionic conductivity at room temperature come up to 7×10-4 S·cm-1 [10], which is the same order of magnitude with some commercial polymer/liquid electrolytes. The preparation methods of lithium titanium phosphate solid electrolytes include the traditional sintering method [11], sol-gel [12], laser ablation [13], spark plasma sintering (SPS) [9], or crystallization of glass [14, 15]. Lithium ion conductive glass-ceramic prepared by glass-melting and later crystallizations or sintering is polycrystalline material containing conductive crystal and residual glass phase composition, belongs to a new type of solid electrolyte. The research on it began in the 1990s, the ionic conductivity of Al-incorporated LiTi2(PO4)3 glass-ceramics prepared by crystallization of glass come up to 10-3 S·cm-1 at room temperature. In this paper, lanthanum and Key Engineering Materials Vol. 509

aluminum incorporated LiTi2(PO4)3 glass was fabricated by melting and quenching, the influence of heat-treating temperature on the structure, morphology and electrical properties of glass-ceramics are discussed. Experimental  The original glass with composition of 14 Li2O-6 Al2O3-3 La2O3-38 TiO2-39 P2O5 in molar ratio was prepared by the melt quenching method using chemical reagents Li2CO3, Al(OH)3, La2O3, TiO2 and NH4H2PO4 as raw materials. After mixed, the batch of about 70 g was melted in electrical furnace using corundum crucible according to the following schedule, heating to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min and held for 1 h, then raised to 1450 °C at a rate of 5 °C /min and kept for another 2 h. The melt was poured onto preheated steel plate quickly, and pressed into chips about 2 mm thick by another steel plate. Subsequently, the transparent brown glass annealed at 550 °C for 6 h in a muffle furnace and natural cooled to room temperature. The brown color is attributed to the presence of Ti3+. Then the annealed glass slices was crystallized at 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 °C for 12 h, then cooled to room temperature naturally, respectively. The handled samples were cut, ground and polished into a 10 ×10 ×1.5 mm sheet for test. Utilizing the STA449c/3/G thermal analyzer (DSC, Netzsch, Germany) to do differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test in the temperature range 100---1000 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C /min, the glass transition (Tg) and crystallization (Tx) temperatures of the glass were characterized. The morphology and microstructure were observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-5610V, JEOL Ltd., Japan). The phase structure for the glass and glass-ceramics was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation and X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) at voltage 40 kV, current 50 mA, scaning speed 4 °/min, step width 0.02° and 2θ scanning from 10 to 70º. To measure the electrochemical properties, an ~1 µm thick silver slurry was coated on both sides of these specimens and subsequently dried at 200 °C for 2 h. The ionic conductivity of glass and glass-ceramic slices was tested by electrochemical workstation (CHI 760d) using a.c. impedance analyzer with a frequency range from 1 to 106 Hz. Results and discussion Fig. 1 shows the DSC curve of 14 Li2O-6 Al2O3-3 La2O3-38 TiO2-39 P2O5 glass, showing Tg to be 613 °C and Tx to be 657.6 °C. The difference ∆T between Tx and Tg is only 44.6 °C due to the larger content of TiO2, meaning the glass forming ability is poor and easy to crystallization. The DSC curve shows two exothermic peaks for crystallization with a stronger at 669.3 °C and a weaker at 720.0 °C, meaning the glass-ceramic contains not only a main crystalline phase but also other crystalline phases.   Fig.1 DSC curve of 14 Li2O-6 Al2O3-3 La2O3-38 TiO2-39 P2O5 glass Due to the small ∆T, one step crystallization was used. The glass was treated by heating in the range of 700---1100 °C for 12 h which are higher than glass transition temperature. Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the original glass and glass-ceramics. The XRD pattern of the glass shows a broad smooth halo and no obvious diffraction peak was found, indicating the fully amorphous state. After 316

heat-treatment at different temperatures, significant diffraction peaks appear, the main crystalline phase is attributed to LiTi2(PO4)3 [14] similar to lithium-analogue NASICON structure (JCPDS card 35-0754) and the other minor peaks belong to AlPO4, TiO2 and unknown crystalline phase. The glass-ceramic contains at least two crystalline phases as predicted from the DSC curve. Meanwhile, with the increase of heat-treating temperature, grains grow up, thus the intensity of diffraction peaks increase and the peak width decreases gradually, which illustrates the devitrification degree enhanced accordingly. When the crystallization temperature rises to above 900 °C, TiO2 phase began to devitrify and its diffraction peak significantly increased. At the same time, the glass contained a variety of ingredients, the diffraction peaks of La2O3 maybe overlap with LiTi2(PO4)3 or other crystal phase, it is difficult to distinguish the existence of La2O3 due to testing technology.  Fig.2 XRD patterns of the glass and glass-ceramics annealed at 700, 800, 900, 1000 and 1100 °C, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the fractured surface morphologies for the glass and glass-ceramics prepared at different heat-treatment temperatures. It can be seen that there is no crack, uniform, dense texture without formation of grain for the glass sample from Fig. 3a. Whereas, with the gradual elevation of crystallizing temperature from 700 °C to 1100 °C, the morphology and the microstructure in Fig. 3b-f displayed that the grains grew up gradually and distributed inhomogeneous, the average grain size became larger gradually. It means that the higher the crystalline temperature, crystallization is more complete, grains overlapped each other, thus the grain boundary decreased accordingly. Meanwhile, the unexpected phases such as AlPO4, TiO2 and other unknown phases lied in the microstructure and mainly distributed into the grain boundaries [16] which accord with the above discuss.     Key Engineering Materials Vol. 509

Here only a semicircle was observed and another semicircle is difficult to identify, which need to be measured at a low temperature (<-10 °C) and higher frequencies (>1 MHz) [13]. Due to the restraint of electrochemical workstation (the upper limit for the electrochemical workstation CHI760D is 1 MHz), it cannot be measured at higher frequencies, so it is not discussed in this paper. In addition, the inclined diagonal at low frequency illustrated the samples belong to pure ionic conductor on the whole and the electrical conductivity can be neglected. Meanwhile, the impedance semicircle is not complete and was depressed, this phenomenon can be explained by the “concept of mismatch and relaxation” (CMR) [17], which is based on the model of “jump relaxation” [18]. It is assumed that each mobile ion has a vacancy around it, other ions is present in the little far position. The effective potential of each ion consists of two parts: a static potential come from the three-dimensional network structure and the dynamic potential barrier varied with time caused by the mobile of adjacent ion. The mobile ion jumping to its neighboring sites leads to the mismatch to the momentary arrangement of its mobile surrounding ions. To reduce the mismatch, the adjacent ions may be recombined or the mobile ion jumps back. This explains the forwardbackward correlation of successive jumps, thus the dispersion phenomenon occurred in the impedance spectrum of ion conductive material. The ionic conductivity was calculated according to the following equation: σ = d/(R×A) [S·cm-1]                                                                                        (1) Where d is the electrolyte thickness, A the valid area and R the electrolyte resistance which could be fitted by Zview software for complex data analysis. The calculated ionic conductivities of samples were shown in Fig. 5, the original glass had lowest ionic conductivity, yet with the enhancement of crystallization temperature, the conductivity of glass-ceramic increased fast at first and subsequently decreased gradually, the maximum value at room temperature come up to 5.85 × 10-4 S·cm-1 for the glass-ceramic prepared at 900 °C. According to the calculated conductivity data, the variation of ionic conductivities with the absolute temperature meets the Arrhrenius relationship: 0exp()aETKTσσ−=                                                                                               (2) Where Ea is the activation energy, T the absolute temperature, k the gas constant and σ0 the pre-exponential factor. In accordance with Eq. (1) and Eq. (2), the room temperature ionic conductivity, activation energy and pre-exponential factor were calculated and listed in Table 1. The original glass possesses the highest activation energy and minimum ionic conductivity, whereas the ionic conductivity of glass-ceramic increased significantly after heat treatment at different temperatures. This is because that glass-ceramics consist of main crystal phase LiTi2(PO4)3 with channels suitable for lithium-ion migration, while the glass with disordered structure has no such channel, the ionic conductivities of glass-ceramics increased significantly compared with the glass. Combining with XRD and SEM analysis, with the increase of heat-treating temperature, grains grew 318

up and grain boundary decreases, contains more main crystal phase, thus the microstructure was more suitable for lithium ion migration, so the ionic conductivity increased. In addition, combined the ionic conductivity with activation energy, the smaller the activation energy of sample, the higher the ionic conductivity is. This was due to the smaller the Ea, the smaller the barrier to be overcome for lithium ion migration, and more easily to transmit, and therefore the ionic conductivity increased. Certainly, the pre-exponential factor related to the number density had an effect on the ionic transfers. After crystallization of as-cast glass to glass-ceramics, the density increased due to the reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. And yet the density of glass-ceramics samples obtained at different temperatures had little changes, its influence was negligible. When the temperature rises to above 900 °C, due to the increase in the dielectric phase AlPO4, TiO2 and other unknown phase, which could have a blocking effect mainly and space charge effects slightly [19], meanwhile the activation energy increased, thus resulted in the conductivity decline. Yet the mechanism for the influence of blocking effect, space charge effects or their synergistic effect of impurities on the conductivity required further in-depth study and discussion.
