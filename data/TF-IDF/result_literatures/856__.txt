In this research, VO43 substitution was used to improve electrochemical properties of the NasiconLi3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode material.

The VO43 substitution resulted in formation of a homogeneouscompound Li3Fe2(PO4)3-x(VO4)x in a composition range of x  0.45; further introduction of VO43 led toprecipitation of some other phases.

It was shown that the VO43 substituted samples presenteddischarging capacity higher than that of bare non-substituted Nasicon and the reported Ti4+ and Mn2+doped ones.

 The Li3Fe2(PO4)2.55(VO4)0.45 material exhibited excellent cycling stability and rate capability,and retained a capacity of 91.8 mAh g1 after 60 cycles at 2C charge-discharge rate.

This value is one of thehighest reported to date for the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 compound, and was about 48% higher than that of the latter.

The electrochemical performance enhancements for the VO43 substituted samples were attributed tothe reduction of charge transfer resistance, increase of electrical conductivity, and fast lithium iondiffusion behavior.

Hence, the obtained results proved that the VO43 anion substitution for PO43 is apowerful technique to improve the electrochemical performance of the studied Nasicon compound.

Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) with an ordered olivinestructure has attracted much attention as a promising new cathodematerial for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its superior capacityretention, thermal stability, nontoxicity, safety, and lower cost[1,2].

Despite these advantages, the following disadvantagesimpedes its wide application.

Firstly, the synthesis of LiFePO4 iscomplicated because of change of the oxidation state of iron andthe undesired impurity phases formation, such as Fe2O3 andLi3Fe2(PO4)3, which negatively affects its performance [3].

Furthermore, the rate capability of LiFePO4 is poor due to itslow intrinsic electronic conductivity and slow lithium diffusionkinetics within the material grains [4].

Similar to olivine LiFePO4, Nasicon Li3Fe2(PO4)3 owns theadvantages of iron compounds, such as low cost, low toxicity andnatural abundance.

Furthermore, Nasicon Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is a goodionic conductor due to the existence of large 3D tunnels and thelithium ions disorder in its structure [5], and Nasicon structuredLi3Fe2(PO4)3 is more stable than olivine LiFePO4 [6].

In addition, thesynthesis of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is easier than LiFePO4 due to thatLi3Fe2(PO4)3 can be prepared directly in air without worryingabout the oxidation of Fe2+ [7,8].

It should also be noted that inregard of the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple redox, 2 mol Li+ can be reversiblyextracted/intercalated from/into 1 mol of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, yielding in atheoretical capacity of 128 mAh g1.However, a low electronicconductivity of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (<108 S cm1) due to FeO6 isolated byPO43 limits its practical use [9].

In order to improve electrochemical activity of the Nasiconcompounds like Li3Fe2(PO4)3, cation doping is generally adopted inaddition to conventional methods such as reducing particle size ofthe active materials and dispersing carbon black with high surfacearea [6,10].

 Huang et al.[11,12] found that Ti4+ and Mn2+substitution for Fe3+ is effective to improve electrochemicalproperties of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 compound, and that the Li3-xFe2-xTix(PO4)3 cathode with x = 0.2 delivered a capacity of 100 mAh g1at 0.5C after the 20th cycle.

Though this value is one of the bestreported for the compound, it is below the expected application requirements for LIBs.

Mixed anion effect is generally used to improve ionicconductivity of ion-conducting glasses [13â€“16], it is found to alsobe effective to enhance electrochemical performance of electrodematerials such as Li1+xMn1.5Ni0.5O4-xFx spinels [17] and LixTiS2-zSezlayered compounds [18].

However, anion substitution is seldomadopted for such purposes for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [19].

Based on ourrecent research on an apparent increase in ionic conductivitycaused by the VO43 partial substitution for PO43 in the NasiconLi3Sc2(PO4)3 solid state electrolyte [20], in this work, we studiedthe effect of VO43 substitution on electrochemical property of theLi3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode material.

In this study, we investigated partial substitution of PO43 byVO43 in the Nasicon Li3Fe2(PO4)3 compound to prepare highperformance cathode for lithium-ion batteries.

It was shown thatthe VO43 anion substitution remarkably enhanced the ratecapability and cycling performance of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 via theimproved conductivity and lithium diffusion, favoring releasingthe stresses generated by the repetitive Li+ intercalations/extraction, which, consequently, led to a lower electrochemicalpolarization at high rate charge-discharge process.

Among thesubstituted samples, the Li3Fe2(PO4)2.55(VO4)0.45 shows the bestelectrochemical performance delivering a high initial capacity of96.6 mAh g1 and a reversible capacity of 91.8 mAh g1 after 60cycles when cycled at 2C rate.

These performance enhancementsprove the partial substitution of phosphor by vanadium inLi3Fe2(PO4)3 as a beneficial technique to remarkably improvereversible intercalation/extraction of Li+; and the electrochemicalproperties exhibited by Li3Fe2(PO4)2.55(VO4)0.45 prepared in thiswork make it a promising cathode for high performance lithiumion batteries.
