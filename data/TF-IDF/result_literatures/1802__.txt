Phosphates, which are characterized by framework — n   anionic structures  containing  mixed T2（PO4）3n-  anionic groups, where n  is the framework charge varying from groups, where  0 to 4 and   are elements in oxidation states from +1 to T +5,  form  a  large  group  of  inorganic  compounds. All possible formula types of the frameworks of such compounds  were  described  in.  Calculations  revealed 24 possible types. Such frameworks can exist in several structural modiﬁcations, one of which is the lang-beinite structure type. This, like the NaZr2(PO4)3(NZP) structure type, contains the topological unit [T2(PO4)3] consisting of two TO6 octahedra and three PO4 tetrahe-dra linked to each other by shared oxygen atoms. Large cavities  in  the  langbeinite  structure  can  be  occupied (two  positions)  by  charge-compensating  cations.  For . The extraframethe langbeinite framework,  work positions can be occupied by cations in oxidation states of +1 and +1 if  = 3, and +1   =  4.  
Phosphates  with  the [T2(PO4)3]2– framework  have  been  studied  in  most detail and are well described in the literature. T2 = RM, where R are trivalent Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ga, Y, Er, Yb, and Bi cations, and M are tetravalent Ti, Zr, Sn, and Hf cations. Sodium and potassium ions serve as cations compensating for the framework charge n = 2.
These compounds are Na2RTi(PO4)3 , R =Fe or Cr; K2RTi(PO4)3 , R = Ti, V, Y, Er, or Yb; K2RZr(PO4)3 , R = Fe, Y, or Gd; K2RHf(PO4)3 , R = Ga, Fe, Cr, or Bi; and K2RSn(PO4)3 , R = Ga, Fe, or Cr [9]. All these compounds crystallize in the cubic system within the sp. gr. P213.
It should be noted that most of these compounds contain potassium in cavities. At the same time, no compounds with NZP-type frameworks of the composition [RM(PO4)3]2– containing either potassium or larger alkali cations are known. Presumably, the cavities in the framework of the langbeinite modification are more favorable to be occupied by larger chargecompensating cations as compared to the NZP-type modification.
The aim of this study was to verify the validity of the prediction of the possible existence of phosphates having [B0.5M1.5(PO4)3]2–-type frameworks with n = 2, where B is an element in the oxidation state of +2. We also examined whether it is possible to crystallize compounds that are characterized by this framework; have the langbeinite structure; and contain potassium, rubidium, or cesium cations in cavities. To this end, we synthesized and characterized phosphates K2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3, Rb2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 , and Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3.
In  addition  to  scientiﬁc  interest,  these  compounds have drawn attention for solving certain practical problems, in particular, in nuclear technologies producing wastes containing alkali elements (Na, K, Rb, Cs) with high  concentrations.  Framework  phosphates  hold promise  for  developing  procedures  for  isolation  of these  elements  from  the  biosphere.  The  presence  of cesium in wastes excludes the possibility of extracting radioactive cesium from them. Owing to the geometric restrictions on the diffusion of extraframework cations, the langbeinite structure can trap these cations and prevent  hazardous  radionuclides  from  contaminating  the environment.
Samples  were  synthesized  by  the  sol-gel  method using  1-M  aqueous  solutions  of  the  alkali  chlorides
MgCl2 and ZrOCl2 and H3PO4 as the starting reagents. A 1-M H3PO4 solution was added with stirring to aqueous solutions of the starting salts taken in a stoichiometric ratio. The resulting gel was dried at 90 C for one to two days and then successively heated at 600, 800, and 1000 C  for  one  day  at  each  temperature,  the  heating being alternated with ﬁne grinding in an agate mortar. Samples were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and neutron powder diffraction. X-ray diffraction study was carried out on a DRON-3M diffractometer using ﬁltered  CuKa  radiation (Ni ﬁlter, lamda = 1.54056 Å) in the 2q -angle range from 14  to 60. 
The IR spectra were recorded on a SPECORD 75IR spectrophotometer in the wavenumber range from 1400 to 400 cm-1 (samples were prepared as thin ﬁlms on KBr substrates).
The  neutron  diffraction  patterns  of  the  phosphate Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3, which was placed in a cylindrical container (d = 10 mm), were recorded at 15, 150, 300, 450, and 600 176) C on a DN-2 time-of-ﬂight diffractometer installed on an IBR-2 fast pulsed reactor (Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia). The structure  was  reﬁned  by  the  Rietveld  method  using  the MRIA program.
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the K2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3, Rb2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 , and Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 samples (Fig. 1) show reflections with the hkl Miller indices 111, 210, 211, 300, 310, 311, 320, 321, etc., of the cubic lattice. Such reflections are characteristic of phosphates of the langbeinite structure type. The X-ray patterns were indexed in the langbeinite structure type (K2Mg2(SO4)3 is the synthetic analog, sp. gr. P213). The calculated unit-cell parameters of the cubic lattice for the phosphates studied are a = 10.105(2), 10.172(2), and 10.270(2) Å and V = 1047.4(5), 1051.4(5), and 1083.6(5) Å3 , respectively. The unit-cell parameter a linearly depends on the radius of the alkali cation (Fig. 2). The picnometric density ρexp of phosphate K2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 was determined to be 3.26 g/cm3, which is close to the X-ray density (ρcalcd = 3.27 g/cm3).
The  IR  spectra  of  the  phosphates  are  shown  in Fig. 3. The local symmetry of the PO4 tetrahedron in the langbeinite structure is C1. The factor-group analysis of internal vibrations of the phosphorus tetrahedron allowed us to determine the following normal-vibration modes in the crystal ﬁeld (crystal symmetry P213, factor group T):
The IR spectra of the phosphates A2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 show bands predicted by the group theory. Three bands at 990, 1040, and 1080 (sh) cm-1 are due to P–O asymmetric stretching vibrations v3, and the band at 930 cm-1 is  due  to  asymmetric  stretching  vibrations  v1.  The range 640–550 cm-1 contains bands due to three of the predicted  vibrations  corresponding  to  the  bending vibrations  v4  at  645,  595,  and  555  cm-1  and  v2  at 450 cm-1. The bands show a general tendency to shift to low frequencies with an increase in the weight of the alkali cation.
We  used  the  atomic  coordinates  of  phosphate K2YZr(PO4)3 as the starting model for the refinement of the Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 structure. The results of the reﬁnement are listed in Table 1. The experimental and theoretical neutron-diffraction proﬁles of the sample  (t  =  15 C)  and  the  difference  curve  (experiment minus calculation) normalized to the rms deviation at a point are shown in Fig. 4. The calculated positional and thermal  parameters  (t  =  15  and  600 176) C)  are  given  in Table 2. The corresponding interatomic distances and bond angles are listed in Table 3.
A  fragment  of  the  structure  of  the  phosphate Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 5. This structure is based  framework [Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3]2-  composed  of  discrete  MgO6, ZrO6, and PO4 polyhedra. The group (dimer) consisting of  two  octahedra  and  three  tetrahedra  linked  to  each other by shared oxygen atoms is a characteristic fragment of this framework.
In  the  Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3  compound,  zirconium and magnesium cations are randomly distributed over two  nonequivalent  4a  positions  in  the  anionic  framework. This result can be attributed to the fact that these elements have equal ionic radii (r = 0.72 Å). 
Distortions of the framework polyhedra characterized by the maximum dispersion Delta of the bond lengths vary with temperature. At 15 C, phosphorus tetrahedra are only slightly distorted (Delta  = 0.05 Å), and the O–P–O bond  angles  are  close  to  the  calculated  value  for  the ideal tetrahedron (109.5 ). The bond lengths vary with temperature. At 600 C, Delta  for the phosphorus tetrahedron  is  0.21  Å.  Somewhat  smaller  distortions  are observed in the metal–oxygen MgO6 and ZrO6 octahedra (Delta  = 0.23 and 0.35 Å at 15 and 600 176) C, respectively). In addition, the polyhedra are rotated with an increase in temperature (see Fig. 6).
The temperature dependences of the of the unit-cell parameters a and V shown in Fig. 7 are described by the second-degree polynomial. The polynomial parameters of  thermal  expansion  were  calculated  using  Eqs.  (1) and (2):
The polynomial parameters p2, p1, and p0 are given in Table 4. The thermal-expansion coefﬁcients aa and aV are listed in Table 5.
The temperature dependences of the thermal-expansion coefﬁcients are shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that aa and aV increase with an increase in temperature. At t = 600 C, aa and aV are 5.05 *10-6 and 12.10*10-6 C-1, respectively.
In  this  study,  we  conﬁrmed  the  prediction  of  the existence  of  phosphates  with  the  [B0.5M1.5(PO4)3]2— frameworks. The new compounds K2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3, Rb2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3,  and  Cs2Mg0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3  were synthesized and characterized. We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that rubidium and cesium cations are involved in phosphates with the [T2(PO4)3]2- frameworks. These phosphates  were  found  to  crystallize  in  the  structure type  of  the  mineral  langbeinite.  Therefore,  we  conﬁrmed  the  hypothesis  that  phosphates  having  the [T2(PO4)3]2-  frameworks  and  containing  large  alkali cations in cavities crystallize in the langbeinite structure type (cubic system, sp. gr. P213). The inﬂuence of the temperature factor on the unit-cell parameters and distortions of the framework polyhedra was analyzed.
