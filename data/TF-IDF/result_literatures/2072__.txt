A compact CO2 sensor based on the combination of newly developed trivalent Sc3 135) conducting solid electrolyte, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was fabricated with Li2CO3 as an auxiliary electrode. The present sensor shows both a high sensitivity such as quick, theoretical and reproducible response and also a high selectivity for CO2. Furthermore, the sensor also has a long-term stability because the stable oxide (Sc2O3) is formed at the interface between Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and YSZ. Since, the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is chemically stable and has a high mechanical strength, the present sensor is expected to be applied for a practical device. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In these years, a global warming mainly caused by emitted CO2 gas has been becoming a very serious problem and the effective suppression of CO2 generated in various industrial ﬁelds has been greatly required. In order to reduce the CO2 gas amount emitted into the atmosphere, the on-site monitoring and the controlling of CO2 generated at each emitting site are greatly requested. For accomplishing this target, the commonly utilized methods such as infrared spectroscopy are not suitable because the size is too large to set up at every detecting site. Therefore, compact sensors which can be installed at every detecting site are strongly desired. As the candidates of the compact CO2 sensor component, semiconducting [1–3] and solid electrolyte [4–8] materials are proposed. However, the sensor with semiconductors cannot avoid the interference of the gas species other than CO2 since their detecting mechanism is based on the gas adsorption on the semiconductor surface. In contrast, solid electrolytes have a unique characteristic that only one ion species can migrate in solids and are used for various practical applications such as oxygen gas sensors based on yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and lithium batteries for heart pacemaker etc. Up to now, various types of compact CO2 sensors based on alkali metal ion conducting

In the worst case, Li2CO3 reaches the interface between Sc2(WO4)3 and YSZ, and the cell cannot work as a sensing tool any more. In order to realize a compact CO2 sensor with a high sensitivity and a long-term stability, both a high chemical stability and a high mechanical strength are required for the solid electrolyte to be applied for practical sensors in addition to the formation of stable oxides between two electrolytes.

Recently, we have succeeded in developing a new trivalent Sc3 135) cation conductor with NASICON type structure, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 [17], which is chemically stable compound based on phosphate with zirconium. The trivalent ion conductivity in the NASICON type structure increased monotonously with reducing the trivalent R3 135) ion radius in R1/ 3Zr2(PO4)3 (R: trivalent cation) and the highest ion conductivity was obtained for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3. An aluminum analog, Al1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which is expected to be prepared for smaller Al3 135) cation compared with Sc3 135), could not be obtained because Al3 135) cation is too small to hold the NASICON type structure and products were a two-phase mixture of AlPO4 and ZrP2O7.

In this paper, we select the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which has a high mechanical strength in addition to the highest trivalent ion conductivity among the R1/3Zr2(PO4)3, we obtained, as the component of present sensor. A compact CO2 sensor was fabricated with the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, and an excellent sensing performance with a long-term stability was demonstrated here.

Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 was prepared by a sol–gel method from reagent grade of Sc2O3 (99.9%), ZrOCl2 1)8H2O (99.95%) and NH4H2PO4 (99%) as starting materials. Sc2O3 and ZrOCl2 1)8H2O were dissolved in 3 N HNO3 solution separately. The solutions were mixed with each other afterwards.

The NH4H2PO4 solution (3 wt.%) was dropped into the mixed nitric acid solution. After obtaining white precipitations, the solution was heated at 758C for 24 h, then water was vaporized at 1308C for 8 h. The dried precipitant was heated at 3008C for 24 h and the powder obtained was pelletized and sintered at 8508C for 24 h. Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction from reagent grade of Y2O3 (99.9%) and ZrO2 (99.9%). After mixing ZrO2 and Y2O3 in a molar ratio of 9:1 in a mortar, the mixed powder was heated at 16008C for 6 h two times. The obtained powder was pelletized and sintered at 16008C for 12 h.

The characterization of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and YSZ was done by X-ray powder diffraction using Cu–Ka radiation (M18XHF, Mac Science). The XRD data were collected by a step-scanning method for the 2y range from 10–708 with a step width of 0.048 and a scan speed of 108/min. The Vickers hardness of sintered pellets of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Sc2(WO4)3 was measured by using the Micro Hardness Tester (HMV-2, Shimadzu).

On the center surface (diameter: 6.2 mm) of the pellets, Pt layer was sputtered as the electrodes. Two solid electrolytes were ﬁxed by an inorganic adhesive agent (SUMICERAM17D, Asahi) as shown in Fig. 1. The platinum and gold net were attached to the pellets as the reference and the detecting electrode, respectively. As the lead, Pt and Au wire were utilized. By heating the sensor element at 6508C for 12 h in a 5 vol.% CO2 diluted air, Li2CO3 was formed from LiOCH3 which was attached on the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 surface. EMF measurements were performed at 5508C with the CO2 concentration ranges from 200 to 2000 ppm and from 1– 5% which were regulated by mixing air — 1 vol.% CO2 diluted with N2 or air — pure CO2, respectively. The longterm stability of the sensor output was tested by monitoring the EMF outputs at 400 and 2000 ppm CO2 every several days. The sensor cell was hold constant at 5508C in dry air atmosphere during the experiment. The EMF measurements were also done in the atmosphere where NO (0–500 ppm), NO2 (0–500 ppm), or O2 (5–40%) coexist under the condition of the CO2 concentration at 1 vol.%. The CO2 sensing

As can be easily seen from Fig. 1, the whole sensor element is inserted in the detecting atmosphere. The practical gas sensors should show a high sensing performance such as a high sensitivity and a high selectivity. In addition, the sensor must be also chemically stable to operate in such serious conditions where the atmosphere changes from a reducing to an oxidizing condition and vice versa since the oxygen pressure continuously changes in actual CO2 detecting sites. The solid electrolytes applied for the sensor should have not only a chemical stability but also a physical stability, that is, a reasonably high sinterability to overcome the stress caused by the temperature and the humidity variation. Table 1 lists the Vickers hardness, the relative density, and the Sc3 135) ion conductivity at 6008C for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 with the corresponding data for Sc2(WO4)3 [11]. The Vickers hardness of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 was 293 Hv which was 7.3 times higher than that of Sc2(WO4)3 and the relative density of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is as high as 99.9%. The Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 has an appreciably high sinterability and a high mechanical strength compared with Sc2(WO4)3 (relative density: 89%). Since, the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 utilized for present sensor was a well sintered pellet, Li2CO3 used as an auxiliary electrode did not penetrate into Sc2(WO4)3, while Sc2(WO4)3 became ductile and many cracks appeared on the Sc2(WO4)3 surface which was conﬁrmed at a glance. Although, the conductivity of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is about one-third lower than that of the Sc2(WO4)3, the lower conductivity is not a disadvantage in the case of CO2 sensing because the detecting mechanism of the present sensor is to monitor the potentiometric signal of the sensor output generated from the difference in chemical activity between the detecting and the reference electrode as described below, and the current pass through the sensor element is negligibly low. In addition, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is based on chemically stable phosphate, any electronic conduction which results in the electronic short-circuit of solids would not be expected to appear even in a reducing atmosphere. Therefore, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is thought to be much more suitable candidate for solid electrolyte applied for CO2 sensor compared with Sc2(WO4)3 electrolyte from the view point of both chemical and physical stability. Furthermore, because

the sensor fabricated with the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte forms a very stable oxide (Sc2O3) at the interface between Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and YSZ (described below), the sensor based on Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is greatly expected to exhibit a well stable sensor output.

The following reactions occur at the detecting electrode, the interface (interface I) between detecting electrode and Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, the interface (interface II) between Sc1/ 3Zr2(PO4)3 and YSZ, and at the reference electrode. 2 135) 2e 255) Detecting electrode : Li2CO3! 2Li 135) 135) CO0 O0

As the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, Li2CO3 and the LiZr2(PO4)3 formed at the interface I are supposed to be in a solid state, the activities aSc1=3Zr2 133)PO4 134)3 are unity. Furthermore, the oxygen partial pressure at the detecting electrode (O0 2) is exactly equal to that at the reference electrode (O00 2) because the present sensor element is inserted  18)  19) in the same atmosphere as illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 2 depicts one of representative sensor response curves in dry atmosphere. The time necessary for the attainment of 90% response was within 1 min, and the sensor output (EMF) showed continuously reversible response. The measured EMF variation with the CO2 concentration is plotted as a function of the logarithm of the CO2 partial pressure in Fig. 3, with the theoretical slope (solid line) calculated from the Eq. (7). The sensor output obtained by changing the CO2 concentration lies in a linear relationship, and the n value obtained from the measured EMF slope is 1.97 which almost obeys the Nernst Eq. (7) (n  136) 2:00).

Since, the other gas species such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and H2O coexist and the oxygen concentration continuously changes in an emitted gas atmosphere, a highly selective

For the purpose of applying the present sensor in an actual detecting site, a long-term stability of the sensor output is greatly requested. Fig. 7 shows the sensor output deviation of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 based sensor at the CO2 content of 400 and 2000 ppm. In the case of a sensor fabricated with a Li 135)

CO2 sensing is required for practical sensors. The effect of the coexistence of NOx, O2 and H2O on the CO2 sensing was investigated over 12 h with changing gases concentration. The EMFs of the present sensor at 1% CO2 with O2 from 5 to 40 vol.% and with NOx from 0–500 ppm are depicted in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. As expected from the proposed reaction mechanism (Eq. (6)), no interference with the coexistence of O2 was observed. Furthermore, NOx which always appears in an exhaust gas to a certain content was also found not to interfere with the CO2 sensing at all.

The EMF variation with the CO2 concentration coexisted with H2O is plotted as a function of the logarithm of the CO2 partial pressure in Fig. 6. No meaningful difference of EMF in between dry and wet atmospheres (even in the atmosphere where the water vapor exists up to 30 vol.%) was observed. The above mentioned results explicitly indicate that the sensor can be applied in various types of exhaust gas atmosphere.
