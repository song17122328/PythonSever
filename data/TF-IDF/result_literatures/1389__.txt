Abstract. New magnesium-ion conductors, TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (TM = Fe, Mn, Co and Nb), have been prepared by sol-gel method. In addition, their crystal structure has been refined by Rietveld technique and the conductivity has been evaluated by ac impedance method. The samples were sintered at 1150oC for 2 h (Fe, Mn and Co) or 1200oC for 10 h (Nb). For all samples, three resistance components attributed to grain, grain boundary and the interface of electrolyte-electrode were successfully separated as a result of sintering accompanied by grain growth reaching to 5 to 10 µm. The change of ionic conductivity will be discussed in relation to the dopants and their crystal structures. Introduction Rechargeable batteries are of great interest as an energy source for a variety of electrical products. Demands for the rechargeable batteries in future are not only high capacity, but also safety and low production cost. Li-ion batteries are widely commercialized because of its high capacity in weight basis; however their component materials such as a Co-containing cathode and organic solvents as an electrolyte are relatively high cost and highly flammable. Therefore, alternative cheaper and more stable materials for rechargeable batteries have been studied to date. Instead of Li-ion, Mg-ion batteries can be one of the solutions. The advantages of the Mg-ion batteries are expected to be high capacity and resource abundance, while their charge-discharge rate is low compared with that for Li-ion ones. To realize such the batteries, novel materials to be used as a cathode or an electrolyte are required. In addition, their conduction and charge-discharge mechanism have to be studied. To date, some of cathode materials for the Mg-ion battery have been reported. Aurbach et al. have studied a chevrel phase of MMo6T8 (M = cations, T = S, Se) having cation nonstoichiometry and conductivity [1]. For the chevrel phase, Mo6T8 cluster makes three cavities which are possible to hold cations, and the cation can move through the cavities [2]. They have clarified that structural nature such as cation positions, cavity size, cation-Mo interaction, anion type, and repulsion between inserted cations controls their ionic mobility; so, ionic conductivity correlates with crystal structure and a variety of constituent ions. On the other hand, rhombohedral NASICON-type structure (MxTM2(XO4)3) as shown in Fig. 1 is also one of the promising crystal structures having M-ion nonstoichiomety and conductivity. This structure is composed of TMO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra. These polyhedra share each corner and form a three-dimensional framework having large interstitial sites which provide cation nonstoichiometry and fast multivalent cation transport. The followings are typical ion conductors having NASICON-type structure. Na-ion conduction in Na1+xZr2(P1-x/3Six/3O4)3 has been reported by Goodenough. It has a Na+ resistivity at 300oC of ρ < 5 Ω·cm for x~2 [3]. Nomura et al. have performed a systematic investigation on the framework structure, the phase transition and electrical conductivity of zirconium phosphates, MIIZr4(PO4)6 (M = Mg, Ca, Ba, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb) [4, 5]. In addition, Imanaka et al. have studied Al, rare earth (Sc, Eu, Gd, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) and tetravalent (Ti, Hf and Ge) cation conduction in phosphates and tungstates [6-8]. They established a way to prove cation conductivity by applying a dc voltage for several days. On the other hand, Makino et al. have reported Mg0.5(Me, Ti)2(PO4)3 (Me = Fe and Cr) as a cathode material of Mg-ion 292

 batteries. Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 shows relatively high theoretical capacity of 130-140 Ah/kg and small change in unit cell volume for Mg-ion insertion which seems to be advantageous in terms of durability [9, 10].     Fig. 1. NASICON-type crystal structure.  For high-rate charging and discharging, high ionic conductivity is required for cathode materials; however, relationship between crystal structure and electrical conductivity remains unclear for the NASICON-type materials, especially for Mg-containing systems. To understand a correlation between the mobility of Mg cation and the phosphate framework, we prepared TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (TM = Fe, Mn, Co and Nb) and their crystal structure and electrical conductivity  were evaluated. Experimental Mg0.5(1+x)TMIIIxTi2-x(PO4)3 (TMIII = Fe, Mn and Co) and Mg0.5(1-x)TMVxTi2-x(PO4)3 (TMV = Nb) were prepared by sol-gel method. Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O, titanium tetra-butxide tetramer C4H9O[Ti(OC4H9)2O]4C4H9, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Mn(NO3)3·6H2O and Co(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in ethanol; while niobium pentaethoxide Nb(OC2H5)5 was dissolved in propylene glycol and NH4H2PO4 was dissolved in distilled water with concentration of 0.1 mol/l, separately. These solutions were mixed to be a stoichiometric ratio of TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. The gel was dried at 90oC over 6 h and heated at 300oC for 12 h. Fe, Mn and Co-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were finally fired at 800oC; while, Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was fired at 1200oC. The resultant powder of 10mol%TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was pressed into a pellet and sintered under either air at 1150oC for 2 h (Fe, Mn and Co-doped) or at 1200oC for 10 h (Nb-doped). X-ray diffraction (XRD) is performed to identify phases present. To refine crystal structure including lattice constant, interatomic distances, and lattice distortion, Rietveld analysis by using TOPAS and VESTA softwares was performed. The microstructure was observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To evaluate electrical conductivity, twoand four-terminals ac-impedance measurement was performed at temperature range of 300 to 600oC in the frequency range of 0.01 to 107 Hz by using φ8 to 10 mm pellets or 12 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm bars as a sample. Results and Discussion Firstly, several TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were prepared. The transition metals were substituted for titanium sites. For undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, 50% interstitial sites were occupied by Mg-ion. For acceptor (lower valence cations than Ti4+) or donor-doping (higher valence cations than Ti4+), Mg concentration in the phosphates increases or decreases, respectively, to hold charge neutrality according to following equations. Key Engineering Materials Vol. 508

 [TMIII’Ti] = 2[Mg••i]           (1) [TMV•Ti] = 2[V’’Mg]            (2) Figures 2 (a) to (d) show XRD profiles of Fe-, Mn-, Coand Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. For trivalent TM-doped samples ((a) to (c)), peaks close to basal planes such as (116) appear to shift toward to higher angle, indicating lattice contraction in c-axis direction. For Fe-doped samples (Fig. 2(a)), the peak position of 50mol%Fe-doped sample is almost same as that for 75mol%Fe-doped one, meaning that solubility limit of Fe is 50mol%. This result agrees with the report by Makino et al. For Mn-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2(b)), peak displacement of 10 and 25mol%doped samples are almost identical; so, 25mol%doped sample seems to be overdoped. As well as Mn-doping, 25mol%Co-doping forms a secondary phase of Co3(PO4)2. Based on these observations, the single phase of NASICON-type structure was found to be obtained for less than 50mol%Fe-doped, 25mol%Mn-doped and 10mol%Co-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. On the other hand, for pentavalent Nb-doped samples (Fig. 2(d)), while a secondary phase of Mg0.5(TiO)PO4 was formed, peaks attributed to the NASICON-structure shift to lower angle, suggesting lattice expansion. Judging from these profiles and peak shift, solid solution of less than 20mol%Nb were obtained.       Fig. 2. XRD profiles of (a) Fe, (b) Mn, (c) Co and (d) Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 powder. Figure 3 shows the lattice constants of TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 as a function of dopant concentration. The data are plotted for only composition range in which the single phase of NASICON structure is obtained. As mentioned above, the acceptor-doped (Fe, Mn, Co) samples show lattice contraction in the direction of c-axis; while the donor-doped (Nb) sample shows lattice expansion. It should be noted that these trends can be explained by taking change in Mg concentration into account. As shown in eqs. (1) and (2), acceptor-doping leads to the incorporation of Mg interstitials; while donor-doping reduces its amount, respectively. The increase and decrease in Mg interstitials appear to causes lattice contraction and expansion, respectively, due to an electrostatic effect. 294

To further understand the effect of dopants, detailed structural analysis was conducted for undoped and 10mol%TM-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. This crystal structure was refined in space group R-3c. Figure 4 shows a result of Rietveld refinement for undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. Table 1 summarizes the structural data refined by the Rietveld analysis. Lattice contraction in c-axis direction and expansion in a-axis for trivalent-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 or lattice expansion of Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 takes place. Figure 5 shows the local structure nearby TiO6 octahedra and Mg sites. Based on the refined structure, these trends can be explained as follows: the valence of dopants and the amount of Mg interstitial appear to control Ti-O2 within TiO6 octahedra and Mg-O2 interatomic distances. The acceptor dopants with lower valence, i.e. lower bond strength, give increase in Ti-O2 distance that may cause increase in a-axis. In addition, acceptor doping leads to increase in Mg concentration (see eq.(1)) that may strengthen Mg-O2 bonding (shorter Mg-O2 distance). In the case of donor doping, opposite situation may hold.    Fig. 4. Rietveld refinement of undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3.   Key Engineering Materials Vol. 508

Local structure of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 in the vicinity of Mg site.  Figures 6 (a) to (d) show SEM images of 10mol%Fe, Mn, Co and Nb-doped samples after sintering. Even though phosphate-based materials are difficult to densify in general, the prepared samples seem to have relatively high relative density of 70 to 80% and grain size of 5 to 10 µm. Figure 7 shows XRD profiles of the sintered samples. For all the sample, the main phosphate phase was partially decomposed to Mg0.5(TiO)PO4 during sintering; however, as reported in our previous work [11], since dense microstructure and grain growth are essential to separate resistance components precisely, and the electrical conductivity of the secondary phase of Mg0.5(TiO)PO4 is several orders of magnitude lower than that of main phosphate phases, the following conductivity analysis are performed for these dual-phase samples.

To evaluate their electrical property, ac impedance measurement was performed. Figure 8 shows Nyquist plot of undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. Three or four depressed semicircles are observed. By fitting an equivalent circuit comprising of four RC components, the capacitance of on the order of 10-11, 10-9, 10-8 and 10-6 F were attributed to the semicircles. In addition, in the case of four-terminals ac Key Engineering Materials Vol. 508

 impedance measurement using bar-shape sample (not shown), semicircles having a capacitance of on the order of 10-6 F disappeared. Judging from the magnitude of capacitance, the first semicircle at higher frequencies and following other semicircles showing the capacitance of 10-9 and 10-8 F can be assigned to grain and grain boundary resistances, respectively. As well as the undoped sample, 10mol%Fe-, Mn-, Coand Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 showed three to four resistance components. The same analysis was performed to separate grain and grain boundary conductivities.     Fig. 8. Nyquist plot of undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 at 500oC.   Figures 9 (a) to (d) show Arrehnius plots of ionic conductivity of Fe-, Mn-, Coand Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 derived from the ac impedance measurements. The electrical conductivity for grain (bulk) is obviously higher than that for grain boundary by two or three orders of magnitude. For example, undoped sample showed grain and grain boundary conductivities of 1.7 x 10-3 and 1.9 x 10-5 S/cm at 600oC, respectively. The change in the ionic conductivity and the activation energy is discussed in the viewpoint of composition, crystal structure and coulomb interaction. Compared with undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (dashed lines), the grain boundary conductivity of acceptor (Fe, Mn, Co)-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 increases; while, that of donor (Nb)-doped one decreases. The grain boundary conductivity seems to be directly related to Mg carrier concentration in the vicinity of grain boundary. As shown in eqs. (1) and (2), Mg concentration increases or decreases with increasing acceptor or donor doping level to hold charge neutrality. In the case of grain (bulk) conductivity, the structural variation seems to affect the activation energy and conductivity. In the case of Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, not only decrease in Mg interstitial concentration, but also lattice expansion leading to increase in Mg-Mg distance appears to give the smallest conductivity (1.1 x 10-4 S/ cm at 600oC) and the largest activation energy (102 kJ/mol). On the other hand, in the case of acceptor doping, lattice contraction seems to play an important role on the grain conductivity. The activation energy of grain conductivity for acceptor-doped samples is 92, 89 and 57 kJ/mol for Fe-, Mn-, and Co-doped samples, respectively. Compared with that for the undoped sample (78 kJ/mol), Fe-doped sample having the smallest c-axis shows the largest activation energy. This implies that the too much lattice contraction may cause the narrowing of bottleneck for Mg-ion conduction. In addition, the lowest activation energy of Co-doped sample suggests that there might be an optimum size of Mg interstitial sites and bottleneck for Mg-ion conduction.   298

Those for undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 are plotted as dashed lines. Conclusion 50mol%Fe, 25mol%Mn, 10mol%Co, and 20mol%Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were prepared as a single phase of NASICON-type structure. Acceptor (Fe, Mn, Co) and donor (Nb)-doping caused lattice contraction and expansion in the direction of c-axis, respectively. This structural variation was explained by the valence of dopants and the amount of Mg interstitial; acceptor doping caused increase in Mg concentration that may strengthen Mg-O2 bonding and give shorter Mg-O2 distance. Donor doping gives rise to the opposite effect. The electrical conductivity of 10mol%Fe, Mn, Co and Nb-doped samples sintered at high temperatures were measured by ac impedance technique. Three to four resistance components attributed to grain, grain boundary and electrode interface were successfully separated. For undoped sample, grain and grain boundary conductivities were 1.7 x 10-3 and 1.9 x 10-5 S/cm at 600oC, respectively. The grain boundary conductivity seems to be controlled by carrier concentration. On the other hand, the crystal structural variation affects the grain conductivity. Donor (Nb)-doped sample showed the smallest conductivity (1.1 x 10-4 S/ cm at 600oC) and the largest activation energy (102 kJ/mol) presumably due to decrease in Mg interstitial concentration and increase in Mg-Mg distance. Key Engineering Materials Vol. 508

 The activation energy of grain conductivity was 92, 89 and 57 kJ/mol for acceptor (Fe, Mn, and Co)-doped samples, respectively. Fe-doped sample having the smallest c-axis length showed large activation energy. This implies that too much lattice contraction may cause the narrowing of bottleneck for Mg-ion conduction.
