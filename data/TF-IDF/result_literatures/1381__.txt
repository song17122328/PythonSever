Two Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 [Sr0.5.] and SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 [Sr.] phases were obtained by conventional solid-state reaction techniques at 1000 °C in air atmosphere. Their crystallographic structures were determined at room temperature from X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data using the Rietveld analysis. Both compounds belong to the Nasicon structural family. [Sr0.5.] and [Sr.] crystallise in rhombohedral system with R3 and R3c space group, respectively. Hexagonal cell parameters for [Sr0.5.] and [Sr.] are: a = 8.227(1) A˚ , c = 22.767(2) A˚ and a = 8.339(1) A˚ , c = 22.704(2) A˚ , respectively. Sr2? and vacancies in {[Sr0.50]3a[h0.50]3b}M1SbFe(PO4)3 are practically ordered within the two positions, 3a and 3b, of M1 sites. Structure reﬁnements show also an ordered distribution of Sb5? and Fe3? ions within the Nasicon framework. Within the structure, each Sr(3a)O6 octahedron shares two faces with two Fe3?O6 octahedra and each vacancy (h(3b)O6) site is located between two Sb5?O6 octahedra. In [Sr]M1Sb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 compound, all M1 sites are occupied by Sr2? and the Sb5? and Fe3? ions are randomly distributed within the Nasicon framework. A Raman and infrared spectroscopic study was used to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding in both selected compositions.

The Nasicon-type family has been the subject of intensive research due to its potential applications as solid electrolyte, electrode material, and low thermal expansion ceramics and as storage materials for nuclear waste [1–7]. The structure of such materials with general formula AxXX0(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional network made up of corner-sharing X(X0)O6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in such a way that each octahedron is surrounded by six tetrahedra and each tetrahedron is connected to four octahedra. Within the Nasicon framework, there are interconnected interstitial sites usually labelled M1 (one per formula unit) and M2 (three per formula unit) through which A cation can diffuse, giving rise to a fast-ion conductivity [1, 3, 8] (Fig. 1). The four such sites per formula unit can be represented by the crystallographic [M2]3[M1]XX0(PO4)3 formula. Each M1 cavity is situated between two X(X0)O6 octahedra along the c-axis. Six M2 cavities with eightfold coordination are located between the [O3X(X0)O3M1O3X(X0)O3hO3X(X0)O3]? ribbons and surround the M1 cavity (Fig. 1).

Recently, the structural characteristics by powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD) study using the Rietveld method for A0.50SbFe(PO4)3 (A = Mn, Ca, Cd) (R3 space group) were realised [9, 10]. In all A0.50SbFe(PO4)3 samples, A2? cations occupied principally one-half of the M1 3a sites and the Sb5? and Fe3? cations are orderly distributed within the SbFe(PO4)3 framework. In a continuation of our scientiﬁc research concerning Nasicon-like structure, in this article, we report the results of the structural investigations by the Rietveld reﬁnement using the X-ray powder diffraction patterns and SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 [Sr.] compositions. In order to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding spectrometer was calibrated by ﬂuorescence lines of the neon lamp. Non-polarized Raman spectra were collected in the back-scattering geometry, in the range 180–2280 cm-1, at a resolution of about 3 cm-1. Accuracy of spectral measurements, resulting from the wavelength calibration procedure and experimental conditions, is estimated to be about 1.5 cm-1. Precision of the reported peak positions, as represented by standard errors obtained in peak ﬁts, varied between 0.04 and 0.7 cm-1, depending on the signal-tonoise ratio and peak overlap. The acquisition time varied from 4 to 5 s.

The infrared spectra were recorded using a Bruker’s VERTEX 70. FT-IR spectrometer. Samples were in the form of KBr (mid-IR) and polyethylene (far-IR) pellets. The spectral resolution was 4 cm-1.

Analysis of the XRPD spectra of [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.] indicated that the peak positions of the XRPD lines are similar to those observed for other Nasicon-type phases (Figs. 2, 3). SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 is isostructural with SrFeTi(PO4)3 (R3c space group) Nasicon-type phase [12]. The presence, in XRPD pattern of Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3, of diffraction peaks, with Miller indexes h0 l (l = 2n ? 1) (e.g., (101) and is incompatible with the plane c. (003) Therefore, the XRPD data of [Sr0.5.] are consistent with R32 and R3 space groups. The structural reﬁnements of [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.], were principally based upon the previous assumption.

The structural parameters of SrFeTi(PO4)3 [12] were used as starting parameters for the Rietveld reﬁnement of

in the crystalline solids, a Raman and Infrared spectroscopic study was also undertaken.

Syntheses of Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 and SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 were carried out using conventional solid-state reaction techniques. Powder crystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of carbonates SrCO3 (Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99%), oxides Sb2O3 (Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99.9%), Fe2O3 (Prolabo, 99%) and NH4H2PO4 (Riedel-de Hae¨n, 99%) in stoichiometric proportions. The mixture was heated progressively with intermittent grinding at 200 °C (12 h), 400 °C (6 h), 600 °C (12 h), 800 °C (24 h), 900 °C (24 h) and 1000 °C (24 h) in air atmosphere. The products of reaction were characterised by XRPD data at room temperature with a Panalytical X0Pert-PRO (h–2h) diffractometer; (CuKa) radiation (45 kV, 40 mA); divergence slit of 1° and antiscatter slit of 1°. The data were collected from 10 to 90° 2h, in steps of 0.02°, with a counting time of 30 s per step. The Rietveld reﬁnement of the structure was performed using the Fullprof program [11].

The Raman spectra were recorded with an imaging spectrometer (HoloSpec f/1.8i, Kaiser Optical Systems) equipped with a holographic transmission grating and thermoelectrically cooled two-dimensional multichannel CCD detector (Newton, Andor Technology, 1600 9 400 pixels, -60 °C). An argon laser was used for the excitation: the 514.5 nm wavelength radiation was chosen. The

SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3. Reﬁnement with all Sr atom in the M1 site and Sb(Fe) within the Nasicon framework leads to best results (RB = 5.2%). The ﬁnal reliability factors and atomic parameters for [Sr.] are summarised in Table 1. A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRPD proﬁle is shown in Fig. 2. Sr–O(2) (2.525(2) A˚ ) and Sb(Fe)–O (Sb(Fe)–O(1) = 1.917(3) A˚ , Sb(Fe)–O(2) = 2.007(3) A˚ ) distances are consistent with the ionic radii values in six coordination of Sr2?, Sb5? and Fe3? ions [13]. P–O distances values, 1.524(2) and 1.514(2) A˚ , match well with those typically observed in Nasicon-type phosphates. In order to have more structural information, the bond valence sum (BVS) based on bond-strength analysis [14] for [Sr.] were computed. The BVS values calculated for Sr, Fe, Sb, and P sites (2.0 for Sr in M1 site, 4.0 for Sb/Fe (should be 3.5 for [1.5 Fe3?, 0.50 Sb5?]), and 5.2 for P) are relatively consistent with the expected formal oxidation state of Sr2?, Fe3?, Sb5? and P5? ions. XRPD data of [Sr.], obtained from the ‘‘observed intensities’’ of the Rietveld reﬁnement (CuKa1:1.540 56 A˚ ), are presented in Table 2.

Structure determination of Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3, using the Rietveld method, was undertaken in two principle models. In the ﬁrst model, the reﬁnement was made in R32 space group whereas in the second the hypothesis of R3 space group was veriﬁed. During the ﬁrst model, initial starting parameters for the Reitveld Reﬁnements of [Sr0.5.], using R32 space group, were based on those already reported for Na5Ti(PO4)3 ([Na3]M2[Na]M1TiNa(PO4)3 crystallographic formula) [15]. Sr2? and vacancies are randomly distributed in the M1 site, 6c position (0.0*0.25), while Sb5? and Fe3? are supposed to reside within the framework. The reﬁnement in this model was conﬁrmed to be less

Table 2 Powder diffraction data of SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 (CuKa1; k = 1.540 56 A˚ )

appropriate (e.g. RB= 20%). During the second model, the structural parameters of [Mn0.50h0.50]M1SbFe(PO4)3 in R3 space group [9] were used as starting parameters for the Rietveld reﬁnement. In a ﬁrst step, Sr2? ions are supposed to reside only in one of the two possible types of M1 site, 3a (000); the other, 3b (001/2), was considered to be empty. Sb and Fe atoms were constrained to be distributed, within the framework, between the two possible types of 6c position. Note that in the ﬁnal step of reﬁnement, the Sr atoms were allowed to occupy the two possible positions of M1 sites (3a and 3b) instead of only 3a in the previously reﬁnement. In this reﬁnement only 0.08(1) of Sr2? ions are found in 3b position of M1 site. This last result agrees well

with an ordered cationic distribution of Sr2? within the M1 sites. A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRD proﬁle is shown in Fig. 3. The ﬁnal reliability factors and atomic parameters for [Sr0.5.] are summarised in Table 3. Their structure is represented in Fig. 4. In order to facilitate the structure description, we use in the following Sr(3a)O6 to deﬁne the site occupied to 92% by Sr2? and h(3b)O6 for the site which contains 8% of Sr2? ions. The presence of a quasi-ordered vacancy–strontium distribution leads to two inequivalent FeO6 and SbO6 octahedra. Each Sr(3a)O6 octahedron shares two faces with two FeO6 octahedra and each weakly occupied (h(3b)O6) site is located between two SbO6 octahedra. The electrostatic repulsion

between the two O(2) triplets surrounding the vacant 3b the M1 sites tends to increase its volume. h(3b)–O(2) = 2.678(2) A˚ to the Sr(3a)–O(1) one (Table 4; Fig. 4). The Fe–O interatomic distances show that the FeO6 octahedra, which have a common face with the occupied Sr(3a)O6 octahedra are relatively more distorted than the SbO6 octahedra which share one face with the unoccupied h(3b)O6 octahedra. Note that distortion degree, within each type of octahedron of the Nasicon framework, can be evaluated by the difference, D, between the two distance-types of each octahedron. Thus, in the FeO6 octahedron the value (0.22(1) A˚ ) of D(Fe–O) is superior to that (D(Sb–O) = 0.07(1) A˚ ) calculated for the SbO6 octahedron. This result can be related to the electrostatic repulsion between Sr2? and the neighbouring Fe3? ions within the [O3FeO3SrM1(3a) O3FeO3hO3SbO3hM1(3b)O3SbO3]? ribbons (Fig. 4). Since the ionic radii values of Sb5? and Fe3? cations are relatively comparable, the exact reason behind the tendency of a quasi–ordering of the Sb5? and Fe3? cations, within Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 Nasicon framework, may be related to the difference between their oxidation state. Indeed, in order to minimise the electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring cation within the ribbons, two Fe3?O6 octahedra tend to juxtapose the quasi-full occupied M1(3a) sites. In contrast, the unoccupied M1(3b) sites have practically two Sb5?O6 octahedra as a neighbouring. The P–O distance values (Table 4) are in good agreement with those typically observed in Nasicon-like phosphates. The correctness of the structure for Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 was also

Table 4 Selected interatomic distances (A˚ ) and calculated bond valence sum (BVS) for Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3

conﬁrmed by bond valence calculations. The BVS values calculated for Sr, Fe, Sb and P sites are relatively consistent with the expected formal oxidation state of Sr2?, Fe3?, Sb5? and P5? ions (Table 4). X-ray powder diffraction data of [Sr0.5.], obtained from the ‘‘observed intensities’’ of the Rietveld reﬁnement (CuKa1:1.540 56 A˚ ), are presented in Table 5.

In order to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding in both [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.] crystalline solids, in this part of the paper, a Raman and Infrared (IR) spectroscopic study was undertaken. The IR and Raman spectra of [Sr.] (a) and [Sr0.5.] (b) are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, respectively. Spectra of both samples are similar except the broad Raman band observed for [Sr.]. According to the crystallographic results, the relatively broadening Raman bands observed in [Sr.] spectra (Fig. 6a), in comparison to those found in the [Sr0.5.] Raman ones (Fig. 6b), may be easily related to the difference between the cationic distribution within both Nasicon frameworks. In fact, both Sr2? ions in M1 sites and Sb5?(Fe3?) within the Sr0.5SbFe(PO4)3 Nasicon framework are relatively orderly distributed. Consequently, in this last material, every PO4 group is surrounded by two FeO6 octahedra and two SbO6 octahedra. In the case of SrSb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3, the stoichiometric consideration (75% of Fe and 25% of Sb atoms within the framework) leads to several combinations for the PO4 group environments. So, in [Sr.] sample, the PO4 groups are more disturbed and consequently in addition to the broadening of the Raman bands, shifts of the modes to higher or lower wavenumbers (red or blue shift) are normally expected.

The vibration modes of Nasicon phases can be assigned to internal and external modes of (PO4) tetrahedra and to lattice modes including the motions of the metallic Sb5? and Fe3? in their octahedral coordination and Sr2? ions in 6 and/or 8 coordination spheres. It is observed that

phosphate group vibrations are generally strong compared to the and metal–oxygen vibrations. According to factor group analysis, the phosphate PO4 tetrahedra group has Td symmetry and nine internal modes (Cd = A1 ? E ? 2F2) which are distributed as: (i) the symmetric non degenerate PO stretching (m1 observed in the range 960–1020 cm-1), (ii) antisymmetric, doubly degenerate PO stretching (m2, observed in the range 420– 450 cm-1) (iii) symmetric, triply degenerate OPO bending (m3, observed between 1100 and 1160 cm-1) and (iv) triply degenerate, antisymmetric and harmonic OPO bending (m4, observed in the range 545–680 cm-1) [16, 17]. Note that all the modes are Raman active whereas m3 and m4 ones are IR active only. Table 6 gives the correlation scheme for the stretching modes of the (PO4) groups through their site symmetry in the R3  C2 crystalline cells. The number of predicted frequencies is also presented (Table 7).

For (SbO6) groups, it is not possible to establish correlation schemes as for the PO4 groups because the (SbO6) octahedra are distorted and exhibit a low symmetry, the Sb–OP bonds existing in two compounds have an average length of 2.00 A˚ . Their stretching vibrations are probably coupled with the P–O–P bending m4 mode. These frequencies are found between 680 and 470 cm-1.

Since most of the Raman bands present in these spectra is very broad, a deconvolution procedure of the experimental spectra was necessary. In fact, the deconvolution procedure allowed us a better identiﬁcation of the Raman bands that appear in the experimental spectra, offered the possibility to calculate their relative area and thus to follow more precisely their compositional evolution. This procedure was performed with the LABSPEC v 2.04 program [18] using a Gaussian type function. Figures 7 and 8 show the deconvolution, in Gaussian bands, of the spectra for the [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.] samples in the range of 100–700 cm-1 (Figs. 7a, 8a) and 800–1300 cm-1 (Fig. 7b, 8b). The positions of the most important absorption bands evidenced in the Raman and IR spectra are grouped in Table 8

Note that similar Raman band are already observed in this region for Mn0.5MSb(PO4)3 (M = Al, Fe and Cr) phases. The absorptions observed at 580 and 639 indicate the presence of Sb5? in octahedral oxygen coordination [19], in good agreement with those found for the same type of Sb-O bonds in antimonates of pyrochlore structure [20]. But in the case of titanyl and niobyl phosphates the stretching modes of TiO6 and NbO6 octahedra were located in the 600–850 and 630–890 cm-1 region, respectively [21–25]. It has been shown that the strongest Raman line can be attributed to the m1 symmetric stretching mode of the TiO6 (NbO6) unit. This band shifts towards higher frequency with increasing ion valency (from 650–710 cm-1 for TiO6 to around 870–890 cm-1 for NbO6 [21–25]. In previous Raman studies of the crystal structure of SbOPO4 [26], described as consisting of chains of corner shared octahedra running parallel to the c–axis and linked together by PO4 tetrahedra, there are two types of Sb–O bonds: Sb–OSb and Sb–OP [27]. The stretching frequencies are found at *790 cm-1 in Raman spectrum and 872 cm-1 in IR spectrum. But in this study, the appearance of intense bands corresponds to PO4 stretching modes which rules out the possibility of the Sb–OSb chain.

Fig. 7 The deconvolution of the bands observed in Raman spectrum of SrSb0.5Fe1.5(PO4)3 (range of 100–700 cm-1 in a and 800– 1300 cm-1 in b)

In order to facilitate the discussion about the assignment of Raman and IR bands of [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.] samples, two principally frequency domains are considered: a high frequency part region (800–1300 cm-1) and a low frequency part region (100–800 cm-1).

Most of the papers on the Raman and IR spectra of phosphates [28–33] indicate that the region 800–1300 cm-1 is characteristic of phosphate group. For example the former studies of a number of titanyl and niobyl phosphates showed that the m1 and m3 modes of the PO4 ions are observed around 933–1000 and 970–1150 cm-1, respectively [34–36]. The high frequency part (800–1300 cm-1)

In order to have a better visualization, in the low frequency part (100–800 cm-1), the Raman spectra for [Sr.] and [Sr0.5.], respectively are divided in three spectral regions (Figs. 7a, 8a): 100–250 cm-1, 250–550 cm-1, and 550– 700 cm-1. For the P–O bending vibrations (range of 250–550 cm-1) seven [Sr.] Raman bands (545, 464, 435, 406, 378, 343 and 308 cm-1) were observed (Fig. 7a), the predicted ones are eight. In the [Sr.] infrared spectrum, two bands (472 and 436 cm-1) are observed (Fig. 5a). [Sr0.5.] Raman spectrum shows six bands (539, 460, 415, 347, 325 and 281 cm-1) (Fig. 8a), the predicted ones are ten and in the [Sr0.5.] IR spectrum four bands (545, 483, 463 and 429 cm-1) are observed (Fig. 5b).

In the lattice modes region, the translational modes of Sr2?, Fe3?, Sb5? and PO4 3ions as well as librational modes of PO4

3ions and FeO6, SbO6 groups should be expected. At wavenumbers below 450 cm-1 strong coupling between the different bending vibrations O–P–O, O–Sb–O, Sb–O–P, Sb–O–Sb is expected [26].

The Raman bands observed at 378 and 343 cm-1 in [Sr.] (Fig. 7a), and 347 and 325 cm-1 in [Sr0.5.] (Fig. 8a), could be assigned to Fe3?–O stretching modes of vibrations. It can be seen that similar band positions are observed in the range 300–370 cm-1 of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 Raman spectrum [37]. The weak bands observed below 280 cm-1 are due to translational modes of the Sr2?, Sb5? and (PO4)3ions [38].

Fig. 8 The deconvolution of the bands observed in Raman spectrum of Sr0.5SbFe(PO4)3 (range of 100–700 cm-1 in a and 800–1300 cm-1 in b)

of the Raman spectra (Fig. 7b, 8b) correspond to the internal stretching vibrations of the PO4 tetrahedra and exhibits seven bands (1233, 1158, 1114, 1071, 1022, 959, and 900 cm-1) for [Sr.] compound. In this last region, the [Sr.] IR spectrum shows three bands (1223, 1085, and 948 cm-1) (Fig. 5a). Eight bands (1233, 1158, 1135, 1127, 1069, 1016, 941 and 909 cm-1) are observed in the [Sr0.5.] Raman spectra, the predicted ones are also eight. In the studied region, ﬁve bands (1285, 1150, 1071, 1013, and 925 cm-1) are observed in the [Sr0.5.] IR spectrum (Fig. 5b). Similar bands are already observed in isostructural materials such as Mn0.5AlSb(PO4)3 (R3c space group) (1260, 1240, 1110, 1071, 1042 and 959 cm-1) and Mn0.5FeSb(PO4)3 (R3 space group) (1156, 1118, 1089, 1005 and 916 cm-1) [19].

Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3, and SrSb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3 compounds are prepared and characterized by XRPD, Raman and IR spectroscopies. Both the samples crystallise in hexagonal lattice of the Nasicon framework with the space group R3 for [Sr0.5.] and R3c for [Sr.]. The Rietveld analysis results of the reﬁnement show that Sb5? and Fe3? ions are randomly distributed within the [Sr.] framework whereas the same cations are orderly distributed within the [Sr0.5.] framework one. This last ordering cationic distribution may be related to the difference between the Sb5? and Fe3? oxidation state. Raman and IR spectra are consistent with [Sr0.5.] and [Sr.] crystal structures. The spectra show characteristic PO4 vibrations. The stretching modes of SbO6 groups are observed at frequency (580 and 639 cm-1) than stretching modes of FeO6 groups (*350 cm-1).
