Phosphosilicates of sodium and zirconium Na11xZr2SixP32xO12 were discovered by Hong, Goodenough, and co-workers [1,2]. The best electric properties of this series range from x 5 1.8 to 2.2. Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (x 5 2), called Nasicon, exhibits a higher conductivity than b0-alumina above 300°C (s 5 0.25 ohm21zcm21). These materials lend themselves to a wide range of applications, for example, in solid-state batteries [3], ionic exchangers [4], and ceramics with low thermal expansion coefﬁcients [5,6]. Particular attention has been paid to the elaboration of AxMy(XO4)3 compounds with various elements and/or compositions [7–10].

The structure of the Nasicon-type NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) [11] has been described as a three-dimensional network of ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners with (P,Si)O4 tetrahedra. The Zr2{(P,Si)O4}3 framework shows two different crystallographic sites accommodating various cations: the M1 site (Wickoff notation 6b 0,0,0; space group R3c) is formed by an oxygenated trigonal antiprism, elongated along the [001] direction in the corresponding hexagonal cell and capped by two ZrO6 octahedra. The M2 asymmetric site, with a large coordination number 8 –10, ribbons zO3ZrO3Na(1)zO3ZrO3]n. These cavities, empty in NbTi(PO4)3 [12], are partially [O3ZrO3 occupied [7,11,13] or entirely ﬁlled as in Na4Zr2(SiO4)3 [14].

To our knowledge, phosphosilicates with an NZP-structure type containing trivalent elements in the M1 site have not been isolated previously. This work reports on the synthesis and structure characterization of these phases. The new materials are Bi1/3Pb1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3 (SiO4)1/3, called BPZPS, and Ln1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6 with Ln 5 La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Er, Yb, denoted as LnPZPS. The crystal structure of the lanthanum counterpart was determined using the Rietveld method.

Samples BPZPS and LnPZPS, with the above-mentioned Ln elements, were prepared via the sol-gel route according to the following process: Stoichiometric amounts of starting materials z8H2O were separately dissolved into a Ln2O3 [or Bi(NO3)3 slightly acidiﬁed solution for the former ones and into aqueous ones for the lead and zirconium salts. A calculated amount of Si(OC2H5)4 dissolved into ethanol and an ammonium phosphate solution were added dropwise to the mixture. The gel thus formed was maintained at 80°C for 24 h. The resulting residue was progressively heated up to the crystallization temperatures, i.e., 700°C/24h for the BPZPS phase and 800°C/48h for LnPZPS phases.

or R32. Small amounts of ZrP2O7 were clearly identiﬁed. In order to remove this impurity, a doping by Pb21 ions substituted for Bi31 was carried out. Both ions were characterized by a 6s2 lone pair, inducing a similar one-sided coordination. The new synthesis was successfully achieved and yielded a pure phase, Bi1/3Pb1/6Zr2(PO4)8/3(SiO4)1/3. The powder pattern was fully indexed in the trigonal system with hexagonal cell parameters, a 5 8.74, c 5 23.20 Å. Composition was conﬁrmed by chemical analysis (Table 2), and speciﬁc mass measurements revealed the presence of Z 5 6 formulae per unit. The detailed structural analysis along with the ability of this phase to host large and heavy elements in its potential crystallographic sites will be described in a forthcoming paper. The powder patterns of these two phases are given in Figure 1.

The chemical analysis of Ln1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6 showed atomic ratios close to computed ones, except for lanthanum, which exhibits slightly smaller atomic ratios (Table 3). Measurements of speciﬁc mass for the La, Gd, and Er phases are in good agreement with Z 5 6 formulae per unit cell (Table 4).

Ln1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6 with Ln 5 La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Er, Yb. The powder patterns of these LnPZPS phases clearly showed the Nasicon structure type. However, the presence of reﬂections hh0l with l 5 2n 1 1 induced the space group R3. Unit-cell parameter variation with the ionic radii of rare earth showed a slight contraction along the a axis and expansion along the c axis. This elastic feature of the network, already studied in the literature [17], corroborates the substitution effect due to the cation size of the M1 site (Fig. 2).

During the ﬁrst trial, Rietveld reﬁnements were performed in the R3 space group [18] with the initial coordinates of NaZr2(PO4)3, assuming a random distribution of both La and Pb atoms in the 3a (000) and 3b (001/2) crystallographic sites. After achieving 5 0.04), the output structural parameters showed the convergence (RB presence of La and Pb atoms in both 3a and 3b sites but with the 3a site hardly occupied (i.e., 10%). Figure 3 shows the ﬁnal Rietveld reﬁnement plot, which corresponds to

New prototype compounds exhibiting the Nasicon structure type were successfully synthesized using the sol-gel technique. Structural investigation of La1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6 carried out via the Rietveld technique resulted in a clearer deﬁnition of the space group (R3#) of these phases and showed that lanthanum and lead atoms are randomly distributed over the 3b site of the trigonal cell. Nevertheless, to investigate the role of the lone pairs 6s2 of elements such as Bi(III) and Pb(II) on the cation site distributions with rare earths, other investigations (EXAFS, luminescence properties) are being conducted.
