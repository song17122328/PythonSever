Ceramic sheet of Na+ ion-conducting solid electrolyte, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON), has been prepared by tape-casting method. Addition of 60Na2O-10Nb2O5-30P2O5 glass as a sintering aid is crucial for fabrication of fully-densified impermeable sheet. Otherwise the gas tightness is not achieved even sintered at 1200 °C. The best preparation condition is 5 or 10 wt% grass-addition with respect to NASICON and sintering at 1000–1100 °C, which is lower by 100–200 °C than the typical densification temperature of NASICON without the additive. A sample with a thickness of 35 μm and total conductivity of 4.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 is obtained by 5 wt% glass addition and sintering at 1100 °C for 4 h.

Ceramic solid electrolytes are expected to play more important roles in conventional batteries as well as in next-generation batteries [1,2] including all solid state batteries (ASSBs) [3,4], and anode protection-type metal-air batteries [5], etc. Among sulfide- and oxide-based electrolytes, the latter has advantages in better durability for humidity and thermal stability. The challenge for the developments of oxide-based electrolytes is reduction of sintering temperature that is compatible with formation of good electrical contact at interfaces with electrode active materials. Furthermore, there is a strong demand for perfect densification to prevent for the dendrite short [6,7].

Alkaline metal-air batteries are classified into aqueous and nonaqueous batteries. The former is characterized by the structure that the anode is protected from the aqueous electrolyte and the ‘air’ by a ceramic electrolyte. This structure contributes to enhancing effective power and energy densities of a metal-air battery as well as to enabling operation in ambient air [8,9]. For the application to the aqueous alkaline metal-air batteries, the densification for the liquid and gas impermeability is crucial. The nonaqueous type does not necessitate the ceramic electrolyte, however the idea of the ceramic anode protection is often beneficial for, such as, prevention of O2 for directly reaching the anode.

Since total conductivity of oxide-based electrolytes at room temperature (RT) is typically below 10−3 S cm−1, which is too low for use as a bulk electrolyte. Then, reduction of the effective resistance by reducing the thickness is effective. As for Li-ion conducting oxide-based electrolyte, Imanishi et al., prepared Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4 (PO4)3 sheet by tape-casting method and the resultant sheet was impinged with an epoxy resin to impart the liquid impermeability. They applied the composite electrolyte sheet to an aqueous Li-air battery [10,11]. Similar approach to inorganic-organic composite membrane with Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) [12] and Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3 [13] have also been reported. However, preparation of pure inorganic thick film compatible with high electrical conductivity and the impermeability has not been successful very much [14].

In recent years, Na-based batteries have been attracted much attentions due to the abundance and low cost of sodium resources. [[15], [16], [17]]. Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (NASICON) with 1.8 < x < 2.2 usually exhibits best total conductivity > 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at RT [[18], [19], [20], [21]] when NASICON is crystallized in monoclinic structure with x∼2 [22]. Furthermore, owing to its good durability against direct contact with metallic Na around RT and/or basic aqueous solution, NASICON has been considered for the electrolytes for all solid state batteries [[23], [24], [25], [26]] and aqueous Na-air batteries [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. Although fabrication of the NASIOCN film with a thickness of < 1 μm by sol-gel process has been reported [27], there has been no report about thick film by tape-casting. In this study, tape-casting method is employed to prepare a fully densified NASICON sheet by combining with the sintering aid.

Full densification of bulk NASICON requires high sintering temperature, typically above 1200 °C. Very recently, Noi et al. obtained densified NASIOCN-based bulk ceramics with RT conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 by sintering at 900 °C promoted by the liquid phase formation by Na3BO3 additive [28,29]. Similarly, fully densified NASICON with RT conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 by spark plasma sintering method and addition of Na-Nb-phosphate glass as a sintering aid has been achieved by our studies [30]. This glass was again chosen in the present study, owing to its less deliquescence property as compared with the Na3BO3. The stability against the aqueous solution is especially important for the application to the aqueous cells. The promotion of sintering by liquid phase former or glass is expected to be also effective for the densification at reduced sintering temperatures to prepare a gas- and liquid-impermeable ceramic electrolyte sheet.

Reagent grade ZrO2, SiO2 and Na3PO4⋅12H2O (Purity of 98%, 99.9%, and 99%, respectively; purchased from Kojundo chemicals, Saitama, Japan) were weighed to obtain a composition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, and mixed by planetary ball milling using a Pulverisette 6 milling machine (Frichche, Germany) at 150 rpm for 1 h. The mixture was calcined at 1100 °C for 12 h. To obtain fine powder, the calcined cake was pulverized by ball milling at 250 rpm for 18 h with zirconia balls with a diameter of 4 mm (YTZ; Nikkato, Osaka, Japan) and ethanol as a dispersant in a polyamide pot.

A Na-Nb phosphate glass (60Na2O-10Nb2O5-30P2O5) was chosen as a sintering aid, and was prepared by melting a mixture of Na2CO3, NaH2PO4 2H2O (Wako pure chemical, Tokyo, Japan), and Nb2O5 (99%; Kojundo) powders at 900 °C for 0.5 h, followed by pouring the melt on an iron plate for quenching [31]. The glass was powdered using an alumina mortar.

Green sheets were fabricated by tape casting method [32]. A slurry (Table 1) was prepared by mixing the NASICON powder and the Na-Nb phosphate glass powder with ratios of 0, 1, 5, 10 wt% to the NASICON powder, and organic components including a binder (poly-vinyl-butylal 630; Wako), a plasticizer (dibutyl phthalate; Wako), a dispersant (ethylene glycol; Kishida chemical, Osaka, Japan), a defoamer (polyoxyethylene(10) octylphenyl ether; Wako), and a solvent (2-propanol and toluene; Wako), by planetary ball milling at 200 rpm for 20 h. The slurry was applied on a silicone-coated polyethylene sheet (R75; Toray Industries, Inc., Japan) using a doctor blade. The thickness of the green sheet was controlled to be 45–50 μm after drying. The green sheet was punched into a disc with 15 mm in diameter.

For the sintering, the green sheet disc was put on a zirconia plate covered by the same zirconia plate with a spacer. This assembly was embedded in the calcined NASICON powder in an alumina crucible to suppress the volatilization of Na component. They were first degreased at 400 °C for 1 h, and then sintered at 900–1230 °C for 4 h in air.

Microstructure on sintered surface and fractured cross-section of a sintered sheet was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using an S-5200 SEM (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Crystalline phases of sintered sheets were identified by powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) using a D8 ADVANCE (Bruker AXS GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). Electrical conductivity was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a 1260A impedance/gain-phase analyzer (Solartron Analytical, Leicester, UK) with a modulation voltage of 20 mV in a frequency range of 4–40 MHz at 25 °C. In-Ga alloy was applied to a sample as an electrode, which is removable and causes no significant stress on a fragile sample.

Gas permeability of the sintered sheet was measured using a home-made apparatus equipped with a capacitance manometer (Baratron 622A; MKS instruments, USA). Fig. 1 shows the schematic of the apparatus. The vacuum chamber has the internal volume, V, of 11.3 mL. The sample was attached on the inlet with the area, S, of 1.98 × 10−2 cm2 using a vacuum grease, with exposing the one side to ambient air. The chamber was pumped to the pressure of ∼50 kPa. After closing the valve, the change of pressure in the chamber was monitored.

When the gas permeation rate is proportional to the difference of the pressure at the both sides of a membrane, the gas leakage rate per unit area, Q (kPa⋅m3⋅s−1), is described as,(1)where C (m3⋅s−1) is defined as the gas permeability of a membrane, p∞ (kPa) is the atmospheric pressure, and p (kPa) is the pressure in the chamber. Then, the change of p, with the time, t (s), is described as,(2)where Δp0 is the initial differential pressure (p∞ − p) at t = 0, which corresponds to the moment of closing the valve. The value of C for each sample was determined by fitting Eq. (2) to an experimental time-dependence data.

Fig. 2 shows the appearance of all sintered samples with and without the sintering aid. Apparent densification was promoted with the larger amount of glass additive and at higher sintering temperature. In particular, 5 wt%-1100 °C and 10 wt%-1100 °C samples were well sintered so as to become translucent. Their thickness was ∼35 μm, and proved to be gas-tight as described in the later section. In contrast, higher temperature of 1230 °C was required to densify the sample without the sintering aid. Nevertheless, this sample was still not fully gas-tight. Practically, sintering temperatures >1200 °C is required to obtain a gas-tight bulky NASICON ceramics without a sintering aid [19]. It is demonstrated that the Na-Nb phosphate glass additive is effective to fully densify the membrane at reduced sintering temperatures.

Fig. 3 displays cross-sectional SEM images of the samples with 1, 5 and 10 wt% glass additive sintered at 900–1100 °C. Amount of pores decreases with increasing the amount of glass additive and the sintering temperature. This tendency agrees with that in the shrinkage of sintered sheets (Fig. 2). Fig. 4 compares the microstructure of 0 wt%-1230 °C and 10 wt%-1100 °C samples. A number of pores was observed in the 0 wt%-1230 °C sample despite of the higher sintering temperature. It is likely that grain growth was promoted prior to the pore annihilation due to the high sintering temperature in the 0 wt%-1230 °C sample. In contrast, the 10 wt%-1100 °C sample contains only isolated pores, and most parts were fully densified, leading to the gas-tight membrane.

To test simply a permeability of a liquid, ethanol was dropped on the samples. The leakage was detected in 0 wt%-1230 °C sample, while not in 10 wt%-1100 °C, 10 wt%-1000 °C, and 5 wt%-1100 °C samples.

The impermeability was more quantitatively evaluated by the procedure described in section 2.4, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. As far as the sensitivity of our apparatus, no gas leakage was detected, namely the permeability, C, was below 1.0 × 10−9 m3 s−1 in 5 wt%-1100 °C, 10 wt%-1000 °C, and 10 wt%-1100 °C samples (Fig. 5a). In contrast, rapid pressure increase was observed in 10 wt%-900 °C and 1 wt%-1100 °C samples, whose C values were estimated to be 2.5 × 10−7 and 4.9 × 10−7 m3 s−1, respectively. A weak leakage with 5.6 × 10−9 m3 s−1 was also detected in 5 wt%-1000 °C sample (Fig. 5b).

Fig. 6 shows powder XRD patterns of 1, 5 and 10 wt%-1100 °C samples as well as the Na-Nb phosphate glass. These sintered sheets were mainly composed of NASICON crystal with monoclinic symmetry, indicating that its chemical composition was close to Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [22]. ZrO2 is equilibrium coexisting phase with NASICON [33], and was present as a minor phase, as identified from a peak at ∼28°. There is a trend that the phase fraction of ZrO2 increases with increasing the sintering temperature, (refer to supplemental Fig. S1). This trend accords with a phase diagram proposed in Ref. [33]. In the 10 wt%-1100 °C sample, additional peak at ∼31° was found. This is assigned to NaNbO3 crystal, whose formation has been also found in our recent study on sintering of bulk NASICON ceramics promoted by the Na-Nb-phosphate glass additive. It has been concluded that most of Nb component is distributed in the NaNbO3 crystal after sintering and the Nb dissolution in the NASICON phase is limited [30].

Fig. 7a shows an EIS measured in the 5 wt%-1100 °C sample at 25 °C. The data was fitted with an equivalent circuit model depicted in the inset, which consists of three resistors corresponding to the bulk resistance, Rb, the grin boundary resistance, Rgb, and electrode interface resistance as well as two constant phase elements for inhomogeneous capacitance components for the grain boundary and the interfaces. Total conductivity is defined as 1 / (Rb + Rgb). Among all samples, this sample exhibited the highest total conductivity, 4.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is ∼3 times less than typical conductivity of bulk NASICON ceramics, ∼1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 [[19], [20], [21], [22]], slightly better than that, 3.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 (Supplemental Fig. S2), of NASICON sheet without the glass additive sintered at 1230 °C, and estimated to be ∼2 orders of magnitude higher than the sol-gel derived Na3Zr2Si2PO12 film [29]. The density and especially the grain size is likely principal factors determining the total conductivity. Our tape-casted sheets have the average grain sizes of a few tenths of micrometers (Fig. 3), while the sol-gel derived films sintered at same temperature [29] have smaller grain size at least by an order.

The conductivity of all samples at 25 °C is plotted against the sintering temperature in Fig. 7b (Their EIS data are provided in Supplementaly Fig. S3.). The conductivity tends to increase with increasing sintering temperature, and was best for the 5 wt% at each sintering temperature of 1000 and 1100 °C. The general increase in the conductivity with the sintering temperature is attributable to the grain growth and relevant decrease in the grain boundary resistance. The optimum amount of the glass was 5 wt%.

The Na-Nb phosphate glass addition is effective for enhancing the sinterability and reducing sintering temperature of tape-casted NASICON. The dense sheet satisfies demands of a solid electrolyte separator particularly for metal anode protection-type batteries.

The glass is expected to be a liquid at temperatures above the melting point of 730 °C [31]. The liquid diffuses to infill pores and voids rapidly, promoting formation of gas- or liquid-tight dense structure [19,20]. During the sintering, most of Nb in the glass is crystallized as NaNbO3, while remaining component of P is likely incorporated in the NASICON crystal, increasing the P5+: (P5+ + Si4+) ratio in the tetrahedral site in the NASIOCN crystal. The charge neutrality is most likely compensated by decrease in the Na+ site occupation, leading to the decrease in bulk conductivity. This is also the case for the Nb5+ substitution for the octahedral Zr4+ site, despite the Nb solubility appears to be limited.

The conductivity was best for the 5 wt% at each sintering temperature of 1000 and 1100 °C. The general increase in the conductivity with the sintering temperature is mainly attributable to the grain growth and relevant decrease in the grain boundary resistance. When the amount of glass amount was smaller, the sintering was not promoted sufficiently (Fig. 2). When the amount was excess, the densification was sufficient, but the grain growth was rather suppressed (Fig. 3), leading to the increase in the grain boundary resistance. The amount of 5 wt% is regarded to be the best balanced condition for promoting both the grain growth and the densification.

Liquid- and gas-impermeable NASICON sheets with ∼35 μm in thickness were obtained by tape-casting of NASICON ingredients added with 5 or 10 wt% 60Na2O-10Nb2O5-30P2O5 glass and sintering of relevant green sheets at 1000–1100 °C, which is lower by 100–200 °C than the typical densification temperature of NASICON without the sintering aid. The 5 wt%-1100 °C sample exhibited best total conductivity of 4.4 × 10−4 S cm−1. Further addition of the glass (e.g. 10 wt%) resulted in the decrease in the conductivity most likely due to the suppression of grain growth. NaNbO3 was detectable in the 10 wt% samples.

The glass addition is effective for enhancing the sinterability to achieve impermeability and reducing sintering temperature. The latter is further beneficial for suppressing the evaporation of Na and the formation of ZrO2 sub-phase, preserving more stoichiometric chemical composition of NASICON. These properties are requisite to preparation of oxide-based ASSBs by co-sintering technique and reducing internal resistivity of ASSB and other electrochemical devices including aqueous Na-air battery.
