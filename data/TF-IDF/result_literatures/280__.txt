Novel NASICON-type structural Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7SixP5(3-0.8x)O12 (LATSP) solid electrolytes are synthesized by spraydrying combined with sintering methods, and the corresponding physicochemical properties are investigated by X-ray diﬀraction, Field emission scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy. The targeted LATSP powders present uniform cube-like morphology and excellent crystallinity, in which the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.053 E4 S cm−1 and a low activation energy of 0.44 eV at 25 °C as well as a high compaction density of 2.892 g cm−3 when the content of Si doping retains 5% vs. the molar ratio of the pure Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. Furthermore, the assembled LiCoO2/LATSP-0.05/Li all-solid-state coin cell can achieve a relatively high initial discharge speciﬁc capacity of 116.2 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and possess outstanding cycle and rate performance compared to other cells at room temperature. These results show that the novel LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte with NASICON-type structure is expected to widely employ in the ﬁeld of all-solid-state lithium ion batteries.

In recent years, all-solid-state lithium ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy-density, long cycle-life and wide electrochemistry-window have become an eﬀective solution to deal with safety problems by replacing the traditional liquid LIBs [1–4]. On the one hand, many obstacles, such as the ﬂammability and leakage associated with liquid electrolytes, are eliminated by the replacement of solid electrolytes [5–8]. On the other hand, the application of solid electrolytes in all-solid-state LIBs can eﬀectively alleviate the formation of lithium dendrites and improve the battery performance to a large extent [9–12]. However, the most key challenge for all-solid-state LIBs is the research and development of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity [13–16]. In the past decade, solid electrolytes can be classiﬁed into polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes, in which polymer electrolytes mainly include poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride), poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly (ethylene oxide) based electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes cover sulﬁdes and oxides, respectively [9,17–19]. Sulﬁde solid electrolytes are unstable in air while oxide solid electrolytes have a good chemical and electrochemical stability [1,20]. Oxide solid electrolytes possess various crystal structures, such as garnet-type [21], perovskitetype [22], LISICON-type [23], LIPON-type [5] and NASION-type [24], in which NASICON-type Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) electrolytes are

The NASICON-type LATP has a diamond-shaped unit with a space group of R3C [27], in which oxygen ions in the [TiO6] octahedral apex are shared to the [PO4] tetrahedron [28]. Besides these excellent inherent-properties, NASICON-type LATP solid electrolytes should meet following requirements to achieve good electrochemical performance for all-solid-state LIBs, high ionic conductivity at room temperature, low interface impedance between solid electrolytes and electrodes and excellent compatibility with lithium electrodes [29–32]. Nowadays, many eﬀective strategies have been employed to further increase the ionic conductivity at room temperature by enhancing the mobility of lithium ions in solid electrolytes, including adding sintering aids, improving the sintering process and doping elements into the solid electrolyte system [33–36]. Elements doping is one of the most eﬃcient and general method to increase the physical and electrochemical properties of LATP solid electrolytes. Further studies have shown that doping Si4+, Y3+, Ge4+, Ga3+ and Nb4+ into solid electrolytes can increase the lattice volume and compaction density of system and thus contribute to improve ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes [37–41]. In the present work, the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7SixP5(30.8x)O12 (LATSP) powders are successfully prepared by doping Si4+ into the LATP system using a spray-drying method and the eﬀect of diﬀerent Si4+ contents on the performance is investigated. In addition, the

The preparation process of the materials is brieﬂy stated as follows. First, the stoichiometric ratio of Ti(OC4H9)4, Al(NO3)·9H2O, LiNO3·H2O, H3PO4 and diﬀerent contents of C8H20O4Si are accurately weighed and then successively added into the mixture of alcohol and deionized water (1:1, v/v) with citric as complexing agent to produce the homogeneous Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7SixP5(3-0.8x)O12 (LATSP, x = 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) precursor solution with continuous stirring for 2 h in 80 °C water bath. Then the precursor solution is introduced into a spray dryer (YC-015 Shanghai Pilotech Instrument Equipment Co., Ltd.) to prepare LATSP precursor powders at a speed of 1500 mL h−1 in a pressure of 0.2 MPa. The precursor powders are placed in a tube furnace and are calcined for 6 h under 900 °C at a heating rate of 2.5 °C min−1 in air to obtain the targeted LATSP powders. According to the above methods, the pure LATP powders without Si4+ doping are obtained using the same process, which are placed into a tube furnace to calcine for 6 h in diﬀerent temperatures (800, 850, 900, 950 and 1000 °C). The LATSP-x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) are taken as the name of samples for the convenience of subsequent experiments, respectively. All the experimental chemicals are analytical grade and were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Co., Ltd..

The crystalline phase composition of the as-prepared ceramic powders is analyzed by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD, EMPYREAN) in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a rate of 4° s−1. The morphology and elemental distribution of the as-targeted LATP and LATSP are observed by Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, MIRA3 TESCAN) with the attached energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, TESCAN). The ceramic powders are uniformly dispersed in deionized water to determine the particle size distribution by Laser granularity analyze (LSPOP9). The infrared experiment of the samples in diﬀerent proportions is performed on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) at room temperature. The element composition of the samples is conducted by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-ALPHA). The compaction density of the solid electrolyte sheets is determined using Eq. (1), in which ρ, m, D and h represent the compaction density, weight, diameter and thickness of the as-prepared electrolyte sheet, respectively.

The interfacial impedance between solid electrolytes and electrodes is analyzed at diﬀerent temperatures using solid electrolyte sheets coated with Ag layers on both sides by CHI660E (Shanghai Chenhua Co., Ltd.) at scan frequency of 0.01–105 Hz with the amplitude of 10 mV. The ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is calculated using Eq. (2), in which σ, l and D denote the ionic conductivity, thickness and diameter of solid electrolytes and R refers to the impedance value obtained from the impedance spectra, respectively. The activation energy of solid electrolytes is calculated by the following Eq. (3), in which σ0, Ea and K are pre-exponential factor, activation energy and Boltzmann's constant, respectively. The galvanostatic charge-discharge performance of cells assembled with LATSP-x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) solid electrolyte sheets is investigated on a Land Battery System (Wuhan Land Electronic Co., Ltd.) at diﬀerent rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0C) with the cut-oﬀ voltage ranging from 2.75–4.25 V.

The XRD patterns of the diﬀerent LATSP-x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) powders sintered at 900 °C are depicted in Fig. 2(A), from which it can be found that the main diﬀraction peaks of the diﬀerent LATSP-x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) powders are also well indexed to the LiTi2(PO4)3 phase (JCPDS#35-0754). These results indicate that adding Si4+ into the LATP system generates very slight eﬀect on the crystal structure of the targeted samples, in which the impurity peak at 21.6° is attributed to SiO2 when the doping content reaches to 0.07. It can be explained that the ionic radius of Si4+ (41 pm) is larger than that of P5+ (34 pm), and in this case, the Si4+ ions cannot fully enter the crystal lattice. Fig. 2(B) presents the partial ampliﬁed XRD patterns of the samples at the range of 18–28°, from which it can be observed that all of the peak positions gradually move to the left and then to the right with increasing the content of Si4+. The reason of the peaks moving to the left can be attributed to the larger ionic radius of the doped Si4+, which leads to the increase of lattice parameters when Si4+ occupies part of the position of P5+. Moreover, the peaks move to the right when the doping content reaches to 0.07, which can be due to the decrease of the solubility of Si4+ in the LATSP system [43]. Therefore, there is reasonable to believe that the appropriate content of Si4+ can provide the more channels for lithium ion transfer, which is favorable to enhance the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolytes.

The FT-IR spectra of the LATSP with diﬀerent Si4+ contents are presented in Fig. 4. It can be distinctly found from Fig. 4 that there are three main bands around at 550 to 670, 900 to 1280 and 1000 to 1200 cm−1 in the as-prepared LATSP samples, which can be reasonably attributed to the bending vibration absorption peaks of P-O-P, stretching vibration peaks of (PO4)3− tetrahedron and vibration peaks of (SiO4)4− tetrahedron group, respectively. It can be clearly seen that the peak intensity in the range from 1000 to 1200 cm−1 of the LATSP-x (x = 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) powders have obvious changes with increasing the Si4+ doping content compared with pure LATP powders. This phenomenon indicates that P5+ ions are partly replaced by Si4+ ions, that is to say, the partial replacement of (PO4)3− tetrahedrons are occupied by (SiO4)4− tetrahedrons. These results can lead to lattice distortions and lithium ion vacancies, which can contribute to the improvement of ionic conductivity of the battery system.

To better understand the chemical valence and composition of the sintered samples, the XPS spectra of the targeted LATSP-0.05 sample calcined at 900 °C are investigated and presented in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen from the survey spectra demonstrated in Fig. 5(A) that the peaks of Li 1s, Al 2p, P 2p, Ti 2p, O 1s and Si 2p conﬁrm the main

The high ionic conductivity is an essential factor for the application of solid electrolytes in all-solid-state LIBs [44]. The impedance spectra of the assembled cells with the LATSP with diﬀerent Si4+ contents are depicted in Fig. 6(A). The impedance spectra exhibit a compressed semicircle springing from the grain boundary properties of the targeted samples in the high-medium frequency range and an oblique line originating from the diﬀusion of lithium ions in the blocking Ag electrodes in the low frequency range, in which the diameter of the semicircle represents the value of the grain boundary resistance (Rbg), and the left intercept of the semicircle on the real axis denotes the bulk resistance (Rb) and the oblique line refers to the Warburg resistance of the solid electrolytes, respectively. It can be found from Fig. 6(A) that the impedance values of the LATSP-x solid electrolytes present a signiﬁcant change when the adding Si4+ contents increase from 0 to 0.07. In particular, the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte presents the lowest impendence value about 1234 Ω, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the value in the gel or liquid electrolytes system due to the inferior interface wettability between solid electrolytes and active electrodes. The ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes is calculated by Eq. (2), in which R can be obtained from Fig. 6(A). Table 1 shows that the ionic conductivity of the LATSP-x (x = 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) solid electrolytes is always higher than that of the pure LATP solid electrolyte, in which the LATSP0.05 possesses the highest ionic conductivity of 1.053 E-4 S cm−1. It can be explained that the increasing lattice volume and compaction density of the system with doping Si4+ can lead to the improvement of ionic conductivity. To have insight into the mechanism of ionic conduction in solid electrolytes, the impedance spectra of the cell with the targeted LATSP-0.05 sample in the temperature range from 25 to 65 °C are investigated and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 6(B). It can be detected from Fig. 6(B) that the impedance values gradually decrease with the increase of temperature, which can be explained by increasing the diﬀusion rate of lithium ions in the solid electrolytes as increasing the temperature. AC impedance of the cells assembled with the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte at diﬀerent test temperatures (25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 °C) are shown in Fig. 6(C). It can be found that the relationship between the temperature and the ionic conductivity is well ﬁtted by Arrhenius equation. These results imply that the lithium ions composition of the sintered sample, which is well corresponding to EDX analysis results. To be speciﬁc, the XPS spectra of O 1s are deconvoluted into two distinct contributions and shown in Fig. 5(B), indicating the existence of two diﬀerent chemical environments of oxygen. The binging energies at 532.5 and 531.4 eV are assigned to the bridging oxygen (BO) and the non-bridging oxygen (NBO), respectively. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5(C), the Ti 2p spectra of the LATSP-0.05 sample exhibit a distinct spin-orbit doublet of 2P3/2 and 2P1/2. The peaks at 460.1 and 465.8 eV correspond to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 of Ti4+ in the LATSP0.05, respectively, indicating that the main form of Ti is Ti4+ in the LATSP system. Moreover, the obtained binding energy at 465.8 eV of the Ti 2p3/2 is 1.1 eV larger than the one of the reported TiO2 [24]. The phenomenon is due to the fact that the induced eﬀect of PeO bond existing in LATSP sample system can easily result in the polarization of the TieO bond. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Si element are presented in Fig. 5(D), which conﬁrms that the Si4+ ions are successfully doped into the LATP system.

The electrochemical properties of the all-solid-state LIBs are closely related to the compaction density (ρ) of the targeted LATSP powders. The corresponding ρ values are calculated according to Eq. (2) and the related results are listed in Table 1. It can be obviously seen from Table 1 that the ρ values of the solid electrolytes are aﬀected by the content of Si4+ in the LATP system, in which the ρ values are 2.724,

These phenomena can be attributed to the formation of the SiO2 second phase, which tends to form amorphous silicate at the grain boundary and can bind the grains together, and then result in improving the compaction density of solid electrolytes. In addition, the introduction of the second phase can promote the transfer of lithium ions from the grain interior to the grain boundary phase, which is beneﬁcial to the increasing of the ionic conductivity of the grain boundary. However, as a non-lithium ionic conductor, the excess second phase of SiO2 accumulates in the grain boundary and blocks the ions conduction of solid electrolytes. It can be clearly obtained from Table 1 that the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte has the highest compaction density of 2.892 g cm−1 when the doping content is 0.05, which indicates that only appropriate doped content can be beneﬁcial to improve the compaction density of solid electrolytes.

To illustrate the excellent performance of the cell assembled with the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte sheets, the surface morphology and phase composition before and after being cycled are examined and shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(A–B) displays the SEM images of the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte sheets before and after 50 cycles. By contrast, there are

Novel NASICON-type structural Si4+ doped LATSP-x (x = 0, 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07) solid electrolytes are successfully synthesized by spray drying and calcination method, and the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte can possess enhanced ionic conductivity and compaction density. The LiCoO2/LATSP-0.05/Li coin cell presents high charge-discharge and excellent rate and cycling properties at room temperature. Therefore, the LATSP-0.05 solid electrolyte may be a promising candidate for allsolid-state LIB in the future.
