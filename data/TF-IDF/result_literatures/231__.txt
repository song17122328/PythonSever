Though very encouraging progress has  been  made,  up  to  date,  for  most  phosphate  cathode  materials,  the  number  of  electrons  involved  in  the  electrochemical  reaction is still limited to one or two per formula unit, rendering the  energy density less than 500 Wh kg−1.[12,36] It is highly desirable  but remains a great challenge to seek a new cathode material that  enables three-electron reaction as well as high operating voltage  for a higher energy density.

Herein, a hitherto-unknown NASICON-type Na4MnCr(PO4)3  (NMCP)  has  been  successfully  synthesized  by  a  facile  sol–gel  method  and  developed  as  a  three-electron  reaction  cathode  for  SIBs. The as-prepared NMCP/C nanocomposites demonstrated  an intriguingly reversible three-electron process corresponding  to  the  Mn2+/Mn3+  (3.6  V),  Mn3+/Mn4+  (4.2  V),  and  Cr3+/Cr4+  (4.4 V) couples, respectively. Consequently, an admirable reversible capacity of 160.5  mA h g−1 at 0.05 C together with a high  average discharge voltage of 3.53 V has been achieved, realizing  the highest energy density of 566.5 Wh kg−1 among all the phosphate Na-storage cathodes reported so far, which is even higher  than  that  of  the  commercialized  LiFePO4  in  LIBs.  It  is  interesting that the synergetic effect of Mn and Cr can not only stabilize the crystal structure along with the Mn2+/4+ and Cr3+/Cr4+  transitions, but also improve the specific capacity, and increase  the working voltage through the high-potential redox centers.

The  crystal  structure  of  NMCP  was  determined  by  both  high-energy  synchrotron  X-ray  diffraction  (SXRD,  Figure  S1,  Supporting  Information)  and  neutron  powder  diffraction  (NPD). Figure 1a presents the Rietveld refinement of the NPD 

The rate capability of NMCP/C with a higher carbon content of 18.2 wt% was  also  measured  (Figure  S9,  Supporting  Information).  Although  the  electrode  exhibits  excellent  high-rate  tolerance,  the  energy  density is not comparable to that of NMCP/C (12.4 wt%) when  taking  the  total  mass  loading  into  account.  Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  measurements  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  electronic/ionic  conductivity  of  the  electrodes  with  different  carbon  contents  (Figure  S10,  Supporting  Information). The fitting results reveal that the electrodes with  higher carbon contents display lower charge-transfer resistance  (Rct) and faster Na-ion diffusivity, manifesting the great significance of carbon to the rate capability.

Galvanostatic  intermittent  titration  technique  (GITT)  measurements and CV curves at different scan rates were performed  between 1.4 and 4.3 V in order to estimate the electrode process  kinetics  of  NMCP/C.  Figure  2e  depicts  the  typical  charge/discharge  GITT  curves  at  the  second  cycle.  The  cell  was  charged  and discharged at 0.1 C for 30 min and relaxed for 120 min to  make  the  voltage  reach  equilibrium.  The  calculated  Na+  diffusion coefficients (DNa) are about 10−11 to 10−12 cm2 s−1 (Figure 2f;  Figure S11, Supporting Information), which are comparable to  those  of  the  NASICON-type  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  materials.[28]  From the CV curves at various scan rates (0.2–1.0 mV s−1), the  DNa  values  of  NMCP/C  electrode  are  calculated  to  be  around  10−12 cm2 s−1 (Figure S12a,b, Supporting Information), in good  accordance  with  the  GITT  result.  In  general,  faradaic  intercalation  and  surface-controlled  adsorption  (pseudocapacitance)  both  exist  in  carbon–coated  nanostructured  materials.[14,46] 

Specifically,  the  pseudocapacitive  contribution  in  NMCP/C  is  identified to be ≈32% at a scan rate of 0.6 mV s−1 (Figure S12c,d,  Supporting  Information).  The  moderate  pseudocapacitance  is  essential to the outstanding rate performance.

It  is  interesting  to  find  that  when  the  present  NMCP/C  is  charged/discharged within a wider potential range of 1.4–4.6 V,  three  distinct  voltage  plateaus  occur  at  3.6  V,  4.2  V,  and  4.4  V,  respectively  (Figure  3a).  The  electrode  can  deliver  an  initial  charge  capacity  of  196  mA  h  g−1  at  0.05  C  (1  C =  160  mA  g−1,  based  on  three-electron  transfer).  Intriguingly,  an  extraordinary  reversible  discharge  capacity  of  160.5  mA  h  g−1  and  a  decent  average  working  voltage  of  3.53  V  are  achieved  during  the  following Na+ insertion process. With the elevation of charge cut-off  voltage,  the  NMCP/C  enables  an  unprecedentedly  high  energy  density  of  566.5  Wh  kg−1  among  the  phosphate  Na-storage  cathodes reported so far which will be discussed later in detail.  In  accordance  with  the  charge–discharge  profiles,  the  CV   curves at 0.1 mV s−1 within the wide voltage range of 1.4–4.6 V  (Figure  S13,  Supporting  Information)  display  three  distinct  pairs  of  redox  peaks  located  at  about  3.43/3.75  V,  4.11/4.26  V,  and 4.34/4.43 V, respectively. As for the cyclic stability, a promising capacity retention of 74% is attained after 50 cycles at 0.2 C   (Figure  S14,  Supporting  Information).  The  capacity  fading  is  mainly  caused  by  the  decomposition  of  electrolyte  at  high  voltage  and  the  detrimental  Mn3+  Jahn–Teller  distortions.  As  is  well  known,  fluoroethylene  carbonate  (FEC)  is  recognized  as  a  suitable  additive  to  restrict  the  decomposition  of  electrolyte   and  benefit  the  formation  of  a  stable  solid  electrolyte  interface  film  on  electrodes.[47,48]  In  this  scenario,  the  electrolyte  

In  order  to  unveil  the  valence  variations  of  Mn  and  Cr  in  NCMP/C during Na+ extraction/insertion, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy was conducted.  Before the measurements, all samples were disassembled and  sealed directly into Capton film in a glovebox to avoid exposure  to  air.  Figure  3b  presents  the  Mn  K-edge  spectra  at  different  charged/discharged states during the first cycle. Upon charging  to  3.8  V,  the  energy  of  Mn  K-edge  shifts  rightward,  indicating  the  valence  change  from  Mn2+  to  Mn3+.  As  further  charged  to 4.3 V, the energy shows a significant shift to a higher level,  manifesting  further  oxidation  from  Mn3+  to  Mn4+.  When  the  charge cut-off voltage is continuously raised to a higher value of  4.6  V,  no  difference  occurs  in  the  energy  shift  of  Mn  K-edge  compared  with  that  at  4.3  V,  suggesting  that  Mn  is  fully  oxidized  at  4.3  V.  To  reveal  the  reversibility  of  Mn  valence  under  different  charge  depths,  two  electrodes  were  discharged  to  1.4 V after finishing the charge measurements at 4.3 and 4.6 V.  Both of them can recover to the energy state which is close to  the pristine material, attesting the highly reversible Mn valence  change.  Considering  the  different  coordination  environments  of phosphate and oxides, the standard oxides of MnO, Mn2O3,  and MnO2 were not used as the references for comparing the  oxidation  states  of  Mn.[15]  Figure  3c  presents  the  Cr  K-edge  absorption  spectra  at  different  states.  It  is  very  interesting  to  observe that there is also a shift in the energy of Cr K-edge upon  charging, especially, the pre-edge peak of Cr displays a dramatic  change (the inset of Figure 3c). When charged to 3.8 V, the preedge  peak  remains  unchanged  at  5990  eV,  similar  to  the  pristine  electrode.  However,  upon  charging  to  4.3  V,  the  pre-edge   peak  splits  into  two  peaks  located  at  5990  eV  and  5992  eV,  respectively,  which  can  be  attributed  to  the  1s  to  3d  transition  due to the Cr oxidation. The small pre-edge peak at 5992 eV is  exactly the indication of Cr4+. Such phenomenon has also been  observed  in  other  Cr-based  cathode  materials  for  SIBs.[49,50]  When the electrode was further charged to 4.6 V, the intensity  of  the  pre-edge  peak  at  5992  eV  is  significantly  increased  but  not  the  energy.  It  means  a  continuous  oxidation  from  Cr3+  to  Cr4+.  Therefore,  we  can  conclude  that  a  small  amount  of  Cr3+  undergoes  valence  variation  to  Cr4+  when  charged  to  4.3  V,  and more Cr3+ can be oxidized to Cr4+ upon charging to 4.6 V.  More  impressively,  after  being  discharged  to  1.4  V,  the  preedge peak recovers back to the pristine state, corroborating the  excellent reversibility of the whole reaction. Based on the above discussions,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  three  reversible  plateaus, which are located at 3.6 V, 4.2 V, and 4.4 V, correspond  to  the  Mn2+/Mn3+,  Mn3+/Mn4+,  and  Cr3+/Cr4+  redox  couples,  respectively.  The  extraordinary  specific  capacity  in  the  present  NMCP material is highly correlated with the unique three-electron transfer process, namely, Na4Mn(II)Cr(III)(PO4)3 – 3Na+ –  3e−  ⇄  NaMn(IV)Cr(IV)(PO4)3.  To  deeply  understand  the  local  environment  of  Mn  upon  sodiation/desodiation,  the  extended  X-ray  absorption  fine  structure  (EXAFS)  analyses  have  been  performed.  Figure  3d  exhibits  the  Fourier-transformed  Mn  K-edge EXAFS spectra of NMCP during Na+ extraction. When  the  electrode  is  charged  to  3.8  V,  the  peak  of  MnO  bonds  splits  into  two  peaks  with  decreasing  intensity,  implying  that  the  MnO6  octahedra  experience  positive  Mn3+  Jahn–Teller  distortions with four lengthened MnO bonds and two shortened  MnO  bonds.  Such  a  phenomenon  was  also  observed  in  the  previous study on LiMnPO4.[51] Moreover, with further charging  to 4.3 V, the two peaks emerge into one peak again, which suggests another valence transformation from Mn3+ to Mn4+.

For  the  purpose  of  illuminating  the  structural  evolution  in  NMCP/C  during  the  Na+  extraction/insertion  process,  in  situ  XRD  has  been  carried  out.  The  in  situ  XRD  patterns  were  collected within the voltage range of 1.4–4.6 V using Al foil as  both  current  collector  and  monitoring  window  (Figure  3e).  In  general,  all  the  diffraction  peaks  undergo  significant  shift  and  progressively recover to the initial state, demonstrating that the  full charge/discharge reaction is highly reversible. The gradual  shift of some peaks signifies a single-phase solid-solution reaction,  whereas  the  emergence  of  new  peaks  or  disappearance  of  existing  peaks  represents  phase  transition.  Specifically,  the  (211)  profile  shifts  rightward,  and  completely  disappears  upon  charging.  At  discharging,  the  peak  gradually  reappears.  Furthermore,  upon  desodiation,  the  (300)  peak  experiences  rightward shift, splits into two peaks, and subsequently continues to  shift rightward. During the sodiation process, the peak of (300)  completely  restores  back  to  the  pristine  state.  To  elucidate  the  detailed  structural  change,  we  conducted  the  Rietveld  refinement  of  ex  situ  high-energy  SXRD  on  the  samples  at  two  different charged states of 4.3 and 4.6 V. As shown in Figure S18  and  Tables  S2  and  S3,  Supporting  Information,  there  is  a  systematical  change  in  lattice  parameters  as  follows:  the  pristine  Na4MnCr(PO4)3  (a  =  8.912  Å,  c  =  21.493  Å),  Na2MnCr(PO4)3  (4.3  V,  a  =  8.646  Å,  c  =  21.741  Å),  and  NaMnCr(PO4)3  (4.6  V,  a  =  8.510  Å,  c  =  21.760  Å).  The  a-axis  decreases,  while  the   c-axis  increases.  The  unit  cell  volume  expands  (ΔV/Vpristine)  at  4.8%  and  7.7%  for  the  two  charged  states  of  4.3  V  and  4.6  V,  respectively. The increased c-axis and decreased a-axis manifest  that the Na2 sites gradually become empty, while the Na1 sites  are still highly occupied.[43] It needs to be noted that the volume  expansion  of  the  current  three-electron  reaction  in  NMCP  is  similar to those of the one-electron reaction or two-electron reaction  materials  such  as  Na3V2(PO4)3  (8.3%),[37]  Na3MnZr(PO4)3  (5.5%),[32] Na4Mn3(PO4)2P2O7 (7%),[44] Na3MnTi(PO4)3 (4.8%),[43]  and LiFePO4 (6.8%).[52] This indicates that the high-potential Cr  redox  center  can  not  only  contribute  to  the  reversible  capacity,  but  also  stabilize  the  structure  by  alleviating  the  detrimental  impact from the Mn3+ Jahn–Teller effect.

Therefore,  one  can  see  that  the  Na1–Na2–Na1  channels  (depicted  by  the  blue isosurfaces in Figure 5a) in parallel with the [MnCr(PO4)3]  framework  are  the  most  energy  favorable  pathways  for  Na+  diffusion.  The  corresponding  migration  barrier  (0.38  eV)  is  comparable  to  that  of  Na3V2(PO4)3,  and  is  much  smaller  than  those  of  most  reported  SIB  cathode  materials.[14,16,46]  In  addition,  the  projected  density  of  states  (DOS)  of  NMCP  exhibit  some  metallic  properties  especially  for  the  spin  up  electrons  (Figure 5c, the band structure is provided in Figure S19, Supporting Information). The excellent reaction kinetics and desirable rate performance of NMCP are ascribed to the low ionicmigration energy barrier and decent electronic conductivity.

The fascinating Na-storage performance of NMCP/C inspires  us  to  explore  its  practical  feasibility  for  full  batteries.  The  hard  carbon  anode  was  matched  with  the  NMCP/C  cathode  to  assemble  Na-ion  full  cells,  as  schematically  illustrated  in  Figure  6a.  The  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  curves  and  cycling  performance  of  the  hard  carbon  anode  are  provided  in  Figure  S20,  Supporting  Information.  In  order  to  balance  the  capacity,  the  active  mass  ratio  of  cathode  to  anode  was  set  at  2.1:1  within  the  voltage  window  of  1.2–4.3  V,  and  1.5:1  within  the voltage window of 1.2–4.6 V. Figure 6b,c displays the charge– discharge  profiles  of  the  full  cells,  initial  discharge  capacities of 146.5 mA h g−1 and 105.9 mA h g−1 are obtained under  1.2–4.6  V  and  1.2–4.3  V,  respectively,  at  a  current  density  of   0.1 C (1 C = 160 mA g−1 for 1.2–4.6 V and 1 C = 111 mA g−1 for  1.2–4.3 V, based on the cathode active mass). In coincidence with  the  voltage  profiles,  the  CV  curves  of  the  full  cell  within  1.2– 4.6 V (Figure S21, Supporting Information) feature three pairs of  redox peaks positioned at 3.34/3.63, 4.02/4.17, and 4.28/4.37 V,  corresponding  to  the  Mn2+/3+,  Mn3+/4+,  and  Cr3+/4+  reactions,  respectively.  In  addition,  the  cyclic  stability  and  rate  capability  in the two different voltage ranges are provided in Figure  6d,e.  The  full  cells  enable  capacity  retentions  of  84.5%  and  72.1%  under  1.2–4.3  V  and  1.2–4.6  V  after  50  cycles  at  0.2  C,  respectively. Besides, between 1.2 and 4.6 V, the full cell can deliver rate  capacities of 145.4  mA h g−1, 136.5  mA h g−1, 124.0  mA h g−1,  110.6  mA  h  g−1,  96.3  mA  h  g−1,  and  75.9  mA  h  g−1,  at  0.1  C,  0.2 C, 0.5 C, 1.0 C, 2.0 C, and 5.0 C, respectively; between 1.2 and  4.3 V, the capacities are successively 105.6, 98.3, 91.6, 73.2, 62.2,  and 50.1 mA h g−1, manifesting the excellent rate performance of  the full cells. We have also summarized the full cell performance  in terms of cyclic stability, energy density, and output voltage of  the recently reported works (Table S4, Supporting Information),   the overall performance especially the high energy density of the  present  work  is  outstanding  among  its  peers.[14,33,34]  Moreover,  the excellent temperature stability of the full cell under the voltage  interval  of  1.2–4.6  V  at  0.2  C  is  elucidated  in  Figure  6f,  which  presents discharge capacities of 106.5 mA h g−1, 126.0 mA h g−1,  134.8 mA h g−1, 142.2 mA h g−1, and 147.5 mA h g−1 at −10 °C,  0  °C,  25  °C,  40  °C,  and  60  °C,  respectively.  The  insert  digital  photo of Figure 6d demonstrates that the coin-type full cell can  continuously light up dozens of light-emitting diodes, showing a  great prospect for practical applications.

In  summary,  a  novel  NASICON-type  Na4MnCr(PO4)3  has  been developed as a promising three-electron reaction cathode  for  high-performance  SIBs.  The  crystal  structure  with  R-3c  space  group  was  verified  by  the  NPD  and  high-energy  SXRD polyanion-type  cathodes.  Not  only  higher  discharge  voltage  but  also higher specific capacity is demanded toward excellent performance of energy density. In the present work, it is very interesting  to achieve an energy density as high as 566.5 Wh kg−1 (specific  capacity of 160.5 mA h g−1 with operating voltage of 3.53 V). It is  the first realization of energy density more than 550 Wh kg−1 for  the phosphate SIB cathode materials, which is even higher than  that of the commercialized LiFePO4/Li batteries.[52]

To  deeply  figure  out  the  origin  of  the  superior  Na-storage  behavior of NMCP/C, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the Na+ migration paths and  barriers. As shown in Figure 5a, four possible migration pathways  are  rationally  built  following  Na1→Na2  (P1),  Na2→Na1  (P2),  Na1→Na1  (P3),  and  Na2→Na2  (P4).  Based  on  the  climbing-image  nudged  elastic  band  method,[53]  the  calculated  energy  barriers  for  the  P1,  P2,  P3,  and  P4  paths  are  0.38  eV, 

The  NMCP  nanoparticles  homogeneously  distributed  in  carbon  matrix  could  deliver  an  initial  discharge  capacity  of  114  mA  h  g−1  in  the  voltage  window  of  1.4–4.3  V  with  a  prominent  capacity  retention  of  86.5%  after  600  cycles.  When  the  charge  cut-off  voltage  was  extended  to  4.6 V, the cell could display an extraordinary reversible capacity  of 160.5 mA h g−1 with an average discharge voltage of 3.53 V,  harvesting  the  energy  density  record  of  566.5  Wh  kg−1  for  the  phosphate  Na-storage  cathode  materials.  Confirmed  by  the  ex  situ  XANES  measurements,  the  uncommon  three-electron  reaction  with  Mn2+/Mn3+,  Mn3+/Mn4+,  and  Cr3+/Cr4+  redox  couples  is  responsible  for  the  ultrahigh  specific  capacity.  The  DFT computations and GITT measurements manifest that the  low  ionic-migration  energy  barrier  and  facilitated  Na+  diffusivity  account  for  the  outstanding  rate  capability  of  NMCP/C.  In situ XRD and ex situ synchrotron XRD further elaborate that  the  structure  experiences  highly  reversible  single  phase  and  biphasic  transitions  with  small  volume  changes  of  4.8%  and  7.7% over the two-electron and three-electron processes, respectively. Future studies on metal-ion doping, morphology design,  and surface engineering may further improve the cyclic stability  of the present interesting three-electron reaction cathode material. The concept of designing reversible multielectron reaction  cathode materials can be extended to the family of NaxM2(PO4)3  (M  =  transition  metal),  which  opens  a  new  window  for  the  development of high-energy-density cathodes for SIBs.
