Adoption  of  cells  with  a  solid-state  electrolyte  is  a  promising  solution  for  eliminating  thepolysulfide shuttle problem in Li-S batteries.

Among the various known lithium-ion conductingsolid-electrolytes,  the  Nasicon-type  Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3  offers  the  advantage  of  good  stabilityunder ambient conditions and in contact with air.

Accordingly, we present here a comprehensiveassessment of the durability of Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 in contact with polysulfide solution and in Li-S cells. 

Due to its high reduction potential (2. Due to its high reduction potential (2.5 V vs.Li/Li+), Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 gets lithiated incontact with lithium polysulfide solution and Li2CO3 is formed on the particle surface, blockingthe  interfacial  lithium-ion  transport  between  the  liquid  and  solid-state  electrolytes.After  thelithium  insertion  into  the  NASICON  framework,  the  crystal  expands  in  an  anisotropic  way,weakening the crystal bonds, causing fissures and resultant cracks in the ceramic, corroding thegrain boundaries by polysulfide solution, and leaving unfavorable pores.The assembly of porescreates a gateway for polysulfide  diffusion from  the cathode side to  the anode  side, causing anabrupt  decline  in  cell  performance.Therefore,  the  solid-state  electrolytes  need  to  have  goodchemical  compatibility  with  both  the  electrode  and  electrolyte,  long-term  stability  under  harshchemical environment, and highly stable grain boundaries.

As a highly efficient and environment-friendly energy storage system, lithium-based batterieshave long been regarded as a promising power source for the sustainable growth of our society. 

However,  the  current  lithium-ion  batteries  are  unable  to  satisfy  the  world’s  rapidly  risingdemand for higher energy density.

The theoretical energy density of the Li-S battery system (~2,600 Wh kg1) is five times as high as that of commercial Li-ion system, making it a promisingnext-generation energy storage technology.

Despite  this  advantage,  the  current  Li-S  battery  system  with  conventional  organic  liquidelectrolyte and Celgard separator has problems that need to be addressed before it could becomecommercially viable.

The highly soluble long-chain polysulfides generated in the cathode duringeasily migrate through the separator to the anode side, where they are reduced into  Li2S and/orshort-chain  polysulfides.

The  parasitic  reaction  between  the  diffused  polysulfides  and  lithiummetal  anode  leads  to  a  gradual  loss  of  sulfur  and  lithium  metal  active  materials,  causing  poorcapacity  retention  and  resulting  in  low  Coulombic  efficiency.6,  7  To  solve  these  inherentproblems, many  approaches have been  pursued in the literature.The strategies pursued includethe trapping of polysulfide species within the cathode, protection of lithium-metal anode, and useof  new  type  of  separators.8,  9  However,  these  approaches  could  not  completely  eliminate  thepoysulfide  shuttle  problem.The  polysulfide  shuttle  problem  becomes  even  more  magnified  asthe sulfur loading in the cathode is increased to practically acceptable levels.To harness a stableLi-S battery system and to improve the cycling performance of Li-S batteries, new strategies thatcan completely confine the dissolved polysulfide species within the cathode region are needed.

Batteries that employ solid-state electrolytes as separators, instead of the currently used porouspolymeric  separators,  could  potentially  impede  any  diffusion  of  soluble  species  between  thecathode  and  the  anode.Such  a  design  is  now  recognized  as  the  most  promising  architecturenecessary  to  resolve  the  problems  associated  with  the  polysulfide  shuttle  reaction.Recently,there  has  been  significant  progress  with  Li-S  cells  employing  solid-state  electrolytes  towardsenhancing the Coulombic efficiency and long-term calendar life.10, 11 Solid-state electrolytes playa  pivotal  role  in  achieving  good  performance  with  such  systems.10,  12  Various  solid-stateelectrolytes based on NASICON, Garnet, LiPON, and sulfides have been developed and pursued.

Among  them,  the  NASICON-type  solid-state  electrolytes  are  currently  the  most  stable  inambient atmosphere and in contact with moisture. 

With a high conductivity (~ 103 S cm-1),the Al-doped  Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 with  the NASICON structure is the most  prevalent solid-stateLi-S  batteries  employing  the  Ti-based  NASICON-type  solid-state  electrolytes,  without  theLiNO3 additives in the liquid electrolyte, have previously been shown to exhibit high Coulombicefficiency.

However, the durability of these solid-state electrolytes in Li-S batteries, which is oneof the most important issues for the long cycling life of batteries, has yet to be investigated.

We present here an investigation of the chemical compatibility between the solid-state electrolytematerial  Li1.

We present here an investigation of the chemical compatibility between the solid-state electrolytematerial  Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  (LATP)  and  polysulfide  solution.The  detailed  degradationmechanism  of  the  solid-state  electrolyte  membrane  is  uncovered  under  electrochemicalTo investigate the chemical compatibility between the solid-state electrolyte and a polysulfidesolution, LATP powder was first immersed into a polysulfide solution (6 M Li2S4) and allowedto  soak  at  50°C  for  12  h.From  Figure  1,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  color  of  the  white  powdertransforms into blue color after this soaking process, indicating a chemical reaction of LATP inpolysulfide  solution.  The  soaked  compound  is  hereafter  termed  as  r-LATP.Morphological  andstructural characterizations were then performed on both the original and the reacted powder inorder to clarify the reaction mechanism.

Figure 1. Photo (inset) and SEM image of (a) LATP and (b) r-LATP.(c) XRD pattern of LATPand  r-LATP  with  corresponding  standard  diffraction  peaks  of  LiTi2(PO4)3  (PDF  04-011-2160)and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 (PDF 04-006-8821).

The as-prepared solid-state material LATP was examined with a scanning electron microscope(SEM)  and  it  was  found  to  consist  of  cubic  particles  (particle  size:  1  –  20  m),  as  shown  inFigure  1a.The  particle  size  and  morphology  of  r-LATP  did  not  show  any  significant  changeupon  reaction  in  the  polysulfide  solution.Energy  dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  (EDX)  (TableS1)  and  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS)  (Table  S2)  were  used  to  determine  theelemental  composition  in  the  two  powders.EDX  results  show  ample  signals  for  the  elementsaluminum  (Al),  titanium  (Ti),  phosphorous  (P)  and  oxygen  (O).The  lithium  (Li)  1s  peak  wascharacterized in  a wide-scan  XPS survey, confirming the presence of lithium.The existence ofelemental S was  not detected in  either EDX or  XPS spectra.In  essence, we are able to  deducethat the elements in the reaction product r-LATP include Li, Al, Ti, P and O.

Figure  1c  gives  the  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  of  the  fresh  solid-state  electrolytematerial  LATP  and  the  reaction  product  r-LATP.The  XRD  pattern  of  the  fresh  LATP  showssingle-phase  formation  and  the  typical  NASICON  structure. 

However,  the  peak  positionsand  relative  intensities  change  from  LATP  to  r-LATP.The  XRD  pattern  of  the  polysulfide-immersed  reaction  product  r-LATP  matches  closely  with  the  diffraction  peaks  of  Li3Ti2(PO4)3(PDF  04-011-2160),.T

he  elemental  composition  of  r-LATP  (performed  with  EDX  and  XPS)include  Li,  Al,  Ti,  P,  O.Therefore,  we  deduce  that  the  reaction  product  r-LATP  is  Al-dopedFrom the literature, the reduction potential for Al-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 is ~ 2.

Therefore,  we  deduce  that  the  reaction  product  r-LATP  is  Al-dopedFrom the literature, the reduction potential for Al-doped LiTi2(PO4)3 is ~ 2.5 V vs. Li+/Li.24, 25The oxidation potential for polysulfide solution (Li2S4) is ~ 2.24, 25The oxidation potential for polysulfide solution (Li2S4) is ~ 2.3 V vs.Li+/Li, indicating that theNASICON solid-state electrolyte LATP would be reduced by polysulfide solution.As shown inFigure  2d,  the  two  XPS  peaks  corresponding  to  Ti  2p1/2  and  Ti  2p3/2  have  shifted  to  lowerbinding energies by ~ 0.As shown inFigure  2d,  the  two  XPS  peaks  corresponding  to  Ti  2p1/2  and  Ti  2p3/2  have  shifted  to  lowerbinding energies by ~ 0.7 eV after reaction with the polysulfide solution.This shift is due to thereduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ that is accompanied by a lithiation of LATP by polysulfide solution.26Lithium ions from polysulfide are inserted into LATP, and the polysulfide becomes higher-order(e.g.,  Li2Sy,  y  >  4).The  reaction  of  LATP  was  also  investigated  with  different  polysulfidesolutions  (Li2S4,  Li2S6,  and  Li2S8)  under  the  same  experimental  procedures.

A  similar  reactionmechanism as described above was confirmed by the XRD of the products (Figure S1).

Figure 2a shows a wide scan XPS survey of the reaction products.The peak intensities of P 2s,P  2p,  and  Ti  2p  have  become  much  smaller  after  the  reaction  while  those  of  C  1s  and  O  1sremain  similar.The  intensity  of  the  Li  1s  peak  of  the  reaction  product  r-LATP  has  becomeslightly stronger than that of LATP.

The variations in the peaks intensities between r-LATP andLATP may be caused by excess lithium on the surface of the r-LATP particles after reacting withthe polysulfide solution, causing a diminution of the peak intensities of Ti and P.Looking at thedetailed C 1s spectra of LATP, there are three peaks at 289.Looking at thedetailed C 1s spectra of LATP, there are three peaks at 289.0, 286.0, 286.6, and 285.6, and 285.0 eV, which are allattributed  to  adventitious  carbon. 

After  the  reaction,  there  is  a  typical  peak  at  290.27  After  the  reaction,  there  is  a  typical  peak  at  290.0  eV,representing C 1s in carbonate.28 Looking at the detailed O 1s spectrum of LATP, there are twopeaks at 533.28 Looking at the detailed O 1s spectrum of LATP, there are twopeaks at 533. and 531. and 531.2 eV, which originate from oxygen atoms at different crystalline sites inLiTi2(PO4)3.2 eV, which originate from oxygen atoms at different crystalline sites inLiTi2(PO4)3.29 After reacting with the polysulfide solution, there exists only one peak for O 1s at531.29 After reacting with the polysulfide solution, there exists only one peak for O 1s at531.9 eV, which is typical for O 1s in Li2CO3.9 eV, which is typical for O 1s in Li2CO3.28 The conclusion can thus be drawn that Li2CO3 isformed  on  the  particle  surface.

A  similar  phenomenon  has  also  happened  on  other  solid-stateelectrolyte compounds (e.g., Li14Zn(GeO4)4 and Li7La3Zr2O12), when these solid-state electrolytematerials  were  exposed  to  harsh  chemical  environments.15,  30,  31  Since  Li2CO3  has  much  lowerconductivity,  the  formation  of  Li2CO3  may  increase  the  interfacial  resistance  by  impeding  thelithium ion transport between the solid-state electrolyte and liquid electrolyte.

In  order  to  get  more  detailed  information  on  the  structural  variations  of  LATP  and  r-LATP,Rietveld  refinement  was  conducted  with  XRD  data.The  compounds  LiTi2(PO4)3  andLi3Ti2(PO4)3  were  used  as  the  starting  model  for  the  refinement  of,  respectively,  LATP  and  r-LATP.A  rather  good  agreement  was  obtained  between  the  observed  and  the  calculated  XRDpatterns with low reliability factors (Rwp = 10.A  rather  good  agreement  was  obtained  between  the  observed  and  the  calculated  XRDpatterns with low reliability factors (Rwp = 10.8 %; Rb = 3.8 %; Rb = 3.22 % for Li1.22 % for Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 and Rwp=  21.7(PO4)3 and Rwp=  21.6  %;  Rb  =  7.6  %;  Rb  =  7.37  %  for  Li3Al0.37  %  for  Li3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3).The  structures  are  shown  in  Figure  3  and  thestructural parameters are summarized in Tables S3 and S4 in the supporting information.

Figure  3.Experimental  (red)  and  calculated  (black)  XRD  patterns  and  the  difference  betweenthem  (blue  line  near  bottom)  of  (a)  LATP  and  (b)  r-LATP.The  cyan  vertical  bars  indicate  thepositions of allowed Bragg reflections. Crystal structures of (c) LATP and (d) r-LATP.

LATP has the typical NASICON structure consisting of a three-dimensional rigid frameworkwith Ti(Al)O6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing common corners.The space group is R-3C(167).After  reacting  with  the  polysulfide  solution,  r-LATP  still  maintains  the  NASICONstructure with contiguous M2(PO4)3 units (M = Ti, Al).The main structural differences betweenthe two can be found in the ribbons parallel to the c axis.After the reaction, the PO4 tetrahedraremain  unchanged.However,  following  the  reduction  of  Ti4+  to  Ti3+,  the  Ti  octahedra  expand(Ti, Al-O bond increases from 1.However,  following  the  reduction  of  Ti4+  to  Ti3+,  the  Ti  octahedra  expand(Ti, Al-O bond increases from 1.88 to 2.88 to 2.06 Å).The similar distances for the six Ti-O bonds in r-LATP implies a lower distortion of the TiO6 octahedra than that seen in LATP.

In LATP, there are two lithium atom sites at M1 and M2.In LATP, there are two lithium atom sites at M1 and M2.Lithium atoms first occupy the M1sites  located  between  two  TiO6  octahedral  sites  along  the  c  axis.The  additional  lithium  atomsthen occupy the M2 sites situated between  the ribbons perpendicular to  the c axis,  exhibiting atrigonal prismatic coordination with oxygen.However, in r-LATP, a large electrostatic repulsioncauses lithium to move from the M1 sites to the M2 cavity as lithium ions are inserted into theframework.According to the structural models of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 from previous neutron diffractionstudies,  Li+  occupies  M3  and  M3’  sites,  which  are  deviating  from  the  center  of  M2  cavity,forming strongly distorted oxygenated tetrahedra.

The Ti(1)–Ti(2) distance is almost the same between LATP [4.The Ti(1)–Ti(2) distance is almost the same between LATP [4.52(5) Å] and r-LATP [4.52(5) Å] and r-LATP [4.52(4)Å], while there are significant changes in the Ti(1)–Ti(1) distance and Ti(2)–Ti(2) distance.TheTi(2)–Ti(2)  distance  [6.TheTi(2)–Ti(2)  distance  [6.93(7)  Å]  and  the  Ti(1)–Ti(1)  distance  [6.93(7)  Å]  and  the  Ti(1)–Ti(1)  distance  [6.71(4)  Å]  in  r-LATP  are  muchlonger  than  the  corresponding  Ti–Ti  distance  [5.71(4)  Å]  in  r-LATP  are  muchlonger  than  the  corresponding  Ti–Ti  distance  [5.88(3)  Å]  in  LATP.

This  is  in  accordance  withthe lack of lithium ions between the oxygen layers in the M1 cavity.The size variation of the M1cavity  in  r-LATP  causes  a  distortion  of  the  [Ti2(PO4)3]  framework.The  oxygen  displacementsperpendicular to the c axis results in a seemingly twist or coil of the PO4 tetrahedra.The slightdistortions reduce the symmetry of the structure from R-3C (167) to R-3 (148).The lithium-iondisplacement  and  Ti4+  reduction  cause  changes  in  the  size  of  the  octahedra  and  the  resultinganisotropic  expansion  of  the  unit  cell.  

The  length  of  the  a  axis  decreases  from  8.  The  length  of  the  a  axis  decreases  from  8.4948(3)  Å  to8.4948(3)  Å  to8.3476(3) Å, while the length of c axis increases from 20.3476(3) Å, while the length of c axis increases from 20.8144(0) Å to 22.8144(0) Å to 22.6986(12) Å.The unitcell  expands  approximately  by  5%  by  volume.The  anisotropic  expansion  of  the  unit  cell  mayweaken the connection of crystals and give rise to small cracks in the ceramic.

In  order  to  test  the  stability  of  the  solid-state  electrolyte,  Li-S  batteries  were  assembled  withthe  LATP  solid-state  electrolyte  membrane.Figure  S2  gives  a  schematic  configuration  of  thecell.  

The  solid-state  electrolyte  separates  the  cathode  chamber  and  the  anode  chamber.For  acomparison,  a  traditional  coin  cell  was  also  assembled  with  a  Celgard  separator  and  withoutLiNO3 additive.Figure  S3  shows  the  charge  and  discharge  polarization  curves  of  the  two  celldesigns.For the coin cell with the Celgard separator, the charge capacity is much higher than thedischarge capacity – the initial  Coulombic efficiency is  only 55.For the coin cell with the Celgard separator, the charge capacity is much higher than thedischarge capacity – the initial  Coulombic efficiency is  only 55.4  %.The high charge  capacitystems from the outcome of the shuttle effect.Oxidized polysulfide species diffuse to the anodeand  is  reduced  into  low-order  polysulfide  species  to  be  charged  again.High  Coulombicefficiency, on the other hand, was able to be obtained for the cell with the solid-state electrolyte.

This  is  because  the  solid-state  electrolyte  is  capable  of  totally  curbing  any  diffusion  ofpolysulfide species to the anode side.

The shuttle effect is completely obstructed in the cell withthe solid-electrolyte.

Accordingly, the cell exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 978 mAhg1 at C/10 rate, and stable cycling performance was achieved for 50 cycles.

However, an abruptdegradation of the cell performance occurred.After cycling and upon disassembling the cell, thecolor of the ceramic electrolyte was visibly blue (Figure 4b), indicating that the ceramic has beenreduced  by  polysulfide  solution  during  electrochemical  testing,  which  was  confirmed  by  theXRD analysis.

As shown in Figure S4, new peaks belonging to Li3Ti2(PO4)3 appeared after theelectrochemical  cycling.

The morphology of the ceramic electrolyte was  characterized by SEM(Figure  4).After  cycling,  the  glass-type  grain  boundaries,  which  connected  the  cubic  grains  inthe membrane, were corroded (Figure 4c and 4d).The presence of pores increased, leaving cubicgrains.

This  allowed  the  polysulfide  diffusion  from  the  cathode  side  to  the  anode  side,  whichresulted  in  the  abrupt  degradation  of  the  cell  performance.Electrochemical  impedancespectroscopy (EIS) analysis was performed on a cell before cycling, at 20th cycle, and after  50cycles  (Figure  S5a).The  responses  before  cycling  and  at  20th  cycle  can  be  divided  into  threeparts.The high-frequency semicircle corresponds to the response from the electrolyte, includingsolid electrolyte, liquid electrolyte, and the interfaces between the solid electrolyte and the liquidelectrolyte.The  semicircle  at  the  mid-frequency  range  arises  from  the  response  of  the  solidelectrolyte  interphase  (SEI)  between  the  liquid  electrolyte  and  lithium  metal.

The  semicircle  atthe low-frequency range corresponds to the response from the charge-transfer reaction.The EISanalysis  of  the  cell  after  cycling  (shown  in  blue  in  Figure  S5a)  reveals  no  response  from  thecharge-transfer  reaction,  suggesting a failure of the cell.The impedance  data were  fitted to  getthe resistances of the cell at different stages (Figure S5 and Table S5).All the resistances fromthe three responses increase on cell cycling.

Figure  4.Figure  4.  Electrochemical  analysis  and  performance:  (a)  voltage  vs.time  curve  and  (b)  thecycling  performance  of  a  Li-S  cell  with  solid-state  electrolyte.SEM  images  of  the  solid-stateelectrolyte (c) before and (d) after cycling.

After cycling, the ceramic electrolytes were recovered from the cell.The ceramic electrolyteswere  washed  with  DOL-DME  solvent  and  then  dried  in  an  oven.The  ionic  transport  wasevaluated  with  impedance  measurements  (Figure  S6)  and  isothermal  transient  ionic  current(ITIC)  measurements  (Figure  S7).There  are  three  factors  that  affect  the  conductivity:  (1)  theformation of pores in the ceramic may reduce the total conductivity, (2) the reduction of Ti4+ mayincrease  the  electronic  conductivity,  and  (3)  the  change  in  the  structure  and  increase  in  thelithium-ion  concentration  in  the  structure  may  also  have  an  effect  on  the  ionic  conductivity.

According to the impedance measurements, total conductivity increases from 3.According to the impedance measurements, total conductivity increases from 3.35 × 10-4 S cm-1to  5.35 × 10-4 S cm-1to  5.48  ×  10-4  S  cm-1  after  cycling  for  50  cycles.The  spike  tails  at  the  low  frequency  rangeindicate  that  the  ionic  conductivity  dominates  the  total  conductivity  for  the  ceramic  electrolytebefore  and  after  cycling.  This  has  also  been  confirmed  by  the  ITIC  measurements.Since  ion-blocking electrodes were employed, an apparent ionic blocking current was observed.The ionictransference numbers were 0.The ionictransference numbers were 0.99 and 0.99 and 0.98 before and after cycling respectively, which confirmsthat the ionic conductivity still dominates the total conductivity even with the reduction of Ti4+.

Although there are a lot of pores in the cycled ceramic electrolyte, there is still an increase in theconductivity,  indicating  that  the  lithium-ion  diffusion  in  r-LATP  is  higher  than  that  in  LATP.

After  the  reaction,  the  reduction  product  Li3Al0.After  the  reaction,  the  reduction  product  Li3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO3)4  still  maintained  the  NASICONstructure.Due  to  the  modification  of  the  crystal  structure  and  an  increase  in  the  amount  oflithium ions due to lithiation, a higher ionic conductivity can be expected.

In  summary,  the  stability  of  the  NASICON-type  solid-state  electrolyte  in  Li-S  batteries  hasbeen investigated. Because of the high reduction potential of the  Li1. Because of the high reduction potential of the  Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 solid-stateelectrolyte,  it  is  lithiated  to  give  Li3Al0.7(PO4)3 solid-stateelectrolyte,  it  is  lithiated  to  give  Li3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  by  polysulfide  solution  species  and  Ti4+  isreduced into Ti3+.At the same time, Li2CO3 forms on the particle surface, which may stymie theinterfacial transport of lithium ions between the liquid electrolyte and the solid-state electrolyte.

After  the  lithium  insertion  into  the  NASICON  structure,  the  crystal  expands  anisotropically,which  may  weaken  the  connection  of  the  crystallites  and  generate  small  cracks  in  ceramicmembrane.After  long  term  cycling,  the  grain  boundaries  are  corroded  by  polysulfide  solution,leaving lots of pores allowing for accessibility of polysulfide diffusion.

The apparent diffusion ofpolysulfide  species  is  what  gives  rise  to  a  sudden  degradation  of  the  cell  performance.

These findings give us a comprehensive understanding of the durability of ceramic solid electrolytes inLi-S batteries.Not only the chemical and electrochemical stability of solid electrolyte materialshave  an  important  effect  on  the  durability,  but  also  the  stability  of  grain  boundaries  is  a  bigconcern.

Therefore, more comprehensive strategies needed to be implemented to fully assess andimprove the durability  of ceramic solid electrolytes.Some examples are: (1) replacement  of Tiwith  Ge,  Zr,  or  other  ions  in  the  NASICON  structure  to  get  a  proper,  stable  electrochemicalwindow for the Li-S battery system; (2) coating of the surface of the ceramic to obtain a stableinterface  between  the  solid  electrolyte  and  the  liquid  electrolyte;  and  (3)  elimination  of  theamorphous component and second phases in the grain boundaries to improve the durability of thegrain boundaries.Overall, to enable a long cycling-life  Li-S battery, development of solid-stateelectrolytes with highly stable grain boundaries and long-term chemical stability is necessary.

Synthesis  ofthe  solid-state  electrolyte  LATP:  The  solid-state  electrolyte  materialLi1.Synthesis  ofthe  solid-state  electrolyte  LATP:  The  solid-state  electrolyte  materialLi1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  was  prepared  by  a  solid-state  method.Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Li2CO3,TiO2,  (NH4)2H(PO4)3,  and  Al2O3  were  mixed  and  ground  for  0.Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Li2CO3,TiO2,  (NH4)2H(PO4)3,  and  Al2O3  were  mixed  and  ground  for  0.5  h  in  an  agate  mortar.Theground materials were heated at 450 °C for 2 h, followed by heating at 900 °C for 2 h.In order toobtain  the  ceramic,  the  heated  mixtures  were  first  ball-milled  for  6  h.Then,  the  ball-milledmaterials were pressed into pellets and sintered at 1000 °C for 2 h under the flow of oxygen (O2).

At last, the ceramic was polished down to a thickness of 300m.

The Li2S4-DOL-DME solution was obtained by dissolving Li2S and S in the mole ratio1:3 in the DOL-DME solution 1.The Li2S4-DOL-DME solution was obtained by dissolving Li2S and S in the mole ratio1:3 in the DOL-DME solution 1.The total sulfur concentration in the polysulfide solution was 6mmol mL-1.The total sulfur concentration in the polysulfide solution was 6mmol mL-1. The mixture was then stirred at 50 °C over 12 h.After that, the mixture was filteredand washed 4 times with DOL-DME solution (vol. 1:1).The powder was finally dried on a hotplate  at  50  °C.  All  the  processes  were  done  in  the  glovebox  under  argon  atmosphere.The  rawmaterial and reaction products were characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS.

Stability of the solid-state electrolyte membrane in the Li-S battery: In order to test the stabilityof  the  solid-state  electrolyte  membrane,  the  Li-S  batteries  with  the  solid-state  electrolytemembrane were assembled, as schematically shown in Figure S2.Stability of the solid-state electrolyte membrane in the Li-S battery: In order to test the stabilityof  the  solid-state  electrolyte  membrane,  the  Li-S  batteries  with  the  solid-state  electrolytemembrane were assembled, as schematically shown in Figure S2.The electrolyte for the anode isI  M  lithium  trifluoromethanesulonate  (LiTf)  in  DOL-DME  (1:1  vol).The  electrolyte  for  thecathode  is  a  Li2S6-Litriflate-DOL-DME  solution.
