The cold sintering process (CSP) and Bi2O3-activated liquid-phase sintering (LPS) are combined to densify Mg-doped NASICON (Na3.256Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2PO12) to achieve high densities and conductivities at reduced temperatures. As an example, a cold-sintered specimen with the addition of 1.1 wt. % Bi2O3 sintering additive achieved a high conductivity of 0.91 mS/cm (with ~96% relative density) after  annealing at 1000  176) C; this conductivity is >70% higher than that of a cold-sintered specimen without adding the Bi2O3 sintering additive, and it is >700% of the conductivity of a dry-pressed counterpart with the same amount of Bi2O3 added, all of which are subjected to the same heating profile. The highest conductivity achieved in this study via combining CSP and Bi2O3-activated LSP is >1.5 mS/cm. This study suggests an opportunity to combine the new CSP with the traditional LPS to sinter solid electrolytes to achieve high densities and conductivities at reduced temperatures. This combined CSP-LPS approach can be extended to a broad range of other materials to fabricate the “thermally fragile” solid electrolytes or solid-state battery systems, where reducing the processing temperature is often desirable. 


The development of sodium-ion batteries, with soldium being a much more abundant resource than lithium, attracts significant interests due to the high demand of large-scale energy storages, such as sustainable energy applications in power grids and electric vehicles [1–4]. However, serious safety issues, such as leakage and explosion risks, exist with the uses of flammable liquid electrolytes [5,6]. To overcome these safety issues, the solid-state sodium batteries were explored. Particularly, the research of solid-state sodium batteries with inorganic oxide solid electrolytes has attracted great attentions due to their potential benefits, including low costs, high stability (moisture/air stable), high energy density, and high safety [7–9]. 



The soldium-ion solid electrolytes are one of the key components of solid-state sodium batteries and it should have high durability and sodium ionic conductivity. Specifically, natrium  (Na) superionic conductor (NASICON) with the general formula of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 £ was demonstrated as a promising sodium-ion solid electrolyte with a wide electrochemical window and high ion transference numbers [10–12]. The NASICON solid electrolytes are more air and moisture stable than some other electrolytes such as sulfides and the room-temperature total ionic conductivities of undoped NASICON are on the order 0.1 mS/cm [13–16]. More recently, several reports have showed that the addition of metal oxides, including Fe2O3, NiO, ZnO, Y2O3, Al2O3, TiO2 and MgO, in NASICON materials can increase their conductivities. As an example, Mg doped NASICON can exhibit a high room-temperature ionic conductivities of >1 mS/cm and a combined experimental and modeling study attributed the conductivity enhancement to the formation of conductive secondary (or interfacial) Na3PO4 phase at NASICON grain boundaries (GBs) [20].

However, the poor sinterability of the NASICON based materials limits their applications for solid-state sodium batteries. High sintering temperatures (typically ‡ 1200  176) C) with prolonged durations are typically required to densify NASICON based solid electrolytes, which can cause the sodium and phosphorus evaporation and lead to NASICON decomposition [21–23], besides adding energy consumption and significant cost. It will also result in various compatibility and technical issues when co-sintering is used to fabricate the solid state batteries, including over-sintering and possible degradation of the active electrode materials as well as undesirable side reactions at the interface between solid electrolytes and electrodes [7,24]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to decrease the processing temperatures of the NASICON based materials to promote their applications in solid-state batteries. 



On the one hand, an innovative sintering technology, namely cold sintering process (CSP), was recently developed by Randall and co-workers at Pennsylvania State University [25,26]. It can densify a variety of ceramic materials, including chlorides, carbonates, phosphates and  oxides at low temperatures (<300  176) C) in short durations (generally 15-60 min) [25,26]. The densification process is mainly caused by the assistance of the aqueous solutions under pressures (100-500 MPa) with a dissolution-precipitation process; in many cases, post-CSP annealing, typically at temperatures lower than the normal sintering temperatures, is still needed to achieve nearly full densities as well as improve properties [25,26]. Most recently, we applied CSP with post-CSP annealing to fabricate Mg-doped NASICON (Na3.256Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2PO12) specimens; we achieved, e.g., ~82% density and ~0.5 mS/cm conductivity with post-annealing at as low as  800  176) C, but the conductivity only increased moderately when the annealed temperature was  further increased up to 1100  176) C [27]. In this case, post-CSP annealing was found necessary to increase the ionic conductivities of cold-sintered specimens mainly via increasing their GB conductivities [27]. Berbano et al. also demonstrated that the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) solid electrolytes could be densified at low temperatures by applying the CSP [28]. In addition, the feasibility of applying the CSP in fabricating solid-state batteries has been investigated and discussed [29].     

On the other hand, the addition of Li3PO4 [30], LiBO2 [31], Li2O [32], Na3BO3 [33] and Na2O-Nb2O5-P2O5 glass [13,15] with low melting points were found effective to promote the densification of solid electrolytes at low temperatures via the classical liquid phase sintering (LPS). 

In this work, we first applied Bi2O3-activated LPS to densify a Mg-doped NASICON (Na3.256Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2PO12) for the first time to our knowledge. We successfully demonstrated  that adding Bi2O3 can substantially enhance the density and conductive at (but only) at 1100  176) C.  Subsequently, we combined CSP and Bi2O3-activated LPS to densify the same Mg-doped NASICON, again for the first time to combine these two enhancing sintering techniques.

Notably, we showed that combing CSP and LPS can achieve higher densities and ionic conductivities than either CSP or LPS alone, at reduced temperatures. Thus, the success of this study opens up a new opportunity to fabricate solid-state electrolytes for solid-state batteries at reduced temperatures by combining CSP with LPS as a new processing route to reduce sintering temperature beyond that can be achieved by any single technology (CSP or LPS), which can be subsequently extended to a broad range of other “thermally fragile” solid electrolytes. 


The Mg-doped NASICON powder with the composition of Na3.256Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2PO12 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. The stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3 (Fisher Chemical, 99.5%), MgO (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%), ZrO2 (Fisher Chemical, Laboratory Grade), SiO2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%), and NH4H2PO4 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%) were used as raw materials. The  mixtures were milled in isopropyl alcohol by planetary ball milling for 24 h, dried in air at 85  176) C  for 12 h and then calcinated in an oven at 1150  176) C for 5 h. The calcined powder was ground by hands with a mortar and pestle and then mixed with 1.1 wt. % Bi2O3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99.999%) by ball milling in isopropyl alcohol for 48 h. For comparison, Bi2O3-free Mg-doped NASICON (Na3.256Mg0.128Zr1.872Si2PO12) powder was also prepared by using the same procedure. 



Bi2O3 sintering additive) and then mixed by hands using mortar and pestle for 2-3 min; noting that this procedure was slightly different from a prior procedure for cold sintering NASICION as we added PVA as binder here. PVA will be burnt out in the subsequent annealing. The prepared powder was then transferred into a ¼ inch die and a following pre-pressing step was applied by uniaxially pressing the die at 780 MPa at room temperature for 2 min. Finally, the  cold-sintered specimens were prepared at 140  176) C for 1 h at 780 MPa [27]. For comparison, dry-pressed specimens were also prepared by applying the identical pressure of 780 MPa (also for 1 h) at room temperature. The cold-sintered and dry-pressed specimens were subsequently  annealed at 850-1200  176) C for 6 h in a furnace with a heating rate of 5  176) C/min. 



The specimen densities were calculated by the weights and dimensions and the theoretical density of 3.27 g/cm3 was adopted for NASICON. X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out by using a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The microstructures of fractured surfaces were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI Apreo Pt blocking electrodes were sputtered on both surfaces of the pellets to prepare the specimens for ionic conductivity measurements; the specimen thicknesses were in the range of 0.9-1.3 mm. 

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out to measure the  sodium ion conductivity at room temperature (25  176) C) using a Solartron 1255B EIS analyzer from  106 to 1 Hz at 25, 50, or 75 mV. The ionic conductivities were determined by fitting EIS data using the Z-View software (Scribner, Inc.).   


Thus, these two cases collectively suggest that the Bi2O3 additive lowers the ionic conductivity of Mg-doped NASICON at the lower annealing temperatures at 850-950 °C (despite of the enhanced densification by Bi2O3), which may be related to the formation of Bi2O3-enriched liquid (or secondary crystalline) phase at the NASICON grain boundaries. It is important to note that the addition of Bi2O3 generally increased the ionic conductivity of Mg-doped NASICON, if compared with the same pre-process (dry-pressing vs. cold sintering) and heating profile, which can be attributed to the increased density at the same processing temperature. It was reported that the total resistance of NASICON solid electrolyte is often dominated by the grain boundary resistance [33,38], which is consistent with our recent report [27]. Therefore, it is likely that the grain boundary resistance is also higher than the bulk resistance for the present specimens. Again, here the low ionic conductivity (for specimens sintered as the low temperature range of 850-950 °C) may be caused by the resistive Bi2O3-based liquid phase.


However, the Bi2O3 liquid phase can evaporate at higher annealing temperatures of 1000-1200 °C, which makes the NASICON grain boundaries less resistive. Moreover, the higher annealing temperature will also promote the grain growth, leading to coarser microstructures and decreasing the total grain boundary resistance. This is consistent with our observation of substantial increases in ionic conductivities in Bi2O3-added (dry-pressed or cold-sintered) specimens in the high annealing temperature range of 1000-1200 °C (Fig. 1(b)).   

The above-discussed observations illustrate the complicated, yet interesting, interplays of the sintering additive, densification, grain boundary resistance, grain growth, and phase transformation (e.g., evaporation of the volatile sintering additive). Understanding and controlling such interplays can help us to further control the sintering and properties of solid electrolytes in general.   


First, the cold-sintered Mg-doped NASICON specimens, regardless of whether 1.1 wt. % Bi2O3 sintering was added or not, can achieve ~82.4% of the theoretical density at 140 °C. The post-CSP annealing was found effective to further enhance both the densification and ionic conductivity of the cold-sintered specimens. For example, a high ionic conductivity of ~0.88 mS/cm and relative density of ~86% were achieved for the cold-sintered Mg-doped NASICON  after 1100 °C ·6 h annealing. 


In contrast, the dry-pressed counterpart annealed at the identical condition exhibited a much lower ionic conductivity of ~0.29 mS/cm and relative density of Second, the further addition of 1.1 wt. % Bi2O3 sintering additive can significantly enhance the densification and further reduce the sintering/annealing temperature. The addition of 1.1 wt. % Bi2O3 was found to increase the ionic conductivity of the cold-sintered NASICON specimen from ~0.54 mS/cm to ~0.91 mS/cm, while simultaneously increased the relative density from ~82.4% to ~95.8%, after annealing at (a lower temperature of) 1000 °C for 6 h. Furthermore, the ionic conductivity was increased from ~0.88 mS/cm to ~1.18 mS/cm at the annealing temperature 1100 °C for 6 h.   

Third, the Bi2O3 additive can also increase the ionic conductivity of the dry-pressed specimens, e.g., from ~0.29 mS/cm to ~1.17 mS/cm, along with an increase of the relative  density from ~74.6% to ~97.3%, after 1100 °C ·6 h annealing. We should note that Bi2O3 sintering additive increase the ionic conductivity via increase the sintering and density of the specimen, while the presence of the Bi2O3 at grain boundaries appears to reduce the conductivity with the same relative density at low annealing temperatures. 

As the most notable new innovative processing, we showed that combing CSP and Bi2O3-activated LPS can achieve higher densities and ionic conductivities than either CSP or LPS alone, at reduced temperatures. As an example, after the identical thermal processing at  1000  176) C; the measured Na-ion conductivity of the CSP + LPS specimen is >70% higher than that of the CPS only specimen (without Bi2O3), and >600% higher than that of the LPS only specimen (with the same amount of Bi2O3 being added). In addition, the high (>95%) densities  achieved by combining CSP and Bi2O3-activated LPS (at as low as ~950 176) C) are also highly  desirable for fabricating solid-state batteries, but are unattainable by conventional sintering  unless going to ~1200 176) C.                 Thus, this study suggests a new processing route to sinter dense solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivities at the reduced temperatures by combining the new and innovative CSP with the classical LPS technologies. This can be extended to other ceramic materials beyond NASICON, as well as help to develop lower-temperature co-sintering technologies to fabricate electrolytes and electrodes together for solid-state sodium batteries. This new combined CSP and LPS technology can be particularly useful for fabricating thermally fragile lithium or sodium solid electrolytes with volatile components or thermally-unstable phases, such as phosphates and sulfates, at reduced temperatures, which is highly desirable for solid state battery technologies.
