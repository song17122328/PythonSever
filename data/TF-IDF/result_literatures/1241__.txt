Crystallographic structures of the three NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) phases were determined at room temperature from X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data using the Rietveld analysis. The three compounds belong to the Nasicon structural family. The presence of the (303) reflection in all XRD spectra of NaSbR(PO4)3 shows clearly that all compounds crystallise in rhombohedral system with R 3 space group. Na atoms are practically ordered within the two positions, 3a and 3b, of M1 sites. Structure refinements show also a partially-ordered distribution of Sb5+ and R3+ions within the Nasicon framework. A Raman and Infrared spectroscopic study was used to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding in NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) phases.

The Nasicon-type family has been the subject of intensive research due to its potential applications as solid electrolyte, electrode material, low thermal expansion ceramics and as storage materials for nuclear waste (Hong, 1976; Padhi et al., 1997; Roy et al., 1982; Delmas et al., 1981; Woodcock et al., 1999). The structure of such materials with general formula AxXX’(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional network made up of corner-sharing X(X’)O6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra in such a way that each octahedron is surrounded by six tetrahedra and each tetrahedron is connected to four octahedral. Within the Nasicon framework, there are interconnected interstitial sites usually labelled M1 (one per formula unit) and M2 (three per formula unit) through which A cation can iffuse, giving rise to a fast-ion conductivity (Hong, 1976 ; Delmas et al., 1981) (Figure 1). The four such sites per formula unit can be represented by the crystallographic [M2]3[M1]XX’(PO4)3 formula. Each M1 cavity is situated between two X(X’)O6 octahedra along the c-axis. Six M2 cavities with eightfold coordination are located between the [O3X(X’)O3M1O3X(X’)O3O3X(X’)O3] ribbons and surround the M1 cavity (Figure1).

Recently, the structural characteristics by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) study using the Rietveld method for A0.50SbFe(PO4)3 (A = Ca, Sr) (R3space group) and ASb0.50Fe1.50(PO4)3(R3c space group) phases were realised (Aatiq, Tigha et al. 2006; Aatiq et al., 2012). In A0.50SbFe(PO4)3 sample, A2+ ions occupied one-half of the M1 sites and the Sb5+ and Fe3+ cations are orderly distributed within the SbFe(PO4)3 framework. In a continuation of our search concerning Nasicon-like phases herein we report the results of the structural investigation by the Rietveld refinement using the XRD patterns of the three NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) phases. In order to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding in the crystalline solids, a Raman and Infrared spectroscopic study was also undertaken.

Syntheses of NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) phases were carried out using conventional solid-state reaction techniques. Powder crystalline samples were prepared from mixtures of carbonates Na2CO3 (Riedel-de Haën, 99 %), oxides Sb2O3 (Riedel-de Haën, 99.9 %), R2O3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) (Prolabo, 99 %) and NH4H2PO4 (Riedel-de Haën, 99 %) in stoichiometric proportions. The mixture was heated progressively with intermittent grinding at 200°C (12h), 400°C (6h), 600°C (12h), 800°C (24h), 900°C (24h) and 1000°C (24h) in air atmosphere. The products of reaction were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature with a Panalytical XPert-PRO (θ-2θ) diffractometer; (CuKα) radiation (45 kV, 40 mA); divergence slit of 1° and antiscatter slit of 1°. The data were collected from 10 to 90° 2θ, in steps of 0.017°, with a counting time of 30 s per step. The Rietveld refinement of the structure was performed using the Fullprof program (Rodriguez-Carvajal, 1997)

The infrared spectra are recorded in the form of KBr pellets in the wave number range 1500-400 cm−1using a Bruker’s VERTEX 70 spectrometer and the Raman spectra are recorded on RENISHAW 1000B spectrometer in the wave number range 100–1500 cm−1. All the spectra have been recorded at room temperature.

Analysis of the powder XRD spectra for the three NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) materials indicated that the principal peak positions of the XRD lines are similar to those observed for other Nasicon-type phases (Figure 2-4). The XRD pattern of NaSbIn(PO4)3 shows clearly the presence of diffraction peaks, with Miller indexes h0l (l = 2n+1) [e.g., (101) and (003) reflections] at 11.52 in two theta, characteristic of the R3 space group. A rapid analysis of the two NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe) XRD data shows the absence of the usually known (101) and (003) reflections. Therefore, in a first approximation, the structure refinement of the two last compounds is conducted in the R3c space. Obtained Rietveld refinement results show that the particularly reflection around 39.3, in two theta, is not generated when the refinement is realised in the R 3c space group (Figures 2-3). This result leads us to suspect that the real space group is rather R3. In fact, as it will be shown later this last hypothesis will be confirmed by a carefully Rietveld analysis for both NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe) phases. In the following, the structural refinement was principally based upon the previous assumptions.

Structure determination of NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe) phases, using the Rietveld method, was therefore undertaken in two principle models. In the first, the refinement was made in R3c space group whereas in the second model the hypothesis of R3space group was verified. During the first model, initial starting parameters for the Reitveld Refinements, using R3c space group, were based on those already reported for MnFeTi(PO4)3 (Aatiq and Dhoum, 2006). Na atoms are distributed in the M1 site, 6c position (0 0 ~0.25), while Sb5+ and R3+ are supposed to reside within the framework. As shown in the inset of Figures 2 and 3, result of refinement in R3c space group was confirmed to be less appropriate. In fact, because some peaks are not generated [e.g., (303) reflections around 39.3 in two theta] this last structure refinement was dismissed. In the second model, the structural parameters of Ca0.50SbFe(PO4)3 (R3space group) (Aatiq, Tigha et al. 2006) were used as starting parameters for the Rietveld refinement of NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe). Refinement with Na atom distributed between the two M1(3a) and M1(3b) sites and the Sb(R) atoms within the Nasicon framework leads to best results. The final reliability factors and atomic parameters for NaSbCr(PO4)3 and NaSbFe(PO4)3 phases are summarised in Tables I and II respectively. A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRD profile is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Na-O and X-O (X = Sb(Cr) or Sb(Fe)) distances values are grouped in Table III. Obtained interatomic distances are consistent with the ionic radii values in six coordination of Na+, Sb5+ and R3+ ions (Shannon, 1976). P-O distances values match well with those typically observed in Nasicon-type phosphates. In order to have more structural information, the bond valence sum (BVS) based on bond strength analysis (Brown and Altermatt, 1985) for NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe) were also computed. As shown in Table III, the BVS values calculated for Na, R, Sb and P sites are relatively consistent with the expected formal oxidation state of Na+, R3+, Sb5+and P5+ ions.

The structural parameters of NaSbFe(PO4)3 (R3space group) were used as starting parameters for the Rietveld refinement of NaSbIn(PO4)3. Refinement with all Na atom in the two M1(3a) and M1(3b) sites and Sb(In) atoms within the Nasicon framework leads to best results (RB = 5.0%). The final reliability factors and atomic parameters for NaSbIn(PO4)3 are summarised in Table IV. A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRD profile is shown in Figure 4. Na-O, X-O (X = Sb(In)) and P-O distances are consistent with the ionic radii values,in six coordination, of Na+
, Sb5+ and In3+ ions (Table III). The correctness of the NaSbIn(PO4)3 structure was also confirmed by bond valence calculations.

In order to obtain further structural information about the nature of bonding in NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) crystalline solids, in this part of the paper, a Raman and Infrared (IR) spectroscopic study was undertaken. The IR spectra of the three samples are similar(Figure 5). Raman spectra of the selected NaSbFe(PO4)3 phase is shown in Figure 6.

The vibration modes of NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) Nasicon phases can be assigned to internal and external modes of PO4 tetrahedra and to lattice modes including the motions of the metallic Sb5+ and R3+ in their octahedral coordination and Na+ions in six coordination spheres. It is observed that phosphate group vibrations are generally strong compared to the lattice modes and metal-oxygen vibrations. According to factor group analysis, the phosphate PO4 tetrahedra group has Td symmetry and nine internal modes (Γd = A1 + E + 2F2).The Raman and IR band positions of the four (ν1, ν2, ν3 and ν4) modes observed in the spectra of the NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) Nasicon series are close to those expected for Nasicon type materials. Assignments of Infrared and Raman vibration modes of the three materials are gathered in Table V. Thus, the symmetric non degenerate PO stretching modes (ν1) are observed in the range 930-1030 cm-1 while antisymmetric doubly degenerate PO stretching (ν2) are located in the 410-480 cm-1range. The symmetric, triply degenerate OPO bending (ν3) is observed between 1090-1175 cm-1and the triply degenerate, antisymmetric and harmonic OPO bending (ν4) is observed in the range 520-680 cm-1. Note that all the modes are Raman active except the ν3 and ν4 ones which are IR active only.

The SbO6 octahedra are distorted and exhibit a low symmetry. The Sb-O…P bonds existing in the three compounds have an average length of 2.00 Å. Their stretching vibrations are probably coupled with the P-O-P bending ν4 mode. The frequencies found between 570 and 670 cm-1in Raman and IR spectra of NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) phases can be assigned empirically to Sb-O stretching modes involving Sb-O-P linkage. The same Sb–O vibrations are already observed, in the IR spectrum of SbOPO4 at 597 and 652 cm-1 (Sudarsan et al., 2002) and at 580 and 639 cm-1, in the IR and Raman spectra, of Mn0.5MSb(PO4)3 (M = Al, Fe and Cr) phases (Anantharamulu et al., 2009). Obtained results are also in good agreement with the spectroscopic study realised for Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 (Aatiq et al., 2012). Note that in the three studied samples, the IR and Raman data confirm the presence of Sb5+ ions in octahedral oxygen coordination. In the lattice modes region, the translational modes of Na+, R3+ (R = Cr, Fe, In),Sb5+ and PO43-ions as well as librational modes of PO43-ions and RO6, SbO6 groups should be expected. At wavenumbers below 450 cm-1strong coupling between the different bending vibrations O-P-O, O-Sb-O, Sb-O-P, Sb-O-Sb is expected (Husson et al., 1988)

The Raman bands observed at 375 and 308 cm-1in NaSbFe(PO4)3 (Figure 6), could be assigned to Fe3+-O stretching modes of vibrations. It can be seen that similar band positions are observed in the range 300-370 cm-1of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 Raman spectrum (Butt et al., 2004) and also at 378 and 343 cm-1for Sr0.50SbFe(PO4)3 phase (Aatiq et al., 2012). The low frequency modes observed below 270 cm-1can be easily attributed to translational modes of the Na+, Sb5+ and (PO4)3-ions.

NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) compounds are prepared and characterized by XRD, Raman and IR spectroscopy. The three samples crystallise in hexagonal lattice of the Nasicon framework with the space group R3. Results of the Rietveld refinement show that the Na atoms are ordered in the Nasicon M1 site. The Na+cationic distribution within the two possible, 3a and 3b, positions of M1 sites may be the driving force of a partially-ordered distribution of Sb5+ and R3+ ions within the NaSbR(PO4)3 Nasicon framework. In fact, in the case of A0.50□0.5SbFe(PO4)3(A = Ca, Sr) phases (R3space group) where only one of the M1 is occupied [i.e., M1(3a)] and the other is empty, a practically complete ordered distribution of Sb5+ and Fe3+ ions was observed. Indeed, in order to minimise the electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring cations within the ribbons of [A0.50)]M1(3a)[□0.5]M1(3b)SbFe(PO4)3 phases two Fe3+O6 octahedra tend to juxtapose the quasi-full occupied M1(3a) sites and the unoccupied M1(3b) one have two Sb5+O6octahedra as a neighbouring. It should be noticed that in NaSbR(PO4)3 Nasicon phases, where the two M1 site types are fully occupied by the same Na+cations, every Sb5+O6 and R3+O6octahedra is situated between two Na+O6 octahedra [i.e. Na(1)O6 and/or Na(2)O6 octahedra].Consequently, a partially ordered distribution of Sb5+ and R3+ ions within the SbR(PO4)3 Nasiconframework was normally expected. Raman and IR studies are consistent with the obtained NaSbR(PO4)3 (R = Cr, Fe, In) crystal structures. All spectra show characteristic PO4 vibrations. The stretching modes of SbO6 groups are observed at significantly higher frequency (570 and 670 cm-1) than stretching modes of RO6 groups (~375 cm-1).
