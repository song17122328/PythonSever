NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 with a zero-stress framework has been receiving particular attention as anadvanced anode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.
In this work, the three-dimensional (3D)NaTi2(PO4)3@CNT microspheres were prepared by using a spray drying method with thermal calcination.
Inthis composite, the conductive CNT was condensed into the NaTi2(PO4)3 microspheres, leading to intimateinterfacial contact between the NaTi2(PO4)3 and CNT.
As an anode for energy storage, the NaTi2(PO4)3@CNTexhibited a high reversible capacity and stable cycling performance due to the constructed 3D network whichcould greatly enhance the electronic conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3 material.
It delivered the initial capacities of127, 125 and 123 mA h g−1 at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 C, respectively.
Even at 10 C, this composite still showed acapacity of 88 mA h g−1 with capacity retention of about 99.3% over 20 cycles.
In summary, the 3D NaTi2(PO4)3@CNT composite was successfullydesigned and prepared by using a spray drying method with thermalcalcinations.
The SEM and TEM results indicate that the CNTconstructs a 3D conductive network among the NaTi2(PO4)3 microspheres.
Such a special structure can significantly facilitate the transportof electron throughout the secondary particle.
Thus, theNaTi2(PO4)3@CNT anode shows excellent sodium storage performancessuch as high specific capacity, superior rate capability andstable cycling performance.
It can be speculated that the as-prepared3D NaTi2(PO4)3@CNT composite is a promising candidate anode forenergy storage.
