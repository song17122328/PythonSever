The temperature dependence of photoluminescence properties and decay times inthe range 10-300 K is reported for Eu2+ doped NASICON-type phosphateCaZr4(PO4)6. Luminescence from the Eu2+ impurity has been investigated.
Twodifferent Eu2+ centers have been detected in the host structure, 3a and 3b,corresponding to the emission bands peaking at 531 and 480 nm.
The emissionintensity and lifetimes decrease with increasing temperature due to temperaturequenching.
The values of Stokes shift, quenching temperature T1/2 and activationenergy for thermal quenching are evaluated.
The mechanism of thermal quenching isalso discussed.
In CaZr4(PO4)6:Eu2+ two different Eu2+ emissions peaking at 531 and 480 nm areobserved.
This is in agreement with the two sites available for Eu2+ in thisNASICON-type phosphate lattice.
The Stokes shift of the Eu (I) and Eu (II) emissionbands are about 4000 and 6000 cm-1. However, the crystal environments of the Eu (I)and Eu (II) ions are so similar that two separated emission bands cannot be observedeven at 10 K.
The lifetimes decrease from 0.38 μs (10 K) to 0.07 μs (300 K) withincreasing temperature as a result of a substantial increase in nonradiative relaxationrate.
The activation energy (ΔE) for thermal quenching is about 0.096 eV and thequenching temperature T1/2 is about 225 K.
The small activation energy indicates thelowest energy level of the relaxed Eu2+ 4f65d1 electronic configuration is not wellisolated from the host lattice conduction band, which supports the thermal quenchingshould be attributed to the thermal excitation of the 5d electron to conduction bandstates.
