NASICON-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3 has been recognized as a potential positive electrode material for sodium-ion batteries, but its electrochemical mechanism during de(sodiation) has not been well understood. In this work, the structural transformation, charge transfer, and ionic diﬀusion properties of Na4MnV(PO4)3 were comprehensively studied by ﬁrst-principles calculations combined with experimental studies. The results revealed two independent Na sites, Na(1) and Na(2), in the structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3, but only Na(2) can be extracted between 2.5 and 3.8 V. Extraction of the ﬁrst Na+ caused charge transfer on V3+ and was associated with a solid-solution reaction. In addition, Na+ migrated along the 3D channels in the NASICON structure with low energy barriers of <0.4 eV. With extraction of the second Na+, the charge transfer process occurred on Mn2+. The material underwent a biphasic transition with the Na(1) atom auto-migrating to a nearby interstitial site, Na(3). During this process, Na+ migrated in a 1D channel with a relatively higher diﬀusion barrier of 0.52 eV. In line with the structural evolution, the Na+ diﬀusion coeﬃcients remained at 2.0 x 10-12 cm2 s-1 during the ﬁrst Na+ extraction, and then decreased to 9.7 x 10-14 cm2 s-1 with the extraction of the second Na+.
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the market of secondary batteries for portable electronics since the 1990s due to their long cycle life, high energy density, and environmental benignity. However, the limited lithium (Li) resource in the Earth's crust is a major obstacle to the large-scale application of LIBs, especially in electric vehicles and stationary energy storage. In recent years, there has been widespread interest in the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) as an alternative to LIBs due to the widespread availability and low cost of sodium (Na), which is about 200 times more abundant in nature than Li.1–4 However, the heavier weight and larger radius of Na+ (mNa = 23 g mol-1 and rNa = 0.98 A˚) compared to those of Li+ (mLi = 6.9 g mol-1 and rLi = 0.69 A˚) lead to sluggish diﬀusion kinetics for Na+ in the host material, resulting in relatively low capacity, poor rate capability, and short cycle life.5,6Various transition-metal oxides,7–9 polyanionic compounds,10–12 ferrocyanides,13 organic materials,14 and poly-mers15 have been considered as promising positive electrode materials for SIBs. Among these materials, polyanionic compounds with a NASICON (Na superionic conductor) struc-ture have attracted intensive attention due to the three-dimensional (3D) Na+ migration channels constructed from MO6 octahedra (M = transition metal) and XO4 tetrahedra (X = P, S, Si, As).16–20 In particular, a V-based NASICON material, Na3V2(PO4)3, has attracted enormous attention due to its rela-tively large capacity of 117 mA h g-1 based on the extraction of two Na+. In spite of the great promise of Na3V2(PO4)3 in SIBs, substituting V with other low-cost and earth-abundant elements is highly desirable due to the high cost and toxicity of V-based raw materials. Discharge capacities corresponding to the extraction of two Na+ ions per formula unit have been reported for some Na3+dV2-xMx(PO4)3 materials, with M = Fe2+,21 Zr4+,22 Mn2+,23 Cr3+,24 Ti 4+,25 and so on. Among these materials, a promising one is Na4MnV(PO4)3, which was first reported by Goodenough et al.26 in 2016. The material showed a specific capacity of 101 mA h g-1 at the 1C rate, long cycle life of over 1000 cycles, and good rate performance. Compared to the V3+/V4+ redox couple of Na3V2(PO4)3, which occurs at 3.4 V vs. Na+/Na, the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple of Na4MnV(PO4)3 shows a higher voltage of 3.6 V, which increases the average working voltage of the electrode to some extent. To improve the elec-trochemical performance of Na4MnV(PO4)3, Jiao and co-workers27 have synthesized a Na4MnV(PO4)3@C@GA material that shows an energy density of x380 W h kg-1 against the Na metal anode at 0.5C and a high capacity retention of 68.8% after 4000 cycles. Chen and co-workers28 have studied the structural properties of Na4MnV(PO4)3 during charge–discharge using in operando X-ray diﬀraction. Their results demonstrate highly reversible reactions in the 2.5–3.7 V voltage window, in which extraction of the first Na+ occurred at 3.38 V, accompanied by a single phase transition, while extraction of the second Na+ occurred at 3.58 V, which is associated with a biphasic transi-tion. These observations, however, are not suﬃcient to comprehensively understand the electrochemical mechanisms of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in SIBs. Some important questions still remain unclear, such as the atomic rearrangements during structural transformations. In addition, the charge transfer properties and ionic diﬀusion during Na+ migration have not been studied to date.In this study, a combined theoretical and experimental investigation was performed to study the electrochemical properties of Na4-xMnV(PO4)3 (0 < x < 2). Extraction of the third Na+ was not considered because this process is not reversible, which results in a large capacity loss after the first cycle and poor cycling stability during subsequent cycles.28–30 23Na nuclear magnetic resonance and first-principles calcula-tions demonstrated that Na4-xMnV(PO4)3 underwent a solid-solution reaction in the range of 0 < x < 1, followed by a biphasic transition in 1 < x < 2. The biphasic transition was ascribed to the auto-migration of Na+ from the Na(1) site to an interstitial site, Na(3). The Na+ extraction process was associ-ated with stepwise V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples. Moreover, the 3D framework of the NASICON structure provided facile migration pathways for Na+, which was benefi-cial for the rate capability of this material in SIBs.
The Na4MnV(PO4)3 material was prepared by the sol–gel method using 0.004 M citric acid as the chelating solution. Stoichiometric quantities of CH3COONa, (CH3COO)2Mn$4H2O, NH4H2PO4, and NH4VO3 were dissolved in a solution with a molar ratio of sodium/citric acid of 4/1. This was followed by a room temperature incubation of the solution for 24 h. Then, the resulting solution was evaporated at 60 °C and dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precursor was sintered at 750 °C under a N2 atmosphere in a tube furnace for 6 h. The ramp rate was set at 2 °C min-1.The crystal structure of the material was determined by powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) on a STOE STADI/P powder diﬀractometer with Mo-Ka1 radiation (l = 0.70932 A˚). The morphological properties of the material were characterized on an FEI Magellan-400 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an operating voltage of 2.0 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was preformed using a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer under O2 flow to determine the carbon content in the Na4MnV(PO4)3 sample. Magnetic (mass of material: 7.8 mg) and heat capacity (24.2 mg) measurements were conducted using a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design PPMS Dynacool). Zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetization vs. temperature measurements were performed during heating between 2 and 300 K (2–50 K with a ramp rate of 1 K min-1,50–300 K with a ramp rate of 2 K min-1)ata field of 500 Oe (m0H = 0.05 T). The inverse susceptibility (c-1) curve was derived from the FC branch. In addition, ZFC/FC curves were measured at m0H = 0.1 T and 2–80 K in the temperature-settle mode. Heat capacity was measured by the relaxation method with a 2% relative temperature rise between 2 and 100 K at zero magnetic field and with higher temperature resolution between 2 and 20 K at magnetic fields of m0H = 0, 3, and 7 T. 23Na magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (23Na MAS NMR) was performed on a Bruker Advance 200 MHz spectrometer at a magnetic field of 4.7 T, corresponding to a Larmor frequency of 52.9 MHz. The samples were packed into 1.3 mm rotors under an Ar atmosphere and spinning was performed at 50 kHz. Spectra were collected with a rotor-synchronized Hahn-echo pulse sequence, recycle delay of 1 s, and p/2 pulse length of 1.5 ms. About 80 000 scans were acquired for each spectrum and the spectral intensity was normalized with respect to the sample mass and number of scans.
The electrode mixture was prepared by mixing 70 wt% of Na4-MnV(PO4)3 active material, 20 wt% of Super P conductive additive, and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The slurry was pasted on an Al foil current collector. CR2032 coin-cells were used to perform electrochemical tests using a Na4VMn(PO4)3 positive electrode, Na metal counter electrode, two pieces of Whatman GF/D separator, and 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate (EC/PC = 1/1 by volume ratio) electrolyte. For ex situ NMR measurements, the above electrode mixture (11–12 mg) was pressed on an Al mesh by applying a 4 ton pressure. The electrodes were cycled using Swagelok-type cells at a rate of C/20 per Na ion and then washed with PC solvent and dried. Galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling was conducted on a BioLogic VMP multichannel elec-trochemical workstation. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) experiments were performed using a BioLogic VSP multichannel electrochemical workstation. For GITT measurements, the battery cell was charged for 30 min with a current of 8 mA g-1 followed by an open-circuit stand for 4 h to reach a quasi-equilibrium state.
First-principles calculations were performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)31 in the framework of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.32 The exchange–correlation functional was parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) for generalized gradient approximation (GGA).33 The configuration of Na-3s1, Mn-3p63d54s2, V-3p63d34s2, P-3s23p3, and O-2s22p4 was treated as valence electrons. To correctly describe the localization of transition metal d-electrons, a Hubbard potential (U) was added to describe the d-part of the Hamiltonian, with U = 4.85 (ref. 34) and 4.0 (ref. 35) for Mn and V elements, respectively. The plane-wave cutoﬀ was set at 500 eV. k-Spacing was set to 0.4 for all structures to allow the smallest spacing between k-points in the unit of 0.4 A-1. The atomic sites and lattice constants were relaxed until the residual force was <0.01 eV A˚-1 in each species and the total energy converged to 10-4 eV. The migration properties of Na+ were simulated using the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.36 The intrinsic structural preferences without complicated interactions and between diﬀerent Na+ ions were explored by using a 2 x 1 x 3 supercell. The ionic convergence criterion was set at 0.03 for the force on each image. The crystal structure scheme was produced using VESTA software.
The prepared Na4MnV(PO4)3 consisted of micrometer particles, as confirmed by SEM imaging (Fig. S1, ESI†). It should be noted that the sol–gel preparation of such a kind of polyanion mate-rial usually leaves some residual carbon on the particles' surface, which could eﬀectively improve the material's elec-tronic conductivity. The content of carbon in the Na4MnV(PO4)3 sample was determined to be 2.4 wt% by TGA (Fig. S2†). Powder XRD showed that most reflections could be indexed to the rhombohedral-structured Na4MnV(PO4)3 with space group R3c (Fig. 1a). Moreover, a small amount of impurity NaMnPO4 phase (2.6 wt%) was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. The lattice parameters of the material were determined to be a = 8.9398 A˚ and c = 21.5317 A˚, which were consistent with those reported in the literature.27 The crystal structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3 was modeled based on the Rietveld refinement results (Table S1†), which showed a 3D framework consisting of corner-shared octahedral MO6 (M = Mn, V) and tetrahedral PO4 (Fig. 2a). Na atoms located at two independent sites in the interstitial space of the framework, with one Na atom 6-fold coordinated with O (termed as Na(1), green spheres) and the other three 7-fold coordinated with O (termed as Na(2), blue spheres). Accordingly, the chemical formula of Na4MnV(PO4)3 could also be written as Na(1)Na(2)3MnV(PO4)3 in more detail. Using Wyckoﬀ labels, the Na(1) and Na(2) atoms are located at the 6b and 18e sites of the rhombohedral system, respectively, and the Mn, V, P, and O atoms occupied the 12c, 12c, 18e, and 36f sites, respectively. The bond lengths of Na(1)–O are shorter than those of Na(2)–O, which averaged 2.416 A for Na(1)–O and 2.528 A for Na(2)–O. The shorter Na(1)–O bond indicated a larger overlap of electrons between Na(1) and O, resulting in higher binding energy than that of Na(2)–O.The temperature dependent magnetization of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in ZFC–FC measurements is shown in Fig. 1b. From the linearfitting of c-1 at 75–300 K where Na4MnV(PO4)3 is in a para-magnetic state (inset of Fig. 1b), the Curie–Weiss temperature was determined to be q =-17.0(1) K, indicating antiferro-magnetic mean field interactions. There was a clear indication of paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition at a N´eel temperature of TN = 6.0(5) K in the ZFC–FC measurements, which fell together with the local maximum of the l-peak sha-ped heat capacity signal at 5.9(5) K that is typical of para-magnetic to antiferromagnetic transition with the transition temperature shifting to lower temperatures at higher magneticfields (Fig. S3†). The eﬀective magnetic moment of Na4-MnV(PO4)3 was determined to be meﬀ = 6.39(2) mB from the Curie–Weiss fit of the inverse susceptibility vs. temperature curve, which is in good agreement with the theoretical spin-only moment of 6.55 mB calculated based on the Mn2+ (high spin, 3d5) and V3+ (3d2) cations in an octahedral crystal field. The somewhat lower experimental value of the eﬀective magnetic moment compared to the theoretical spin-only value can be explained by the spin–orbit coupling contribution for less than half filled d orbitals. It is noticed that a bifurcation between the ZFC and FC branches was observed below TB = 55 K from the temperature dependent magnetization curve (Fig. 1b), which indicates the existence of an additional ferro/ferrimagnetic phase with irreversible behavior, that was identified as the NaMnPO4 impurity phase with magnetic transition at 55 K.37The electrochemical performance of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in SIBs was characterized by galvanostatic charge–discharge in the voltage range of 2.5–3.8 V. Two voltage plateaus were observed at 3.4 and 3.6 V in the charging profile, and were associated with the V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples, respectively (Fig. S4a†). The specific capacity obtained in the 3.4 V plateau was 55 mA h g-1, corresponding to 0.99 Na+ extracted from Na4MnV(PO4)3. With further charging, 0.95 more Na+ was extracted from the electrode, resulting in a total charging capacity of 108 mA h g-1. The discharge profile was consistent with the charging process, indicating reversible electrochemical reactions in the tested voltage window. However, the cycling stability of the prepared Na4MnV(PO4)3 was not as good as those reported in the literature26–29(Fig. S4b†). To meet the require-ments for practical application, further eﬀort in materials preparation such as nano-engineering and surface carbon coating should be made to improve the electrochemical performance of Na4MnV(PO4)3.38
The structural properties of Na4MnV(PO4)3 during Na+ extrac-tion were studied by DFT calculations. The lattice parameters of the DFT optimized Na4MnV(PO4)3 are in good agreement with the XRD results. In addition, the lattice parameters of the Na+ extracted structures, Na2MnV(PO4)3, are also close to the experimental data reported by Chen et al.28 (Table 1). The theoretical cell volume of the Na+-extracted Na2MnV(PO4)3 was 7.4% smaller than that of Na4MnV(PO4)3. This small volume change indicated that Na4MnV(PO4)3 possessed a facile struc-ture for Na+ (de)intercalation.The charging process of Na4-xMnV(PO4)3 (0 < x < 2) was simulated by extracting Na one by one from a 2 x 1 x 3Na4-MnV(PO4)3 supercell. The enumeration method was used to determine the ground state structure (i.e., the structure with the lowest energy) of Na4-xMnV(PO4)3 at diﬀerent contents of Na. According to the electrochemical test results, the first voltage plateau at 3.4 V was attributed to the V3+/V4+ redox couple as a result of one Na+ extraction per formula unit of Na4-MnV(PO4)3. There are two possibilities for the extraction site of Na+ during this stage, i.e. Na(1) or Na(2). Calculations of relative energies showed that the structures of Na(1)Na(2)3-xMnV(PO4)3 were all more stable than those of Na(1)1-xNa(2)3MnV(PO4)3 (Table S2†). This indicated that extraction of Na(2) was more energetically favorable than extraction of Na(1). In addition, the original R3c space group of Na4MnV(PO4)3 remained unchanged during Na(2) extraction from the supercell. Accordingly, with the extraction of one Na+ per unit cell, the material underwent a solid-solution transition from Na(1) Na(2)3MnV(PO4)3 to Na(1)Na(2)2MnV(PO4)3 (Fig. 2a and b).With further charging, one more Na+ was extracted from Na(1)Na(2)2MnV(PO4)3, accompanied by the Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couple at 3.6 V vs. Na+/Na. Calculations of relative energies showed that extraction of Na(2) was still more feasible than extraction of Na(1) (Fig. S5†). However, with Na(2) extraction, the nearby Na(1) atom was no longer stable, and it relaxed to an interstitial site between Na(1) and Na(2), denoted as Na(3)(Fig. 2c, black spheres). Thus, the material underwent a biphasic transition from Na(1)Na(2)2-xMnV(PO4)3 to Na(1)1-xNa(2)2-xNa(3)xMnV(PO4)3. A chemical composition of Na(2)Na(3)MnV(PO4)3 with a structure belonging to the R3c space group was obtained after 2 Na+ ions were extracted from the Na4MnV(PO4)3 unit cell (Fig. 2c).The local structure around Na was studied in detail to aﬀord a deep understanding of the biphasic transition of Na4-x-MnV(PO4)3 during extraction of the second Na+.Fromthestruc-tural point-of-view, the most reasonable crystallographic site for Na in polyanionic materials should possess a spacious cavity for accepting big Na ions. In addition, a stable Na site should oﬀer a high degree of O coordination39,40 and long Na–VandNa–P bonds to produce an active screen for the electrostatic repulsion between Na and the surrounding cations.41 In the Na2MnV(PO4)3 structure, the Na(1), Na(2), and Na(3) ions were six-, seven-, and seven-fold coordinated with O, respectively. In addition, among the three Na sites, Na(3) possessed the longest Na–O, Na–V, and Na–P bond lengths (Fig. S6 and Table S3†). This indicated that Na(3) was the most favorable site for accommodating Na ions. To further study the biphasic transition from the dynamic perspec-tive, the Na migration behavior in Na(1)Na(2)2-xMnV(PO4)3 was studied by the CI-NEB method. Accompanied by extraction of Na(2), Na+ would migrate in Na(1)Na(2)2-xMnV(PO4)3 along four possible pathways as shown in Fig. 3. The migration barriers of Na+ in these pathways were 0.87, 0.98, 0.39, and 0.59 eV for paths-1–4, respectively, which clearly showed that path-3 was the most feasible one. In this preferred migration pathway, Na+ migrated from site-(1) to site-(2) after passing an interstitial site-(3). In addition, it is important to note that a negative energy minimum of -0.13 eV was observed for path-3, which was just obtained at site-(3). This indicated that the Na(3) site was located at a poten-tial well between Na(1) and Na(2). Therefore, with the extraction of Na(2), the nearby Na(1) did not move to the Na(2) vacancy but instead auto-migrated to the interstitial site Na(3) into a lower-energy state.The structural transformations obtained by DFT calculations are in general agreement with the in operando XRD results re-ported by Chen et al.28 However, according to their XRD anal-ysis, the biphasic transition in 1 < x < 2 was a result of the decreases in site occupancies of Na(1) and Na(2) from Na(1) Na(2)2MnV(PO4)3 to Na(1)0.78Na(2)0.72MnV(PO4)3. In contrast, the present DFT calculations showed that the biphasic transi-tion involved Na+ migration from site-(1) to the nearby site-(3), resulting in a structural change from Na(1)Na(2)2-xMnV(PO4)3 to Na(2)Na(3)MnV(PO4)3. Powder X-ray diﬀraction is probably not sensitive enough to distinguish partial occupation on either the Na(2) or the Na(3) site.To probe the local structural changes around Na in more detail, 23Na MAS NMR was performed on Na4-xMnV(PO4)3 at diﬀerent electrochemical stages (Fig. 4). For the pristine Na4-MnV(PO4)3, two resonance peaks were observed at -56 and -428 ppm. The intense peak at -56 ppm was assigned to the Na(2) atom at the 18e site and the weaker peak at -428 ppm corresponded to the Na(1) atom at the 6b site. The large nega-tive shifts are explained by the strong interactions of Na nuclei with unpaired electron spin density that was transferred from the Mn/V next-nearest neighbors via the O to Na nuclei.42 Both peaks were quite broad due to the diﬀerent occupations with V3+ or Mn2+ of the next-nearest neighbor positions. When the electrode was charged to 3.58 V, both peaks at -56 and -428 ppm showed significant decreases in their intensities. This was caused by the oxidation of V3+ (3d2)toV4+ (3d1), which reduced the overall electronic magnetic moment of the V ions. However, it was noticed that the relative intensity of the -56 ppm peak decreased much more with respect to the -428 ppm peak. This demonstrated that Na+ ions were extrac-ted from the Na(2) site, which agreed with the DFT results discussed above. With further charging to 3.7 V, the resonance peak at -428 ppm was almost invisible. Meanwhile, a new resonance peak was observed at 136 ppm, which indicated the occupation of Na on a new site. Combined with the DFT results, this new resonance peak was a result of the auto-migration of Na(1) to the interstitial Na(3) site, concurrent with the extraction of Na(2). When the electrode was discharged to 2.5 V from 3.7 V, the 23Na MAS NMR pattern recovered to its original form, indicating good structural reversibility of the electrode in the tested voltage window.
The Na+ extraction voltage of Na4xxMnV(PO4)3 (0 <= x <= 2) was calculated using the following equation43 where Ex1 and Ex2 are the total energies of Nax1MnV(PO4)3 and Nax2MnV(PO4)3, respectively, and ENa is the energy per Na atom in metallic Na. The calculated voltage profile of Na4MnV(PO4)3 showed an open-circuit voltage of 2.5 V (Fig. S7†). With Na+ extraction, the electrode exhibited two voltage plateaus at -3.3 and 3.6 V, which were consistent with the experimental charging profile.The partial density of states (DOS) of Na4MnV(PO4)3 indi-cated that the free electrons in V-3d and Mn-3d orbitals were pinned at the highest energy level (x1.5 to 0 eV) in the occupied state (Fig. 5a). The DOS for other 3d electrons (<x1.5 eV) over-lapped with that of the O-2p state, implying polar covalent bonding between the transition metals and O. By integrating their DOS under x1.5 eV, the covalent bonding of V and Mn was determined to be 1.14e and 1.20e, respectively. Moreover, the ionic bonding was determined by Bader charge analysis, and was 1.71e for V and 0.78e for Mn. Based on this, the theoretical valence states of V and Mn were calculated as the sum of covalent and ionic bonding, and were +2.85 for V and +1.98 for Mn. In addition, a total magnetic moment of 6.58 mB was calculated for Na4MnV(PO4)3. These results are in good agree-ment with the PPMS measurements (6.39 mB) as discussed above, which also validates the reliability of the DFT calculations.
The DOS at the Fermi level for the pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 was composed of V-3d and O-2p orbitals, which were strongly overlapped in spin-up states, indicating that Na4MnV(PO4)3 is a semi-metal material. Furthermore, DOS analysis of Na4xx-MnV(PO4)3 (x = 1 or 2) showed that the semi-metallic properties were maintained during Na+ extraction (Fig. 5b and c). Compared with other well-known polyanionic electrode mate-rials with large band gaps, such as LiFePO4 (ref. 44) and Na3V2(PO4)3,45 the semi-metallic properties of Na4xxMnV(PO4)3 provide relatively higher electronic conductivity. After the first Na+ was extracted, a sharp unoccupied V-3d orbital appeared near the Fermi level, which indicated loss of electrons from the V-3d state. In addition, structural analysis showed that the average length of the V–O bonds decreased from 2.053 to 1.950 A. Meanwhile, the average Mn–O bond length was almost unchanged (2.202 A). This indicated that V was the charge transfer center of this Na+ extraction process. After the extrac-tion of the second Na+, a new unoccupied orbital was observed near the Fermi level, which was attributed to the Mn-3d state, indicating loss of electrons from Mn. During this process, the average V–O bond length remained unchanged while the average Mn–O bond length decreased from 2.202 to 2.019 A. This demonstrated that Mn was the charge transfer center of this process.Furthermore, the charge transfer properties of Na4-MnV(PO4)3 during Na+ extraction were analyzed by calculating the Bader charge (Table 2). First of all, it was seen that one extracted Na-ion transferred -0.54e to the electrode. After extraction of the first Na+, the Bader charge of V increased from 1.71e to 1.90e, while the Bader charge of Mn remained almost unchanged. With further Na+ extraction, the Bader charge of Mn changed from 0.80e to 0.99e, while the value for V remained at 1.90e. This demonstrated that V and Mn consecutively acted as the redox center of Na4xxMnV(PO4)3, which is consistent with the DOS analysis. Together with Na+ extraction, the Bader charge of O gradually changed from x1.48e (Na4MnV(PO4)3)to x1.32e (Na3MnV(PO4)3), and then to x1.10e (Na2MnV(PO4)3). According to our previous study,46 changes in Bader charge do not imply that O participated in the redox reaction, but indicate that O acted as a charge transfer medium between the transition metal cations (M = V, Mn) and Na+. In addition, the partial DOS of the V(Mn)-3d and O-2p states of the Na4xxMnV(PO4)3 phases showed that, for these phases, the occupied state of V(Mn)-3d was strongly hybridized with the O-2p state in a low energy range from x0.5 to 0 eV. This indicated that the strong covalent properties of V(Mn)–O decreased the energy level of V(Mn)-3d electrons to the energy level of O-2p orbitals via polarized covalent bonds, which resulted in the high structural stability of this material. In addition, although these shared electrons in covalent bonds occupied the energy levels of the O-2p orbitals, they indeed contributed to the V(Mn)-3d orbital, which resulted in Bader charges very diﬀerent from the formal charge of x2e for O, +2e/3e for Mn, and +3e/4e for V in the fully ionic limit.The Na+ transport kinetics of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in the first voltage plateau was studied by the CI-NEB method using a 2 x 1 x 3 Na4MnV(PO4)3 supercell. During the initial charging process, one Na+ was extracted from the supercell with the formation of Na23/6MnV(PO4)3 and a vacancy at the 18e site. Then, the Na+ at the adjacent 18e site migrated to this vacant site. Considering Na+ migration along the a-axis, there are a total of six possible pathways for Na+ (Fig. S8a†). The displacements for Na+ migration along paths(a)-1–6 are 3.43, 3.43, 3.38, 3.38, 5.08, and 4.96 A, respectively. According to CI-NEB calculations (Table S3†), the energy barriers for Na+ migration along path(a)-5 and -6 were 1.320 and 1.147 eV, respectively, which were too large for Na+ migration. In comparison, Na+ migration along the other four pathways was more feasible, with very small energy barriers of 0.380, 0.300, 0.390, and 0.390 eV for paths(a)-1–4, respectively.
Connections of paths(a)-1–2–3–4 formed a 2D zigzag migration channel for Na+. Following this method, Na+ was determined to also migrate along the path(b)-1–2–3–4 channel (b-axis) and path(c)-1–5–4–2 channel (c-axis) as well (Tables S4 and S5†). These Na+ migration channels form spiral 3D pathways for Na+ with low energy barriers of <0.4 eV, which ensure high Na+ mobility in Na4MnV(PO4)3 (Fig. 6).The Na+ transport properties in the second voltage plateau were further studied. According to the crystal structure of Na(2) Na(3)MnV(PO4)3, there are four possible migration pathways at this charging stage, with path-1 and -4 along the a-axis, path-2 along the b-axis, and path-3 along the c-axis (Fig. 3a). CI-NEB calculations showed that the diﬀusion barriers of Na+ were 0.870 (a-axis), 0.976 (b-axis), and 0.520 eV (c-axis). This indicated that Na+ could only migrate in a 1D channel along the c-axis during this charging process (Fig. 7), while migration along the a- and b-axis was hindered by high diﬀusion barriers >0.8 eV. Moreover, the eﬀective Na+ diﬀusion barrier was much smaller than those in the first voltage plateau, which resulted from the biphasic transition from Na(1)Na(2)2xxMnV(PO4)3 to Na(2)Na(3) MnV(PO4)3.
The electrochemical performance of SIBs is closely related to the diﬀusivity of Na+ in the electrode bulk. Here, GITT analysis was performed to determine the Na+ diﬀusion coeﬃcients of Na4MnV(PO4)3 during the charging process. The Na+ diﬀusion coeﬃcients were calculated from the potential response using the following equation47
In summary, theoretical calculations and experimental studies were combined to investigate the structural properties and electrochemical mechanisms of Na4MnV(PO4)3 in sodium ion batteries. There are two independent Na sites, Na(1) and Na(2), in the structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3. Charge–discharge cycling at 2.5–3.8 V was associated with (de)sodiation of Na(2). Extraction of the first Na+ caused charge transfer on V3+ together with a solid-solution transition from Na(1)Na(2)3MnV(PO4)3 to Na(1) Na(2)2MnV(PO4)3. During this process, Na+ migrated in the 3D channels of the NASICON structure with low energy barriers of <0.4 eV. With extraction of the second Na+, the charge transfer process occurred on Mn2+ and the material experienced a biphasic transition from Na(1)Na(2)2xxMnV(PO4)3 to Na(2) Na(3)MnV(PO4)3 with the Na(1) atom auto-migrating to a nearby Na(3) site. During this process, Na+ migrated in a 1D channel along the c-axis with a relatively higher diﬀusion barrier of 0.52 eV. The material showed a large and constant Na+ diﬀusion coeﬃcient of 2.0 x 10x12 cm2 sx1 during extraction of the first Na+ because of the facile 3D migration pathways for Na+ and the solid-solution structural change. With extraction of the second Na+, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient decreased to 9.7 x 10x14 cm2 sx1 due to the 1D migration of Na+ and the biphasic structural change. These results provide a deep understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism of Na4MnV(PO4)3 at the atomic scale. There are no conflicts to declare.
