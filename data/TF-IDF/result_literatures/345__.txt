Li-ion microbatteries have emerged a new direction for powering the miniaturized modern devices, for instance  RFID tags, implantable medical devices, microsensors, and smart cards. In order to advance towards the fabrication of all-solid-state thin film microbatteries, numerous studies have been reported to find innovative cathode  and anode materials. Most of reports have been largely devoted to anode materials such as self-organized TiO2  nanotubes1,2, silicon nanowires3, Cu2Sb4, aluminum nanorods5, carbon nanotubes6,7, and LiNiVO4 8. Besides the  anode materials, exploiting the cathode materials are very crucial to realize the fabrication of full cell Li-ion  microbatteries. Iron-based phosphate especially olivine-type LiFePO4 (LFP) becomes a popular cathode as it is  known to be cheap, abundant, low toxic, and thermally stable9. The strong Fe-O covalent bonds in LFP cathodes  has such a special characteristic compared to layered LiCoO2-type materials10. Indeed, this covalent bond greatly  improve the stability of O in the lattice, thus increasing the reliability of the materials.

In the field of thin-film microbatteries, study the properties of the pure active layers deposited onto the current collectors is essential since neither binder nor conductive additive are utilized11–13. By using the thin film  cathodes, the intrinsic drawbacks such as a low electronic conductivity and low Li+ diffusion mobility can also be  suppressed because the thickness of the cathode material is considerably reduced14–16. Much studies have reported  the growth of thin-film electrodes by various techniques such as pulsed laser deposition (PLD)17–22, sputtering23,24  and sol-gel25–27.

More recently, RF sputtering have attracted substantial attention in the fabrication of the flexible and transparent thin-film batteries. For example, Lee et al.29 reported a flexible battery applied on contact lens using LFP  cathode material deposited on the flexible polyimide substrate by RF sputtering, the thin film reached 63.8% of  the theoretical capacity without carbon coating and the cell showed stable performance under wet conditions.  Also, Oukassi et al.30 deposited transparent thin film batteries layers using RF sputtering, a discharge capacity of  0.15 mAh at C/2 rate with an average capacity loss of solely 0.15% per cycle can be obtained.

Due to a strong research interest focused on searching for lithium transition metal phosphates as cathode  materials, NASICON type-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has been reported of having a high lithium mobility and can intercalate  up to two moles of lithium within the structure31. Besides a theoretical capacity of 128 mAh g−1 32, Li3Fe2(PO4)3  cathode is currently attracting considerable interest due to several advantages such as low toxicity, low cost, good  ionic conductivity, and large natural abundance33. Furthermore, the structure of the NASICON type-Li3Fe2(PO4)3  is more stable than that of olivine-type LiFePO4 34 and its synthesis is easier as it can be prepared directly in air.  NASICON type-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 have been commonly synthesized via various methods such as solid-state reactions35, hydrothermal36, sol-gel combustion32 and ultrasonic spray pyrolysis37. However, there are only limited  reports regarding the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 film deposited by RF Sputtering12. In the present work, we propose to study  the effect of annealing temperature on RF sputtered LFP thin-films in terms of morphology, composition, structure, and electrochemical properties. We show that the thermal treatment performed at 700 °C in air leads to the  formation of porous Li3Fe2(PO4)3 showing the best electrochemical performance and therefore being a good  candidate as a cathode for Li-ion microbatteries.

Results and Discussion Structural and chemical characterization.  The schematic representation of the sputtering system is  illustrated in Fig. 1. The sputtering process can be briefly described as follows: an inert argon gas is introduced  in the vacuum chamber and the ionization process leads to the formation of a plasma. Then, the energized ions  hitting the LFP target (cathode) eject out adatoms that are deposited on the substrate to form a thin film. Various  parameters such as the nature of the substrate, the sputtering power, the argon pressure, the duration, and the  deposition temperature have significant influences on the growth rate and features of the deposited film14.

In this work, a sputtering power of 3 W cm−2 and argon pressure of 7 mTorr during 12 hours of deposition was  employed to obtain smooth and dense layers as well as a better adhesion between the films and the substrates.  Owing to a low deposition rate, 12 hours of deposition is required to obtain LFP films with a sufficient thickness  for the targeted application. The XRD pattern of the commercial LFP target and as-deposited film are plotted in  Fig. 2a. Obviously, the initial target has well-defined peaks corresponding to the Olivine LiFePO4 (JCPDS File No.  040-1499). However, after deposition at room temperature, only Ti peaks can be identified suggesting that the  material is amorphous. The amorphous nature of the thin films deposited without heating treatment, either substrate heating during deposition or post-annealing have been reported in previous studies12,14. Thus, the thermal  treatment step is essential because the crystalline materials are known for their better electrochemical reactivities  versus Li ions38.

LFP and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phases can be detected at elevated temperatures. The amorphous nature of LFP is evidenced  for the film annealed at 400 °C since only Ti peaks are visible. This result confirms that annealing temperature  higher than 400 °C is required to crystallize LFP thin film13. As the temperature was increased to 500 °C, several  characteristic peaks of 2θ suited at 17.21°, 20.82°, 25.65°, 29.87° and 32.36° marked as symbol (o) are attributed  to the (0 2 0), (0 1 1), (0 2 1), (1 2 1) and (0 3 1) planes of LFP phase. Besides the presence of LFP peaks, two small  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 peaks with low intensities marked as symbol (*) are also detected at 2θ of 24.4° and 35.8° suggesting  that the decomposition of LiFePO4 phase has also started. Nevertheless, crystalline LFP seems to be the most predominant phase at 500 °C. This is probably due to a slow heating rate that is applied during annealing treatment.  As reported elsewhere40, the heating rate plays an important role in decelerating a second phase formation. It is  important to note that in our work the films were heated at 2 °C min−1 to avoid the fast formation of Li3Fe2(PO4)3  phase due to the LFP sensibility to air atmosphere. Thus, the LFP phase can be clearly detected at 500 °C after  annealing in air atmosphere. Presumably, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase might be quickly obtained when the heating rate is  faster than 2 °C min−1 in air.

As the electrochemical performance of electrodes are often driven by their morphology, the examination of  thin-films was performed by SEM. Figure 5 shows the surface of the annealed thin films. Apparently, the roughness increases with increasing of the annealing temperature.

According to the SEM examinations, LFP-400 is composed of small grains and exhibits a rough surface due  to an inhomogeneous size distribution of particles (Fig. 5a,b). As the temperature is raised to 500 °C, the surface is characterized by the presence of large pores with various diameters (Fig. 5c,d), suggesting the formation 

For LFP-600, the voltage plateau around 2.8 V is ascribed to the reaction implying the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase.  The presence of a short plateau at 3.5 V can be attributed to the low amount of crystalline LFP. The capacities  of the LFP film annealed at 600 °C for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles are 27 µAh cm−2 µm−1, 20 µAh cm−2 µm−1 and  18 µAh cm−2 µm−1 and the coulombic efficiencies are 57%, 80% and 84%, respectively. The low coulombic efficiency obtained in the 1st cycle could be explained by the mixed phases. In addition, the LFP film annealed at  700 °C revealed a well-defined plateau around 2.4 V which indicates the Li ions insertion into the LiTi2(PO4)3  lattice structure and another plateau appeared at 2.8 Vcorresponds to redox reactions involving the Li3Fe2(PO4)3  phase50–52. The capacities of the film for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles are 31 µAh cm−2 µm−1, 28 µAh cm−2 µm−1  and 27 µAh cm−2 µm−1, while the associated coulombic efficiencies can reach 83%, 90% and 92%, respectively.  Beyond the influence of the chemical and structural composition, the enhanced electrochemical properties of  LFP-500 and LFP-700 can be explained by the porosity of the both layers. Actually, it has been reported that the  use of porous electrodes can improve the electrochemical performance of batteries owing to the larger electrode/ electrolyte interface53,54. In the present case, the porous nature of the LFP-500 and LFP-700 films is supposed to  promote the penetration of the electrolyte providing more reaction electrochemical actives sites for the lithium  ions intercalation/de-intercalation owing to larger accessible surface of the thin films. This is beneficial to improve  the Li ion exchange between the LFP film electrode and electrolyte because the pores serve as channels for fast  lithium supply55.

In order to have a better insight into the potential use of annealed LFP layer as cathode materials, rate capability and long-term cycling tests were carried out. Figure 8a confirms that LFP-400 film provides the lowest  capacity values attaining only 2 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at the 50th cycle. LFP-500 film exhibits the highest discharge  capacities up to the 90th cycle but this cathode is subjected to a continuous capacity loss with a drop after the 80th  cycle. The capacities obtained at the 1st, 2nd, and 100th cycle are 36 µAh cm−2 µm−1, 35 µAh cm−2 µm−1, and 18  µAh cm−2 µm−1, respectively. Thus, only half of the initial capacity is retained after 100 cycles. It can be noticed  that similar behavior regarding the capacity fading has been reported for the annealed LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 thin  films at 500 °C22. 

As a further examination, we also studied the rate capability of the thin films annealed at 500 °C and 700 °C  because they showed the most interesting electrochemical properties (Fig. 8b). LFP-500 delivers stable capacity  values of 35 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at C/10 rate, 25 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at C/5 rate, and 13 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at 1C rate.  Although the initial C/10 and C/5 discharge capacity are superior compared to LFP-700 film, the LFP-500 shows  relatively larger degradation in capacity with further increasing discharge current. Indeed, significant capacity  losses of 28% and 48% are observed for subsequent tests at C/5 and 1C rate, respectively. The LFP-700 film cathode delivers capacity values of 25 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at C/10 rate, 22 µAh cm−2 µm−1 at C/5 rate, and 19 µAh cm−2  µm−1 at 1C rate. The capacity slightly decreased of only 11% from C/10 to C/5 rate and decreased of about 15.5%  from C/5 to 1C rate. More remarkably, the discharge capacity values of about 22 µAh cm−2 µm−1 and 25 µAh cm−2  µm−1 at C/5 and C/10 show that the full capacity is completely recovered even after fast cycling tests. Therefore, it  is found that the highest annealing temperature treatment (700 °C) is able to strongly improve the electrochemical  stability of LFP films electrodes, especially in the rapid charge-discharge regimes. After few initial cycles, LFP700 film reveals high reversibility and prominent cycling stability. The better performance of LFP-700 film is also  attributed to the presence of the LTP phase as a good ionic conductor56.

To sum up, the amorphous and partially crystalline LFP phases may not be stable during Li-ion intercalation/ de-intercalation, yielding in a fast capacity fading22. Thus, through this study, we highlight the important role  of the post annealing treatment mainly for the intercalation cathodes. This treatment is responsible for the film  texturation, thus it could help minimizing ionic limitation by enhancing the contact area between electrolyte and  the film surface contact, as well as could enhance the electrochemical activity54,57–59.

In summary, we have successfully prepared porous thin film cathodes by RF sputtering technique and subsequent  annealing treatment in air atmosphere. The electrochemical performance of the thin films depends strongly on  the annealing conditions. Different morphological and structural properties were obtained by varying the temperature treatment, leading to a significant influence on the cell performances. We report that annealing at 500 °C  is required to obtain porous olivine type-LiFePO4 film even if the electrochemical tests revealed a drop of capacities after the 80th cycle. Complete transformation from porous olivine type-LiFePO4 to porous NASICON-type  Li3Fe2(PO4)3 occurring at 700 °C led to a remarkable stability of the electrode with good electrochemical performance even at fast kinetics.
