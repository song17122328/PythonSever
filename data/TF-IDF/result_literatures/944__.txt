Triclinic NASICON-type hafnium hydrogen phosphateHHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O was obtained by ion exchange fromLiHf2(PO4)3. The dehydration of HHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O (~400 K)followed by a triclinic-rhombohedral phase transition (~470 K)was observed, and the resulting HHf2(PO4)3 was stableup to 870 K.

The proton conductivity of the sample was4.7×10–7 Ohm–1 cm–1 at 773 K.

Double phosphates with the NASICON structure belong to aclass of compounds with the general formula AxB2(PO4)3, whereA = H, Li, Na, K, Cu(0.5), H3O, NH4, and B = In, Sc, Fe, Zr, Ti,Hf, Sn, Ge, etc.

The alternation of the two types of cavitiesalong conductive channels gives a three-dimensional network forfast ion transport.

Furthermore, these compounds are characterizedby high hydrolytic and thermal stability.

Hydrogen phosphates of polyvalent elements are promisingmaterials for applications at elevated temperatures in processeswhere organic proton-exchange membranes cannot be employedbecause of their degradability.

 High-temperature proton fuelcells have received substantial attention due to their high carbonmonoxide tolerance allowing to use cheap hydrogen produced byconversion of hydrocarbons and simplified water management.

Previously, it was shown that the double hydrogen phosphates withthe NASICON structure HZr2(PO4)3·nH2O, H1±xZr2–xMx(PO4)3·H2O(M = Nb, Y) and H3–2xMiii2 –xNbx(PO4)3·nH2O (Miii = In, Fe) arecharacterized by high thermal stability and high proton conductivity at high temperatures.

At the same time, there areno data on the properties of hafnium hydrogen phosphate withthe NASICON structure.

Therefore, the synthesis and protonmobility of HHf2(PO4)3 are of theoretical interest.

Previously, highion conductivity of rhombohedral NASICON-type LiHf2(PO4)3was reported.

Here, we synthesized hafnium hydrogen phosphate with theNASICON structure for the first time and characterized itscomposition, thermal stability and proton mobility.

Hafnium hydrogen phosphate was obtained by ion exchange inhot nitric acid for 30 days from LiHf2(PO4)3 with the NASICONstructure previously synthesized by a solid state method.

According to SEM data, the initial LiHf2(PO4)3 with theNASICON structure is characterized by a broad particle sizedistribution (1–20 mm) with an average particle size of about5 μm.

 The hydrogen form that was obtained as a result of ionexchange is characterized by smaller and more uniform particleswith an average size of about 3 mm.

The initial LiHf2(PO4)3 possesses rhombohedral symmetry.

The XRD patterns of prepared sample have revealed that theNASICON structure is kept after ion exchange, but a decrease inthe lattice symmetry is observed.

The X-ray diffraction pattern ofthe sample can be indexed in the triclinic system.

The unit cellparameters are as follows: a = 15.46±0.03, b = 8.85±0.01 and c == 9.32±0.02 Å, a = 89.8±0.1°, b = 123.5±0.1° and g = 88.75±0.1°.

Two steps of weight loss are observed in the TGA curve ofhydrogen hafnium phosphate.

The first one corresponds to theloss of crystalline water.

The hydration degree calculated fromthe first step of weight loss is 0.5 molecules of H2O per formulaunit of HHf2(PO4)3.The second step (870–1170 K) correspondsto anhydrous hydrogen phosphate decomposition with split outof structural water followed by hafnium oxide and hafniumpyrophosphate formation [equation (1)].

The decomposition ofHHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O is similar to that of HZr2(PO4)3·nH2O reportedelsewhere.

The observed weight loss corresponds to 100% lithium ionexchange.

Phase transformations that occur on heating HHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2Owere investigated by high-temperature XRD analysis.

The phasetransition from triclinic to rhombohedral symmetry was observedin a temperature range of 470–570 K.

The unit cell parametersof rhombohedral HHf2(PO4)3 at 570 K are a = 8.844±0.003 andc = 22.893±0.001 Å (space group R–3c).

The sample returns tothe triclinic symmetry after cooling.

According to calorimetric data, two broad endothermic peaksat 440 and 505 K appeared on heating (Figure 1, curve 1).

Onlyone peak was observed in the DTG curve (at 440 K) (Figure 1,curve 3) due to the dehydration of the sample.

The second peakin the DSC curve (at 505 K) corresponds to the phase transition.

The heat effects of these endothermic processes are 8.3 and3.4 kJ mol–1, respectively.

Only one exothermic peak at 495 Kwas detected on cooling HHf2(PO4)3 (Figure 1, curve 2).

Themass changes were not revealed during cooling.

The resultsindicate the reversibility of the phase transition.

This fact is alsoconfirmed by XRD analysis.

The anhydrous hydrogen–hafniumphosphate reverts to a triclinic modification after cooling to roomtemperature.

Figure 2 shows a plot of conductivity vs.1000/T for HHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O.

Impedance measurements were performed at usualrelative humidity in cylindrical pellets with platinum electrodes(platinum black) by a two-probe method using an IPU-62alternating current bridge in a frequency range from 10 Hz to2 MHz in a temperature range of 298–873 K with a step of 10–20 Kand a heating rate of 2 K min–1.Bulk conductivity was calculatedby the extrapolation of the semicircle to the resistance axis.

Theproton conductivity of HHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O is 5.5×10–8 Ohm–1 cm–1at room temperature.

At low temperatures, conductivity is mostlikely determined by the proton diffusion in water sorbed onHHf2(PO4)3 particles.

At 298–470 K, the conductivity decreasesdue to a water loss.

This correlates with the first step of mass lossaccording to the TGA data.

Above 470 K, the conductivityincreases due to the thermal activation of proton transfer inHHf2(PO4)3 with an activation energy of 40±1 kJ mol–1.At thesame time, a change in the slope of the Arrhenius plots owingto the phase transformation of HHf2(PO4)3 is observed at 520 K(Figure 2).

Note that the conductivity of HHf2(PO4)3 is lower than that ofhydrogen–zirconium phosphates with the NASICON structure11,14,15and H3–2xMiii2–xNbx(PO4)3·nH2O (Miii = In, Fe)16 obtained at usualrelative humidity even after HHf2(PO4)3 triclinic–rhombohedralphase transition in a high-temperature range (470–750 K).

Thus, the triclinic hafnium hydrogen phosphate HHf2(PO4)3·0.5H2O with the NASICON structure was obtained for the firsttime and characterized in a wide temperature range.

 This compound possesses high thermal stability and exhibits proton conductive properties.

Hydrogen phosphates with the NASICONstructure can be considered as promising proton conductingthermostable electrolytes for fuel cells operated at medium temperatures (473–773 K).
