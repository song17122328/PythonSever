Here, we develop design rules for aqueous sodium-ion battery cathodes through a comprehensive density functional theory study of the working potential and aque-ous stability of known cathode materials. These design rules were applied in a high-throughput screening of Na-ion battery cathode materials for application in aqueouselectrolytes. Five promising cathode materials - NASICON-Na3Fe2(PO4)3, Na2FePO4F, Na3FeCO3PO4, alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3 and Na3MnCO3PO4, were identiﬁed as hith-erto unexplored aqueous sodium-ion battery cathodes, with high voltage, good capac-ity, high stability in aqueous environments and facile Na-ion migration. These ﬁndings pave the way the practical cathode development for large-scale energy storage systems based on aqueous Na-ion battery chemistry.
Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) have recently gathered intensive interest for largescale energy storage systems.1,2 Compared to non-aqueous batteries, the use of a non-ﬂammable, inexpensive and environmentally-safe aqueous electrolyte in ASIBs not only oﬀers high reliability, but also lowers the cost of manufacture and maintenance. The rapid ionic diﬀusion in the aqueous electrolyte, which is generally two to three orders of magnitudehigher than that in a non-aqueous electrolyte, also enables high rate capability in ASIBs.3
Much research eﬀort has been directed toward the design of ASIBs cathodes with both higher energy densities and long term cycling stabilities.1,2 Figure 1 and Table 1 summarizesthe main cathodes that have been studied for ASIB applications. They can be broadly categorized into four families:
1.Mn oxides. Na0.44MnO2 (Space group: P bam) is among the most well-studied cath-odes in ASIBs. Its electrochemical performance varies in diﬀerent voltage ranges and electrolytes.4–6 While most Mn oxides exhibit capacitive behavior in aqueous elec-trolytes,7–11 Na0.44MnO2 exhibits consecutive biphasic reactions with Na+ intercala-tion.4 The inter-connected diﬀusion channels and the abundant vacancies in the struc-ture facilitates Na+ diﬀusion in the charge/discharge processes.3
2.Natrium Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON). The NASICON compounds have been extensively studied as SIBs cathodes due to their open framework, which enable facile Na+ diﬀusion.12 The general formula of NASICON is NaxMM’(XO4)3 and consists of a three dimensional framework of MO6 and M’O6 octahedra sharing corners with XO4 tetrahedra. R3c-Na3V2(PO4)3 is the most widely investigated NASICON-type cathode in conventional SIBs.13 Recently, R3c-Na3VTi(PO4)3 14 and Na3MnTi(PO4)3 15have also been investigated as electrodes in symmetric aqueous batteries and exhibits signiﬁcantly improved long term cycling stability compared with Na3V2(PO4)3.16
3.Fe phosphates. Olivine-NaFePO4, pyrophosphate-Na2FeP2O7 and mixed anionic phosphate Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 have been investigated as cathodes in ASIBs given the fact that average redox potential of Fe2+/Fe3+ in phosphate compounds usually locates within the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolyte.17–19
4. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). PBAs, with a general chemical formula of AxP[R(CN)6]1–y· nH2O (A = alkali or alkaline ion, P and R = transition metals), have been demonstrated as excellent cathode materials for ASIBs because their open 3D framework enables fast ionic diﬀusion and superior cycling stability.20 In partic-ular, K0.6Ni1.2Fe(CN)6· 3.6 H2O and Na1.4Cu1.3Fe(CN)6· 8 H2O show great performance in aqueous electrolyte during electrochemical cycling of Na+ ions.21,22
Unlike cathodes in conventional sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), which usually operate at potential larger than 3.5 V vs Na/Na+, cathodes in ASIBs must have working potentials within the evolution potential of O2 and H2 gas, i.e., 2.31 ∼ 3.53 V vs Na/Na+ in neutral electrolyte. Also, dissolution of electrodes and side reactions with the aqueous electrolyte, such as electrode materials reacting with H2O/O2 and proton intercalation into electrode materials, can adversely aﬀect the long-term cycling stability of ASIBs. Possible strategies to mitigate these side reaction include coating the electrode, eliminating oxygen and adjusting the pH of the electrolyte.23 However, the intrinsic instability of electrode materials in aqueous environment still leads to signiﬁcant performance reduction of ASIBs. For example, Zhang et al. 16 found that the capacity of carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 fades steadily from 94.5 mAh/g to about 10 mAh/g within only 30 cycles in 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte when being charged/discharged at rate of 10 C due to cathode dissolution. While ﬁrst principles methods have been applied extensively to the study of battery materials,24 there have been relatively few computational studies of ASIB cathode materials, and most are focused on the PBA family.25,26In this work, we derive design rules by benchmarking ﬁrst principles predictions of the working potential and aqueous stability on representative ASIB cathode materials. The scope includes all cathodes tabulated in Table 1, with the exception of the PBAs as these have been studied extensively previously and possible water co-intercalation in these systems complicate their analysis.26 We then apply these design rules to the high-throughput screening of known SIB cathode materials for application in aqueous electrolytes, identifying several hitherto-unexplored candidates for further exploration.
All spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vi-enna ab initio simulation (VASP) package within the projected-augmented wave method.32,33 The exchange-correlation functional used for structural relaxation and energy calculations was the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) func-tional34 with a Hubbard U 35 applied for 3d transition metals. The U parameters used were similar to those from the Materials Project.36 For Ti and V containing compounds, calculations were also performed using the screened hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional37,38 and the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional.39 The energy cutoﬀ of plane wave was 520 eV, and the k-point density was at least 1000/(num-ber of atoms in the cell). All calculations were performed in a ferromagnetic conﬁguration, initialized with low spin for Co and high spin for all other transition metals. All crystal struc-ture manipulations, input/output ﬁle generation and data analysis were performed using the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) package.40
The average intercalation potential of Na into a host X vs Na/Na+ was calculated by the equation:41where EDF T (·) denotes the DFT calculated total energy, and e is the electron charge. In this work, the average voltage was calculated based on a one-electron-per-transition-metal redox reaction for all materials.
The voltage proﬁles were constructed by using all stable phases from the pseudobinary phase diagram of the sodiated and desodiated compounds (Figure S1), obtained using the convex hull construction.42 All the initial sodiated structures were obtained either from the Materials Project36 or ICSD database.43 All the partially desodiated structures were determined by enumerating all symmetrically distinct orderings in suﬃciently large supercells using the adaptor to the enumlib library44 in pymatgen.40 For each composition, at least 20 lowest electrostatic energy (computed via the Ewald summation method) conﬁgurations were selected for the convex hull construction.
Pourbaix diagrams were computed using the formalism developed by Persson et al. 45 , which combines ab initio calculated solid phases with experimental aqueous reference states. In a chemical system M, the Pourbaix stable domains are determined based on the knowledge of all possible equilibrium redox reactions in M-O-H chemical space. For the following reaction in an aqueous medium at a given pH = −log[H+]:the Nernst equation, can be used to relate the external potential, E, to the change of the Gibbs free energy of the reaction, ∆Gr. ∆Gr0 denotes the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction under standard state, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Thus, the most stable species in aqueous environment can be determined by minimizing (∆Gr + nF E) across all possible reactions for a given pH and E.The meta-stability of a cathode was evaluated by computing its Gibbs free energy dif-ference (∆Gpbx) with respect to the stable domains on Pourbaix diagram as a function of pH and potential (E).46,47 The focus of this work is on the potential range from -2 V to 2 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and the pH range from 0 to 14. Unless otherwise stated, the concentration of Na+ ion is set at 1M, and the concentrations of all other ions are set at 10−6 M, which are typical operating conditions for ASIBs. It should be noted that the number of non-H/O atoms are conserved in the phase transformations between cathodes and stable species in aqueous environment. Hence, ∆Gpbx is normalized by the total number of non-H/O atoms with units of eV/cation.
The sodium vacancy migration barriers were calculated using the climbing image nudged elas-tic band (CI-NEB) method.48,49 Here, the PBE functional without Hubbard U was adopted to avoid the possible mixing of the diﬀusion barrier with a charge transfer barrier.50 The force convergence criterion was 0.05 eV/˚A.
Our proposed screening workﬂow for ASIB cathodes given in Figure 2. For operation in aqueous environments, a cathode must satisfy the following criteria:
1.Suitable working potential within the H2 and O2 evolution potential range (e.g. 2.31 ∼ 3.53 V vs Na/Na+ in neutral solution). For practical energy densities, the average working potential in literature is typically higher than 3V vs Na/Na+ in neutral electrolyte (Table 1).2.High aqueous stability. Within the potential range of interest, a cathode with low ∆Gpbx and form solid phases in decomposition products on Pourbaix diagram tends to exhibit superior long-term cycling stability. Based on previous work by Singh et al. 47 on photoanodes, a ∆Gpbx < 0.5 eV/cation (ideally 0 eV/cation) indicates low reactivity in aqueous environments.
In addition to the above criteria, any cathode (for ASIBs or otherwise) must also be syn-thesizable and have relatively high Na+ diﬀusivity for high rate capability.50,51 The synthesiz-ability of a material is computationally estimated by its energy above the linear combinationof stable phases in the DFT calculated 0K phase diagram (Ehull).42 Stable phases have zero Ehull, and the higher its Ehull, the more unstable a phase is. A typical Ehull threshold of 30 - 50 meV/atom was used to identify synthesizable materials in previous high-throughput screening works.51,52 The potential for high ionic conductivity can be estimated by com-puting the Na ion migration barriers(Ea) for percolating Na diﬀusion pathways using NEB calculations. In conventional SIB cathodes, the predicted Ea values in facile Na+ diﬀusion pathways are generally less than 500 meV.53It should be noted that the criteria were established based purely on thermodynamic considerations; kinetic factors can contribute to stabilization of the materials in aqueous environments. For example, the electrochemical stability window of the aqueous electrolyte is usually slightly larger than 1.23 V due to overpotentials.54 Kinetic barriers (to ion diﬀusion for instance) may also retard cathode dissolution. While these kinetic factors are diﬃcult to directly compute, they can be accounted for by relaxation of the thermodynamic thresholds for screening purposes. Also, we only explore the aqueous stability of bulk cathodes in this work, while surface/interface eﬀects and particle size may have an inﬂuence on the electrochemical properties of cathodes in ASIBs. For example, nanostructured electrodes may exhibit better performance in terms of facile ion/electron transport, reduced changes of the electrodes and increased utilization of active materials during charge/discharge processes, but increased surface/interface area may also result in destabilization of the electrode in aqueous solutions.55,56We will ﬁrst benchmark the DFT computed working potentials and ∆Gpbx for the seven well-known ASIB cathodes in Table 1 (excluding the PBAs).
Figure 3(a) shows the calculated voltage proﬁle of NaxMnO2, which exhibits nine plateaus within the voltage range of 2 ∼ 3.3 V vs Na/Na+. The computed proﬁle and voltages are in good agreement with experimental observations.57 In neutral electrolyte (pH = 7), the cathode can be cycled within the potential range of 2.31 ∼ 3.53 V vs Na/Na+ (blue region) with a theoretical capacity of 100 mAh/g, while in a basic electrolyte (pH = 13.5)(orange region in Figure S2), the electrochemical window shifts to 1.91 ∼ 3.14 V vs Na/Na+ with asmaller theoretical capacity of 80 mAh/g.
Figure 3(b) shows the computed Pourbaix diagram of Na0.44MnO2, which plots the stable species in the Na-Mn-O-H system with a Na/Mn ratio of 0.44:1 under various pH and potential. In regions within the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes, Na forms Na+ ion in most regions. Mn is stable in alkaline environment at high potential (e.g. E > 0.17 V vs SHE at pH = 7) by forming manganese oxides while Mn2+ ion forms in acidic conditions (pH < 4) or low potential regions. It may be observed that the solid phase Na0.44MnO2 does not appear in any region on the Pourbaix diagram, which suggests that it is thermodynamically metastable in an aqueous reservoir. It should be noted, however, that Na0.44MnO2 is a stable phase (Ehull = 0) on the non-aqueous Na-Mn-O phase diagram.The aqueous stability of NaxMnO2 cathode during the cycling process was evaluated by computing ∆Gpbx as a function of potential in diﬀerent electrolytes (pH and Na concentra-tion). In a neutral electrolyte (Figure 4(a)), when being charged at high potential of 3.30 ∼ 3.50 V vs Na/Na+, Na+ ions and solid NaMn8O16 forms, and the ∆Gpbx of NaxMnO2 is less than 0.1 eV/cation. With Na+ intercalating into the host structure, solid Mn2O3 along with Na+ ions become more stable on Pourbaix diagram, and the ∆Gpbx of NaxMnO2 slightly increases. As the potential decreases to below 3.25 V vs Na/Na+, the ∆Gpbx dramat-ically increases and reaches 1.0 eV/cation at 2.31 V vs Na/Na+. In these potential regions, NaxMnO2 fully decomposes into Na+ and Mn2+.
In contrast, NaxMnO2 is predicted to be more stable in a basic electrolyte (Figure 4(b)), with relatively smaller ∆Gpbx (< 0.5 eV/cation) within 2.0 ∼ 3.14 V vs Na/Na+. Similarly, the small ∆Gpbx is coupled with the formation of all solid phases on Pourbaix diagram within the potential range of 2.81 ∼ 3.14 V vs Na/Na+. Na0.42MnO2 becomes stable within 2.81 ∼ 2.87 V vs Na/Na+ in aqueous electrolytes with ∆Gpbx = 0 eV/cation. In addition, ∆Gpbx starts to increase as solvated ion species become stable when potential is lower than 2.81 V vs Na/Na+.
The change of ∆Gpbx with potential can be related to the cycling stability of Na0.44MnO2 cathode observed in experiments.4–6 For example, in a neutral electrolyte (1M Na2SO4 with pH = 7), the capacity of a Na0.44MnO2/activated carbon cell shows no sign of decay after 1000 cycles when cycled within 3.35 ∼ 3.60 V vs Na/Na+, whereas, a signiﬁcant capacity fading was observed at lower potentials (< 3.35 V vs Na/Na+).4 Pang et al. 5 also observed a 88% retention of the initial cycling after 200 cycles within the potential range of 2.91 ∼3.41 V vs Na/Na+. In our calculations, the ∆Gpbx of NaxMnO2 at potential larger than 3.35 V vs Na/Na+ is lower than 0.1 eV/cation and solid phase NaMn8O16 forms in decomposition products. While the measured slightly lower cycling stability within lower potential ranges can be anticipated due to larger ∆Gpbx and the formation of all ion phases on Pourbaix diagram when E < 3.25 V vs Na/Na+. In a basic electrolyte (1 M Na2SO4 with pH = 13.5), a stable capacity of 32 mAh/g was achieved with no signiﬁcant capacity reduction after 400 cycles at 2C rate when cycled within 2.31 ∼ 2.91 V vs Na/Na+.6 The stable cycling stability in basic electrolytes is inline with the low computed ∆Gpbx (< 0.2 eV/cation) and the formation of solid phases in decomposition products in this voltage range.We also ﬁnd that in regions where Na+ ions are stable, increasing the concentration of Na+ ions slightly decreases the dissolution tendency of electrodes by ∼ 0.0591 log CNa+ eV/Na (Figure 4).
Figures 5(a) and (b) present the calculated voltage proﬁles of NaxV2(PO4)3 and NaxTiV(PO4)3, respectively. In all cases, the voltages are substantially underestimated relative to experi-mental values,13,14 similar to previous DFT results on the NASICON systems.50 While the use of the HSE and SCAN functional does substantially increase the voltage of the lower redox couples, they remain far below the experimental value. We therefore adopted the experimental redox potentials as electrochemical window of interest in the following aqueous stability analysis.Figures 6(a) and 7(a) show the calculated Pourbaix diagram of Na3V2(PO4)3 and ∆Gpbx at pH = 7, respectively. From Figure 6(a), V forms solid vanadium oxides in low voltage regimes (e.g. < 0 V vs SHE at pH = 7). With an increase in the external potential, V in higher oxidation states becomes more stable as VOn– ions. At pH = 7, ∆Gpbx increases with increase of potential and reaches 0.65 eV/cation at 3.37 V vs Na/Na+, (Figure 7(a)) which is equal to the experimental redox potential of V3+/V4+. Thus, the observed capacity fading of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in 1M Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte16 can be anticipated by the large ∆Gpbx and the decomposition into non-solid phases when cycled within 2.7 ∼ 3.6 V vs Na/Na+.
Compared with Na3V2(PO4)3, the introduction of Ti in Na2TiV(PO4)3 leads to the for-mation of TiO2 solid phases within the voltage range of 2.0 ∼ 3.8 V vs Na/Na+ on Pourbaix diagram (Figure 6(b)). In a neutral electrolyte, ∆Gpbx of Na2TiV(PO4)3 increases from 0.17 to 0.42 eV/cation as the potential is increased from 2.16 to 3.33 V vs Na/Na+. With contin-ued increase of potential, a biphasic reaction occurs from Na2TiV(PO4)3 to NaTiV(PO4)3.Then the ∆Gpbx reaches 0.5 eV/cation at 3.53 V vs Na/Na+. Unlike Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which exhibits severe capacity fading in ASIBs,16,28 Na2TiV(PO4)3 shows excellent cycling performance in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (pH = 7) with greater than 90% retention of its initial capacity after 500 cycles when cycled within 2.11 ∼ 3.51 V vs Na/Na+.14 Both the lower ∆Gpbx of NaxTiV(PO4)3 as well as the formation of solid TiO2 in the high potential region may contribute to suppression of V dissolution. Similar results were also observed for Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrodes (Figure S3), which exhibits stable electrochemical performance experimentally.15
Figures 8(a)-(c) present the calculated voltage proﬁle of three Fe-based cathode materials.Here, we consider the voltage proﬁle operating on the Fe2+/Fe3+ couple only; even though additional Na can potentially be removed from Na2FeP2O7 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) to access the Fe3+/Fe4+ couple, the voltages are far too high for ASIBs. All the three cathodes exhibits voltages within the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolyte (pH =7) related to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, and thus are able to deliver large capacities in ASIBs. Olivine-NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 have theoretical capacities of 154.2 mAh/g and 97.2 mAh/g, respectively, in aqueous electrolyte, which are in good agreement with the experimentally achieved capacities. Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 has a theoretical capacity of 129.0 mAh/g, but its ﬁnal voltage plateau lies close to the oxygen evolution potential and therefore may not be accessible experimentally.Figure 9(a) shows the Pourbaix diagram of olivine-NaFePO4 cathode. Within the elec-trochemical stability window of aqueous electrolyte, Fe forms solid Fe2O3 in most regions (e.g. E > -0.2 V vs SHE at pH = 7). In the low potential region (near the H2 gas evo-lution potential), Fe2+, Fe(OH)+ and solid Fe3O4 are stable in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. P forms HxPOyn– ions within the water splitting window in aqueous environment and does not aﬀect the formation of Fe and Na-based stable species on Pour-baix diagram. Similar observations can be made in the Pourbaix diagrams of Na2FeP2O7 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (Figures S4(a) and (b), respectively).All three cathodes exhibit low ∆Gpbx (≤ 0.32 eV/cation) in the range of their working potential and a solid phase of Fe2O3 forms in high potential regions (> 2.67 V vs Na/Na+) in a neutral electrolyte (Figure 10(a)-(c)). Both the olivine- NaFePO4 and Na2FeP2O7 cath-odes exhibit stable cycling behaviors in experiments.17,18 For Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, Fern´andez-Ropero et al. 19 detected a small component of dissolved Fe (0.1%) along with a thin layer of solid Fe3O4 after immersing the sample in 1M Na2SO4 solutions (pH = 6) for 72h. Fur-thermore, the oxidation of electrodes in aqueous solution was conﬁrmed by PXRD and ICP analysis after the stability tests and the authors ascribed its modest cycling stability to the oxidation and dissolution of electrode materials.
The screening workﬂow in Figure 2 was applied to well-known cathodes in the following chemistries:
1.Phosphates. Phosphate-based electrodes are known for their stable open frame-works and high working potential due to the strong covalent bonding and inductive eﬀect of the phosphate anion.51 The following compounds were selected: NASICON-Na3Me2(PO4)3 (Me = Fe, V),16,58 olivine-NaMePO4 (Me = Fe);17 pyrophosphate Na2MeP2O7 (Me = Mn, Fe, Co);18,59,60 mixed anion phosphates Na4Me3(PO4)2P2O7 (Me = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni);19,61 alluaudite Na2Me3(PO4)3 (Me = Fe);62 α- and β-NaVOPO4.63,642.Carbonophosphates. The sidorenkite Na3Me(CO3)(PO4) was ﬁrst proposed by Hau-tier et al. 65 from high-throughput calculation as potential cathode materials for Na-ion batteries. Among the predicted structures, Na3Mn(CO3)(PO4) and Na3Fe(CO3)(PO4) have been successfully synthesized and investigated as cathodes in Na ion batteries with high capacity.66,673.Sulphates. A new alluadite Na2Me2(SO4)3 (Me = Fe) was reported as an SIB cathode with high redox potential (3.8 V vs Na/Na+) and Na ion conductivity.684.Oxyﬂuorides. Oxyﬂuorides have the potential to enable cathodes with high working potential due to the highly electronegative ﬂuoride anion. The oxyﬂuorides investigated in this work include Pbcn - Na2MePO4F (Me = Fe, Co),69,70 P21/c - Na2MePO4F (Me = Mn),71 Pna21 - NaVPO4F72 and Na3(VOx)2(PO4)2F3–2x (x = 0, 1).73
Figure 11 summarizes the aqueous electrochemical properties of all compounds investigated. It may be observed that the average redox potential of Co and Ni-based phosphates are too high (> 3.94 V vs Na/Na+) to be used in ASIBs.Among the cathodes with average voltage within the electrochemical window of neutral aqueous electrolytes, the V-based cathodes generally exhibit high reactivity with water (high ∆Gpbx ≥ 0.5 eV/cation) and lack of solid decomposition products in aqueous solution, which suggests that they are intrinsically unstable in aqueous environments. This observation is in line with experimental observations.16 The Fe-based cathodes generally exhibit far better aqueous stability, though with somewhat lower average voltages. Na2FeP2O7, olivine-NaFePO4, Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 have already been studied as cathodes in ASIBs. NASICON- Na3Fe2(PO4)3 has been investigated as an anode in ASIBs with Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential at 2.5 V vs Na/Na+.74 Our results showed that it can be used as cathodes in ASIBs with the activated Fe3+/Fe4+ redox pair at a potential of ∼ 3.0 V vs Na/Na+.58 Na2FePO4F, which shows an average voltage at around 3.0 V vs Na/Na+ with theoretical capacity of 124.2 mAh/g,69 is a promising candidate for cathodes in ASIBs due to its high average workingpotential as well as high aqueous stability (∆Gpbx = 0.2 eV/cation at 3.0 V vs Na/Na+). The average voltages of alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3 and sidorenkite-Na3Fe(CO3)(PO4) are somewhat too low in neutral electrolytes, resulting in a signiﬁcant compromise in energy density in ASIBs. Nevertheless, they are potentially interesting cathodes in basic electrolytes when paired with appropriate lower-voltage anodes. Fe-based cathodes tend to form solid phases within 2.5 ∼ 3.53 V vs Na/Na+ in aqueous solution and most compounds with Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs are electrochemically active within this voltage range. Thus, looking for novel structures containing Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs may achieve new cathodes in ASIBs.In acidic aqueous electrolytes, several other cathodes - Na3MnCO3PO4, Na2MnPO4F, NaVOPO4 and Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F - are predicted to have average voltage below the increased O2 evolution potential. Na2Fe2(SO4)3 and the two V-containing cathodes - NaVOPO4 and Na3(VO)2(PO4)2F - exhibit high reactivity with water (similar to the other V containing cathodes) (See Figure S5(b)). Further, the the observed charge potential of Na2MnPO4F cathode in non-aqueous electrolyte is very high (∼ 3.8 V vs NaNa+), and the Pourbaix diagram analysis predicts that Na2MnPO4F is highly unstable in acidic solutions, making it less promising for ASIB applications (see Figure S3). Hence, only Na3MnCO3PO4, which has multiple voltage plateaus, has been selected for detailed analysis.
NASICON-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and Na2FePO4F. The calculated redox potential of the Fe3+/Fe4+ couple in NASICON-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is 4.2 ∼ 4.3 V vs Na/Na+. The experimental values were reported to be 3.0 ∼ 3.6 V vs Na/Na+ with a solid solution behavior,58 making part of the Fe3+/Fe4+ capacity accessible in aqueous electrolyte (Figure S7(a)). The low ∆Gpbx and solid Fe2O3 formed at potential E > 2.5 V vs Na/Na+ means that a stable capacity of ∼ 90 mAh/g should be achievable in neutral aqueous electrolytes (Figure S7(c)). A facile 1D diﬀusion mechanism with a barrier of 383 meV is observed from the CI-NEB calculations (Figure S8), suggesting high rate capability for Na3Fe2(PO4)3 cathode in ASIBs.Sharma et al. 75 have previously reported Na2FePO4F as a cathode in a 17 M NaClO4 “water-in-salt” electrolyte with a reversible capacity of 85 mAh/g and no signiﬁcant capacity loss after 100 cycles. While the highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte shows relatively high viscosity (5 mm2s−1), high cost and complex electrolyte/electrode interface phenomena,76 our results suggest that Na2FePO4F may also exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in standard low-cost, high diﬀusivity aqueous electrolytes (Figures S9-S10).
Na3FeCO3PO4 and Alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3. The calculated voltage proﬁle of Na3FeCO3PO4 (Figure S11(a)) shows one plateau at 2.66 V vs Na/Na+, which is in line with previous ex-perimental results67 in non-aqueous electrolytes. Na3FeCO3PO4 is predicted to be stable in basic solution with small ∆Gpbx (< 0.3 eV/cation). Similarly, alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3 ex-hibits three computed voltage plateaus at 3.24, 3.23 and 2.23 V vs Na/Na+(Figure S13(a)), while a solid-solution behavior was observed with an average working potential of 2.75 V vs Na/Na+.62 Here, we propose alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3 can be cycled within the potential range of 2.12 ∼ 3.35 V vs Na/Na+ in basic electrolyte with pH of 10.(Figure S13(c)) Both cathode candidates exhibit reasonable diﬀusion barriers of 400-500 meV.(Figure S12 and S14) An anode with low working potential should be coupled with these cathodes in basic solution to achieve a high energy density in ASIBs.Na3MnCO3PO4. Na3MnCO3PO4 was reported to exhibit a large charge/discharge po-tential gap in non-aqueous electrolyte.66 Our calculations (Figure S15(a)) indicate that Na3MnCO3PO4 have three voltage plateaus at 4.08, 3.80 and 3.04 V vs Na/Na+. WhileNa3MnCO3PO4 is predicted to be unstable in acidic aqueous solution within high potential regime (Figure S15(c)), the aqueous stability analysis ((Figure S15(d))) predicts that it is stable within the potential range of 2.39 ∼ 3.23 V vs Na/Na+ in a basic electrolyte (pH =12) with facile Na+ conductivity. (Figure S16)
All ﬁve cathodes are predicted to exhibit high aqueous stability across wide voltage ranges, and thus may have large accessible capacities in aqueous electrolytes. In particular, Na2FePO4F and Na2Fe3(PO4)3 cathodes are predicted to have theoretical capacities of 124 mAh g−1 and 110 mAh g−1 in aqueous solution, respectively, which outperform most of the known ASIBs cathodes in the literature (see Table 1). Also, the excellent electrochemical properties of the two promising sidorenkites, Na3FeCO3PO4 and Na3MnCO3PO4, show that the easily synthesizable, low cost carbonophosphates family are a potential new class of forASIB cathodes.
To conclude, we have performed a comprehensive investigation of the working potential and aqueous stability of well-established ASIB cathodes using DFT calculations. A set of rigor-ous design rules and a screening workﬂow to identify potentially promising ASIB cathodes were developed. By applying this screening workﬂow to a large database of known Na-ion battery cathode materials, ﬁve promising cathode materials - Na3Fe2(PO4)3, Na2FePO4F, Na3MnCO3PO4, Na3FeCO3PO4 and alluadite-Na2Fe3(PO4)3 were identiﬁed that exhibit high voltage, good capacity, high stability in aqueous environments and facile Na-ion migration. These ﬁndings pave the way the practical cathode development for large-scale energy-storage systems based on aqueous Na-ion chemistry.
