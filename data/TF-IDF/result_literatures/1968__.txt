The thick type sensor having Pt/Na super ionic conductor(NASICON) Pt/Na2SO4/Pt catalyst system for SO2 gas sensing was fabricated by screen printing method. The phases of NASICON with the variation of sintering temperature (1050 0), 1150 0), 1250 0)) and sintering time (1.5hr, 2.5hr, 3.5hr) were investigated by XRD. The variation of electromotive force of the sensor with SO2 concentration and operation temperature were also investigated. 
The major phase of NASICON film sintered at 1150 0) for 3.5hr was sodium zirconium silicon phosphate (Na3Zr2Si2PO12). The Nernest's slope of NASICON sensor for SO2 gas with the variation of concentration from 10 to 100 ppm was 176.12 mV/decade at the operating temperature of 500 0). The increase of oxygen partial pressure was not affected to the variation of Nernst's slope.  Introduction  The instrumentation for SO2 gas sensing by physical or chemical method is very expensive. And it is impossible to measure SO2 gas concentration continuously. In order to solve these problems, several sensor materials such as alkali metal sulfuric salt,  alumina, stabilized zirconia, NASICON have been investigated. [1-4] Among these materials NASICON which have Na1+xZr2SiP3-xPO12 (0 £ x £ 3) compositional range has high ionic conductivity (10-1-10-5S/cm) so that it can be used in solid electrolyte and ionic exchanger. Recently NASICON is studied actively to apply electrochemical sensor.[5-8] 
But the present NASICON gas sensor is bulk ceramic type which has higher cell resistance than that of thin or thick film. And it takes long time to synthesize single NASICON phase. The local compositional change and the formation of second phase such as free zirconia and zircon are present during sintering process due to the volatilization of P and Na. It hinders the electrochemical properties of NASICON. In order to overcome low ionic conductivity of ceramic bulk type NASICON sensor, thin film process like sol-gel process[10,11], sputtering[12] and pulse laser deposition method[13] were introduced to fabricate NASICON film. But these process have high value of porosity and also have problems of composition control due to the volatilization of P and Na. In this paper NASICON thick film was fabricated by screen printing method in order to overcome relatively high resistance and  high sintering temperature which give rise to volatilization of  P and  Na and high  porosity. 
To find optimum heat-treatment condition of screen printed NASICON thick film, the variation of phase with sintering time and temperature was investigated.  And Pt/NASICON/Pt/Na2SO4/Pt structured sensor was fabricated for the investigation of SO2 sensing behavior.  
In order to fabricate NASICON sensor, Na2CO3(Shinyo pure chem.), ZrO2(Junsei), SiO2 (Junsei) and NH4H2PO4(Sigma) powders were employed. After mixing, the mixture was sintered at 600  for 5hr. The sintered powder was mixed with ethanol and wet milled for 24hr with zirconia ball. The milled slurry was dried at 80 and grinded. To increase binding force between powders the binder ethyl cellulose the organic solvent was mixed to make paste. After screen printing with NASICON paste, to remove retained humidity and organic solvent NASICON film was continuously heat treated at various temperatures and times (120  10 min, 130  24hr, 350  10min), and then sintered at 1150  for 3.5hr.  In order to investigate the crystal phases of NASICON with the sintering temperatures and times, the NASICON film was sintered at 1050  for 1.5hr, 1150  for 2.5hr, 1250  for 3.5hr, respectively.

Properties of NASICON thick film  The XRD patterns of NASICON thick film with various sintering temperatures for 3.5hr are shown in Fig.2. In Fig.2 (a) have strong ZrO2 peak and weak NASICON peak due to the low sintering temperature. It seemed that sintering temperature was not enough to dissolve ZrO2 phase. In Fig.2 (b) ZrO2 phase peaks were disappeared and all peaks represents NASICON phase. It seemed that ZrO2 phase dissolved into matrix phase and formed NASICON phase with increased sintering temperature of 1150 0). In Fig.2 (c) NASICON phase peaks are disappeared and ZrO2 and ZrSiO4 peaks are appeared. ZrO2 and ZrSiO4 phases are second phases formed by the volatilization of Na and P. The formation of second phases means that the sintering temperature of 1250 0) was so high that N and P are volatilized. Fig.3 shows the XRD patterns of NASICON sensor with the variations of sintering time at 1150 0). 
With increasing sintering time from 1.5hr to 3.5hr ZrO2 phase gradually disappeared and over 3.5hr only NASICON phase could be observed.
