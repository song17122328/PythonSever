Na4MnV(PO4)3 is a sodium ion conducting material with a NASICON type crystal structure. This phase is not much known as an electrode material. The present work focuses on the sodium ion intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism and charge/discharge behavior of the material. The Na4MnV(PO4)3 is synthesized through a sol-gel process and characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS. The structural analysis confirms the formation of a phase pure crystalline material with nanometric particle size which adopts a trigonal crystal structure. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements indicate that Na4MnV(PO4)3 is electrochemically active having slanting voltage plateaus. Ex-situ and In-situ XRD analysis, as a function of sodium concentration, indicate that the intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium is associated with a single-phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V. The electrochemical measurements on composite electrodes, Na4MnV(PO4)3/CNTS (1 & 3 wt.%), show promising charge/discharge capacity (∼140 mAh/g), good cyclability (100% capacity retention after 40 cycles) and reasonable rate capability. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicate that the main contributions towards the activity of Na4MnV(PO4)3 can be attributed to the active of Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+ redox couple with partial activity of V4+/V5+. The obtained results suggest that Na4MnV(PO4)3 is a promising electrode material which can be achieved better rate performance with long cycling stability and battery performance through engineering of the particle morphology and microstructure.

Lithium-ion battery (LIB) technologies have become an essential part of our society. It provides great option to be stored electrical energy for a wide range of applications[1,2]. Due to the growing demand for safer and long-lasting batteries, last 10 years, a huge amount of research funds was allocated to develop lithium-ion batteries. The LIB market is no longer limited to portable consumer electronics[1,[3], [4], [5]]. Taking into consideration the long-term impact on climate change, it has widely been agreed that mass production of electric vehicles (EVs) is required besides the implementation of renewable energies such as wind and solar power coupled with large-scale stationary grid-level energy storage[[6], [7], [8], [9]]. This is expected to put tremendous pressure on resources and supply chains of lithium as well as price concerns in near future[9,10]. To date, research on sodium-ion batteries has been started to gain more interest, motivated by the large abundance of sodium. It is also hoped to produce batteries that would be cheap in comparison to LIBs and less prone to resource issues and safety concerns. Moreover, sodium shows similar electrochemical principles to Li which makes it as a promising alternative to lithium ion batteries[[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]].

However, due to the larger ionic radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) as compared to Li+ (0.76 Å), sodium ion batteries (SIBs) show sluggish kinetics during Na+ insertion/de-insertion into the host electrode material affecting its performance (crystal structural, capacity and cycling stability) [13,14]. Therefore, great efforts are being carried out to develop new cathode materials for SIBs with robust and flexible crystal structures which can accommodate large Na+ ion during insertion and de-insertion[11,13]. To date, a large number of phosphate-based materials such as NaFePO4, Na3V2(PO4)3, Na2FeP2O7, NaVP2O7, Na2(VO)P2O7, Na2FePO4F, Na3V2O2x(PO4)2F3-2x, Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7), Na0.7Fe0.7Mn0.3O2 have been extensively studied [10,13,14,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]] due to their variable features of crystal structures, good thermal stability, enhanced safety, relatively high energy density and low cost. NASICON based cathode materials with general formula NaxM2(PO4)3 are considered one of the most promising candidates for sodium ion batteries electrode material due to its large tunnel structure which can accommodate Na+ ion during insertion/de-insertion enabling faster and easier Na+ ion migration into/from the host structure [11,[27], [28], [29]]. Amongst NASICON based materials, Na3V2(PO4)3 shows one of the best performance cathode materials for SIBs with a reversible discharge capacity of around 100 mAh g−1 with a flat voltage plateau of 3.3–3.4 V associated with V4+/V3+ redox couple [13,20,27,[30], [31], [32], [33]]. Although Na3V2(PO4)3 shows better performance as cathode material for SIBs, there is still a need to improve its performance in terms of rate capability, capacity, thermal stability, and cost. One possibility is to partially substitute of vanadium (V) with other available transition metals such as manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) which can help to improve the electrochemical performance, especially at a high charge/discharge rate [28,30,31]. In addition, vanadium is an expensive component, partially substitution by cheaper transition metals such as “Mn”, could help to reduce the cost of the material[30]. Another advantage is, due to global charge neutralization while doping “Mn” into the Na3V2(PO4)3, added accessible Na+ in the structure leading to enhanced capacity.

Paying attention to the above-mentioned key points, Na4MnV(PO4)3 was developed by Goodenough et al. where they reported the structural, electrochemical and ex-situ XRD during sodiation and de-sodiation process [28]. It has been reported that the sodium intercalation/de-intercalation into/from the host structure is associated with two phase reaction. To explore more, we attempted to further investigate the electrochemical behavior, particularly, the sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism in Na4MnV(PO4)3 using ex-situ and in-situ XRD techniques as a function sodium concentration by setting the cutoff voltage between 1.5 and 4.5 V. Phase pure nanosized Na4MnV(PO4)3 has been synthesized by sol-gel process and its structural, electrochemical performance is evaluated at room temperature. The Ex-situ and In-situ XRD analysis confirm that sodium ion intercalation/de-intercalation is accompanied by a single phase mechanism when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V as reported in a recent publication[34] rather than a bi-phasic reaction as reported by Zhou et al. where they cycled the cells between 2.0 and 3.75 V [28]. This indicates that the difference in intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism of sodium into/from the host structure is sensitive to the cycling conditions (cutoff voltage)[34]. In addition, the electrochemical performances of the materials measured on the composite electrode, Na4MnV(PO4)3/CNTS (1 & 3 wt.% MWCNTs), show promising charge/discharge capacity, good cyclability, and reasonable rate capability. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses indicate that the main contributions towards the activity of Na4MnV(PO4)3 can be attributed to the active of Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+ redox couple with partial activity of V4+/V5+. The obtained results suggest that Na4MnV(PO4)3 can be used as a promising electrode material for SIBs. We believe that the data resulted from the present investigations will help to understand the charge/discharge behavior, structural modifications of Na4MnV(PO4)3 during intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium and further optimization of particle morphology and microstructure for better electrochemical performances.

Na4MnV(PO4)3 was synthesized by sol-gel process using stoichiometric amounts of sodium acetate, manganese acetate, ammonium vanadate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate in the molar ratio 4:1:1:3 respectively. All the precursors were dissolved in distilled water in the presence of ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. The temperature was set to 50 °C and all the precursors were allowed to mix for around 2 h. Later the temperature was increased to 70 °C and the resultant solution was evaporated until a transparent gel was obtained. The resulting gel was dried in an oven at 100 °C and then heat-treated at 650 °C in an argon atmosphere for 8 h to get phase pure Na4MnV(PO4)3. The Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% CNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt. % CNTs were synthesized by addition of CNTs to the precursor solution while mixing at 50 °C. All other synthesis parameters were kept same as for Na4MnV(PO4)3 during the subsequent treatments.

The powder-XRD measurements were performed to check the purity of synthesized materials. The data was collected at room temperature over the 2θ− angular range of 10°≤2 ≤ 90° with a step size of 0.01° using a PANanlytical diffractometer operating with the Cu-Kα radiation (Empyrean) operating with the Cu-Kα radiation (Empyrean). To have more insight to the structure, the Rietveld refinement was performed using the Jana 2006 program package[35]. The background was estimated by a Legendre function, and the peak shapes were described by a pseudo-Voigt function. The refinement of peak asymmetry was performed using four Berar-Baldinozzi parameters.

The particle morphology was investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nova). In order to investigate the oxidation states of transition metals (Mn & V) in the pristine and de-sodiated materials, the particle surface was investigated with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) (Thermo-Scientific-Sigma Probe). The structural changes in Na4MnV(PO4)3 during intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium was investigated through ex-situ and in-situ XRD analysis. The ex-situ analysis was performed using the above mentioned PANanlytical diffractometer operating with the Cu-Kα radiation (Empyrean). The in situ XRD experiments were carried out using an electrochemical cell, equipped with a Be window as a current collector, operating in reflection geometry. Each scan was collected in 0.021 increments between 25□ and 54□ at a scanning speed of 0.018466□ s−1. The active material was prepared by mixing Na4MnV(PO4)3 with carbon (ketjen Black EC-600JD, Akzo nobel) in a ratio of 80: 20. About 25 mg of this mixture was placed in the cell against the Be window acting as a cathode, a Whatman GF/D borosilicate glass fiber sheet separator was impregnated with 1.0 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6, Sigma-Aldrich) in the ethylene carbonate (EC, Acros):DMC (1: 1 by volume) liquid electrolyte and high purity Na metal (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an anode. The cell was galvanostatically cycled at a rate of C/20 using a SP200 Biologic potentiostat. Le Bail refinements were carried out with the FullProf program.

For the electrochemical investigations, 75 wt. % active material, 17 wt. % acetylene black (conductive carbon) and 8 wt. % polyvinylidene fluoride (binder) were mixed in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry. The prepared slurry was then cast on aluminum foil using doctor blade and dried in an oven at 120 °C for overnight to remove NMP and traces of moisture. The electrodes were cut into a circular disk of 14 mm diameter having thickness of around 30 μm. Electrochemical measurements were performed using CR2023 type coin cells assembled in an Ar-filled glove box. Metallic sodium was used as a negative electrode and 1 M NaPF6 solution in 1:1 ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate was used as an electrolyte. Electrochemical properties were evaluated by galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and galvanostatic charge/discharge technique in the voltage window of 1.5–4.5 V (vs. Na/Na+) at room temperature using a battery cycler (WonA Tech, WBCS 3000, Korea). The quasi-open-circuit potential (QOCP) measurements were undertaken at C/20 rate with the intermittent charge-discharge mode (1 C: each charge/discharge takes 1 h), 2 h of relaxation time was applied after each 1 h charge/discharge step. The cycling performance was evaluated by galvanostatic measurement technique at a C/20 rate in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V.

Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD spectra of pristine (as synthesized) Na4MnV(PO4)3, and composites (Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs) and (Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNT). It can be clearly seen that all the synthesized materials are phase pure and crystallized without any impurity content. The crystal structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3 was also solved by using the structure of Na4Zr2(SiO4)3 as a starting structural model [36]. A statistical disorder of Mn/V has been implemented and constraints on their occupancies and atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) were introduced. The structure of Na4MnV(PO4)3 can be described as a covalent skeleton [MnVP3O12] built of Mn/VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, which form 3D interconnected channels with two types of interstitial positions where sodium ions are distributed as shown in Fig. 1(b).

Fig. 1(c) shows a Rietveld refinement of pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 which shows good agreement between the experimental and calculated patterns. The refined lattice parameters and other crystallographic information of pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 is tabulated in Table 1. It is noticed that Na4MnV(PO4)3 compound crystallizes with the NASICON-type structure and the refined lattice parameters are similar to those reported recently [28].

Fig. 2(a–c) shows the SEM micrographs of pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 and composites materials Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs respectively. It can be seen that the all synthesized materials are composed of homogeneously distributed nanoparticles having primary particle size less than 200 nm. For Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs wire network of MWNCNTs is also clearly visible which is expected to be enhanced the electronic conductivity at the electrode. The MWCNTs networks connect particles together and provide the electron conductivity percolating network to enhance electrochemical performance especially during fast intercalation and de-intercalation of Na+ into/from the host structure. This aspect is of great interest as the pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 suffers from poor electronic conductivity. Fig. 2(d–f) shows the elemental mapping images of Na4MnV(PO4)3 which clearly shows the homogeneous distribution of manganese, vanadium and carbon throughout the material. The elemental distribution for Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs are show in the Supplementary Fig. S-1 which also shows well homogenous distribution of manganese, vanadium and carbon throughout the materials. Furthermore, Supplementary Fig. S–2(a-c) shows the EDX patterns for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs which clearly shows that there is no impurity element present in the synthesized materials.

The electrochemical performance of the synthesized materials was extensively studied to understand the charge/discharge behavior and associated intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism of sodium in Na4MnV(PO4)3 when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V. Fig. 3(a) shows the Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) of pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 for the first five cycles conducted at a scan rate of 0.05 mVs−1. Three oxidation peaks can be noticed in first cycle as shows in the inset of Fig. 3(a) at around 3.4, 3.6 and 3.85 V while only single broad peak is present during reduction. The two oxidation peaks at around 3.4 and 3.6 V corresponds to V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples respectively. The small peak at around 3.85 V represents the partial oxidation of V4+/V5+ during charging[[37], [38], [39], [40]]. The behavior of CV after the first cycle looks quite different where only a single broad peak was seen at around 3.56 V during oxidation with shoulders extending from 3.25 V to 4.2 V while a single peak at 3.3 V during reduction with shoulders extending to 2.75 V–3.7 V. These broad peaks basically correspond to V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+ and V4+/V5+ redox couples submerged under a single broad peak. Also, the redox potentials for V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+ are very near to each and the intercalation and de-intercalation is accompanied by single-phase mechanism, therefore they are presented by a single peak during oxidation and reduction. Such type of CV profile indicates the single-phase reaction phenomenon during the intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from the host structure.

To get a deeper insight into electrochemical reactions of Na4MnV(PO4)3, galvanostatic intermittent titration (GITT) measurements was conducted at C/20 rate during the first cycle as shown in Fig. 3(b). It can be clearly seen from the GITT plot that the material shows a slanting voltage plateau, indicative of a single-phase reaction. During initial charging the polarization is almost negligible up to 3.75 V confirming the activity of both V3+/V4+ and Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples and an efficient intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from the host structure. However, further increase in the voltage results in an increase of polarization in GITT curve indicative of sluggish intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium which can either be associated to the impact of diffusion of sodium ion or interfacial kinetics due to the partial oxidation of V4+/V5+ redox couple. A similar mechanism is noticed during the discharge process. The slanting charging/discharging curves of Na4MnV(PO4)3 indicates that intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from the host structure is governed by a single-phase reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. The above mentioned GITT findings are in agreement with our CV analysis.

To further investigate Na4MnV(PO4)3, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was undertaken on the pristine material and after first charged the cell up to 4.5 V. Fig. 4 clearly reveals the presence of V3+ in the pristine electrode whereas the manganese is only present in Mn2+. After charging up to 4.5 V, it was found that a mixture of V4+ and V5+ was present which is consistent with the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic data shown in Fig. 3. The peak shifting towards the higher binding energy from 516.7 eV to 516.9 eV and 517.74 eV and peak splitting during charging indicates the oxidation of V3+ to V4+ and V5+. On the other hand, Mn2+ oxidized to Mn3+ during charging up to 4.5 V. Similarly, the peaks shifting toward higher binding energy from 641.25 to 642.77 eV indicates the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ during charging [28,41]. This confirms the activation of Mn2+/Mn3+, V3+/V4+ and partial activation of V4+/V5+ redox couples in Na4MnV(PO4)3 during the first charge cycle as clearly evident from cyclic voltammetry curve in Fig. 3. Supplementary Fig. S–3 shows the XPS survey patterns of Na4MnV(PO4)3 of pristine electrode and in fully charged state (4.5 V).

The structural variation during intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from the host structure was studied through ex-situ XRD analysis and the results are summarized in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen that during charging up to 4.5 V, no additional peak (s) is introduced, but only small peak shifting is observed towards a higher 2 value which confirms the contraction of the unit cell. Similarly, upon discharging to 2.0 V, the original pattern of the pristine material is retraced confirming the reversible nature of the process. The ex-situ analysis confirms that the intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from Na4MnV(PO4)3 is proceeding through a single-phase reaction rather than a bi-phasic reaction when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V. This behavior is consistent with many other reported materials[[42], [43], [44], [45], [46]].

In order to further confirm the sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism into/from the host structure, the in-situ XRD analysis was conducted as shown in Fig. 6 during charge/discharge process. The right part of Fig. 6(a) presents the voltage vs. time curve while the left part displays a 2D plot of the diffraction patterns recorded during the electrochemical testing. During charging process, only peak shifting is noticed (Fig. 6(a)) without the formation of any new phase indicating single-phase mode of de-insertion in Na4MnV(PO4)3 when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V. Furthermore, the peaks are shifted towards higher 2 values indicating contraction of the unit cell. Similarly, upon discharging, the peaks are shifted towards smaller 2 values indicating expansion of the unit cell due to intercalation of sodium into the host structure. A complete original pattern is retrieved at 1.5 V indicating the reversible nature of the intercalation process. The in-situ analysis clearly confirms that during charging/discharging process, the sodium interaction/de-intercalation in Na4MnV(PO4)3 occurs through a reversible single-phase when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V.

The evolution of the cell parameters for the sodium-rich phase, obtained from cyclic refinements of each XRD pattern of the first cycle (Charge-Discharge), is displayed in Fig. 6(b). The cell parameters have been refined in all patterns together with profile parameters and background parameters. The values between the end of charge and beginning of discharge are in accordance with previously reported values for ex-situ refinements[28].

As was observed from analysis of the 2D plot of Fig. 6(a), the solid solution mechanism can be clearly identified in Fig. 6(b) by the linear decrease of the unit cell parameters a and c at the beginning of charge in accordance with Vegard's empirical law. The evolution of the cell parameters begins decreasing linearly indicating a drastic shrinking of the unit cell with the voltage increase. Upon discharge, the cell parameters also evolve quite symmetrically to the end of charge, increasing linearly. These findings clearly confirm the solid solution formation and single-phase mode of sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism in Na4MnV(PO4)3 when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V.

Fig. 7 (a) shows the rate capability data for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs at different C-rates. All the samples show almost the same initial discharge capacity of around 140 mAh g−1 at C/20. It should be noted that the discharge capacity for pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 continuously decreases with increasing number of cycles, whereas Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs show stable capacity at different C-rates. There is a rapid capacity loss for pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 at higher C-rate whereas Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNT shows better discharge capacity retention at high C-rate. Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs shows the best rate capability amongst all samples which shows a discharge capacity of around 67 and 47 mAh g−1 at 1C and 2C respectively. The addition of MWCNTs is not only expected to enhance the electrical conductivity of the composite electrode, but also stabilizes the material's surface and prevented agglomeration which helps to retain its capacity during successive cycling. After cycling the cells at different C-rates, the same cells were again re-cycled at C/20. Pristine Na4MnV(PO4)3 couldn't fully retain its initial discharge capacity whereas Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs retained their initial discharge capacity. The main reason for the irreversibility of Na4MnV(PO4)3 may be formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) which may consume some sodium during cycling. Fig. 7(b–d) shows the galvanostatic discharge curves for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs. It can be noticed that rate performance of Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs is superior as compared to Na4MnV(PO4)3. The addition of MWCNTs improves the initial discharge and capacity and its retention at high C rates. This improved performance is mainly due to improvement in electronic conductivity of composite electrodes due to addition of MWCNTs[[47], [48], [49]].

Fig. 8(a) shows the cycling data and coulombic efficiency for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs at C/20 for 40 cycles. All the samples deliver the same initial discharge capacity of around 140 mAh g−1. There is rapid capacity fade for Na4MnV(PO4)3 with a capacity retention of only 68.17% after 40 cycles as shown in insert in Fig. 8(a). This rapid capacity fading may be due to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer or agglomeration and degradation of material. On the other hand, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs shows stable capacity for 40 cycles without any significant decrease in the discharge capacity. Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs retains 99.10% and 98% of its initial discharge capacity after 40 cycles respectively. The columbic efficiency for all the material lies is around 91% in the first cycle which increased slowly to 95% for Na4MnV(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% respectively. the coulombic efficiency for Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% is around 96% after 40th cycle. These results suggest that the addition of MWCNTs greatly improved the capacity retention of Na4MnV(PO4)3.

Fig. 8(b) shows the charge/discharge curves for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs & Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs after 10th and 30th cycles at C/20. It can be clearly seen that Na4MnV(PO4)3 shows a capacity fade while going from 10th to 30th cycle. The average operating voltages also decrease with cycling. On the other hand, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs & Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs shows almost same discharge capacity after 10th and 30th cycle without any drop in average operating voltage. Supplementary Fig. S–4 shows the charge/discharge curves for Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs & Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs for the 1st and 40th cycle. All the samples show almost same initial discharge capacity of around 140 mAh g−1. Na4MnV(PO4)3 show more polarization as compared with composite Na4MnV(PO4)3/MWCNTs (1 & 3 wt.%) materials. It can be clearly seen that there is almost no visible change in the discharge capacity for Na4MnV(PO4)3/MWCNTs (1 & 3 wt.%) in contrast to Na4MnV(PO4)3 where a huge capacity fade is observed.

Phase pure and well crystalline Na4MnV(PO4)3, Na4MnV(PO4)3/1 wt.% MWCNTs and Na4MnV(PO4)3/3 wt.% MWCNTs cathodes have been synthesized by a sol-gel process. The Na4MnV(PO4)3/MWCNT (1 & 3 wt. %) composites electrode exhibits better electrochemical performance than the Na4MnV(PO4)3 in terms of cyclability and capacity retention. The V3+/V4+, Mn2+/Mn3+ redox couples are mainly contributing to the electrochemical activity of Na4MnV(PO4)3 although a partial activity of V4+/V5+ redox couple was also noticed. The present investigation confirms that the intercalation/de-intercalation of sodium into/from Na4MnV(PO4)3 is associated with a single-phase reaction rather than a biphasic reaction when cycled between 1.5 and 4.5 V. This single-phase solid solution behavior is beneficial for better electrochemical performances. Nonetheless, the obtained results reveal that Na4MnV(PO4)3 can be used as an electrode material through engineering the particle morphology and microstructure.
