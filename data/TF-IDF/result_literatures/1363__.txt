The development rate of energy storage materials has signiﬁcantly increased over the last decade. Nowadays requirements for materials become more rigid, in particular with compacting, charge/discharge rate, speciﬁc capacity, power and safety [1]. Metal oxides and polyanion-based compounds, e.g. phosphates of polyvalent elements, are the most popular materials for the fabrication of positive electrodes for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries [2]. Phosphates of polyvalent elements are considered to be safe, cheap, and possess high ionic conduction [3]. Phosphates with Nasicon structure can be considered to be promising materials due to high ionic conductivity and ability of reversible lithium intercalation [4,5].

The Nasicon structure consists of PO4-tetrahedra and MO6octahedra linked by shared oxygen atoms. Different varieties of mutual arrangement of structural polyhedra causes great polymorphism and phase transitions; however it depends on deﬁnite structural-forming cation which one deals with [6,7]. There are two types of position for lithium localization that can be distinguished: M1 positions, surrounded by six oxygen atoms; and M2 positions, surrounded by eight oxygen atoms [8]. Hence, a system of three dimensional channels arises, where lithium transport realizes by alternating of positions M1 and M2.

solid electrolytes modiﬁcation affects on the second multiplier in the expression σ i ¼ niμi; where σi is conductivity, ni is concentration of charge carriers, and μi is their mobility. On the other hand charge carriers concentration ni can be changed by aliovalent doping approach and thus creating point defects—lithium vacancies or interstitial ions for charge compensation. We have observed a diffuse phase transition from triclinic to rhombohedral phase in LiZr2(PO4)3 and in corresponding aliovalent doped materials, and it is notable that the phase transition temperature range has been shifted to lower temperatures upon increased doping cation concentration [10]. Doping of LiZr2(PO4)3 by pentavalent Nb5+ cations resulted in the conductivity increase in a low-temperature range due to formation of additional amount of vacancies [11]. The reversible phase transition triclinic→rhombohedral in LiZr2(PO4)3 on heating occurs due to increasing of lithium mobility in M1 and M2 positions.

At the same time there is no information on phase transitions in related LiTi2(PO4)3, which already has R-3c rhombohedral structure at room temperature. Three stages for lithium motion can be deduced by means of 7Li NMR and impedance spectroscopy facilities [12]. Below 250 K all lithium cations are located in M1 positions. Between 250 and 400 K Li motions display some correlations. Above 400 K extended non-correlated motions are achieved.

Improvements of conductive features of LiTi2(PO4)3 by means of aliovalent doping by trivalent cations Al3+, Fe3+, Ga3+ etc. are well known [13,14]. According to Best and Forsyth [15,16] there is no evidence of an enhancement of conductivity upon substitution of V or Nb in Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 − x(ZO4)x (Z=V,Nb). It has been shown

with 27Al NMR that addition of aluminum to LiTi2(PO4)3 results in some tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum in contrast to the expected octahedral substitution. In this respect, there is open issue about Nb state in LiTi2(PO4)3 and its inﬂuence on the lithium transport.

Thus, synthesis and investigation of ion mobility in LiTi2(PO4)3 impedance and Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 were undertaken using XRD, spectroscopy, DSC, and 7Li, 93Nb NMR facilities.

All considered materials were obtained by the solid state method (ﬁnal temperature 1270 K) which is described in detail in Ref. [17]. Starting compounds were (NH4)2HPO4, TiO2⋅H2O, Li2CO3, Nb2O5.

X-ray powder diffraction experiments were carried out using Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer, CuKα radiation, θ/2θ geometry and with a diffracted beam curved monochromator. Patterns were collected in 10–110° 2θ range, step 0.02° and step time of 5 s. Low temperature XRD experiments were carried out on Siemens D500 diffractometer equipped with the cryostat RTI production (individual project), CuKα radiation. The full proﬁle analysis and Rietveld reﬁnements were carried out by the Fullprof computer package [18]. Pseudo-Voight function, represented by a convolution of Lorentz and Gauss components, was used for proﬁle ﬁtting; the background was modeled by Chebyshev 6-coefﬁcient polynomial. LiTi2(PO4)3 structure (ICSD number 95979) was used in kind of the structural model for Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3. Rietveld reﬁnement of Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 was carried out in a way based on the assumption of statistical ordering of Nb on Ti positions (s.g. R-3c (167), Wickoff position 12 c, s.o.f.=0.333). s.o.f. values were ﬁxed 0.3 and 0.033 for Ti1 and Nb1 atoms respectively. s.o.f. of Li1 was settled as 0.149 according to stoichiometry and speciality of 6 b position. All other occupancy factors (s.o.f.) were ﬁxed according to the symmetry of Wyckoff positions.

Ionic conductivity measurements were carried out with the IPU-62 alternating current bridge in frequency range 10 Hz–2 MHz on pressed cylindrical pellets (d=5 mm, h=2 mm) with cylinder bases coated by platinum. Density values are 2.6 and 2.7 g/cm3 for LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 respectively, which are 87% and 90% from theoretical ones respectively. In fact, such a density problem takes place for these phosphates. Nevertheless density ratios have more or less similar values; thus it is correct to compare relative conductivities in order to reveal principal consistency. Conductivity values were calculated by extrapolation of a semicircle on the ReZ axis. NMR 7Li spectra were obtained on Tesla BS-567A spectrometer at a frequency of 34 MHz in the temperature range 80–320 K. NMR 93Nb spectra were collected on Bruker MSL-300 spectrometer at 73.46 MHz. The chemical shift was determined by using of NbCl5 solution in acetonitrile. Thermic behavior of samples was examined using Mettler TA 4000 calorimeter in the temperature range 120–500 K.

Investigated materials crystallize in rhombohedral modiﬁcation, s.g. R-3c (167), Z=6. X-ray diffraction pattern of Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 is shown on Fig. 1. The observed intensity data are depicted by dots while the solid line overlying them is the calculated intensity. Vertical markers below the diffraction pattern indicate positions of Bragg reﬂections. Differences between the observed and calculated intensities are plotted at the bottom using the same scale. The sample has insigniﬁcant amount of NbOPO4 impurity.

The substitution of Ti4+ by Nb5+ gives rise to the increase of lattice constants. The c parameter has signiﬁcantly increased as compared with a, which perhaps is associated with a stronger repulsion of oxygen atoms along the c axis in comparison to the initial LiTi2(PO4)3 (Table 1). Such repulsion is caused by vacancy formation in M1 positions in Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 for charge compensation.

It is impossible to localize lithium in a structure because of its poor X-ray scattering ability. Moreover, it is well known that Li+ ions are disordered between M1 and M2 positions in Nasicon structure [19]. Nevertheless, relatively more scattering environment of M1 position can be observed, which is settled in the origin of coordinates (Fig. 2). Atomic fraction coordinates and interatomic distances are presented in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. Aliovalent doping increases bLi1―O> average distance up to 2.309(3)Å in comparison with 2.274(3)Å for initial LiTi2(PO4)3 (Table 3). However, it should be noticed that 2.274(3)Å distance for initial LiTi2(PO4)3 essentially exceeds typical one 2.12 Å for octahedral Li+ environment in the most of well-known crystallographic objects [20]. That issue was considered by Catti et al. using high resolution precision neutron diffraction facilities in rhombohedral LiZr2(PO4)3 [19]. In particular it has been shown Li1 positions are shifted along z axis. Nevertheless, comparing average distances of initial and doped structures, one can suggest aliovalent doping causes increasing of an average distance bLi1―O>. This factor is favorable for ionic transport in structure.

NMR 7Li spectra at various temperatures of LiTi2(PO4)3 consist of strong central line and two satellites (Fig. 3), which are typical for systems with 7Li spin=3/2. Quadrupole splitting constant CQ is proportional to the distance between two satellites on spectra. It is clear that CQ increases upon heating since growth of M2 positions occupancy, in which CQ is higher than in M1 [21]. In addition it can be noticed that there is central line narrowing due to growth of lithium mobility upon heating. NMR 7Li spectra were used for the estimation of lithium mobility in investigated materials in terms of central line width according to Bloembergen–Purcell–Pound equation [22] (Fig. 4). Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 possesses the highest correlation time due to the lowest lithium mobility. It is noteworthy that conduction of the similar system Li0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 exceeds one for LiZr2(PO4)3 [11]. The NMR 7Li data are consistent with conduction measurements. The

comparison to room temperature pattern. (Fig. 6). Heating of LiTi2(PO4)3 up to 800 K also does not cause any phase transitions according to XRD data. However, DSC data clearly shows wide «endothermic effect» for these materials at low temperatures (Fig. 7). This effect is too broad in order to correspond to the ﬁrst order phase transition. Rather, it corresponds to a gradual passing of the fragments of structure to the mobile state, which is forbidden at low temperatures. Integration of this effect for LiTi2(PO4)3 shows that it corresponds to the value of −134 J/g. A maximum increase in mobility is observed at 250 K. Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 possesses weaker effect −49 J/g. These effects could be interpreted by an increase of lithium mobility. However, one should notice that endothermic effects do not correspond exactly to those ﬁxed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy. Using NMR facilities it is possible to observe increasing of hopping frequency in the short range of values which corresponds to the NMR line width in terms of frequency. Indeed, 7Li NMR spectra clearly show a growth of the lithium mobility in the same temperature range upon heating and thus an increasing in the lithium disorder. Similar effect takes place in some ﬂuorites CaF2, BaF2 etc., when the anomaly of heat capacity arises without the changing of the space group [26]. Such kind of effect in ﬂuorites is concerned with ﬂuoride anion sub-lattice melting and disordering of ﬂuorides. Most likely, a similar situation was realized in considered lithium compounds, where lithium sub-lattice undergoes melting while heating. At the same time the X-ray pattern remains almost the same because of the low scattering ability of lithium.

The endothermic effect square of phase transition should be proportional to energy required for “melting” of lithium sub-lattice or in other words to the “order–disorder” transition. Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 possesses a surprisingly small effect of heat capacity change in contrast to LiTi2(PO4)3. Since the lowest lithium mobility is obtained

conductivity values at 300 K are 3.2×10−8 S/cm for Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3, 5.8×10−7 S/cm for LiTi2(PO4)3.

Conductivity decrease in Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 in comparison with initial LiTi2(PO4)3 is most likely related with some obstacles in lithium paths. Indeed, considering 93Nb NMR spectra of Li0.9Ti1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 one can observe two bands which correspond to the two states of Nb atoms in structure (Fig. 5). The ﬁrst one −1500 ppm is responsible for six-fold coordinated Nb [23]. That band can be ﬁtted by six-fold coordinated titanium positions, which are occupied by Nb as might be supposed. The −2100 ppm band corresponds to an eight-fold Nb5+ coordination. Taking into account the Nasicon structure [8] that band can be determined by M2 positions intended for lithium occupation. Furthermore, ionic radii of Li+ and Nb5+ are 0.92 and 0.74 Å respectively for an eight-fold coordination [20]. Therefore, in fact part of Nb5+ can safely occupy M2 positions thus giving rise to a blocking effect on a lithium transport. It is clear that line width at halfmaximum (FWHM) at 320 ppm (NbO6) band is almost twice as much as FWHM 159 ppm (NbO8). Thus, the splitting of NbO6 corresponding band is obvious; therefore one should distinguish two states of NbO6 arrangements. Probably, part of Nb5+ cations occupy six-fold coordinated M1 positions of lithium together with positions of Ti4+, which are also surrounded by six oxygen atoms. For instance, lithium and niobium ordering can be observed in LiNbO3 [24].

It might be logical to expect some phase transitions upon cooling in rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 since reversible phase transition “rhombohedral-triclinic” occurs in similar LiZr2(PO4)3 in wide temperature range 300–335 K [25]. However, an X-ray diffraction pattern obtained at 100 K evidently shows no phase transition in

Aliovalent doping of LiTi2(PO4)3 by Nb5+ cations stimulates growth of lattice parameters and average bLi1―O> bond length, which could be favorable for Li+ transport. According to 93Nb NMR data Nb5+ partially occupy Ti4+, M2 and perhaps M1 positions in LiTi2(PO4)3 thus blocking the ionic transport and dramatically dropping down ion conductivity and increasing correlation time τc. Endothermic effects can be observed upon heating for all considered compounds while space group remains the same. Such an effect is induced by “defrosting”, following melting of lithium sub-lattice and accompanied by “order– disorder” phase transition.
