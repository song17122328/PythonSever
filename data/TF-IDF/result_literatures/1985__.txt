We presented the conductivity, X-ray diffraction and 23Na NMR spectra of Cu1–yNa0.2+yZr1.9Mg0.1(PO4)3 with Na and Cu mixed ions deﬁned as ionic ratio i = [Na]/{[Na] + [Cu]}. Lattice parameters a axis decreased linearly with increasing ionic ratio and c axis increased linearly with increasing ionic ratio. Conductivity against ionic ratio showed a minimum around i = 0.8. NMR spectra of 23Na nucleus showed a strong quadrupole interaction. The quadrupole coupling constant showed an anomaly around i = 0.8. We observed new results on the mixed ion effect. 
The NASICON structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional network with a bottleneck including a stable localized site (site 1) and quasi-stable high energy interstitial sites (site 2). By substituting Zr4+ in the framework of NaZr2(PO4)3, Na ion hopping conduction between site 1 and site 2 increased with increasing sodium ion content and the conductivity showed a maximum at x = 1.0 [1–4]. The mixed ion effect (MIE) is a phenomena observed in binary ion systems, in which the ionic conductivity decreased to a minimum and was characterized by V-shape at constant temperature when one kind of ions was substituted by another kind of ions [5– 9]. The MIE reported commonly was on the diffusion system, such as glass and β-alumina systems. 
The MIE in glass has a conductivity minimum close to the 50% composition with short range order distribution of host ions and ions substituted by another kind of ion, while in β-alumina conduction ions are statistically distributed over the three kind of sites in a two-dimensional plane and the conductivity showed a minimum at non-equal composition due to a blocking effect. The existence of MIE had been mainly attracting interest as the essential character not dependent on the crystal structure. But, now it is interesting that the MIE depends on ion species and crystal structures. Now, we are focusing on the interest in the MIE within a three-dimensional conduction path. We ﬁrstly observed the MIE of Na and Ag ions or Na and Li ions in sites 1 and 2 within NaZr2(PO4)3 in a three-dimensional diffusion system [10,11]. Their conductivity showed a minimum at about i = 0.3 and 0.8 in Na2–yAgyZr1.5Mg0.5(PO4)3 and Li1–yNa0.2+yZr1.9Mg0.1(PO4)3, respectively. 
In this Letter, we present new results of X-ray diffraction, conductivity and 23Na NMR spectra of Cu1–yNa0.2+yZr1.9Mg0.1(PO4)3 with mixed ions of Cu and Na in a three-dimensional diffusion system.
The sample was prepared by stoichiometrical solutions of Na2CO3, CuNO3, mixing aqueous ZrO(NO3)2 · 2H2O, Mg(NO3)2 · 6H2O and NH4H2PO4, followed by drying at 80 C. The precursor obC for 1 h, tained was prepared by calcining at 300 500 C for 5 h. After powdering the substance, we have polycrystalline pressed pellets C for 5 h in the form of disc sintered at 1040–1200 with about 3 mm thickness and 12 mm diameter. We ﬁrstly prepared samples of Na1+2xZr2–xMgx (PO4)3 and Cu1+2xZr2–xMgx (PO4)3 dependent on x. The former showed a single phase in the region of x = 0.0–1.0, and the latter a single phase in the region of x = 0.0–0.2. Therefore, samples of mixed ion system were prepared with x = 0.1, namely Cu1−yNa0.2+yZr1.9Mg0.1(PO4)3 dependent on y. Electrical impedance measurement were carried out on the sample coated with nickel in the frequency C range of 100 Hz–20 MHz over the range of 30–253 in the air atmosphere. 
The complex impedance plot (Cole–Cole plot; −Z ) at various temperatures generally showed two semicircles. A ﬁrst semicircle observed for the high frequencies represents characteristics of bulk property whereas a semicircle observed for lower frequencies is speciﬁc to grain boundary. Therefore, the bulk electric resistance was given by the intercept on the real axis ﬁtted to a ﬁrst semicircle for the complex impedance plot, then the conductivity was given by the inverse value of the intercept. 23Na NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature using CMX NMR spectrometer with 7 T magnet. The standard sample was of powder NaCl.
But, their fall and minimum position in conductivity were much different from the case of Na and Ag ions in NaZr2(PO4)3. Fig. 4 shows the graph of the ionic ratio dependence of the activation energy Ea obtained by the Arrhenius plots of log σ against 1/T shown in Fig. 5. The Ea rises from approx. 0.35 eV to a maximum value of 0.8 eV at the minimum in conductivity. The behavior suggests that the conductivity minimum results from the localized structure strongly dependent on the ionic ratio and the various species. Fig. 6 shows 23Na static NMR spectra of powder samples dependent on the ionic ratio. The proﬁles exhibit characteristic changes with increasing ionic ratio. The observed proﬁles are produced by the second-order quadrupole interaction with the electric ﬁeld gradient. The proﬁle of the central component for m = 1/2 → −1/2 transition was theoretically deviated from the secondorder perturbation in the literature [12]. 
Using theoretical formulas of two peaks and a minimum in the proﬁle, we calculated the quadrupole coupling constant νQ and asymmetry parameter η. Fig. 7 shows triangles and squares are for the experimental data. The conductivity gradually decreased with increasing ionic ratio and showed a minimum at about i = 0.8. The MIE in Na/Cu–NaZr2(PO4)3 was shown by Vshape at constant temperature with a conductivity minimum and the large fall in conductivity close to i = 0.8 similar to the case of Na and Li ions in NaZr2(PO4)3.
