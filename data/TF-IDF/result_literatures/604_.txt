The  solid  state  synthesis  of  NaTiV(PO4)3  and  Na3TiV(PO4)3  are  reported.
Soft  chemical oxidation of the later composition lead to the NASICON Na2TiV(PO4)3 with intermediate unit cell parameters (s.g.: R-3c, a = 8.610(3) Å, c = 21.755(6) Å) when compared to NaTiV(PO4)3 and  Na3TiV(PO4)3.  Coupled studies  were  achieved  on Na2TiV(PO4)3 for oxidation and reduction by operando x-ray diffraction.
While the oxidation mechanism towards NaTiV(PO4)3 is quite simple, the reduction mechanisms involve several mono and  bi-phasic  mechanisms  leading  to  Na3TiV(PO4)3  as  an  intermediate  composition and to Na4TiV(PO4)3 eventually.

To  our  knowledge,  the  first  electrochemical  investigation  of  this  material  was  reported  in  2002  11  and  more  recently  Saravanan  et  al. demonstrated  the 2(PO4)3 (NVP) is an attractive cathode material excellent cyclability of NVP even at a very high current rate thanks to the presence of a thin layer  of  carbon  coating  that  compensates  for  the  low  electrical  conductivity.
Since  then, several high-profile  studies  have been conducted  in  order to  obtain  optimized performances  and access new redox couples within the NASICON framework 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  Recently, we reported a coupled structural-electrochemical study on the aluminum substituted  analogs with the composition Na3AlyV2-y(PO4)3 (y = 0.1, 0.25 , 0.5) 12. It was found that this  family  of  V/Al  substituted  NASICON  materials  undergoes  multiple  reversible  phase transitions  between  -50  °C  and  250  °C  upon  heating,  from  monoclinic  to  rhombohedral  symmetry,  related  to  progressive  disordering  of  Na+  ions  within  the  framework.
Thanks  to operando X-ray diffraction measurements, it was shown for the first time that substitution of aluminum  for  vanadium  in  Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3  increases  significantly  the  theoretical  energy density of these promising positive electrodes due to the lighter molecular weight of Al and  the possibility of reversible operation on the V4+/V5+ redox couple at 3.95 V vs.Na+/Na.
Along with that study and with the same goal of discovering new structural-electrochemical properties for NASICON-type compounds, we also investigated the substitution of vanadium  by  titanium  in  NaxTiV(PO4)3.  In  the  past,  only  Gopalakrishnan  et  al.reported  on  the  synthesis and X-ray diffraction data on these mixed NASICON compositions.
Na3TiV(PO4)3 was reported to be obtained by solid-state reaction and the chemical oxidation led directly to NaTiV(PO4)3. No further structural or electrochemical characterizations of thoses compounds were  ever  presented  while  the  two  end  members  NaxV2(PO4)3  and  NaxTi2(PO4)3  are  well  documented.
Indeed, the electrochemical extraction of Na+ from Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV2(PO4)3  was shown to occur following a two-phase reaction at 3.37 V versus Na+/Na 14 the latter phase  15,16,17. Moreover, as shown by Uebou et al.

View Article OnlineDOI: 10.1039/C7TA10689KPage 3 of 14Journal of Materials Chemistry ANa3AlyV2-y(PO4)3,  it  has  recently  been  demonstrated  that  Na3V2(PO4)3  undergoes  several reversible  phase  transitions  between  -50  °C  and  250  °C  from  monoclinic  to  rhombohedral  symmetry  18.  On  the  other  side,  the  electrochemical  insertion  of  Na+  into  Na1Ti2(PO4)3  to  Na3Ti2(PO4)3 was reported by Delmas et al.
It proceeds as a biphasic reaction as  well, at 2.1 V vs.Na+/Na.
The reduction towards Na4Ti2(PO4)3 is also possible at a very low  potential of 0.4 V as demonstrated by Senguttuvan et al.
As for NVP, Na3Ti2(PO4)3 shows  a reversible phase transition upon heating / cooling, from a high ordering to low ordering of  the Na+ network 19,20. The  versatility  of  Vanadium  towards  various  oxidation  states  within  the  NASICON  framework  (from  V2+  to  V5+)  makes  it  an  element  of  choice  for  finding  a  multi  electron cathode material and envisaging to build all solid state symmetrical batteries (with the same material at the negative and at the positive).
Very  recently,  such  symmetrical  NASICON  batteries using a liquid electrolyte, either aqueous 9, or organic 23,24 electrolytes were reported.
In the latter, Wang et al.report for the first time on the very long cycle life of batteries built on Na2TiV(PO4)3 both at the anode and at the cathode, thus delivering an average operating voltage  of  ~1.2  V.
Hereafter,  we  report  on  the  preparation  and  phase  stabilities  of  various  compositions  within  the  NaTiIVVIV(PO4)3  –  Na4TiIIIVII(PO4)3  system,  through  various  chemical and electrochemical routes.
Experimental Section NASICON  NaxTiV(PO4)3  powders  with  controlled  values  of  x  (x  =  1  and  x  =  3)  were prepared  by  solid  state  reaction  in  stoichiometric  proportions  from  NH4VO3,  NaH2PO4, NH4H2PO4  and  TiO2  precursors.
NH4VO3  (Sigma-Aldrich  99%),  NaH2PO4  (Sigma-Aldrich 99%),  NH4H2PO4  (Sigma-Aldrich  99%)  were  mixed  and  dissolved  in  hot  water  before Anatase TiO2 powder (Sigma-Aldrich 99%) was added is the solution.
After slow evaporation of solvents, the remaining solid was successively grinded and gently heated up to 300°C as a pre-treatment to  avoid  uncontrolled volumetric expansion  of  the  powder.
After  grinding  the powder, a two steps heat treatment was performed at 400°C for 5 hours and at 750°C for 12 JournalofMaterialsChemistryAAcceptedManuscriptPublished on 06 March 2018.

Depending on the sodium vs (Ti,V) ratio and on the atmosphere during heat treatments, either  NaTiV(PO4)3  or  Na3TiV(PO4)3  were  obtained.
Ambient  atmosphere  was  used  to prepare  NaTiV(PO4)3.  To  form  Na3TiV(PO4)3,  the  reaction  was  performed  in  a  tubular furnace  under  argon-hydrogen  (90:10  vol.%)  atmosphere.
Na2TiV(PO4)3  was  then  obtained from Na3TiV(PO4)3 after air exposure, as discussed later in this paper.
X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  diagrams  were  collected  on  a  Bruker  D8  diffractometer using  the  Cu-Kα1/Kα2  radiations  and  mounted  in  θ-θ  configuration.
High  quality  XRD patterns were recorded overnight between 2θ = 10° and 2θ = 100° by steps of 4.5 s/0.01° for NaxTiV(PO4)3 (x = 1, 2 and 3), as depicted in fig.

Data treatment  were performed using the FullProf Suite 26. Electrochemical  tests  were  performed  on  a  83:17  wt%  mixture  of  the  active  material  and Super P carbon, obtained by ball-milling in a SPEX 8000 mixer (2 stainless steel balls of 2g, 15min).
In  Swagelok-type  cells,  about  10-15  mg  of  the  electrochemically  active  mixture were used as the positive electrode, separated from a sodium disk by two sheets of Whatman GF/D  borosilicate  glass  fiber  soaked  in  a  1  M  molar  solution  of  NaPF6  in  EC/DMC  1:1. Galvanostatic tests were conducted with a Biologic VMP potentiostat controlled by means of the  EC-Lab  software.
For  operando  XRD  measurements,  25-30  mg  of  the  active  mixture  were loaded in our in situ cell behind an Al-protected Be window 25. Galvanostatic tests were conducted with an Apple Mac Pile potentiostat.
Results and discussion As described in the experimental section, the heat treatment under ambient atmosphere with 1  equivalent  of  Na  lead  to  a  pure  dark  green  powder  of  NaTiIVVIV(PO4)3  crystallized  in  the  rhombohedral R-3c cell (see Fig.
The  diffractogram  is  typical  of  a  NASICON  structure  and  shows  a  diffraction peak at 12° (d = 7,18 Å) as well as a doubled peak at 24,5° (d = 3,61 Å) which suggest, as  was  demonstrated  for  Na3(V,Al)2(PO4)3  12  the  co-existence  of  a  low  temperature  « αtype » phase with a higher temperature « β-type » phase.

The lozenges (♦) and circles (●) correspond to the diffraction peaks of the “α”-type and the “β”-type NASICON forms, respectively.
The  XRD pattern  is  slightly  different:  the  12°  and  24.5°  extra-peaks  disappear  and  new  small intensity peaks that may be related to an incommensurate super-structure (as it is the case for  β-Na3V2(PO4)3)  appear.
Differential  scanning  calorimetry  experiments  revealed  a reversible  transition  of  this  compound  at  140  °C  which  may  be  correlated  with  a monoclinic ↔ rhombohedral transformation (Fig.3).
A tiny thermal peak can also be seen only during heating, at 46 °C.
The  material  of  global  composition  Na3VTi(PO4)3  was  then  stored  in  ambient  air  for  a month, which induced a significant color change, from green to orange.
The XRD pattern (Fig.1-green) shows a major evolution with the displacement of all the diffraction peaks and with the appearance of numerous small intensity peaks that most likely belong to the formation of Na-containing impurities (carbonates for instance).
To remove those impurities, the powder was washed in distilled water under stirring for few  hours  before  being  dried  under  vacuum.
The  X-ray  pattern  collected  afterwards  is presented  in  Fig.2-red.
The  impurities  peaks  vanished  completely  and  the  profiles  of some  diffraction  peaks are  slightly  modified.
The  diffractogram  can  be  fully  indexed  in  the  R-3c  space  group  with  intermediate  cell  parameters  (V/Z=232.8  Å3)  with  respect  to NaTiV(PO4)3 and Na3TiV(PO4)3 in perfect agreement with the those reported by Wang et  al 23 (V/Z=232.87 Å3) for the Na2TiV(PO4)3 phase.
Table 1: Lattice parameters of NaTiV(PO4)3, Na2TiV(PO4)3 and Na3TiV(PO4)3 powders prepared chemically Hence, Na2TiIVVIII(PO4)3 was obtained as a pure phase through this oxidation process in air of  Na3TiV(PO4)3, as a result of the slow oxidation of Ti3+ into Ti4+.

The  washing  step  permitted  then  to  remove  the  supplementary  Na+  ions  and  to  complete  the transformation towards pure Na2TiV(PO4)3.
Galvanostatic data were recorded for a current corresponding to Extraction of Na+ from Na2TiV(PO4)3.
Fig.4a  gathers  the  electrochemical  behavior  of  Na2TiV(PO4)3  during  electrochemical  oxidation.
As  expected,  only  one  Na+  is  reversibly  extracted  when  V3+  is  oxidized  towards  V4+ at an average potential of  3.33 V vs.Na+/Na for a theoretical capacity of 62.4 mA.h/g.
A  higher  potential  limit  of  4.5  V  vs.Na+/Na  did  not  reveal  supplementary  reaction  and  the derivative curve dQ/dV shows a reversible sharp peak that suggests a bi-phasic mechanism.
The  variation  of  the  average  potential  of  the  redox  couple  V4+/V3+  when  compared  to  Na3V2(PO4)3  (3.37  V  vs.Na+/Na)  could  be  correlated  with  a  decrease  of  the  average  V-O  bond length in Na2TiV(PO4)3.   As displayed in the Fig.

However, the XRD peaks positions of each phase are moving slightly during the  process  so  that  at  mid-(dis)charge,  the  pattern  is  not  a  linear  combination  of  both  end members.
This phenomenon is being seen for several phosphate-based vanadium-containing  positive  electrodes  such  as  LiVOPO4  27  and  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  28.  The  cell  parameters  of  NaTiV(PO4)3  obtained  by  electrochemical  oxidation  (given  in  table  2)  are  fully  consistent with those obtained through direct synthesis by solid state reaction as presented in Table 1.  Overall, the extraction of 1 Na+ induce a small decrease of the unit cell volume, ∆V/V ~-3.5 %.
Upon  subsequent  discharge,  the  pristine  material  is  fully  recovered,  witnessing  the  high reversibility of this two-phase reaction at 3.3 V vs.Na.
Electrochemical XRD patterns recorded operando for Na2TiV(PO4)3 electrode upon galvanostatic charge and discharge (operating on the V4+/V3+ couple) at a current rate corresponding to 1 Na+/20h.
The experimentally attained capacity was limited to ~1.75 Na+, most likely  due  to  insufficient  conductive  carbon  wiring  around  the  phosphate  particles.
The  comparison with the electrochemistry of NaTi2(PO4)3 15,29 and Na2TiCr(PO4)3 17 indicate that  the  first  Na+  inserted  at  ~2.17  V  vs.
Na+/Na,  for  a  theoretical  capacity  of  62.4  mAh/g,  is  accompanied  by  the  reduction  of  Ti4+  towards  Ti3+.
Likewise,  the  comparison  with   the  data  published for Na3V2(PO4)3  in  22  implies that the  second  Na+ inserted at  ~1.6  V vs.Na+/Na  (for  an  equal theoretical  capacity  of  62.4  mAh/g)  corresponds  to  the V3+/V2+ redox Fig.
Electrochemical (top) XRD patterns recorded operando for a Na2TiV(PO4)3 electrode  upon galvanostatic discharge and charge (operating on the Ti4+/Ti3+ and V3+/V2+ couples) at a current rate corresponding to 1 Na+/20h.
The  XRD  patterns  collected  operando  presented  in  Fig.6  show  indeed  a  non-monotonous   evolution of the NASICON structure during (dis)charge below 2,8 V vs.Na+/Na.
The color map  figure  for  the  23-24°  region  helps  to  identify  more  clearly  each  step  composing  the insertion and extraction of the sodium ions.
During discharge, the initial phase Na2TiV(PO4)3 is  reduced through  a  smooth  solid-solution  up to  ~Na2.5TiV(PO4)3  before  the  appearance of JournalofMaterialsChemistryAAcceptedManuscriptPublished on 06 March 2018.

The  unit-cell  parameters  of  Na3TiV(PO4)3  obtained electrochemically (Table 2) are fully consistent with those of the powder prepared chemically.
The  insertion  of  Na+  into  Na3TiV(PO4)3  (i.e.the  reduction  of  V3+  into  V2+  upon  discharge  down to 1 V vs.Na°) occurs through a monophasic reaction, with anisotropic variations of a and  c  (a  increases  significantly  (+2.5%),  c  decreases  slightly  (-1%))  leading  to  the  end composition  Na4TiV(PO4)3.  The  unit-cell  parameters  obtained  (Table  2)  are  significantly different  from  the  ones  obtained  by  Wang  et  al.,  who  could  reach  only  the  composition  Na3.3VTi(PO4)3 down to 1.5 V vs.Na.
Globally, the insertion of 2 Na+ from Na2TiIVVIII(PO4)3  towards Na4TiIIIVII(PO4)3 induces an increase of the cell volume of ∆V/V = +7.6 %.

The  later  composition  was  proven  to  be  unstable  over  long  exposure  to  ambient  air.Ti3+  is  slowly  oxidized towards Ti4+ inducing the chemical extraction of Na+ from the NASICON structure.

The  oxidation  from  Na2TiV(PO4)3  to  NaTiV(PO4)3  occurs  at  3.33  V  vs.Na+/Na  through  a  biphasic mechanism.
The reduction towards Na4TiV(PO4)3 induces several successive bi-phasic  and monophasic steps involving the Ti3+/Ti2+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples at 2.17 and 1.60 V vs  Na+/Na respectively with the formation of Na3TiV(PO4)3 as an intermediate composition.
