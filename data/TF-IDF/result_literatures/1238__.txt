The   mixed-potential   type   gas   sensors   combining   NASICON   with   oxide   electrodes   exhibit   high   sensing performance   to   typical   pollution   gases   in   the  atmospheric   environment   in   the   intermediate   temperature range,   indicating   a   potential   in   practical   application.   This   paper   describes   the   state-of-the-art   for   the sensors   based   on   the   NASICON,   including   the   current-type,   the   equilibrium-potential-type   and   mixedpotential-type.   For   improving   the   performance   of   sensors   based   on   the  NASICON   and   oxide   electrodes, two  main   approaches   have   been   utilized:   the   developing   of   new   oxide   electrode   materials   and   the   design of   novel   sensor   structure   for   enhancing   the   sensing   performance   as   well   as   the  sensing   mechanism involved   in   the   mixed   potential.

With  the  increasing  of  world’s  population  and  the  acceleration of  the  industrialization  process,  lots  of  harmful  gases  (CO2,  SOx, NOx,  H2S,  NH3,  CO  and  so  on)  from  the  power  generation,  heat supplying,  metallurgy,  chemical  production  and  motor  vehicle  lead to  severe  atmospheric  pollution,  e.g.,  greenhouse  effect,  acid  rain, photochemical  smog  and  other  environmental  disasters.  Therefore,  the  high-performance  environment  gas  sensors  have  been urgently  desired  for  detecting  and  monitoring  these  hazardous gases.  Up  to  now,  various  kinds  of  gas  sensors  based  on  semiconductor  oxides  [1],  organic  thin  ﬁlms  [2]  and  solid  electrolytes  [3]  have been  developed.  Among  them,  the  solid  electrolyte  type  sensors exhibit  excellent  sensing  performances,  such  as  high  sensitivity, rapid  response  kinetics,  outstanding  selectivity  and  reproducibility. For  the  solid  electrolyte  sensors,  most  of  researches  have  focused on  the  sensors  based  on  yttria  stablized  zirconia  (YSZ)  and  sodium super  ionic  conductor  (NASICON)  [4–8].  In  general,  the  YSZ-based sensor  was  operated  at  elevated  temperature  (600–800 ◦C),  so  it seems  to  be  inappropriate  for  detecting  the  gases  in  atmospheric environment  because  of  its  low  sensitivity  and  high  power  consumption.  Contrary  to  the  YSZ-based  sensors,  the  mixed  potential type  sensors  based  on  NASICON  are  generally  operated  at  relatively lower  temperature  range  (100–500 ◦C),  moreover,  having  novel sensing  performance,  so  they  are  more  suitable  for  detecting  the hazardous  gases  in  the  atmospheric  environment.

fast  ionic  conductivity  is  required  [9–16].  The  crystal  structure  of − NASICON-type  phases  of  general  formula  Na1  +  xZr2SixP3    xO12 can be  described  from  corner-sharing  of  ZrO6 octahedra  and  PO4–SiO4 tetrahedra,  and  Na+ ions  located  at  interstitial  sites  of  the  network − (Fig.  1)  [17,18].  The  three-dimensional  framework  Zr2SixP3    xO12 obtained  delimits  large  cavities  which  can  be  occupied  by  Na+ ions. Two  main  types  of  cavities,  M1 and  M2,  are  often  considered:  the  M1 cavity,  one  per  formula  unit,  is  located  between  two  ZrO6 octahedra along  the  c-axis  forming  ribbons  O3ZrO3NaO3ZrO3,  while  the  M2 cavity,  three  per  formula  unit,  is  situated  between  these  ribbons. − Indeed,  NASICON  with  Na1  +  xZr2SixP3    xO12 stoichiometry  shows high  Na+ conductivity  for  x  =  2,  and  the  most  suitable  for  making gas  sensor.

According  to  the  sensing  mechanism,  the  NASICON-based  gas sensors  are  mainly  divided  into  three  types:

I  NASICON-based  the  current-type  sensors,  researchers  mainly focus  on  the  structure  and  auxiliary  materials  of  sensors.

II  NASICON-based  equilibrium-potential-type  sensors,  CO2 sensor is  the  research  point,  including  the  auxiliary  electrode  materials,  reference  electrode  materials  and  the  sensing  mechanism  of sensors.

III  NASICON-based  mixed-potential  type  sensors,  researchers  place great  emphasis  on  the  improvement  of  oxide-sensing  materials and  device  structure.

Besides,  a  few  researchers  reported  that  gas-sensing  mechanism of  SnO2/NASICON  composite  materials  and  thick  ﬁlm  electrochemical  sensor  based  on  the  kinetics  of  the  controlled  chemical  reaction [19–22].  This  paper  provides  an  overview  and  mainly  expressed the  state-of-the-art  about  the  gas  sensors  based  on  NASICON solid  electrolyte.  For  improving  the  performance  of  sensors  based

on  the  NASICON  and  oxide  electrodes,  we  have  taken  two  main approaches:  the  developing  of  new  oxide  electrode  materials  and the  design  of  novel  sensor  structure  for  enhancing  the  sensing  performance.

Generally  speaking,  amperometric  sensors,  if  properly  fabricated,  can  give  more  precise  concentration  data  than  potentiometric  sensors.  Up  to  now,  NASICON-based  the  current-type  sensors  are mainly  divided  into  NO2 and  CO2 sensor  [23–27],  Miura  et  al.  ﬁrst utilized  the  NASICON-based  the  current-type  sensors  for  detecting NO2 in  1996  [24],  sensor  was  designed  by  combining  a  Na+ conductor  (NASICON)  with  NaNO2 (or  NaNO3)  auxiliary  layers  deposited on  both  sensing  and  counter  electrodes.  The  current  response  of this  sensor  varied  linearly  with  NO2 concentration  (Fig.  2)  [24], but  its  lowest  limit  of  NO2 detection  was  several-hundred  ppb.  In addition,  the  original  sensor  needs  the  ﬂow  of  air  to  the  reference electrode  side  as  a  reference  gas,  so  the  simpliﬁcation  and  miniaturization  of  sensor  structure  are  not  easy.  In  order  to  overcome  these drawbacks,  N.  Miura  et  al.  have  proposed  a  compact,  solid-state, amperometric  NO2 sensor  was  fabricated  using  a  small  NASICON plate  and  an  NaNO2 layer  deposited  on  the  counter  electrode.  With the  sensing  electrode  polarized  at  a  constant  potential  relative  to the  reference  Au  electrode  coated  with  an  inorganic  adhesive,  electric  current  ﬂowing  through  the  device  under  exposure  to  NO2 was measured  as  a  sensing  signal  in  1998  [25].  The  current  response of  sensor  was  almost  linear  with  NO2 concentration  in  the  range 10  ppb  to  1  ppm  at  150 ◦C  (Fig.  3)  [25].  The  90%  response  time to  even  20  ppb  NO2 was  ca.  60  s.  The  NO2 sensitivity  was   hardly affected  by  the  coexistence  of  CO2,  H2O  and  O2.  Furthermore,  the device  could  be  operated  rather  stably  during  the  test  period  of  ca. 30  days  except  for  several  days  in  the  early  stage.  As  for  CO2 sensor, J.  Lee  et  al.  have  exerted  an  amperometric  CO2 sensor  which  was fabricated  using  a  Pt|NASICON|Pt   cell  and  a  porous  Na2CO3–BaCO3

(1:1.7  in  molar  ratio)  auxiliary  layer  in  2003  [26,27].  Fig.  4  shows the  sensor  signal  as  a  function  of  the  CO2 concentration  in  dry and  wet   atmospheres  (20 ◦C  in  dew  point)  [27].  The  current  was approximately  proportional  to  the  logarithm  of  the  CO2 concentration  although  the  data  at  low  CO2 concentration  (the  dotted  part  in line)  showed  a  little  deviation.  The  presence  of  humidity  had  little effect  on  the  amperometric  signal.

This  type  of  CO2 sensor  was   reported  ﬁrstly  by  Maruyama  et  al. in  1986  [28],  who   combined  a  NASICON-based  cell  with  a  Na2CO3

was   developed  by  combining  NASICON  and  a  Li-based  binary  carbonate  auxiliary  electrode  represented  by  Li2CO3–CaCO3 (1.8:1  in molar  ratio:eutectic  mixture)  [31].  It  responded  to  CO2 quickly and  reversibly,  following  a  Nernst  equation  excellently  in  the  CO2 concentration  range  102–105 ppm.  In  addition,  Li2CO3–CaCO3 electrode  was   found  to  be  stable  to  deliquescence  even  when  kept under  a  highly  humid  condition  at  30 ◦C  for  more  than  700  h.  It was   found  that  the  electrode  using  Li2CO3–CaCO3 can  stand  a  very humid  atmosphere  for  a  considerable  span  of  time,  and  thus  brings about  a  great  ease  in  the  storage  and  handling  of  the  sensor  in practice  [31].

auxiliary  phase.  And  then,  a  number  of  investigators  have  shown that  sensor  properties  can  be  upgraded  by  replacing  Na2CO3 with  a binary  carbonate  system  such  as  Na2CO3–BaCO3 and  Li2CO3–BaCO3 [29–34,38–47].  For  example,  Yamazoe  et  al.  reported  a  simple potentiometric  CO2 sensor  based  upon  NASICON  was  found  to  be greatly  improved  in  response  time  and  water  vapor-resistance  by using  a  binary  carbonate  electrode  of  BaCO3–Na2CO3.  The  response of  this  sensor  was  perfectly  linear  to  the  logarithm  of  CO2 concentration  in  the  whole  range  tested  (4–400,000  ppm)  with  a  Nernst‘s lope  of  81  mV/decade,  water  vapor  hardly  affected  the  sensor  characteristics,  in  contrast  to  the  case  of  a  pure  Na2CO3 electrode,  with a  90%  response  time  of  as  short  as  8  s  [30].

Subsequent  examinations  from  a  practical  viewpoint,  however, disclosed  that  these  electrodes  (BaCO3–Na2CO3,  etc.)  were  not  stable  enough  during  storage  at  room  temperature  under  extremely humid  conditions  near  100%  relative  humidity  because  of  their hygroscopic  nature.  This  situation  prompted  us  to  seek  for  better  electrode  materials.  As  a  result,  Li-based  binary  carbonate electrodes,  Li2CO3–MCO3 (M  =  Ca,  Sr,  Ba)  were  found  to  be  very promising.  The  use  of  these  electrodes  for  the  NASICON  based  electrochemical  cell  not  only  brings  about  even  better  CO2 sensing properties  but  also  makes  the  sensor  very  stable  to  deliquescence during  storage  in  a  highly  humid  atmosphere  at  room  temperature.  Yamazoe  et  al.  reported  that  solid  electrolyte  CO2 sensor

The  binary  systems  bring  about  several  advantages  such  as  quick response,  resistance  to  disturbance  by  water  vapor,  resistance  to deliquescence  in  storage  under  humid  conditions  and  capability of  operation  at  lower  temperature  such  as  350 ◦C.  However,  the mechanism  of  such  improvements  has  not  yet  been  understood well.  The  sensors  of  this  type  possess  a  hetero-junction  between  the electrolyte  (NASICON)  and  the  auxiliary  phase  (carbonate).  It  seems that  the  junction  should  play  an  important  role  on  CO2 sensing  performance  and  its  improvement.  Miura  et  al.  investigated  the  devices combining  NASICON  with  a  series  of  Li2CO3–CaCO3 binary  carbonates  for  CO2 sensing  properties  and  the  hetero-junction  involved to  evaluate  the  role  of  interfacial  structure  in  this  type  device  [32]. The  CO2 sensing  properties  and  hetero-junction  structure  of  the NASICON-based  devices  varied  rather  extensively  with  the  composition  of  Li2CO3–CaCO3 phases  used.  When  pure  Li2CO3 was  used, a  thin  layer  assumed  to  be  Li2ZrO3 was  formed  on  the  interface between  NASICON  and  carbonate.  When  Li2CO3:CaCO3 (1:2)  was used,  in  contrast,  the  formation  of  CaZrO3 layer  (30  mm  thick) inside  NASICON  was   observed.  Surprisingly,  the  corrosion  area containing  CaZrO3 increased  extensively  with  decreasing  CaCO3 content.  The  formation  of  fairly  well  deﬁned  CaZrO3 layer  is  considered  to  give  the  best  lower-temperature  CO2 sensing  capability to  the  device  using  Li2CO3:CaCO3 (1:2).

Furthermore,  to  research  the  deterioration  mechanism  of  sensors  and  obtain  sensors  with  better  reproducibility  and  long-term stability,  W.   Weppner  et  al.  have  investigated  potentiometric CO2 sensors  based  on  NASICON.  The  sensor  arrangement  may be  described  as  chemical  sensor  of  type  III,  “(−)   Pt  (or  Au), Na0.9CoO2 |NASICON|   Na2CO3,  Pt  (or  Au)  (+)”,  with  Na0.9CoO2 as reference  electrode  and  Na2CO3 as  auxiliary  or  sensing  electrode [33].  Comparing  with  the  property  of  the  sensor  with  structure as  “(−)  Pt,  Na0.9CoO2 | |   carbonate,  Pt,  O2,  CO2 (+)” and  analyzing  the  mechanism,  the  authors  got  the  deterioration reason:  Many  intermediate  compounds  such  as  Na-zirconates,  Nasilicates,  Na-phosphates,  Na-oxides,  Si-oxides,  etc.  with  a  wide range  of  stoichiometry  may   be  formed  at  the  two   interfaces  electrolyte/electrode.  Nevertheless,  once  an  intermediate  compound involving  the  electrons  from  the  electronic  lead  is  formed  at  the interface,  this  compound  contributes  to  the  cell  voltage.  If  the formed  intermediate  compound  is  electrically  non-conducting,  it has  the  property  of  a  capacitor  with  a  dielectric  constant,  which inﬂuences  the  measured  cell  voltage  and  provides  a  parallel  shift of  the  voltage.  Finally,  sensors  like  (–)  Au,  Na0.9CoO2 |NASICON| Na2CO3,  Au  (+)  showed  good  reproducibility  and  long-term  stability.

To  fabricate  reproducible  and  durable  CO2 sensors,  maintenance of  a  stable  and  reversible  ionic  activity  in  the  sensing  and  reference  electrodes  is  the  most  important  technique.  Sadaoka  et  al. [34]  investigated  the  effects  of  adding  Nd2O3 to  the  Li2CO3 layer acting  as  an  auxiliary  electrode  on  the  CO2 sensing  characteristics. Fig.  5  shows  the  EMF   (According  to  IUPAC  [35],  the  name  electromotive  force  and  the  symbol  EMF   are  no  longer  recommended. V,  should  be  used.  HowInstead,  electric  potential  difference,  ever,  since  this  article  reviews  old  ﬁgures,  we  will  keep  the  original denomination  electromotive  force,  EMF,  throughout  this  article.)

For  the auxiliary  electrode,  the  mixture  of  Li2CO3 and  Nd2O3 was   heated  in  100%  CO2 gas  at  800 ◦C  for  2  h.  The  mixing  molar  ratio  of  [Li2CO3]/[Nd2O3]  as  the  starting  materials  is denoted   in  the  ﬁgure. Source:  reprinted  from  reference  [34]  with  permission  from  Elsevier.

responses  of  the  CO2 gas  sensors  using  only  Li2CO3 and  heat-treated mixtures  of  Li2CO3 and  Nd2O3 as  an  auxiliary  electrode  [34].  In these  measurements,  air  (370  ppm  CO2 with  ambient  moisture)  and the  standard  gas  (10,000  ppm  CO2)  were  alternately  changed  in  a 30-min  interval.  The  measurements  were  started  after  reaching  a designated  temperature  from  room  temperature,  and  then  continued  for  20–30  days  to  observe  the  stability  and  reversibility  of  the EMF   response.  The  EMF   had  a  signiﬁcant  drift  for  the  sensor  with only  Li2CO3 as  an  auxiliary  electrode.  For  the  sensor  with  the  heattreated  1:1  mixture  of  Li2CO3 and  Nd2O3 as  an  auxiliary  electrode, a  similar  drift  having  a  decreasing  EMF   tendency  was  also  observed during  the  initial  short  period.  To  improve  the  sensing  stability,  a new  auxiliary  electrode  material  based  on  Li2CO3 and  Nd2O3 was developed.

Brosda  et  al.  developed  potentiometric  sensor  based  on  screenprinted  NASICON  ﬁlms  [36].  In  this  article,  it  has  been  proposed that  the  sintering  process  of  the  thick  ﬁlm  inﬂuences  the  chemical  surface  composition  of  NASICON  and  as  a  consequence  the response  of  the  sensor.  The  highest  sintering  temperature  that  can be  used  is  limited  by  the  decomposition  of  NASICON  and  an  increasing  thickness  of  the  amorphous  layer  at  the  surface,  whereas  the lowest  temperature  is  limited  by  the  adhesion  of  the  solid  electrolyte  onto  the  alumina  substrate  surface.  Therefore  the  window of  sintering  temperature  is  small  and  covers  only  the  range  from 1120  to  1170 ◦C.

Unlike  authors  of  above  literatures  that  improved  the  property of  CO2 sensors  by  altering  auxiliary  electrode  materials,  Holzinger et  al.  [37,38]  used  Na-␤ 4) 4)-Al2O3-pellets  as  a  solid  electrolyte, Na2CO3 as  a  measuring  electrode  and  a  two  phase  reference  electrode  consisting  of  Na2Ti3O7/Na2Ti6O13 or  Na2Ti6O13/TiO2.  Since the  inﬂuence  of  the  oxygen  partial  pressure  ﬁxes  the  activity  of  the

elements  on  both  sides,  no  oxygen  partial  pressure  dependence of  the  sensor  voltage  occurs.  Sahner  et  al.  transferred  this  idea into  a  fully  screen-printed  planar  sensor  device,  using  NASICON as  a  solid  electrolyte  and  Na2CO3/BaCO3 mixtures  as  a  measuring  electrode  [39].  They  researched  the  inﬂuence  of  “sodium-rich (Na2Ti3O7/Na2Ti6O13)”  and  “sodium-poor  (Na2Ti6O13/TiO2)”  on the  performance  of  sensors.  As  a  result,  the  observed  n  values ± for  sensor  device  with  the  sodium-rich  reference  were  2.14    0.06 (total  of  4  specimens,  each  measured  3  times  at  500 ◦C)  and ±   0.06  (total  of  4  specimens  at  600 ◦C).  The  devices  presented 2.12  a  much  higher  emf   reading  than  expected  from  the  thermodynamic  calculations  and  experimental  results.  Analyzing  the  XRD of  NASICON  and  reference  electrode  materials,  the  “sodium-rich” composition  was   found  to  react  with  the  ion  conducting  NASICON  during  thermal  treatment.  For  the  thick  ﬁlm  sensors  using a  sodium-poor  reference  formulation,  excellent  agreement  with the  theory  was  observed.  Screen-printed  sensor  devices  were  prepared  and  tested  with  respect  to  CO2 response,  reproducibility, and  cross-interference  of  oxygen.  After  attaching  a  screen-printed heater,  sensor  elements  were  operated  actively  in  a  cold  gas  stream to  determine  the  CO2 concentration  in  exhaled  air  [40].

Recently,  Dang  et  al.  also  reported  the  studies  on  solid  electrolyte  CO2 sensors’  moisture  resistance  by  altering  the  reference electrode  materials  [41].  To  overcome  this  problem,  a  sensor  using  a porous  BaCO3 ﬁlm  as  reference  electrode  (p-Sensor)  was   fabricated, a  porous  BaCO3 ﬁlm  was   formed  by  PMMA   doping.  For  the  purpose of  comparison,  sensor  without  this  porous  structure  (o-Sensor,  i.e. an  opened  reference  electrode)  and  sensor  with  a  dense  BaCO3 ﬁlm  (d-Sensor)  also  have  been  fabricated.  The  authors  measured the  EMF   response  to  CO2 as  a  function  of  CO2 concentration  under 70%RH  conditions.  Although  the  EMF   values  of  both  d-sensor  and

Fig.  6.  Sensing  performance  to  CO2 or  O2 of  the  open-reference  electrode  type sensor  device  at  300 ◦C,  NdCoO3|NASICON|La0.8Pb0.2CoO3. Source:   reprinted  from  reference  [49]  with  permission  from  Elsevier.

o-sensor  was  still  very  much  linear  to  the  logarithm  of  CO2 concentration  under  humid  conditions.  The  observed  n  values  for  d-sensor, p-sensor  and  o-sensor  were  1.7,  2.0  and  2.4,  respectively.  This  result suggests  that  of  p-sensor  is  closer  to  theoretical  value.  The  reason for  the  good  performance  of  p-sensor  under  humid  condition  was suggested  to  be  due  to  the  almost  the  same  porous  structure  of  both electrodes  that  make  two  Pt  electrodes  potential  dependence  of  RH cancel  each  other  out.

For  above  two  types  of  sensors,  the  long-time  stability  and  moisture  resistance  need  further  be  improved,  due  to  the  hygroscopicity of  the  oxysalt  auxiliary  electrode  as  well  as  the  interface  reaction  between  the  oxysalt  and  NASICON.  Unlike  these  two  types of  sensors,  the  mixed-potential-type  sensor  based  on  NASICON uses  an  oxide  as  a  sensing  electrode  which  has  good  moisture resistance  and  not  directly  involved  in  the  electrode  reaction  (electrode  catalyst),  so  it  has  been  a  hot  research  topic  in  recent  years [48–53,57–64].  The  primal  research  on  sensor  with  the  oxide  electrode  was  proposed  by  S.  Bredikhin  [48],  using  SnOx (doped  with Sb,  V,  etc.)  as  sensing  electrode  and  NaxCoO2 as  reference  electrode.  In  this  work,  non-equilibrium-potential  phenomenon  was found  and  the  mechanism  was  discussed  brieﬂy.  Then,  Shimizu et  al.  developed  a  CO2 sensor  with  perovskite-type  oxide  electrodes (NdCoO3 and  La0.8Ba0.2CoO3 for  sensing  and  reference  electrodes). The  NdCoO3 and  La0.8Ba0.2CoO3 electrodes  have  high  and  poor sensitivity  to  CO2,  respectively,  while  they  have  almost  the  same sensing  performance  to  oxygen.  Fig.  6  shows  CO2 and  O2 sensing properties  of  the  open-reference  electrode  type  sensor  device  at 300 ◦C  [49].  The  sensor  still  has  rather  good  CO2 sensing  properties, while  the  sensor  was  hardly  affected  with  oxygen  partial  pressure, as  expected.

Izu  et  al.  [50]  fabricated  and  investigated  a  planar  SO2 sensor using  NASICON  as  an  electrolyte  and  V2O5/WO3/TiO2 +  Au  or  Pt  as a  sensing  electrode.  The  planar  sensor  fabricated  by  screen-printing is  easy  to  industrialize.  In  this  study,  the  author  varied  the  vanadium oxide  concentration  between  1.5  and  3.0  wt%  and  the  electrode materials  between  Pt  and  Au  and  measured  the  potential  changes when  exposed  to  SO2 and/or  other  gases  in  detail.  As  a  result,  the sensors  using  Au  electrodes  with  1.5  and  3.0  wt%  V2O5 showed  the highest  sensitivity  with  80–83  mV/decade  in  the  SO2 range  from 20  to  200  ppm  was  observed  at  600 ◦C.  The  sensors  showed  the

potential  for  good  selectivity  at  600 ◦C  in  the  case  of  Au  electrodes. The  development  of  this  planar  sensor  not  only  improves  the  SO2 sensor’s  performance,  but  laid  the  foundation  for  industrialization of  the  mixed-potential-type  sensor.

Shimizu  et  al.  [53]  developed  solid  electrolyte  electrochemical  devices  based  on  NASICON  and  pyrochlore-type  oxide − (Pb2M2O7    xPbx;  x  =  0–0.75)  electrodes  were  found to  exhibit  good  performance  for  the  potentiometric  sensing  of  NO as  well  as  NO2 at  400 ◦C.  The  EMF   responses  were  almost  linear to  the  logarithm  of  NO  or  NO2 concentration.  Among  the  elements − tested,  the  device  attached  with  Pb2Ru1.5Pb0.5O7    y electrode  gave excellent  NO  sensing  properties.  Fig.  7  shows  dependence  of  EMF − of  the  sensor  device  using  the  Pb2Ru1.5Pb0.5O7    y and  NASICON combination  on  gas  concentration.  The  sensor  hardly  responded to  NO2 and  CO2 diluted  in  air,  while  it  showed  high  EMF   response to  NO  diluted  in  N2,  being  linear  to  log  PNO with  a  negative  slope  of −40  mV/decade  [53].

In  order  to  examine  the  NOx sensing  mechanism,  the  effect of  co-existent  oxygen  on  the  measurement  of  NO  concentration − was   tested  for  the  Pb2Ru1.5Pb0.5O7    y based  device.  As  shown  in Fig.  8  [53],  the  element  showed  rather  well  EMF   response  to  NO  coexisted  10%  oxygen  with  linear  relationship  between  EMF   versus log  PNO.  However,  the  slope  of  +43  mV/decade  was  completely  different  in  sign  from  that  for  NO  in  N2 (Fig.  7(a)).  As  mentioned  above, the  sensor  signal  was  largely  inﬂuenced  by  the  coexisted  oxygen. The  mixed  potential  mechanism  [54–56]  should  proceed  on  the

sensing  electrode.  Therefore,  each  EMF   value  could  be  determined by  the  potential  at  which  cathodic  and  anodic  reactions  proceed  at an  equal  rate.  For  NO2 sensing,  the  following  electrochemical  reactions  (1)  and  (2)  are  assumed  for  the  cathodic  and  anodic  reactions, respectively. NO2 + − = O2− =

For  NO  sensing,  the  reactions  are  changed  drastically  by  the coexisted  oxygen.  When  the  co-existed  oxygen  is  rare  (NO  sensing in  N2),  reactions  (3)  and  (4)  are  assumed  for  the  cathodic  and  anodic reactions,  respectively.  When  a  sufﬁcient  amount  of  oxygen  is  coexisted,  reactions  (5)  and  (2)  are  assumed  for  the  cathodic  and anodic  reactions,  respectively.

Oxygen  in  reaction  (4)  should  be  considered  as  an  impurity (10  ppm  O2)  of  N2 gas  used.  However,  the  sensing  mechanisms  of the  present  electrochemical  device  still  need  further  investigation [53].

The  NASICON  was  synthesized  with  ZrO(NO3)2,  NaNO3, (NH4)2HPO4 and  Si(C2H5O)4 by  sol–gel  process.  The  sensor  was  fabricated  with  an  alumina  tube  of  6  mm   long,  0.8  and  1.2  mm  in  inner and  outer  diameters.  The  NASICON  precursor  was   applied  on  an alumina  tube  twice  and  sintered  at  900 ◦C  for  6  h  in  air.  Then  noble metal  (Pt  or  Au)  and  oxide  layers  were  formed  on  the  two   ends  of NASICON  layer.  Some  special  sensor  structure  will  be  described  in the  related  part  in  detail.

Some  results  of  the  NASICON  based  gas  sensors  using  oxide  electrodes  were  listed  in  Table  1.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  for  improving  the performance  of  sensors,  two  main  approaches  have  been  utilized: the  exploration  of  new  oxide  electrode  materials  and  the  design  of novel  sensor  structure.

Some  novel  oxide  electrode  materials  (Pr6O11-doped  SnO2, CaMg3(SiO3)4-doped  CdS,  V2O5-doped  TiO2,  C-doped  Cr2O3 and ZnO–TiO2)  for  sensing  H2S,  Cl2,  SO2,  NH3 and  C7H8 have  been  developed.

Pr6O11-doped  SnO2-attached  H2S  sensor.  We   have  reported the  NASICON  based  H2S  sensor  using  Pr6O11-doped  SnO2 electrode as  sensing  electrode.  Compared  with  pure  SnO2,  Pr6O11-doped SnO2 was  found  to  be  more  suitable  for  detecting  H2S.  Fig.  9  shows that  EMF   of  the  device  attached  with  Pr6O11-doped  SnO2 is  perfectly  linear  to  the  logarithm  of  H2S  concentration,  and  the  slopes are  13,  37,  74,  32  and  31  mV/decade  at  200,  250,  300,  350  and 400 ◦C,  respectively.  With  increasing  the  operating  temperature, the  slope  tended  to  increase.  At  300 ◦C,  the  largest  value  of  the slopes  occurred,  but  above  300 ◦C  the  slope  tended  to  decrease.  This could  arise  from  the  consumption  of  H2S  when  it  diffused  through the  Pr6O11-doped  SnO2 electrode  layer  at  higher  temperatures  [57].

It  was  also  seen  that  the  sensor  showed  a  good  selectivity  to  H2S against  SO2,  NO2,  CH4 and  CO,  and  an  excellent  resistance  to  water vapor.  The  sensor  had  speedy  response  kinetics  to  H2S:  the  90% response  time  to  5,  20  and  50  ppm  H2S  was   8,  6  and  4  s,  respectively,  and  the  recovery  time  was   12,  18  and  30  s,  respectively.  On the  basis  of  XPS  analysis  for  the  H2S-adsorbed  sensing  electrode, a  sensing  mechanism  involving  the  mixed  potential  at  the  sensing electrode  was  proposed.

CaMg3(SiO3)-doped  CdS-attached  Cl2 sensor.  The  sensor using  CaMg3(SiO3)4-doped  CdS  exhibited  excellent  sensing  properties  to  1–10  ppm  chlorine  in  air  at  100–250 ◦C  [58].  The  sensing properties  strongly  depended  on  the  sintered  temperature  of  the sensing  electrode  materials.  The  dependence  of  EMF   on  the  Cl2 concentration  for  the  sensing  devices  attached  with  the  sensing electrode  materials  sintering  at  different  temperatures  (A:  500 ◦C, B:  600 ◦C,  C:  700 ◦C  and  D:  800 ◦C)  was   shown  in  Fig.  10.  For  all devices,  the  EMFs  were  almost  proportional  to  the  logarithm  of chlorine  concentration,  but  the  device  sintered  at  600 ◦C  gave  the largest  sensitivity  (slope)  to  Cl2.  The  sensitivity  of  sensor  using −392  mV/decade CaMg3(SiO3)4-doped  CdS  sintered  at  600 ◦C  was   at  200 ◦C.  The  cross-sensitivities  of  the  device  attached  with  B  to other  various  gases,  i.e.  SO2,  H2S,  NO2,  NH3,  CH4 and  CO  each 100  ppm  in  air,  were  measured  at  200 ◦C  and  the  results  obtained

as  the  fastest  response  and  recovery  speeds,  the  variety  of  EMF −176  mV,   and  the  90%  response  and  recovery  times  were  10 was  and  35  s,  respectively.  However,  when  the  doping  concentration  of EMF   sharply  decreased,  and  the V2O5 was   increased  further,  the  response  and  recovery  speeds  also  become  slow.  The  dependence  of the  sensing  performance  on  V2O5 the  doping  concentration  could be  explained  as  following:  in  the  case  of  the  small  V2O5 doping concentration,  V2O5 can  uniformly  be  loaded  on  the  surface  of  TiO2 with  small  particle  size  and  show  high  electrochemical  activity  to SO2,  inducing  high  response  and  speedy  response  kinetics;  in  the case  of  the  high  V2O5 doping  concentration,  the  V2O5 particle  size can  observably  grow  and  even  become  a  single  crystal  phase,  resulting  in  the  decreases  of  electrochemical  activity,  the  response  to  SO2 and  the  response/recovery  speeds.  It  was  also  seen  that  the  sensor using  5%  V2O5–TiO2showed  a  good  selectivity  to  SO2 against  NO, NO2,  CH4,  CO,  NH3 and  CO2,  as  well  as  speedy  response  kinetics,  as shown  in  Fig.  13.

C-doped  Cr2O3-attached  NH3 sensor.  A  high  performance NH3 sensor  was  also  developed  by  using  a  porous  Cr2O3 electrode which  was  prepared  by  doping  10%  carbon  nanotube  [60].  The sensor  using  the  porous  Cr2O3 electrode  shows  higher  sensitivity (slope)  to  NH3 at  350 ◦C,  compared  to  that  using  Cr2O3 particle electrode,  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.  From  SEM  images  of  the  porous Cr2O3 and  the  Cr2O3 particles,  it  was  seen  that  a  lot  of  apertures appeared  on  the  surface  of  the  porous  Cr2O3,  this  could  resulted from  that  the  carbon  reacted  with  the  oxygen  in  the  air  when  it was   sintered  at  high  temperature.  Therefore,  the  adsorption  and diffusion  of  ammonia  through  the  porous  Cr2O3 electrode  were much  facile  than  that  through  the  pure  Cr2O3.  This  could  increase the  amount  of  the  ammonia  molecule  that  participated  in  the

are  shown  in  Fig.  11.  The  cross-sensitivities  were  rather  small  or almost  none,  indicating  its  excellent  Cl2 selectivity.

V2O5–TiO2-attached  SO2 sensor.  A  high  performance  SO2 sensor  was  also  developed  by  combining  NASICON  with  V2O5doped  TiO2 sensing  electrode  [59].  The  inﬂuence  of  V2O5 doping concentration  on  the  sensing  characteristics  of  the  sensor  was investigated,  and  the  result  was  shown  in  Fig.  12.  The  variety  of −70  mV EMF   of  the  sensor  based  on  pure  TiO2 to  50  ppm  SO2 was  at  300 ◦C  and  the  90%  response  and  recovery  times  were  5  and  25  s, respectively.  A  small  amount  of  V2O5 doping  (<5  wt%)  could  largely improve  the  sensitivity  of  sensor.  When  the  V2O5 doping  concentration  was  5  wt%,  the  sensor  showed  the  largest  response  as  well

sensing  electrodes  was  designed  for  detecting  NH3 and  C7H8 simultaneously.  The  sensor  was   fabricated  using  a  small  alumina  tube as  shown  in  Fig.  16  [61].  The  C-doped  Cr2O3 and  ZnO–TiO2 were covered  on  the  mesh-shaped  Au  electrode  at  the  two  ends  on  the NASICON  layer  as  the  sensing  electrodes,  and  the  mesh-shaped  Au electrode  at  the  central  section  was  used  as  reference  electrode. The  thickness  of  the  sensing  electrodes  was  approximately  0.5  mm. Here,  C-doped  Cr2O3 and  ZnO–TiO2 were  named  as  the  electrode  A and  B,  respectively,  and  the  corresponding  sensors  as  the  sensor  A and  B.  Fig.  17(a)  shows  the  correlations  between  the  EMF   and  the logarithm  of  the  toluene  concentration  for  the  sensors  A  and  B.  It could  be  seen  that  the  sensitivities  of  sensor  A  using  C-doped  Cr2O3 sensing  electrode  to  toluene  were  very  small  at  250–400 ◦C.  On  the other  hand,  the  sensor  B  using  ZnO–TiO2 sensing  electrode  exhibited  large  sensitivities  to  toluene  at  250–400 ◦C,  the  slopes  were −43,  −42  mV/decade  at  250,  300,  350  and  400 ◦C, respectively.  Fig.  17(b)  shows  the  dependence  of  the  EMFs  of  the sensor  with  double  electrodes  on  the  ammonia  concentration.  The EMF   values  of  the  sensor  A  and  B  were  almost  proportional  to the  logarithm  of  the  ammonia  concentration,  and  the  slopes  of the  sensor  A  were  much  larger  than  those  of  the  sensor  B  at  any operating  temperatures.  When  the  sensor  with  double  electrodes was   placed  in  the  toluene  atmosphere,  due  to  the  large  difference  of  the  sensitivities  between  the  sensor  B  and  A  at  300 ◦C,  it can  selectively  detect  C7H8 at  300 ◦C.  On  the  other  hand,  the  sensor  with  double  electrodes  shows  high  response  to  ammonia  at 350 ◦C.  Moreover  the  sensor  with  double  electrodes  exhibited  well selectivity  and  rapid  response-recovery  characteristics  to  NH3 and C7H8.

Sensor  with  buried  structure.  A  buried  structure  sensing device  was   developed  by  using  Cr2O3 electrode,  which  can  effectively  prevent  the  reaction  of  the  target  gas  on  reference  electrode EMF   on  the  Cl2 concen[62].  Fig.  18  shows  the  dependence  of  tration  for  different  type  of  sensing  devices  (type  A:  conventional device,  type  B:  simple  buried  device  and  type  C:  deep-buried −270  mV/decade, device),  the  sensitivity  (-slope)  for  the  type  C  was   which  is  much  higher  than  those  for  type  (A)  (−119  mV/decade) and  type  (B)  (−157  mV/decade).This  indicated  that  covered  reference  electrode  with  NASICON  in  Type  B  and  C  can  block  the contact  of  RE  with  the  Cl2 and  restrain  electrochemical  reaction in  the  reference  electrode.  The  sensing  response  (potential  difference  between  the  sensing  and  reference  electrode)  as  well  as the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  has  been  obviously  increased.  The other  way   to  enhance  the  sensitivity  is  to  increase  the  effective area  of  the  sensing  electrode.  For  the  sensor  A  and  B,  because the  sensing  electrode  and  reference  electrode  were  located  at both  ends  of  the  same  NASICON  layer,  the  area  of  the  sensing electrode  was  reduced  to  about  one  half  of  the  surface  area  of the  ﬁrst  NASICON  layer.  However,  for  Type  C,  since  the  sensing electrode  almost  covers  the  all  of  the  surface  area  of  the  second NASICON  layer  (Fig.  18(C)),  the  area  of  the  sensing  electrode  is greatly  enlarged,  and  then  the  sensitivity  of  the  Type  C  is  obviously enhanced.

To  discuss  the  mechanism  of  mixed-potential,  polarization (I–V)  curves  were  measured  in  the  air  and  Cl2 with  Type  C at  the  concentration  of  5  ppm  and  10  ppm  at  300 ◦C,  respectively.  In  Fig.  19,  the  curves  measured  in  the  air  acted  as  anodic polarization  curves,  meanwhile,  the  value  difference  between the  air  and  Cl2 (5  ppm  and  10  ppm,  respectively)  was  served as  modiﬁed  cathode  polarization  curves.  Thus,  potential  difference  could  be  reckoned  by  the  intersection  point  which  was −332  mV.  They  were  rather  close  to  the  measurable −249  and  −325  mV.   It  showed  that  the  mixedvalue  which  was   potential  mechanism  gave  an  extremely  credible  explication  to  the mechanism.

electrochemical  reactions  in  the  triple  phase  boundary,  inducing the  sharply  increasing  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  to  ammonia.

ZnO–TiO2-attached  C7H8 sensor.  In  addition,  we  have developed  the  NASICON  based  toluene  sensor  using  ZnO–TiO2 elecEMF   of  the  device trode  as  sensing  electrode.  Fig.  15  shows  that  attached  with  ZnO–TiO2 is  perfectly  linear  to  the  logarithm  of  C7H8 −20  mV/decade  at −90  and  concentration,  and  the  slopes  are  300,  350  and  400 ◦C,  respectively.  The  sensor  had  speedy  response kinetics  to  toluene,  the  90%  response  and  recovery  times  to  5,  10,  20 and  50  ppm  toluene  were  15,  10,  8,  5  s  and  25,  39,  50,  90  s,  respectively.  It  was  also  seen  that  the  sensor  showed  a  good  selectivity  to toluene.

In  order  to  improve  the  sensing  performance  and  realize  simple sensor  array,  we  also  focused  on  designing  new  device  structures, such  as  the  dual-function  sensor  using  double  oxide  electrodes and  the  buried  structure  device  for  blocking  the  electrochemical reactions  on  the  reference  electrode.

Sensing  mechanism  of  our  NASICON-based  mixed-potential type  sensors

For  the  sensor  based  on  NASICON  and  an  oxide  electrode,  the sensing  mechanism  involved  in  the  mixed  potential  was  proposed  [57–61].  Here,  as  an  example,  the  sensing  mechanism  of the  SO2 sensor  using  the  V2O5-doped  TiO2electrode  is  described [59].  Firstly,  the  SO2 sensor  can  be  expressed  with  the  following

When  the  SO2 sensor  was   exposed  to  SO2,  a  couple  of  electrochemical  reactions  (7)  and  (8)  take  place  at  the  sensing  electrode simultaneously.

These  two   electrochemical  reactions  construct  a  local  cell  at  the sensing  electrode,  when  the  rates  of  the  reactions  were  equal  to each  other,  they  arrive  at  a  dynamic  equilibrium,  and  the  electrode potential  at  the  sensing  electrode  was   the  mixed  potential.  By  treating  Eqs.  (7)  and  (8)  with  the  same  process  described  in  [57–61],  we could  obtain  the  following  equation: EM =

RT 2(˛1 + Here  CO2 and  CSO2 are  the  concentrations  of  O2 and  SO2,  and  E0, m  and  n  are  the  constants,  F  the  Faraday  constant,  R  the  gas  constant and  T  the  absolute  temperature,    represent  transfer  coefﬁcient, respectively.  EM is  the  electrode  potential  of  the  sensing  electrode and  called  a  mixed  potential.  The  constants  A,  n  and  m  changed  with the  operating  temperature.  When  the  concentration  of  oxygen  is ﬁxed,  the  mixed  potential  changes  linearly  with  the  logarithm  of the  concentration  of  SO2,  as  described  in  Eq.  (10). EM =

Here,  Eq.  (10)  could  explain  the  experimental  results  very  well.  Similar  reactions  also  occur  at  the  reference  electrode,  but  since  the reference  electrode  was  blocked  or  had  lower  activity  to  the  target  gases,  the  response  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  the  sensing electrode.

For  the  other  sensors  based  on  NASICON  and  oxide  electrodes, similar  sensing  mechanisms  can  be  applied  for  explaining  their sensing  behavior.  As  for  the  detail  of  the  sensing  mechanism,  the further  investigation  is  necessary.
