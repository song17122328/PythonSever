The Na+ super-ionic conductor Na3Zr2(SiO4)2(PO4), known as the original NASICON material, is a promisingsolid-state electrolyte that can be used for sodium batteries.
A solution-assisted solid state reaction (SA-SSR)method has been developed for its synthesis.
The method is convenient, low-cost, and has potential for largescale production.
The total conductivity of the sample synthesized by SA-SSR is 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C,which is one of the highest reported data of this composition after conventional processing of the ceramic powder.
To rationalize the advantages of themethod, a comparison of powders and ceramics prepared by the Pechiniand SA-SSR methods was carried out.
Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopywereused to investigate the products of both synthesis routes and the possible reasons of the high quality ofSA-SSR samples are discussed.
