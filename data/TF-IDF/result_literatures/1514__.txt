Single crystals of the title compound, trisodium divanadium(III) tris(orthophosphate), were grown from a self-flux in the system Na4P2O7–NaVP2O7. N a3V2(PO4)3 belongs to the family of NASICON-related structures and is built up from isolated [VO6] octahedra (3. symmetry) and [PO4] tetrahedra (.2 symmetry) interlinked via corners to establish the framework anion [V2(PO4)3]3?. The two independent Na+ cations are partially occupied [site-occupancy factors = 0.805 (18) and 0.731 (7)] and are located in channels with two different oxygen environments, viz sixfold coordination for the first (3. symmetry) and eightfold for the second (.2 symmetry) Na+ cation.

The structures and properties of complex phosphates with general formula Na3MIII2(PO4)3 (MIII - Sc, Fe, Cr) have been intensively investigated, for instance: (Collin et al., 1986; Genkina et al., 1991; Lazoryak et al., 1980; Lucazeau et al., 1986; Masquelier et al., 1992; Susman et al., 1983). The structure of NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3, (I), is reported here. In the asymmetric unit of (I) (Fig. 1) there is one V and one P atom, while other,atoms (Na and O) are represented in two distinct positions each. The main building block of (I) (Fig. 2) involves two VO6 octahedra interlinked by three phosphate groups lying along the c axis. As a result of the block aggregation, a three-dimensional framework with an overall composition of [V2(PO4)3]3- is organized (Fig. 3). Sodium atoms are located in the voids of the framework with six- (position 6b) and eightfold (18b) coordination when a cut-off distance of 2.9 Å is considered.

Crystals of (I) were obtained in the system Na4P2O7—NaVP2O7 using a high-temperature crystallization technique. Initial NaVP2O7 was prepared in accordance to Zatovsky et al. (1999). A thoroughly ground mixture of Na4P2O7 and NaVP2O7 (ratio 1:3) was heated up to 1343 K and then kept for 2 h in a sealed silica tube under vacuum. Then it was cooled down to 823 K with a rate of 5 K/h and left in the furnace to reach room temperature. The final product, green prismatic crystals, was leached out from the solidified melt with boiling water.

After refinement of a basic model and an accurate definition of the atom positions, the occupancy of Na1 and Na2 sites were refined freely and were finally restrained to meet the criterion for charge balance. The highest peak and the deepest hole in the final difference map is located at 0.00 Å from Na1 (1.12 e/Å3) and 0.60 from Na2 (-0.74 e/Å3) respectively.

All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes) are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic) treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s. planes.

Refinement of F2 against ALL reflections. The weighted R-factor wR and goodness of fit S are based on F2, conventional R-factors R are based on F, with F set to zero for negative F2. The threshold expression of F2 > σ(F2) is used only for calculating Rfactors(gt) etc. and is not relevant to the choice of reflections for refinement. R-factors based on F2 are statistically about twice as large as those based on F, and R- factors based on ALL data will be even larger.
