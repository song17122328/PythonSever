Although the NASICON-type of Na3V2(PO4)3 is regarded as a potential cathodecandidate for advanced sodium ion batteries (SIBs), it behaves undesirable rateperformance and low cyclability, which are resulted from its poor electronicconductivity.
Here, we utilized conductive polyaniline (PANI) grown in situ to obtainthe hard carbon coated porous Na3V2(PO4)3@C composite (NVP@C@HC) with atypically simple and effective sol-gel process.
Based on the restriction of doublecarbon layers, the NVP size decreases distinctly, which can curtail sodium iondiffusion distance and enhance the electronic conductivity.
As expected, the productdisplays good discharge capacity (111.6 mA h g-1 at 1 C), outstanding rate capacity(60.4 mA h g-1 at 50 C) and remarkable cycling stability (63.3 mA h g-1 with retentionof 83.3 % at 40 C over 3000 cycles).
Also, it performs a long-term cycling capacity of58.5 mA h g-1 exceeding 15000 cycles at 20 C-rate (with the capacity-loss of 0.24 %per cycle).
