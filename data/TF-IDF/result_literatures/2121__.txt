The crystal structures of polycrystalline rhombohedral  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 obtained through Na T Li ion exchange have been determined for the first time, from neutron diffraction data recorded at 473 and 300 K, respectively. Na3Fe2(PO4)3 crystallizes in the space group R3hc at 473 K ( 231)-form, a ) 8.7270(2) Å, and c ) 21.8078(5) Å). A progressive transfer of Na+ ions from the M(1) (6-coordinate) to the M(2) (8-coordinate) sites occurs upon raising the temperature from ambient (R-form,  244)M(1) ) 1) to 393 K ( 226)-form,  244)M(1) ) 0.91) and then to 473 K ( 231)-form,  244)M(1) ) 0.85). This is associated with a significant increase of Fe-Fe distances through the M(1) site and with relaxation of the framework such that the FeO6 octahedra become less distorted. Ion exchange from Na3Fe2(PO4)3 leads to the rhombohedral form of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (space group R3h; a ) 8.3162(4) Å, and c ) 22.459(1) Å). The M(1) and M(2) sites of the NASICON structure are empty in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 which is isotypic with Li3In2(PO4)3. Removal of Na+ from M(1) results in a strong increase of the c parameter due to stronger repulsions between adjacent FeO6 octahedral faces along [001]. Lithium is located on one single-crystallographic site, M(3), with four Li-O distances ranging between 1.91 and 2.09 Å which span a regular tetrahedral geometry and gives rise to one signal in the 6Li spectrum at 152 ppm. Two crystallographic sites are clearly distinguished for iron: Fe(1)O6 shares three of its vertexes only with LiO4 tetrahedra and is far more distorted than Fe(2)O6 which shares three edges with LiO4 tetrahedra.

Li1-xFePO4 and LixFe2(SO4)3 where reduction/oxidation of Fe3+/Fe2+ occurs at desirable potentials close to 3.5 V versus Li/Li+.4,8,14 Importantly, this potential can be “tuned” by modification to the substituents in the 2structure: for example, substitution of PO4 in the “lantern unit” [Fe2(XO4)3] shifts the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple by 0.8 eV through the inductive effect of the polyanion. A generalized mapping of transitionmetal redox couples was recently proposed,10 as a npolyanion and function of (1) the nature of the XO4 (2) the connectivity between FeO6 octahedra. Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was shown to reversibly intercalate two lithium ions at an average voltage of 2.8 V versus Li/Li+ corresponding to the total reduction of Fe3+ into Fe2+.8,17 Depending on the preparation route, two distinct crystallographic forms of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 may be obtained,

which show distinct behavior upon Li intercalation.17 Li3Fe2(PO4)3 can be prepared in a rhombohedral form through ion exchange from the NASICON sodium analogue Na3Fe2(PO4)3 21 and no structural work has been reported so far on that form. Our interest lies in determining the structural factors that impact the electrochemical behavior of the two polymorphs of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 upon lithiation, that is, for compositions Li3+xFe2(PO4)3, 0 e x e 2. Here, we report on detailed structural studies using neutron powder diffraction of the two rhombohedral NASICON A3Fe2(PO4)3 (A ) Na, Li) compositions. The structure of the  231)-form of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was determined from data collected at 473 K. A comparison is drawn with the Rand  226)-forms previously reported,22,23 which allows for a general discussion on NASICON framework modifications associated with the alkali ion transfer from M(1) to M(2) sites. This phenomenon is further supported by the study of the rhombohedral form of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 where both M(1) and M(2) sites are emptied.

Na3Fe2(PO4)3 was prepared following the method of d’Yvoire,21 through crystallization in a flux of sodium phosphates that leads to high-purity fine white powders. A mixture of Fe2O3 + 3.6 NaH2PO4 + 2.2 Na4P2O7 was placed in a platinum crucible

and heated to complete melting at 1193 K for 5 h. After cooling at 2 K/min, the solid was immersed in water and washed repeatedly to dissolve and remove the excess sodium phosphates. Rhombohedral Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was then prepared by three successive ion exchanges (1 day each) in a concentrated aqueous solution of LiNO3 (Lisolution/Nasolid > 10). The phase purity was carefully monitored by X-ray diffraction on a Philips diffractometer (CuKR radiation) equipped with a graphitediffracted beam monochromator.

Neutron diffraction experiments were performed at the Orphe´e reactor at the Laboratoire Le´on Brillouin in Saclay, France. The neutron powder diffractometer G4.2 ( 236) ) 2.3433 Å) was used for a precise determination of the lattice parameters at room temperature of R-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3. The high-resolution neutron powder diffractometer 3T2 was used for data collection with high direct space resolution ( 236) ) 1.2251 Å; Qmax ) 9.2 Å-1). The program FullProf was used for crystal structure refinements, employing the Rietveld method.25,26

They are the result of a superstructure cell presumably because of long-range sodium ordering on the M(1) and M(2) sites of the NASICON structure. These superstructure reflections were clearly identified by d’Yvoire et al. from a singlecrystal study,21,23 but never to our knowledge from a powder diffraction experiment. The true unit cell is then a ) 15.128(1) Å, b ) 8.721(1) Å, c ) 21.564(1) Å, and  226) ) 90.14(1)° in the probable space group C2/c. No detailed study of the superstructure has been published as of yet.

It is well-known that Na3Fe2(PO4)3 undergoes two reversible phase transitions: R T  226) at 368 K and  226) T  231) at 418 K21,27 related to order/disorder rearrangements on the sodium sites within the [Fe2(PO4)3]¥ framework. In the average description of the structure of the roomtemperature form (R), the occupation factors of the NASICON M(1) and M(2) alkali sites are 1 and 2/3, respectively,22,23 but the exact nature of the orderedsodium distribution in the supercell is still unknown. The crystal structure of the  226)-form at 393 K was also determined: compared to the room-temperature form R, there is an important transfer of Na+ ions from the Na(1) site to the Na(2) site, their occupation factors becoming 0.91(2) and 0.70(2), respectively, but with persistence of long-range ordering on the Na(2) sites.22 There are no structural data reported so far on the rhombohedral form  231) of Na3Fe2(PO4)3.

We have determined the crystal structure of  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 using neutron diffraction ( 236) ) 1.2251 Å) at 473 K on a powder sample, far above the  226) f  231) phase transition. Profile-matching refinements gave lattice parameters a ) 8.727(1) Å and c ) 21.807(1) Å in space group R3hc, in very good agreement with those obtained from X-ray data.22 Note that there is a substantial increase in the c parameter as the temperature is raised (c ) 21.569(3) Å in the pseudohexagonal R-form; c ) 21.733(5) Å in the  226)-form). The atomic coordinates of  231)-Na3Cr2(PO4)3 in space group R3hc23 were used as the starting model for the Rietveld refinements, for which the initial occupancy factors on the Na(1) and Na(2) sites were taken to be equal to those of the  226)-form. The refinement converged rapidly to satisfactory agreement factors and the thermal parameters to reasonable values. The thermal parameters on the Na(1) and Na(2) sites were refined first with the occupation factors kept equal to those of the R-form. Then, the isotropic temperature factors were kept constant to allow refinement of the occupation factors for which the sum was constrained to lead to 3 Na per formula unit. A significant improvement of the crystal structure was then obtained by refining the anisotropic thermal parameters on the Na(1) and Na(2) sites. The final agreement factors are listed in Table 1, and the list of fractional coordinates is given in Table 2. Selected interatomic

The structure is entirely described in the space group R3hc using the 6 independent atomic positions of the NASICON structure. The framework is built of [Fe2(PO4)3] “lantern units” stacked parallel to the [001] direction (Figure 2). The local symmetries around Fe and P are 3 and 2, respectively, with Fe-O and P-O average bond lengths (Table 3) characteristic of Fe3+ and P5+ in octahedral and tetrahedral coordination environments, respectively. The sodium ions are distributed over two crystallographic sites. The point symmetry of the 6-coordinate M(1) that lies along [001], between two [Fe2(PO4)3] lantern units is 3. The point symmetry of M(2) is 2; it is 8-coordinated and lies at the same z value as the phosphorus atom.

One first interesting phenomenon in the structure of  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 lies in the values of the occupation

of Fe-O(1) (1.956 Å) while the O(2)-Fe-O(2) angle (83.8°) is lower than the O(1)-Fe-O(1) angle (97.1°). Examination of the Fe-Fe distances along [001] shows that the increase in the c parameter on going from R f  226) f  231) is only due to the increase of the M(1) cavity height as it is progressively depopulated: the Fe-Fe distance within the lantern unit remains the same as that in the  226)-form (4.417(2) Å) while the Fe-Fe distance through the M(1) cavity increases from 6.449(2) Å in the  226)-form to 6.487(2) Å in the  231)-form.

Crystal Structure of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (Rhombohedral R3h). Ion exchange of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 in a concentrated LiNO3 solution allows the preparation of a Li3Fe2(PO4)3 composition where the relative positions of the [Fe2(PO4)3] lantern units are those of the NASICON structure, in contrast to that observed for the monoclinic (P21/n) form.21 The X-ray diffraction pattern presented in Figure 4 is fully indexed with lattice parameters a ) 8.309(1) Å and c ) 22.462(1) Å in the

space group R3h. The indexed powder X-ray diffraction data are given in Table 4. The presence of the (303) reflection at 2ı ) 39.45° definitely rules out the space group R3hc previously proposed.21,17 Note the very strong increase in the c parameter as Na+ is replaced by Li+. From the previous discussion on  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 it follows that there might be a global redistribution of lithium within the framework, in particular, owing to the smaller size of Li+ that does not favor occupation of the large 6and 8-coordinated M(1) and M(2) cavities. The lattice parameters of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 determined from powder neutron diffraction ( 236) ) 1.2251 Å) are a ) 8.3162(4) Å and c ) 22.459(1) Å in the space group R3h. An initial series of Rietveld refinements was undertaken

by using the atomic coordinates of  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (R3hc) transformed in the space group R3h, including lithium in positions derived from the Na(1) and Na(2) sites of the NASICON structure. It became immediately obvious that the occupation of these sites by lithium was very unlikely. Instead, we used the fractional coordinates of Li3In2(PO4)3 reported by Genkina,28 which crystallizes also in the space group R3h, as the starting model for the Rietveld refinements. As we shall describe in detail, we found that Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is indeed isotypic with Li3In2(PO4)3 28 and that the alkali cations that reside on the Na(1) and Na(2) sites of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 are redistributed on a new 4-fold-coordinated site that we label M(3) in Li3Fe2(PO4)3. The experimental, calculated, and difference profiles are given in Figure 5. The final agreement factors, fractional coordinates, and selected interatomic distances and angles are given in Tables 1, 5, and 6, respectively. The loss in symmetry on going from the space group R3hc for  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 to R3h for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 induces a splitting of the unique iron site of the sodium analogue to two independent iron sites, Fe(1) and Fe(2), that still lie on the 3-fold axis (Figure 2). There is still one unique crystallographic site for P and each of the 2 oxygen sites of the sodium analogue is split into two independent sites, O(i) and O(i¢ ). The M(1) site of  231)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 also splits into two M(1a) and M(1b) sites, both unoccupied in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 but that should be differentiated in respect to further discussion on Li location in the structure.

Lithium Environment. The most important feature of the crystal structure of rhombohedral Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is that the 6-coordinated M(1) site of the NASICON structure is empty. This is no surprise, indeed, as this cavity in R-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 is far too big (Na(1)-O ) 2.44 Å) to sustain the smaller Li+ ion. Following the general trend observed through the transitions R f  226) f  231) in Na3Fe2(PO4)3, there is thus a strong increase in the c parameter when M(1) is depopulated. This phenomenon has been previously discussed on going from LiTi2(PO4)3

By analogy to what we have found for Li3Fe2(PO4)3, we suspect that, in Li3Ti2(PO4)3, the M(2) site should not be occupied either. In Li3Fe2(PO4)3, lithium occupies one crystallographic site in the general position (18f) of R3h which we call M(3). This site is not the M(2) site of the NASICON structure (8-coordinated) but is slightly shifted ( 24)(0.8 Å) along [001] and lies in a fairly regular tetrahedral coordination with an average Li-O distance of 2.03 Å (Table 6). This favors total occupancy and the relatively small value of the isotropic thermal parameter indicates that lithium is somewhat localized in this cavity, although mobility may still be higher than that in the monoclinic phase, A-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 as suggested by a comparative study of ionic conductivity in both Aand B-forms of Li3Cr2(PO4)3.21

The location of Li in a single site in the lattice is also confirmed by our solid-state MAS 6,7Li NMR studies. Spectra were acquired at 4.68 T to minimize paramagnetic relaxation effects, using natural abundance 6Li NMR which affords better spectral resolution, although this necessitated a long spectral acquisition time. The M(3) tetrahedral LiO4 site exhibits a single resonance at 162 ppm similar to that in isostructural Li3V2(PO4)3 where the corresponding 6Li shift for Li occupation in M(3) is observed at 88 ppm.30

MAS NMR investigations of rhombohedral Li3Fe2(PO4)3 were also carried out with 7Li (to facilitate more rapid spectral acquisition). Spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 were characterized by very rapid decay in the time domain, suggesting that rapid relaxation behavior occurs for Li in these sites. This is due to a combination of paramagnetic relaxation as a result of through-space 7Li coupling to the electron spin on the Fe3+ ion and/or spinrelaxation effects due to Li mobility. Comparison to the monoclinic phase (space group P21/n) of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, which has similar Li+-Fe3+ distances, suggests that paramagnetic interaction is not the only effect however, as there were still very noticeable differences in the relaxation behavior that must be related to differences in ion hopping in the structures. Work is in progress to investigate this in detail.

Lithium Distribution within the Framework. A close examination of the relative positions of the lithium ions within the framework was undertaken. The results are shown in Figures 6-8. The Li+ ions are arranged in layers perpendicular to [001] and are related to each other by the inversion centers of R3h. These layers are

Mater., Vol. 12, No. 2, 2000 531 6 oxygen atoms O(2¢ ) of a given Li6O18 ring all belong to the empty M(1a)O6 elongated octahedron; thus, each LiO4 tetrahedron shares one corner with the Fe(1)O6 octahedron. Figure 7 also clearly indicates that each LiO4 tetrahedron shares an edge (O(2)-O(1¢ )) with a given Fe(2)O6 octahedron. Within an Li6O18 ring, each lithium is surrounded by two lithiums at 3.36(2) Å. The Li-Li shortest distance between neighboring Li6O18 rings, on the other hand, is 3.78(2) Å. The lithium distribution, is thus fairly regular and seems to represent an electrostatic ordering onto fully occupied welldefined crystallographic positions. This suggests that there may be an effect on the ionic conductivity in this particular form of the NASICON structure; the peculiar “bilayered” arrangement of the lithium positions could restrict it to being two-dimensional in character. The values of the anisotropic thermal factors that were successfully refined for the Li site fully support this assumption (Table 5): they are far more important within the (a,b) plane than along the [001] direction. Iron Environment. The peculiar distribution of lithium within the framework generates different constraints on the Fe(1)O6 and Fe(2)O6 octahedra. These two sites, equivalent in R3hc, are independent in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 as a result of different Li environments. As seen in Figure 8, Fe(1)O6 shares three of its corners (O(2¢ )) with three different LiO4 tetrahedra. On the contrary, Fe(2)O6 shares all its corners (O(1¢ ) and O(2)), through three edges in common, with three different LiO4 tetrahedra (Figure 7). This results in very different bond-lengths distributions and distortions in these two octahedra (Table 6) as indicated by a bond valence calculation. The very good quality of the refinement is further supported by the quite low (0.14) global instability index, defined in ref 31. In Fe(1)O6, the three Fe-O(2¢ ) bonds (with oxygen that also belongs to LiO4 tetrahedra) are far much longer (2.063(5) Å) than the three Fe-O(1) ones (1.929(6) Å) as O(2¢ )s participate in Li coordination, but O(1) does not. Fe(2)O6, which is regularly surrounded by Li, on the contrary, is much less distorted. As already discussed for the sodium analogue, depopulation of the M(1) site in the NASICON framework results in a strong increase of the c parameter. We distinguished, in the previous section, two Fe-Fe distances along [001] depending on whether the iron atoms belong to the same lantern unit or not (4.417(2) and 6.487(2) Å). Here, because of the loss of R3hc symmetry, there are three Fe-Fe distances along [001] and the c parameter decomposes according to the following sequence: Fe(1)Fe(2) (4.515(5) Å) + Fe(2)-Fe(2) (6.865(5) Å) + Fe(2)Fe(1) (4.515(5) Å) + Fe(1)-Fe(1) (6.564(5) Å) (Figure 6). The strongest repulsion occurs therefore between Fe(2) and Fe(2) adjacent octahedral faces that are not “screened” by alkali cations, that is, through the empty M(1b) cavity (Figure 6). One notes, however, that the Fe(1)-Fe(2) distance within a lantern unit is also significantly increased too ( 24)+0.1 Å) and this might cause some structural instability that would favor the transformation to the monoclinic (P21/n) stable form of Li3Fe2(PO4)3.

This study represents the first step of our global research on the structural behavior of three-dimensional polyanionic frameworks based on the NASICON structure: Li3(xM2(PO4)3 (M ) Fe, V). By examining the same fundamental structure type, A3Fe2(PO4)3, where A ) Li, Na, and the phase changes that occur with temperature, we obtained structural results that revealed the exceptional flexibility of the NASICON framework MM¢ (XO4)3 and demonstrated that the nature of the alkali cation also plays a major role in effecting changes to the framework structure. These detailed studies are also important in the context of alkali insertion or extraction during electrochemical redox processes because these materials are viable positive electrode materials in Li batteries. For example, insertion of 2 lithium (reduction of Fe3+ into Fe2+) in rhombohedral Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was recently demonstrated.17 Ex situ experiments suggest

that the resulting 5 lithium ions are accommodated within the same NASICON framework.32 Future work will focus on structural and electrochemical studies of this insertion process, and on the corresponding extraction process from the isostructural compound Li3V2(PO4)3.
