Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract extensive attention as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their abundant reserves and low cost for large-scale energy storage systems. Among the electrode materials for sodium ion battery, Na3V2(PO4)2F3(NVPF), with the NASICON structure, has a unique three-dimensional (3D) channel, suitable voltage plateau and high thermal stability. However, it suffers from the low intrinsic electronic conductivity. In this work, we successfully synthesis a hierarchical hollow NVPF@C microspheres assembled from mesoporous nanosheets, and the possible formation process is systematically explored by changing the reaction time, solvent ratio and glucose dosage. At the same time, these microspheres are wrapped in graphene (marked as NVPF@C@rGO) to further improve their electrochemical performance. As a half-cell cathode, the NVPF@C@10wt% rGO microspheres exhibit excellent rate performance (95 mAh g-1 at 2 C) and cycle stability (78.2% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 5 C). It can be attributed to the hierarchical hollow morphology and graphene packages, which provide continuous electron and ion channels, large electrolyte contact areas and stable structure. This work will provide a viable method for designing high-power NIBs.
Lithium-ion battery has been commercialized as an indispensable energy storage device since the 1980s because of its high voltage and high energy density [1-3]. However, with the rapidly increasing demand of electronic devices and large-scale energy storage, the price of lithium-ion batteries is increasing, which will undoubtedly fail to meet future market demands [4,5]. Therefore, the development of lithium-ion battery replacement is imminent. Among many alternatives, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more and more attention due to their rich resource and low cost [6-8]. However, the larger radius of Na+ results in the poor rate capability, lower energy density and poor cycle performance for SIBs [9,10]. Therefore, more and more researchers are devoted to exploring new electronic materials with stable structure and large open space for rapid migration of Na+. At present, the cathode materials for sodium ion batteries mainly include layered transition metal oxides (TMO) [11-13], fluoride  [14], phosphate [15,16], hexacyanoferrate [17] and organic compounds [18]. Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3F3(NVPF) with NASICON type structure shows unique advantages, such as good thermal stability, high operating voltage and 3D open skeleton for larger channels for rapid transfer of sodium ions [19,20]. However, the inherent low electronic conductivity typically results in poor rate performance, unsatisfactory cycle stability and low energy density [21], which greatly hinders its practical application.
Designing and synthesizing materials with micro-nano hierarchical structure is an effective method to improve the electrochemical performance of materials. This is because although the nano-sized particles can increase the contact area with the electrolyte, it is beneficial to show high rate performance, but the micro-nano particles are prone to agglomeration during the electrochemical reaction, and there is a higher Contact resistance, which greatly affects the performance of the material, but the micro-nano hierarchical structure can reduce the contact resistance between the material and the electrolyte while maintaining the high rate performance of the nanoparticles. In addition, metal ion doping, surface carbon coating or combining with carbon material are widely used to enhance the conductivity of NVPF. For instance, Zhang et. al. successfully synthesized Mn-doped Na3V2(PO4)2F3 hollow microspheres assembled from nanosheets and nanoparticles, which delivered a high reversible capacity of 122 mAh g-1 at a rate of 0.2 C [25]. Hou et. al. reported a hierarchical mulberry-shaped Na3V2(PO4)2O2F@C assembled with nanoparticles and it showed 82.1% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 20 C [26]. Shen et. al. prepared nanotube-modified Na3V2(PO4)2F3@C/CNTs composite composed of nanoparticles with an initial discharge capacity of NVPF@C is about 113 mAh g-1 at the current density of 1 C, and still retains 98.2% after 300 cycles [27]. Consequently, it is expected to be an effective strategy that combines suitable morphology design and carbon coating.In this work, we proposed polyol-assisted hydrothermal approach to synthesize hierarchical hollow NVPF@C microspheres consisted of mesoporous nanosheets for the first time. Furthermore, these microspheres are mixed with graphene oxide and calcined at high temperature to successfully obtain graphene-decorated NVPF@C@rGO composite material. Besides, the growth mechanism of the hollow microspheres was also systematically investigated. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the following advantages of NVPF@C@rGO composites. Frist, the microspheres composed of nanosheets can help shortening the ion and electron diffusion paths. Next, Graphene modification can not only improve the interface conductivity, but also inhibiting the side reactions between the electrode and the electrolyte. It can be found that the NVPF@C@10wt% rGO delivers the best discharge capacity of 118 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C and maintains 61 mA h g-1 after 1500 cycles when the current density increases to 5 C NVPF microspheres are synthesized by polyol-assisted hydrothermal method combined with high temperature calcination, and all reagents and solvents including ammonium vanadate(NH4VO3, ≥99.0%), sodium fluoride(NaF, ≥99.0%), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, ≥95.0%), phosphoric acid(H3PO4, ≥85.0%) and glucose (C6H12O6 ， ≥99.0%) were analytical grade and without further purification. As shown in Fig. 1, 2 mmol NH4VO3 and 0.2 g glucose were dispersed in 5 mL deionized water, and vigorous stirring for 20 min at 30 °C to form a pale-yellow liquid, and then added 30 mL of tetraethylene glycol and stirring well. Secondly, 0.1 mmol Na2CO3 and 0.5 mL phosphoric acid were dissolved in the above solution and continue stirring for 30 min. Finally, the solution as added 3 mmol NaF and stirred for 60 min. Subsequently, the obtained suspension was transferred to a 50 mL Teflon reactor and heated at 180 °C for 20 h in an oven. The precursor was collected by centrifugation with water and ethanol several times, and dried at 70 °C overnight to remove deionized water. The obtained sample was calcined for 4 h in a nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C. This sample was labeled as NVPF@C. Exceptionally, we also synthesized a series of samples by changing the amount of glucose and the ratio of water and tetraethylene glycol to study the effect of reaction conditions on the morphology of the materials.
0.2 g NVPF@C sample without high temperature treatment was dispersed in 30 mL deionized water and ultrasonications for 0.5 h get a suspension. Then, the obtained suspension was added to a GO aqueous solution (0.5 mg mL-1) with continuous stirring at 80 °C until the liquid becomes slurry, and dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained sample was calcined for 4 h in a nitrogen atmosphere at 500 °C. In order to synthesize products with different GO content, different amount of GO aqueous solution are used, where the quality of GO is 5 wt. %, 10 wt. % and 15 wt. %, respectively, the samples were labeled as NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO.
Powder X-ray diffraction is performed by a D8 Advance Bruker diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ =1.5418 Å). Rietveld refinement is conducted on the high quality XRD data using GSAS software. Scanning electron microscope (SEM, EVO 18) is carried out to analyze the surface morphology and particle size of samples. The microstructure and high-resolution transmission of samples were studied by electron microscope (HRTEM, TF20, JEOL 2100F) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS). The crystal structure is obtained using Raman spectroscopy with a laser Raman spectroscope (Raman, inVia) with 532 nm excitation from an argon-ion laser, and a flourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR, Nicolet, IR2000). The specific surface area of the sample was measured using a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurement (TriStar II 3flex). The porosity is estimated from the adsorption isotherm according to the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. A thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA, HQT-4) was used in air to analyze the carbon content of the sample with a heating rate of 5 oC min-1 from room temperature to 700 oC. 
In order to test the electrochemical properties of the composite, CR2032-type cells were assembled with metal sodium as anode and 1 M NaClO4 in a mixture of EC:DEC (1:1 volume) with 2% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as the electrolyte in an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O2 < 0.1 ppm). The working electrodes was an aluminum foil coated with a viscous slurry (active material: acetylene black: polyvinylidene fluoride adhesive, weight ratio: 7:2:1). The capacity and current density are calculated based on the mass of the NVPF@C@rGO materials. In this work, the surface loading of the cathode material is between 1.1–1.3 mg cm-2. The LAND cell test system (CT2001A, Wuhan, China) was utilized to conduct constant current discharge/charge measurement on the half cell at a voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V (vs. Na+/Na). The CV of cells were performed using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation between 2.0–4.5 V vs. Na+/Na. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also measured on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation with a frequency range of 10-2-105 Hz.
In order to further study the structure of NVPF @C, we refined the NVPF@C by a GSAS software, as shown in Fig. 2a. The characteristic peaks of the sample agree well with the single phase of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 indexed to tetragonal NASICON-type lattice with the space group of P42/mm. No characteristic diffraction peaks of carbon were observed, which may be due to the amorphous structure and low content of carbon. The lattice parameters of a, b and c are calculated as 9.052 Å, 9.052 Å and 10.068 Å, respectively (Rp = 8.4%, Rwp = 6.5%, χ2 = 2.668). It is consistent with the reported values of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 [28], confirming the pure phase. As given in Fig. 2b, the 3D frame structure of NVPF can be described by [V2O8F3] double octahedron and [PO4] tetrahedron [29]. The bi-octahedron [V2O8F3] and two [VO4F2] octahedral units are bridged by a fluorine atom, and oxygen atoms are connected to each other through the [PO4] unit. The sodium ions occupy two different interstitial sites (Na1 and Na2) in the overall structure. This special structure makes the Na+ have strong mobility, promoting the reversible intercalation/de-intercalation of Na+ in materials [30]. The morphology of NVPF@C was observed by TEM. As present in Fig. 3a, it shows hierarchical hollow microspheres structure consisting of nanosheets with a diameter of about 2 μm, and the SEM image of Fig. 3c also illustrates it more intuitively. Meanwhile, there are numerous pores with different sizes on the surface of nanosheets (as shown in the illustration in Fig. 3b), which should be conducive to increasing the effective contact area between the material and the electrolyte. In Fig. 3b, we aslo can clearly see that the surface of the sample is coated by an amorphous carbon with the thickness of about 1 nm. Furthermore, there is clear lattice fringes with the spacing of 0.546 nm, assigning to the (111) lattice plane of Na3V2(PO4)2F3. As shown in the element mapping images (Fig. 3e-j), the elements of Na, V, O, P, F and C are uniformly distributed throughout the entire microspheres.
We conducted a series of time-related experiments to clarify the morphological evolution of hierarchical hollow NVPF@C microspheres. SEM images and corresponding TEM images obtained at different reaction times (0-20 h) are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. S1, respectively. It is clearly seen that at the beginning of the hydrothermal reaction (Fig. 4a), the sample is smooth microspheres with a diameter of 1~2 μm. As the hydrothermal reaction time increases, the microspheres become rougher due to the growth of nanosheets on the surface driven by surface energy minimization and etch (dissolve) at the same time. According to Lu et. al. work, the presence of NH4+ adsorbed on one or more certain surfaces of NVPF and it helps etch cations from the surfaces [31]. When the reaction time increased to 20 h, the hollow microspheres assembled by nanosheets are formed. However, the size of the sphere undergoes a process of slow growth first and then slowing down during the entire process (As shown in Fig. 4j). It could be ascribed to the slow nucleation rate (determined by the activation energy of homogeneous nucleation) and nuclei accrue (Oswald ripening). It is also suggested the uniform microspheres are isotropic growth in three directions in the early stage of the hydrothermal reaction. In order to further verify the role of glucose throughout the reaction, we performed a similar time gradient (2-20 h) experiment without glucose. At present in Fig. S2, the microspheres are constructed by nano blocks when the amount of glucose was changed, the growth of microspheres is different.
Morphology of microspheres is optimal when the glucose is 0.2 g. (Fig. S2a-f). The reason why the amount of glucose affects the morphology of the material may be due to the fact that glucose releases a lot of HMF in the initial stage of hydrothermal. The increase of HMF will produce more nucleation points on the surface of the material. Therefore, there are more primary particles constituting the microsphere structure, which is more conducive to the formation of small and thin nanosheets on the surface of the material. This proves that glucose not only acts as a reducing agent throughout the reaction process, but also is a form-directing agent. To investigate the effect of reaction conditions on sample morphology, we changed the ratio of water to triethylene glycol according to the above optimal conditions. And from Fig. S3a-f, we can see that as the amount of triethylene glycol increases, the size and thickness of blocks which constituted the microspheres become smaller and thinner. When the ratio of water to triethylene glycol is 1:7, the microspheres assembled by nanosheets are formed. It may be because the proper amount of triethylene glycol can play a better surface activation, thereby decreasing the surface activation energy and the reaction barrier. It is more favorable the formation of a thin sheet-like structure on the surface of the sphere. We can speculate that the micro-nano hierarchical structure of NVPF@C is formed by the combined action of NH4+, glucose and tetraethylene glycol.
In order to further improve the electrochemical properties of the material, we coated the material with reduced graphene oxide by high temperature calcination. We can see that all NVPF@C microspheres are wrapped by rGO from Fig. S4†. This unique structure of 3D network not only enhances the conductivity of NVPF, but also buffers the stress changes caused by repeated extraction/insertion of sodium ions, further improving the structural stability of the material.
As shown in Fig. S5a, we studied the specific surface area and pore structure of NVPF@C using nitrogen adsorption-desorption technology. The isotherm of NVPF@C belongs to a type IV isothermal adsorption-desorption curve [32], which is characteristic of mesoporous materials. It also can be seen that there are a small number of mesoporous channels on the surface of the material. The surface area of NVPF@C is about 6.69 m2 g-1 as calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett Teller (BET) method and the corresponding Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution curve (inset Figure in Fig. S5a) shows that majority of the pore sizes in NVPF@C are about 17.02 nm. The presence of these mesopores may be more conducive to the rapid penetration of the electrolyte. At the same time, the NVPF@C@rGO composite was characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. S5b, we found that all diffraction peaks are in good agreement with NVPF (JCPDS.no.89-8485), indicating that rGO coating does not affect the phase structure of Na3V2(PO4)2F3. The slight drum peak at the position of 2θ = 27° is related to the rGO [33,34]. As shown in Fig. S5c of the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the carbon content of NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO were 1.02%, 4.85% 8.89% and 12.05%, respectively. The state of carbon in the NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% were investigated by Raman. As shown in Fig. S5d, the two strong bands and broadband appearing near 1326 cm-1 and 1592 cm-1 in the aman spectrum can represent disordered carbon (D-band) and sp2 carbon (G-band), respectively [35,36]. By comparing the ratios of the intensity of the D and G bands (ID/IG) in Table 1, we can find that (ID/IG) value of NVPF@rGO is slightly smaller than NVPF@C, indicating a higher degree of graphitization [37]. This suggested the successful modification of grapheme on NVPF@C. Each sample was further characterized and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as present in Fig. S6. The broadband at 1025–1125 cm-1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration (vas) of the P-O bond in the PO4 tetrahedron, and the bands at 667 and 559 cm-1 also indicate symmetric stretching vibration (vss) and bending vibration (vb) [38]. The vibration of the V-O bond in the VO6 octahedron corresponds to the band at 914 cm-1, and the band at 950 cm-1 also demonstrates the presence of the V-F bond in the sample [39].

(d) Rate performances at various current rates of NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO from 0.1 C to 10 C. (c, e-f) Cycling performance of the NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO at 0.2 C, 1 C and 5 C.
Fig. 5a shows the first galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles of NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO at 0.2 C. The initial discharge specific capacities of NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% were 111, 116, 118 and 115 mAh g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, we can see that all the charge and discharge curves have two obvious charge and discharge platforms around 3.65 V and 4.05 V. This indicates that the rGO does not change the charge and discharge behavior of NVPF@C, but can effectively increase the specific capacity of raw materials. At the same time, the first charge and discharge curves of NVPF@C@10% rGO at different rates (Fig. 5b) also show that the composite with graphene can obtain good rate performance. Fig. 5d shows the rate performances of NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO. We can find that NVPF@C@10% rGO exhibits the best rate performance, from 0.1 C to 10 C rate range, the NVPF@C@10% rGO delivers the highest discharge capacity of 119 mAh g-1 at the initial low rate of 0.1 C. As seen, reversible capacity were 118 mAh g-1 at 0.2 C, 114 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C, 109 mAh g-1 at 1 C, 95 mAh g-1 at 2 C, 76 mAh g-1 at 5 C and 35 mAh g-1 at 10 C, respectively. And when the current density is reset to 0.1 C, the discharge specific capacity of NVPF@C@10% rGO returns to 118 mAh g-1, indicating a good electrochemical reversibility. In contrast, NVPF@C shows worse rate performance, indicating that the introduction of rGO is beneficial to improve the sodium storage capacity of NVPF. As shown in Fig. 5c and e-f, NVPF@C@10% rGO exhibits excellent long-term cycle stability from low to high rates compared to other samples, and exhibits better cycle stability at high rates. Even after 1500 cycles at a high rate of 5 C, it has a stable discharge capacity of 61 mAh g-1 with a 78.2% capacity retention ratio. This is mainly because the nanosheets with pores in the micro-nano hierarchical structure can effectively reduce the diffusion distance of sodium ions. At the same time, the hollow microspheres can effectively avoid the electrochemical agglomeration of the nanosheets during the charge and discharge process, thereby reducing the contact resistance. In addition, the proper amount of reduced graphene oxide not only improves the electrical conductivity of the material, but also further improves the structural stability of the material. Some simple tests were performed on the uncalcined sample (NVPF@C-0) to demonstrate the effect of the pores on the surface of the microsphere, as shown in Fig. S7a, b. It can be seen that the uncalcined sample shows a hollow multi-stage structure, but there were no mesoporous on the surface of nanosheet, and the cycle performance test clearly showed that (Fig. S7c) it delivers worse than that of the calcined sample. One side, due to the enhanced crystallinity of the material during high temperature calcination; on the other side, it may be attributed to the existence of small pores on the surface of the material, which makes a large contact area with the electrolyte. The formation of pores may be due to the presence of residual NH4+ in the material, resulting in a very small amount of NH3 generated during the calcinating process. Furthermore, it can be found that the hierarchical microspheres are stable and do not collapse after 1500 cycles at 5 C rate (see Fig.S8).
To further investigate the reasons for the enhanced electrochemical performance of NVPF@C@10% rGO electrodes, the CV curves of NVPF@C@10% rGO were performed at selected scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 mV s-1 (Fig. 6a). At different scan rates, redox peaks associated with reversible conversion of V4+/V5+ have occurred. And because of the increased polarization, the anode peak moves to the right and the cathode peak shifts to the left [40]. The clear two pairs of redox peaks are shown in the CV curves, indicating a rapid kinetic process. Generally, the energy storage process is divided into a diffusion control process and a capacitance control process [41]. The diffusion behavior or the capacitance behavior of the battery during charge and discharge is determined by correlating the scan rate with the resulting peak current response. For the battery behavior, the peak current is linearly related to v1/2, that is, the process is diffusion control. If it is capacitor behavior, the peak current Ip varies linearly with the scan rates, that is, the process is capacitive control. For the electrode Fig. 6 (a) CV curves at various scan rates. (b) The fitted lines of log ip vs. log v. (c) the contribution of diffusion-controlled capacity (Orange) and pseudocapacitive-controlled capacity (green) at the scan rate of 0.3 mV s-1. (d) The contribution percentage of pseudocapacitive-controlled capacity at different scan rates.
material,the value of b can be calculated by the formula (1) to determine whether there is pseudocapacitive during charging and discharging [42].  Where ip is the measured peak current, ν is the scan rate, and a ,b are adjustable values. If the value of b is 0.5, represents the diffusion controlled electrochemical reaction; if the value of b is in the range of 0.5-1, the electrode material exhibits diffusion controlled process and capacitive-controlled process coexist; if the value of b is ≥1, the electrode material exhibits a total capacitive-controlled process [43]. As shown in Fig. 6b, the b values corresponding to the O1, O2, R1 and R2 redox peaks were 0.81, 0.92, 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. All b values are above 0.5 and closer to 1, indicating that the pseudocapacitive effect dominates throughout the electrochemical process.
The specific contribution of pseudocapacitance and diffusion behavior at different scan rates can be further quantified according to the formula (2). Where ν is the scan rate, V is the specified voltage; k1 and k2 are adjustable parameters. In addition, k1ν and k2ν1/2 represent the pseudocapacitive and diffusion contributions, d k1 value). A plurality of specific voltages (V) is connected to k1ν (i) through a smooth curve for nonlinear fitting (the more voltage points obtained, the more k1 values are obtained, and the more accurate the fitting, the more accurate the pseudocapacitive is for the charge storage calculation). The closed curve of the fit and the CV curve for the specific scan rate are then separately integrated to obtain the area of the two closed curves. Thus, the contribution of pseudocapacitance and diffusion in electrochemical process can be obtained. As shown in Fig. 6c, the middle brownish green area represents the contribution (about 75%) of the pseudocapacitive-controlled capacity. As shown in Fig. 6(d), in the range of scan rates from 0.1 mV s-1 to 0.5 mV s-1, the pseudo-capacitance contribution ratio is 64%, 67%, 75%, 82%, and 84%, respectively. And as the scan speed increases, this indicates that the electrochemical process of the NVPF@C@10% rGO electrode is controlled by the pseudocapacitor at both low and high rates.
In order to better understand the influence of graphene decorating on the electrochemical performance of NVPF@C and the corresponding kinetic behavior, we tested DC resistance and AC impedance for NVPF@C and NVPF@C@10% rGO. DC resistance can more intuitively express the dynamic behavior of the battery during charge and discharge process. The DC resistance was tested by current pulse technique (Fig. 7a, b) after 50 and 100 charge and discharge cycles. As shown in Fig. 7c, d, the DC resistance of the NVPF@C@10% rGO electrode is lower than that of NVPF@C electrode no matter state of charge or discharge. This further proves that proper graphene decorating can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of the material, and the micro-nano structure composed of nanosheets can effectively reduce the  ontact resistance between the material and the electrolyte.to better understand the influence of graphene coating on the electrochemical performance of NVPF@C and the corresponding kinetic behavior, we tested DC resistance and AC impedance for NVPF@C and NVPF@C@10% rGO. DC resistance can more intuitively express the dynamic behavior of the battery during charge and discharge process. The DC resistance was tested by current pulse technique (Fig. 7a, b) after 50 and 100 charge and discharge cycles. As shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d), the DC resistance of the NVPF@C@10% rGO electrode is lower than that of NVPF@C electrode no matter state of charge or discharge, which further proves that NVPF@C@10% rGO has better cycle performance. Therefore, NVPF@C with hierarchical hollow structure and embedded in rGO could effectively reduce the polarization resistance during the entire charge and discharge process.
The EIS was tested in a fully discharged state after 50 cycles at 1 C. As shown in Fig. 8a, all EIS data were fitted with equivalent circuit (the inset in Fig. 8a) using the ZView software. The Rct value of NVPF@C@10% rGO (475 Ω) is the lowest. The lower Rct is beneficial to the fast electrochemical reaction. The Warburg impedance (Zw) associated with the oblique line is related to the sodium ion diffusion coefficient of sodium ions diffusing into the electrode material [47]. The sodium ion (DNa+) diffusion coefficient in the low frequency range can be estimated according to the equation [48]. Where R, T, A, n, F, C and σ represent the gas constant, absolute temperature, specific surface area of the electrode, number of electron transfer during the redox process, Faraday constant, sodium ion concentration and Warburg coefficient, respectively. And Zre is the formula is calculated [49]:
Where ω represents the angular frequency of the low frequency region. Zre can obtain the Warburg coefficient by a linear relationship with ω1/2 (Fig. 8b). The calculated values are listed in Table 2. The sodium diffusion coefficients of the NVPF@C, NVPF@C@5% rGO, NVPF@C@10% rGO and NVPF@C@15% rGO are 6.48×10-13 cm2 s-1, 1.71×10-12 cm2 s-1, 2.23×10-12 cm2 s-1 and 1.35×10-12 cm2 s-1, respectively. NVPF@C@10% rGO shows the highest Na+ diffusion coefficient among all samples. It indicates that the proper amount of graphene decorating can effectively improve the sodium ion diffusion coefficient of the material, and thus exhibit better cycle performance and rate performance.
In this work, we successfully synthesized hollow NVPF@C microsphere with micro-nano hierarchical structure. Through the time gradient experiment, it is found that the formation process of the material belongs to a typical Oswald ripening process, and the adsorption energy and interfacial tension of the NVPF surface in the reaction system are changed by changing the amount of glucose and solvent ratio to control synthesis hierarchical hollow NVPF@C microsphere.This micro-nano hierarchical structure can not only maintain the high rate performance of the nanoparticles, but also solve the adverse effects caused by the nano-particles. At the same time, the surface of the microsphere is decorated an appropriate amount of rGO to further improve its electronic conductivity, and the special network structure of rGO is beneficial to improve the structural stability of the material during the insertion/extraction of sodium ions. On the other hand, the 3D graphene framework also provides a more efficient channel for electron and ion transport. Therefore, we believe that the rational design of new micro-nano hierarchical structures, combined with carbon material modification, will be one of the effective strategies to develop high-performance sodium ion cathode materials.
