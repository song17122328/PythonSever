Highly tetravalent zirconium-ion-conducting solid electrolytes, Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12, were developed by partially substituting the P5+ ions in the Nasicon-type ZrTa?PO4?3 solid, with Si4+ ions having larger ionic size and lower valence. Among the samples prepared, Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 ?x = 0.1? exhibited the highest Zr4+ ion conductivity of 3.04 ? 10−4 S c m−1 at 600°C.

In the field of solid electrolytes, mono-, di-, and trivalent ions are well known as the conducting ion species, and the ion mobility generally depends on the valence state of the conducting ion species. Therefore, higher valence cations are considered to be extremely poor migrating species in solids due to the strong electrostatic interaction between the high valence conducting cation and the surrounding counteranions in the structure. In order to realize tetravalent cation conduction in a suitable structure solid, it is essential to reduce the strong electrostatic interactions by introducing cations with higher valence than tetravalent into the structure. From consideration of these requirements, we have succeeded in developing tetravalent Zr4+ ion-conducting solids of ZrM?PO4?3 ?M = N b o r T a?1 which have a Nasicon2 ?Na+ superionic conductor, which has a three-dimensional network structure suitable for ion conduction? type structure and contain two different pentavalent cations of P5+ and M5+ ?M = N b o r T a? that strongly attract the constituent oxide anions in the lattice structure. However, the ionic conductivities for tetravalent Zr4+ in the ZrM?PO4?3 solids were still lower than those of the commercially applicable solid electrolytes, such as divalent oxide anion conductors of yttria-stabilized zirconia ?YSZ?3 and calcia-stabilized zirconia ?CSZ?;3 therefore, it is necessary to improve the Zr4+ ion conductivity of ZrM?PO4?3 for practical applications. There are two approaches to improve Zr4+ ion migration in solids: expansion of the ion-conducting pathway in the crystal structure, and further reduction of the electrostatic interaction between Zr4+ and the surrounding O2− ions. Recently, for the purpose of improving the Zr4+ ion conduction in ZrTa?PO4?3, we developed the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 4 solid by partially substituting the P5+ ion ?ionic radius 0.031 nm?5 sites in ZrTa?PO4?3 with larger W6+ ions ?ionic radius 0.056 nm?.5 W6+ is a hexavalent cation that can effectively reduce the electrostatic interaction between Zr4+ and O2− ions, resulting in significant enhancement of the Zr4+ ion conductivity, comparable to that of divalent oxide anion conduction in YSZ and CSZ. However, in the case of the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid, the concentration of conducting Zr4+ ions is reduced as a result of doping with hexavalent W6+ into the pentavalent P5+ sites of ZrTa?PO4?3, which causes a lowering of the ion conductivity, because the ion conductivity generally depends on the concentration of charge carriers, in this case, Zr4+. However, many Zr4+ occupation sites remain in the Nasicon-type ZrTa?PO4?3 solid; therefore, it is expected that the Zr4+ ion conductivity is enhanced by increasing the Zr4+ concentration in the structure. In order to enhance the Zr4+ ion conductivity in ZrTa?PO4?3 by increase of the Zr4+ concentration as well as by lattice expansion, Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 solids were developed by selecting the larger size and lower valence Si4+ ion ?ionic radius: 0.040 nm?5 as a dopant on the P5+ sites, and the Zr4+ ion conductivity in the Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 solids was investigated.

Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 ?x = 0.05–0.2? solids were prepared by a sol-gel method, using ZrO?NO3?·2H2O, TaCl5, ?NH4?2HPO4, and Si?OC2H5?4 as starting materials. ZrO?NO3?·2H2O and TaCl5 were dissolved in ethanol, and then a 0.01 mol L−1 Si?OC2H5?4 ethanol solution was added. After homogenization of the solution, ?NH4?2HPO4 dissolved in 3 N nitric acid solution was dropped into the mixed ethanol solution. After obtaining a white precipitate, the solution was stirred at 80°C for 24 h, and then the ethanol and water present in the solution were vaporized at 130°C. The powder obtained was calcined at 600°C for 6 h, 1200°C for 12 h, 1250°C for 12 h, and then 1300°C for 12 h in air. The samples obtained were identified by X-ray powder diffraction ?XRD? analysis using Cu K? radiation ?MultiFlex, Rigaku?. The XRD data were collected by step-scanning in the 2? range between 10 and 70° with a step width of 0.04° and a scan time of 4 s. The lattice parameters were calculated from the XRD peak angles, which were refined using ?-Al2O3as a standard. After identification by XRD analysis, the powder was pelletized and sintered at 1300°C for 12 h in air. The ac conductivity of the sintered sample pellet with Ptsputtered electrodes on both center surfaces was measured by a complex impedance method in the frequency range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz ?Precision LCR meter 4192A, Hewlett-Packard? and at temperatures from 600 to 300°C. The dc conductivity was measured by passing a dc current of 1 ?A between two Pt electrodes that sandwiched the Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 ?x = 0.1? pellet, in both oxygen ?po2 = 1 05 Pa? and helium ?po2 = 1 2 P a? atmospheres, and the dc voltage generated over the sample was measured as a function of time. DC electrolysis of the sintered pellet was conducted by applying a dc voltage of 3 V for 384 h at 850°C, and a line electron probe microanalysis ?EPMA; EPMA-1500, Shimadzu? was performed on the electrolyzed sample.

Figure 1a shows XRD patterns of the Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12?x = 0.05–0.2? solids with the corresponding data for NaZr2?PO4?3?JCPDS card no. 33-1312? that has the typical Nasicon-type structure. Among the samples prepared, a single phase of the Nasicontype structure was successfully obtained for samples with x ? 0.1, whereas TaPO5, Z r3?PO4?4, and SiO2 appeared as impurity phases for samples with x ? 0.1. Figure 1b presents the lattice volume of the Nasicon-type phase for the Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 ?x = 0.0–0.2? solids estimated from the XRD peak angles. The lattice volume of the single-phase samples with Nasicon-type structure ?x ? 0.1? increased linearly with the Si content ?x? due to the partial substitution of P5+ sites in ZrTa?PO4?3 with larger Si4+ ions. In contrast, for those samples composed of a multiphase mixture ?x ? 0.1?, n o meaningful change in lattice volume of the Nasicon-type phase was observed compared to the single-phase Nasicon-type sample with x = 0.1, which is the compositional limit for the formation of this structure. From these results, it was found that the solid solution limit of Si4+ into P5+ sites in ZrTa?PO4?3 is x = 0.1.

Figure 2 presents the compositional dependence of the electrical conductivity for the Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 ?x = 0.0–0.2? solids at 600°C. In the case of the samples with Nasicon-type single phase ?x ? 0.1?, the conductivity increased monotonically with the Si content ?x?, and the highest conductivity of 3.89 ? 10−4 S c m−1 was obtained at the solid solubility limit composition of Zr1+x/4TaP3−xSixO12 ?x = 0.1?. As the Si content ?x? increased over x = 0.1, the conductivity decreased due to the formation of poorly conductive TaPO5, Z r3?PO4?4, and SiO2 as impurity phases. The electrical conductivity results also support a solid solubility limit for Si at x = 0.1. For the purpose of identifying the conducting species in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid that exhibited the highest conductivity among the samples prepared, the polarization behavior was investigated by measuring the time-dependent dc to ac conductivity ratio ??dc/?ac? in oxygen ?po2 = 1 05 Pa? and in helium ?po2 = 1 2 P a? atmospheres at 600°C. The ?dc/?ac ratio abruptly decreased and reached less than 0.003 after 30 min in both atmospheres, suggesting that the conducting species in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid is limited to a cationic species ?Zr4+, S i4+, T a5+, o r P5+? and are not electrons or oxide anions, as detailed in our previous paper.6 In order to directly demonstrate Zr4+ ion conduction in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid, dc electrolysis was carried out by sandwiching the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 sintered pellet between two Pt electrodes. Prior to electrolysis, the decomposition voltage of the sample was determined to be ca. 1.3 V from the current–voltage relationship. By applying a higher dc voltage of 3 V, the conducting cation species, generated by decomposition of the sample at the anodic side, are forced to migrate continuously and macroscopically in the direction from anode to cathode due to the potential gradient, and as a result, only the conducting ion species segregates at the cathodic surface that contacts the ion-blocking Pt electrode. After electrolysis, the elemental distribution inside the sample pellet was investigated by line EPMA measurements, and the results are given in Fig. 3. A high segregation of Zr was observed near the cathodic surface, while no such segregation was recognized for Ta, P , or Si, which indicates that tetravalent Zr4+ ion is the migrating species in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid. Furthermore, the cation transference number of the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid, estimated from the ?dc/?ac ratio after 30 min, is over 0.99; therefore, the only conducting species in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid is the tetravalent Zr4+ ion.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependency of ion conductivity for the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid with the corresponding data for ZrTa?PO4?3,1 Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12,4 and representative divalent oxide anion conductors of YSZ3 and CSZ.3 The Zr4+ ion conductivity of the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid is approximately 16 times higher than that of ZrTa?PO4?3 ?2.34 ? 10−5 S c m−1? at 600°C,1 and the value is comparable to those of the oxide ion conductors, YSZ and CSZ, below 600°C. Furthermore, the activation energy for Zr4+ ion conduction, which was calculated from the slope between 300 and 600°C, in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid ?55.9 kJ mol−1?, was lower than that in the ZrTa?PO4?3 solid ?57.8 kJ mol−1?. The reason for the lower activation energy and the higher Zr4+ ion conductivity in the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid compared to the ZrTa?PO4?3 solid is attributed to expansion of the Zr4+ ion conducting pathway by partial substitution of P5+ ions with larger Si4+ ions, resulting in smooth Zr4+ ion conduction. Compared to the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid,4 which has almost the same lattice volume ?1.494 nm3? as that of the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid ?1.493 nm3?, the Zr4+ ion conductivity was higher than the value estimated for Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 over 700°C, whereas the activation energy for the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12solid was higher than that for Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 ?48.1 kJ mol−1?, as shown in Fig. 4. These results can be explained as follows. In the case of the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid, the electrostatic interaction between Zr4+ and O2− ions was effectively reduced by introduction of the hexavalent W6+ ion, as well as by lattice expansion, which resulted in a decrease of the activation energy. However, in the hightemperature region, where increased thermal energy promotes the dissociation of ionic bonding between Zr4+ and O2−, the influence of electrostatic interaction upon Zr4+ ion conduction is smaller than that in the lower temperature region. The Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid has a higher Zr4+ ion content in the unit cell and a comparably larger ion-conducting pathway compared with the Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12solid. Although the electrostatic interactions between Zr4+ and O2− are still strong at lower temperatures, a high Zr4+ ion concentration would be effective to improve the Zr4+ ion conductivity at elevated temperatures ?in this case, over 700°C?, where dissociation of ionic bonding between Zr4+ and O2− can occur more easily.

To enhance the Zr4+ ion conductivity in the Nasicon-type ZrTa?PO4?3 solid by increasing the Zr4+ ion concentration in the unit cell and expanding the lattice volume, larger size and lower valent Si4+ ions were doped into P5+ sites in the ZrTa?PO4?3 solid. The highest Zr4+ ion conductivity was obtained for the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid, which was approximately 16 times higher than that of ZrTa?PO4?3 at 600°C and comparable to those of divalent oxide anion conductors YSZ and CSZ. Although the Zr4+ ion conductivity of the Zr41/40TaP2.9Si0.1O12 solid was slightly lower than that of the W6+-doped Zr39/40TaP2.9W0.1O12 solid at temperatures below 700°C, it was clear that a larger ion-conducting pathway and a higher Zr4+ ion concentration in the unit cell were effective for improving the Zr4+ ion conduction at elevated temperatures, especially over 700°C.
