NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 material has been extensively studied as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries due to the open 3D framework with the large interstitial spaces, high theoretical capacity and small volumechange during cycling process.
However, the practical application of NaTi2(PO4)3 is hampered because of its lowelectronic conductivity.
Herein, a simple approach along with post-annealing has been designed and adopted toprepare the carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3 (NaTi2(PO4)3@C) composite.
The as-prepared anode material is characterizedby XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman spectrum.
The electrochemical measurements reveal thatNaTi2(PO4)3@C has excellent Na-storage performances including high reversible capacity (112.6 mAh g−1 at0.2 C) and good rate capability (87.1 mAh g−1 at 5 C).
The superior electrochemical performance can be resultedfrom the synergistic effects of the nanosized NaTi2(PO4)3 particles and conductive carbon layer.
