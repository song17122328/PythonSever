Phase formation in ternary system of complex Sc, Na and Li phosphates was studied at 950 8C and synthesis of new phases ofdefinite composition was carried out.
Obtained specimens were investigated with X-ray powder diffraction and infrared spectroscopy.
Compositions of fields of homogeneity with NASICON-like structure were discovered.
There is a challenge of finding new solid-state electrolytes having high values of ionic conductivity at low workingtemperatures.
Solid-state electrolytes are materials that have high ion mobility due to their unique crystal structurewhere ions can move easily through interstitials.
High values of ionic conductivity are achieved by migration ofalkaline cations.
Such compounds as b-alumina, a-AgI and their derivatives with high values of ionic conductivity arewell known.
One of the promising materials for solid electrolytes, phosphosilicate of sodium and zirconiumNa1+xZr2SixP3xO12, 0  x  3, was discovered by Hong and co-workers .
The best electrical properties arefound for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 called NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor), that exhibits a higher conductivitythan b-alumina above 300 8C (s = 0.25 V1 cm1).
These materials lend themselves to a wide range of applications,for example in solid-state batteries, fuel cells and gas sensors.
A number of NASICON-like compounds have beenintensively studied .
Later, it was found that the binary system of ScPO4–Na3PO4 also includes NASICON-like compounds:Na3Sc2(PO4)3 and Na6Sc3(PO4)5 .
They possess relatively high values of ionic conductivity which can beunderstood by their three-dimensional structure .
Its framework consists of (PO4)-tetrahedra sharing corners with(ScO6)-octahedra with interstitial space occupied by Na+-cations.
Significant ionic conductivity of Na3Sc2(PO4)3s = 101 V1 cm1 is achieved only at high temperature of 300 8C that limits its practical application.
Properties ofNASICON-like compounds are characterized by the statistical nature of the filling A- and B-type cavities by smallNa+-cations and their mobility in the system of channels .
These compounds have complex polymorphism, forexample Na3Sc2(PO4)3 has three polymorphous modifications: a ! b (50 8C), b ! g (168 8C) .
High values of ionic conductivity can be also achieved by Li cations.
Li3Sc2(PO4)3 has three-dimensional structurewith Li+-cation conductivity s = 103 to 102 V1 cm1 at 300 8C .
Li cations fill their crystallographic positionsstatistically.
They have a small size and can easily migrate via interstitials.

Polymorphous transitions and ionic properties of Li3Sc2(PO4)3 aresimilar to that of A3M2(PO4)3 compounds (A = Li, Na, Ag, K; M = Cr, Fe, In) .
The above-mentioned complex polymorphism makes it difficult to obtain NASICON-like compounds of highphase homogeneity and with good working characteristics at low temperature.
It should be also noted here that thehigh price of scandium compound would be an impediment to the wide application of NASICON-like compounds.
The present work studies the subsolidical intersection of the quasiternary system of ScPO4–Na3PO4–Li3PO4 at950 8C in order to understand how the introduction of a third component might improve phase stability of NASICON like compounds.
 
As initial substances for complex phosphate synthesis, commercially available Na3PO4 and Li3PO4 (3N purity)were used.
ScPO4 was synthesized using Sc2O3 (3N purity).
During this process Sc2O3 was dissolved in concentratedHCl by heating, next sedimentation of scandium hydroxide by adding NH4OH was conducted at pH 9 and depositswere dissolved in 30% H3PO4. The solution obtained was left for 48 h at room temperature (RT) for ripening,condensation and evaporation.
Finally, the as-obtained deposits were washed out in hot water and dried at 200 8Cfollowed by calcinations 950 8C for 24 h.
Complex phosphates were obtained by a ceramic method usingstoichiometric amounts of simple phosphates.
They were mixed and ground in a mortar with ethanol, then pressed intopellets (d = 10 mm) and sintered in a furnace at 950 8C for 100–200 h.
After that samples were tempered in liquidnitrogen.
Identification of the intermediate and final products of thermal processing was carried out by X-ray powderdiffraction (XRD) using a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer with Cu Ka-radiation at RT.
To determine unit cellparameters, the angle interval of 108  2u  808 with a scanning step of 0.028 and recording time 70 min, dependingon the quality of reflections, was used.
After indexing unit cell parameters were calculated and analyzed using theRietveld method.
The deformation of phosphate anion PO43 caused by adding of 3d component (Li3PO4) was estimated by infrared(IR)-spectroscopy.
IR-spectra of single-phase specimens were registered with spectrometer Bruker EQ-55 in the rangeof wavenumber 400–3600 cm1. Samples were pressed into pellets with KBr.
Ternary system of Sc, Na and Li phosphates was investigated by cross-section.

Diffraction patterns of these areas are shown in Fig.2.
 First, a small single-phase area (Fig.2a) with a structure ofLiNa5(PO4)2 exists up to 8 mol% ScPO4 with the structure of the mineral olympite.
An extensive area of homogeneityon the basis of high-temperature cubic sodium phosphate stabilized by scandium cation Na3xScx/3PO4,0.25  x  0.3, exists from 12 to 35 mol% ScPO4 (Fig.
2b).
A third area of homogeneity with the structure ofthe complex phosphate Na6Sc3(PO4)5 stretches from 60 to 72 mol% ScPO4 (Fig.2c).
Its structure is similar to that ofthe NASICON-like compound Na4.5Yb1.5(PO4)3 (Fig.3).
Lastly, we found a small area of solid solution (78–80 mol%of ScPO4) that has a structure of the complex phosphate Na3Sc2(PO4)3 which is also a NASICON-like structure(Fig.2d).
Other performed cross-sections confirm the existence of a relatively large area of solid solution on the basis ofNa6Sc3(PO4)5. Cross-section Li3Sc2(PO4)3–Na6Sc3(PO4)5 cuts into two areas: a single-phase area with theNa6Sc3(PO4)5 structure ranges from 0 to 50 mol% of Li3Sc2(PO4)3 followed by two-phase area up to 100 mol% ofLi3Sc2(PO4)3. 
Diffraction patterns of two-phase areas contain reflections of both initial compounds.
Cross-section Li2Na(PO4)–Na6Sc3(PO4)5 cuts also into two areas.
These are a single-phase area with Na6Sc3(PO4)5 structure in therange of 0–70 mol% of Li2Na(PO4) and a two-phase area up to 70–100 mol% of Li2Na(PO4).
The cross-sectionLi3PO4–Na6Sc3(PO4)5 cuts into single-phase area, which stretches from 0 to 60 mol% of Li3PO4, and the abovementionedarea of homogeneity with a structure of Na6Sc3(PO4)5. 
It lasts from 60 to 100 mol% of Li3PO4. CrosssectionLi3Sc2(PO4)3–Na3Sc2(PO4)3 has only a two-phase area.
Finally, no homogeneity area was found forLi3Sc2(PO4)3–LiNa5(PO4)2 cross-section.
All samples obtained contain two phases, at least.
Their diffraction patternsare rather complicated and contain a lot of undetermined reflections.
All the obtained single-phase areas are not newcompounds.
They are analogs of compounds existing in the system of double phosphates ScPO4–Na3PO4.Lattice parameters of samples from two large areas of homogeneity were calculated.
On Fig.4(a and b) one can seethe lattice parameters dependencies on ScPO4 content in the cross-section ScPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2. 
The linear characterof dependencies of a and c is observed in all ranges of solid solutions.
Registered IR-spectra show a strong distortion of phosphate anion PO43 caused by introduction of Li cations intothe crystal structure of complex Na–Sc phosphates.
Distortion of the phosphate anion results in a lowering of the symmetry of PO4-groups and a resultant change of selection rules.
Such a picture is observed in the spectra ofNASICON-like phases with the Na6Sc3(PO4)5 structure.
As a result of experimental work performed here a quasi-ternary diagram can be constructed as shown in Fig.1.
 It demonstrates phase correlations in the system at 950 8C.
One can see single-, two- and three-phase regions.
The redcoloredarea (II) corresponds to a cubic phase with the structure of Na3xScx/3PO4, 0.25  x  0.3, while the singlephasearea with NASICON-like structure of Na6Sc3(PO4)5 is marked by blue (III).
Small single-phase areas with NASICON-like structure of Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (IV) and with mineral olympite structure (I) are indicated by green anddark-blue, respectively.
Phase formation in ternary system ScPO4–Na3PO4–Li3PO4 was investigated for the first time.
Introduction of Li+-cations in the crystal structure of NASICON-like compounds does not lead to any new compounds but it significantlyaffects the dimension and stability of solid solution regions.
Four relatively large single-phase areas, analogs ofcompounds existing in forming binary systems, were found.
Compositions of high phase stability which allows theformation of ceramics with the NASICON-like structure with desirable electro-chemical properties were discovered.
These would enable one to decrease the expensive scandium content in NASICON-like compounds and then makesthem very interesting from an economic point of view.
