Li1?5Al0?5Ti1?5(PO4)3 (LATP) solid electrolyte is prepared via coprecipitation using H3PO4, NH4H2PO4 or (NH4)2HPO4 as a PO4 source. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements clearly show the PO4 source influences crystal structure and morphology of LATP after sintering at 1000uC. AlPO4 impurity formation is observed only in the LATP prepared using H3PO4. In terms of the morphology difference, the LATP dense pellet prepared from H3PO4 and (NH4)2HPO4 is composed of many small grains. Contrary, the grain boundary is hardly observed in the LATP prepared from NH4H2PO4. The LATP prepared using NH4H2PO4 reveals the highest Li ion conductivity due to no impurity formation and less grain boundaries which lead to lower resistance at the grain boundaries. It is concluded that usage of suitable PO4 source is a vital point of the LATP preparation via coprecipitation.

Rechargeable Li ion batteries are a key component of present information rich world.1 They have been used as energy sources for mobile phones, laptop computers and so on due to their high energy density. However, ﬂammable organic solvents have been exclusively used as electrolytes and sometimes caused serious safety problems such as ﬁre hazards and electrolyte leakage. In order to solve these problems, all solid state batteries using inﬂammable solid electrolyte have been studied.2–5 Li1?5Al0?5Ti1?5(PO4)3 (LATP) with NASICON (Na ion super conductor) structure has been recognised as a promising candidate for the solid electrolyte because of its high lithium ion conductivity (y1023 S cm21).6 Hoshina et al. fabricated the all solid state thin ﬁlm battery composed of LATP solid electrolyte and LiNi0?5Mn1?5O4 cathode.7 Properties of the thin ﬁlm battery using LATP solid electrolyte and LiCoO2 cathode were reported by Amiki et al.8 Kotobuki et al. also fabricated the all solid battery with three-dimensionally ordered structure using LATP solid electrolyte and Li4Mn5O12 electrode and observed charge and discharge behaviours.

The methods commonly used thus far to synthesise the LATP solid electrolyte are a solid state synthesis and melt quenching method.10,11 These methods need a high temperature to obtain sintered LATP solid electrolyte. Contrary, the coprecipitation method makes the materials react uniformly at molecular scale and has the advantages of lower synthesised temperature and shorter sintering time.11,12 We reported the LATP solid electrolyte can be prepared via coprecipitation method.13 It is thought the coprecipitation method is useful the LATP preparation; however, detailed research on preparation of LATP via the co-precipitation method has not yet been reported.

In this paper, we examined an effect of PO4 source for the LATP preparation via the coprecipitation on sources properties of produced LATP. The PO4 inﬂuenced sintering behaviour of LATP and impurity formation. As a result, the Li ion conductivity was also affected by the PO4 sources.

Experimental LATP was prepared by a coprecipitation method.13 Li2C2O4 and Al(NO3)3.9H2O were dissolved into puriﬁed water and dropped into NH4HCO3 solution under vigorous stirring. To compensate an evaporation of Li during heat treatment and calcination, 10% excessive amount of Li was added into the precursors. Then, 21 wt% NH4H2PO4 aqueous solution was dropped into the precipitation followed by Ti(C3H7O)4 addition. After and drying the mixture was heated at 800uC for Ti(C3H7O)4, 30 min. Obtained precursor powder was ground by ball milling at 650 rev min21 for 1 h (Pulver Risette 7; Fritsch) with Q0?5 mm Zirconia ball to supply to a sintered pellet preparation. The milled powder was pressed into pellet form with 20 mm diameter and then sintered at 1000uC for 6 h in air. All reagents were purchased from Wako Chemical Co. Ltd (Tokyo, Japan) and used without further puriﬁcation. In order to examine the effect of PO4 source on properties of LATP, the samples using (NH4)2HPO4 or H3PO4 instead of NH4H2PO4 were also prepared.

The sintered pellet was subjected to X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima-IV; Rigaku) measurement using Cu Ka radiation to identify crystal phases. Scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6300LA; JEOL) was used to observe the morphologies of the precursor powders heated at 800uC. The pellet cross-section was observed by ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FE-SEM S-4800; Hitachi).

The Li ion conductivity was measured by the alternating current impedance method. Both surfaces of the sintered pellet were polished to obtain ﬂat surfaces and control a thickness of the pellet to 1 mm. Then, Au was sputtered onto both sides of the pellet to prepare Li blocking electrodes. The alternating current impedance data were collected at ¡10 mV voltage signal in a frequency range of 100–1 MHz using a chemical impedance meter (Chemical Impedance Meter 3352-80; Hioki) at 30uC.

SEM images of precursor powder before and after the ball milling are displayed in Fig. 1. In all cases, the precursor powders before the milling were composed of irregular shaped particles. The size of particles was a little inﬂuenced by the PO4 sources. The particles prepared from NH4H2PO4 and H3PO4 were 15–25 mm (Fig. 1c and e). On the contrary, a little smaller particles from were (NH4)2HPO4 (Fig. 1a). After the ball milling, it is obvious that the precursor powders were crushed well. The particle size was reduced to a diameter of y100 nm in all samples. The morphology difference was conﬁrmed before the milling was no longer observed.

The milled powder was used to form a pellet, which was then calcined at 1000uC for 6 h. The XRD patterns of calcined pellet are revealed in Fig. 2. Comparing with the standard diffraction peaks of LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) (PDF 35-0754) having NASICON structure, all diffraction prepared by NH4H2PO4, 5?2261024 S cm21 and samples from (NH4)2HPO4 and H3PO4 were 2?1661024 and 9?9561025 S cm21 respectively.

In this paper, the effect of PO4 source for the LATP preparation via the coprecipitation on properties of produced LATP was examined. Morphological and crystallographic observed among the pellets prepared from different PO4 sources. AlPO4 formation was conﬁrmed in the pellet from H3PO4, but not observed in the other cases. The morphological difference was also observed. is concluded that the PO4 source surely affected morphology and crystal structure of the LATP pellets calcined at 1000uC. These differences could be attributed to pH of H3PO4, NH4H2PO4 and (NH4)2HPO4 solutions. The precipitant must contain Al(OH)3, which is an amphoteric substance. A small amount of Al(OH)3 may dissolve into H3PO4 (acidic) solution. Therefore, Al3z and PO3{ 4 were mixed each other well in the precursor solution, and this could be a reason for AlPO4 formation in the pellet from H3PO4. Although the AlPO4 formation was not conﬁrmed in the pellet from NH4H2PO4 and (NH4)2HPO4, the pH difference of PO4 solution would also modify a nature of precipitant, resulting in formation of the precursor powder with different nature. This could be a reason for the different sintering behaviours among the pellets prepared from various PO4 sources.

The total Li conductivity of the pellet was strongly inﬂuenced by the PO4 source. Comparing the conductivities among these pellets, the bulk conductivities were of the same order, although a large difference was conﬁrmed in the total conductivities. The total conductivity consists of two components, bulk and grain conductivity boundary should be low when the grain boundary conductivity is low, even though the bulk conductivity is high. Therefore, the large difference in the total conductivity among these pellets can be ascribed to the grain boundary conductivity. This is supported by the crosssectional FE-SEM images as shown in Fig. 3. Besides, in the case of H3PO4, AlPO4 formation was another reason for the low conductivity. AlPO4 does not have Li ion conductive nature.18 Thus, the AlPO4 would act as a resistance layer for the Li ion conduction. Therefore, the pellet prepared from NH4H2PO4 showed the highest Li ion conductivity due to no impurity formation and less grain boundaries. The bulk and total conductivities were 1?4661023 and 5?2261024 S cm21 respectively. These values are comparable to previously reported values.15,19 Upon the LATP preparation by the coprecipitation method, the PO4 source inﬂuences the morphology and crystal structure of produced LATP. Consequently, the Li ion conductivity of the LATP is also affected. It is concluded that the usage of suitable PO4 source is a key to the LATP preparation by the coprecipitation method.

Summary The effect of PO4 source for the LATP preparation via the coprecipitation on properties of produced LATP was examined. It was found that the PO4 source inﬂuences the sintering behaviour and impurity formation of the peaks of pellet from NH4H2PO4 and (NH4)2HPO4 (Fig. 2a and b) were well consistent with the standard patterns of LTP. Contrary, a small peak assigned to AlPO4 appeared at 2h521?76u in the pellet prepared from H3PO4.

Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the LATP pellet are presented in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen that the LATP pellet prepared from H3PO4 was composed of a lot of crystal grains whose size was 5–15 mm (Fig. 3c and f). In (NH4)2HPO4, the crystal grains were observed as well; however, the grain size was larger than that of H3PO4. On the other hand, the pellet from NH4H2PO4 was sintered well compared with others and grain boundary was hardly observed.

Complex impedance plots of the LATP prepared by different PO4 sources using Au blocking electrode are depicted in Fig. 4. A semicircle and a tail were observed in high and low frequency ranges respectively. This characteristic proﬁle of the impedance plot often appears in ceramics with ion conductive nature.14 The tail can be attributed to Warburg type impedance, which originates from the diffusion of Li ions in the blocking electrodes. The impedance plot could be resolved into bulk, grain boundary and electrode resistances.15 Estimated conductivities using equivalent circuit of (RbQb)(RgbQgb)(Qel) (where R is the resistance, Q is the constant phase element and the subscripts g, gb and el refer to the grain, grain boundary and electrode)16 are summarised in Table 1. The bulk conductivities were of the same order. On the contrary, a large difference was observed in the total conductivity.

As a result, the Li ion conductivity was also inﬂuenced by the PO4 source. The LATP prepared from NH4H2PO4 showed the highest Li ion conductivity due to no impurity formation and less grain boundaries. The bulk and total conductivities were 1?4661023 and 5?2261024 S cm21 respectively.
