Monoclinic lithium iron phosphate (m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3) doped with 0–15 mol.% Nb2O5 is mechanically milled from a glassy nanopowder.
The microstructures are observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy.
X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to determine the m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 crystallinity.
AC impedance and DC polarization are used to investigate the m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 electrical properties.
The mechanically milled as-prepared monoclinic powders are amorphous and are sintered at 800°C for 12 h to produce NASICON-type crystals whose lattice parameters and sinterability change with increasing Nb concentration.
The 5 mol.% Nb2O5-doped m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows the maximum ionic conductivity of 7.40 ´ 10-6 S cm-1 (Ea = 0.47 eV) and an electronic conductivity of ~10-9 S cm-1. However, m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 doped with >10 mol.% Nb2O5 shows even lower ionic conductivity and sinterability, and NbOPO4 is detected as the impurity phase.
Consequently, Li ion migration may be enhanced by the addition of the appropriate amount of Nb2O5. Therefore, Nb-doped m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is a promising solid electrolyte for application in all-solid-state Li ion batteries.
Monoclinic Li3Fe2(PO4)3 glassy powders doped with 0–15 mol.% Nb2O5 are mechanically milled for 48 h are subsequently sintered at 800°C for 12 h to fabricate a monoclinic NASICON-type Li ion conductor.
The over 10 mol.% Nb2O5-doped m- Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows the NbOPO4 impurity phase; therefore, the solid solution limit of Nb in the m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 occurs when the Nb2O5 concentration is 10 mol.% or less.
The 5 mol.% Nb2O5-doped m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows the maximum conductivity (7.40 ´ 10-6 S cm-1) and minimum activation energy (0.47 eV) at room temperature, suggesting that Nb2O5 doping changes the lattice parameters, which enhances Li+ migration and sinterability.
Consequently, the grain boundary properties are enhanced.
Therefore, the mechanically milled NASICONtype m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows an ion conductivity higher than any other previously reported in the literature.
Further, it shows an electrical conductivity similar to that of an electrical insulator to about 10-9 S cm-1. Therefore, the mechanically milled m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is a promising solid electrolyte for application in all-solid-state Li ion batteries.
