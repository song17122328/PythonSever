A   new   potentiometric   CO2 gas  sensor   using   lithium–lanthanum–titanate   (Li0.35La0.55TiO3,  LLTO) electrolyte,   Li2CO3 sensing   electrode,   and   Li2TiO3 +   TiO2 reference   electrode   was   investigated.   The microstructure   and   electrical   properties   of   the   optimized   solid   electrolyte   were  examined   and  the  measured   conductivity   values   were   found   consistent   with   those   reported   in   literature.   The   performance   of the  sensor   depended   both   on  the   fabrication   temperature   and   the   sensor   operation   temperature.   Sensors with   the   sensing   electrode   fabricated   above   500 ◦C   performed   poorly.   For   sensing   electrodes   fabricated   at 500 ◦C,   as   the  sensing   temperature   increased   from   300   to   450 ◦C,  the  performance   of   the   sensor   improved (near   Nernstian   response),   but   above   450 ◦C,   the   sensor   degraded.   The   proposed   hypothesis   for   the   degradation  beyond   450 ◦C  is  that   at   low   levels   of   CO2 (ppb   in   the   background),   Li2CO3 reacts   with   LLTO   resulting in   insertion   of   Li+ into   LLTO   that   causes   changes   in   the  electrical   properties   of   the   electrolyte.   Poor   performance   of   sensors   fabricated   at   700 ◦C   was   due   to  formation   of   a   new   phase,   LaLi1/3Ti2/3O3.  Thermodynamic calculations   combined   with   X-ray   diffraction   of   the   reaction   products   are   used   to  support   the  hypothesis.   Introduction   of   high   concentrations   of   CO2 (∼99.99%)   during   sensor   fabrication   (650 ◦C)  eliminated the  reaction   between   Li2CO3 and   LLTO,   and   also   facilitated   the   bonding   between   the  electrode   and   the electrolyte.   As   for   long-term   device   performance,   it   is  shown   that   the   sensor   can   measure   changes   in   CO2 concentrations   reproducibly   below   temperatures   of  450 ◦C,  as  long   as  it  is  operated   in   conditions   where there   is  a  background   of   CO2,  such   as   in   ambient   atmosphere   or   combustion   environments.   The   sensor exhibits   minimal   interference   toward   oxygen,   but   signiﬁcant   interference   to   humidity.

Environmental  monitoring  of  greenhouse  gases  [1,2],  health care  [3],  in-door  air  quality  control,  ﬁre  detection  systems  [4,5], and  many  industries  [6]  require  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  sensors.  Various  types  of  CO2 sensors  have  been  developed,  and  among  these, electrochemical  and  optical  sensors  have  been  the  most  studied. Electrochemical  sensors  can  exhibit  higher  sensitivity,  selectivity, can  be  readily  miniaturized  and  often  cost  less  [7–10].

Na+-ˇ/ˇ 5) 5)-alumina,  NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12)  [9,11,12].  Sensors  based  on  sodium  ion  conductors  often  exhibit  drift  under  dry  and/or  humid  atmosphere [13–15],  and  is  caused  by  multiple  reasons  such  as  instability  of  the electrolyte;  reaction  with  metal-carbonate  and  additional  phase formation  at  the  electrode–electrolyte  interface  [16–20].  As  an alternative,  less  humidity-dependent  lithium  ion  conductors  have drawn  attention.  Sensors  based  on  lithium  ion  conductors  have been  reported  [21–30].

Our  previous  studies  focused  on  electrochemical  CO2 sensors with  Li3PO4 electrolyte,  alkali  metal  carbonate  sensing  electrode, and  a  bi-phase  mixture  of  Li2TiO3 and  TiO2 reference  electrode [27,31].  Li3PO4 has  poor  ionic  conductivity  at  lower  temperatures ×   10−6 S/cm).  Thus,  there (even  at  500 ◦C  the  conductivity  is  5.58  is  interest  in  exploring  alternate  lithium  ion  conductors  that  have higher  conductivity  at  low  temperatures  [32].

In  this  study,  we  focus  on  the  performance  and  the  limits  of  a CO2 sensor  using  a  Li2CO3 sensing  electrode,  Li0.35La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) electrolyte  and  Li2TiO3 +  TiO2 reference  electrode.  Microstructure, electrical  properties,  and  stability  of  the  LLTO  electrolyte  in  contact  with  lithium  carbonate  are  presented,  as  well  as  conditions  to optimize  sensor  performance.

The  electrolyte  disk  was   prepared  by  a  conventional  solid-state reaction  method.  As  starting  materials,  stoichiometric  amounts  of Li2CO3 (99.999%,  Alfa  Aesar),  La2O3 (99.99%,  Alfa  Aesar),  and  TiO2 (99.6%,  Anatase,  Alfa  Aesar)  were  mixed  in  ethanol  and  the  mixture  was  ball-milled  for  20  h  using  a  milling  machine  (PQ-N04). The  milled  mixture  was  dried  at  100 ◦C  in  a  convection  oven  followed  by  grinding  in  a  mortar  and  pestle.  The  ground  powder  was calcined  at  1100 ◦C  for  12  h  with  5 ◦C/min  ramp  rate  in  ambient atmosphere.  After  ball-milling,  the  powder  was  cold-pressed  into green  pellets  of  6  mm  diameter  and  1  mm  thickness.  These  green pellets  were  placed  in  a  platinum  crucible  and  heated  to  1200 ◦C  for 12  h  with  3 ◦C/min  ramp  rate.  At  temperatures  >  1200 ◦C,  we  noted phase  segregation  and  melting,  consistent  with  literature  [38].  The sintered  pellet  was  of  ﬁnal  dimensions  of  about  5.4  mm  in  diameter and  a  thickness  of  about  0.9  mm.

The  density  of  the  sintered  sample  was  determined  from  the Archimedes  method  using  de-ionized  water  as  the  immersion  ﬂuid [39].  The  phase  identiﬁcation  was  carried  out  by  powder  X-ray diffraction  (XRD)  method.  The  data  was  collected  by  a  Rigaku X-ray  diffractometer  using  Cu  K␣   radiation  at  40  kV  accelerating  voltage  and  25  mA   current  with  a  step  size  of  0.02◦ 2   and counting  time  of  1  s.  The  microstructure  of  the  sintered  sample was  observed  using  a  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM,  JEOL JSM-5500).

Electrical  conductivity  measurements  were  performed  on  the sintered  sample;  sputtered  gold  was  formed  as  ion-blocking  electrodes  on  the  top  and  bottom  sides  of  the  pellet.  Impedance  was measured  using  a  Solartron  1260A  impedance  analyzer  in  the frequency  range  from  1  Hz  to  32  MHz   with  100  mV   ac  applied voltage  at  temperatures  between  25 ◦C  and  550 ◦C  in  21%  O2/N2, 21%  O2/N2 with  4000  ppm  CO2,  and  N2 atmosphere,  respectively. The  electronic  conductivity  was  examined  by  the  Hebb–Wagner polarization  method  using  a  Gamry  PC4/300;  a  gold  ion  blocking  electrode  was  formed  on  one  side  of  the  pellet  and  a reversible  electrode  made  from  Li2CO3-gold  particle  mixture  on the  other  side  of  the  pellet.  The  tests  were  conducted  at  300, 400,  and  500 ◦C  in  21%  O2/N2 with  4000  ppm  CO2.  The  applied voltage  varied  from  0.05  to  1.4  V  and  the  currents  were  monitored  for  30  min   at  each  voltage  to  obtain  stead-state  values.  The detail  of  the  Hebb–Wagner  dc  polarization  method  is  described elsewhere  [40].

To  investigate  the  stability  between  the  electrolyte  and  the sensing  electrode,  a  mixture  of  Li0.35La0.55TiO3 and  Li2CO3 was heated  for  2  h  at  500,  600,  and  700 ◦C  in  ambient  air.  To  examine the  stability  at  the  interface  between  the  electrolyte  and  the  reference  electrode,  the  reference  materials  (Li2TiO3 and  TiO2)  were mixed  with  Li0.35La0.55TiO3 and  then  were  heated  at  650 ◦C  for  2  h in  ambient  air.

The  details  of  the  open  reference  electrode  are  described  elsewhere  [27,41,42].  The  sensor  was  fabricated  by  the  following procedure:  i)  gold  contacts  (Heraeus,  C5789  or  C5729)  were  formed on  both  sides  of  a  sintered  LLTO  pellet  by  painting  Au  paste  followed  by  a  heat-treatment  at  850 ◦C  for  5–10  min;  ii)  to  form  the reference  electrode,  a  mixture  of  95  wt%   Li2TiO3 (99%,  Lithium  Corporation  of  America  Inc.),  5  wt%  TiO2 (99.6%,  Anatase,  Alfa  Aesar) ␣-terpinoel  organic  binder  (Fisher  Chemicals)  was   painted  on and  one  side  of  the  electrolyte  and  was  ﬁred  at  650 ◦C  for  2  h;  iii)  to  fabricate  the  sensing  electrode,  Li2CO3 powder  (99%  Alpha  Aesar)  mixed ␣-terpinoel  organic  binder  was   painted  on  the  other  side  folwith  lowed  by  a  heat-treatment  in  the  temperature  range  between  350 and  700 ◦C  for  2  h  in  ambient  air.

The  concentration  of  CO2 gas  was  controlled  in  the  range between  500  and  4000  ppm  by  mixing  nitrogen  (99.99%),  oxygen (50%  balanced  by  N2),  and  CO2 (1%  balanced  by  N2).  Total  gas  ﬂow rate  of  the  synthetic  gas  was  160  sccm  and  the  background  gas composition  was   maintained  as  21%  O2/N2.  The  CO2 sensors  were located  in  the  middle  of  a  quartz  tube  inside  a  Lindberg  Blue  M  furnace  and  the  tests  were  conducted  at  temperatures  ranging  from 300  to  550 ◦C  under  dry  condition.  The  emf   was   measured  by  an HP  34970A  data  acquisition  system  and  was   recorded  by  Agilent

The  magnitude  of  emf   change  from  the  baseline (21%  O2/N2)  to  the  steady  state  potential  at  each  CO2 concentration  was  estimated,  and  was  deﬁned  as  the  sensor  response.  The theoretical  EMF   obtained  based  on  Eq.  (1)  is  shown  in  Eq.  (2).

The theoretical  slope  at  a  temperature  T  is  2.303RT/2F.  Based  on  the observed  sensor  responses,  the  emf   change  was  plotted  against the  CO2 partial  pressure,  and  the  slope  for  the  experimental data  was  calculated.  The  percent  Nernstian  behavior  was  deﬁned as:

Fig.  1(a)  shows  the  XRD  pattern  of  LLTO  powders  prepared  from a  mixture  of  Li2CO3,  La2O3,  and  TiO2 by  heating  at  1200 ◦C  for 12  h.  All  diffraction  peaks  can  be  indexed  to  LLTO  having  tetragonal  (P4/mmm)   structure  (JCPDS  #87-0935),  and  is  consistent  with literature  [43,44].  This  structure  is  the  result  of  double  stacking  of the  perovskite  cubic  unit  cell  along  the  c-axis  with  ordering  of  La3+, Li+,  and  vacancies  (the  superstructure  peaks  are  marked  with  an inverse  triangle)  [33,44].

The  microstructure  of  the  sintered  LLTO  pellet  is  shown  in Fig.  1(b),  with  grains  of  “rectangular”  cubic  shapes  with  minimal   overall  porosity.  The  average  grain  size  was   calculated  as ␮m  (linear  intercept  method).  The  measured  density  of 1.5–1.6  the  sintered  LLTO  is  4.76  g/cm3,  94%  of  the  theoretical  value (5.02  g/cm3). Fig.  2  shows  the  impedance  data  between  25  and  100 ◦C  in nitrogen  atmosphere  for  the  sintered  LLTO  pellet  with  sputtered

Au  electrodes.  It  was  possible  to  distinguish  a  high  frequency (32–0.1  MHz,  Fig.  2(a))  semicircle  and  a  low  frequency  semicircle  (105–102 Hz,  Fig.  2(b),  the  numbers  in  the  ﬁgures  indicate  the exponent  of  10  in  frequency  (Hz)),  and  correlated  with  grain  (high frequency)  and  grain  boundary  conductivities  (low  frequency), respectively  [45].  Upon  increasing  the  measurement  temperature, the  intercept  of  the  semicircles  on  the  Z 5)-axis  decreased  from (i)  to  (iv)  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(a).  It  was  difﬁcult  to  identify  the high  frequency  circle  above  100 ◦C,  due  to  reduction  of  the  grain resistance.

The  grain  and  grain  boundary  conductivity  of  the  sintered  LLTO was  calculated  based  on  a  simple  equivalent  circuit  model.  From 25  to  100 ◦C  the  impedance  data  was  ﬁtted  with  two  RC  circuits in  series,  since  two  semicircles  were  clearly  observed.  Between 100  and  300 ◦C,  only  the  semicircle  due  to  the  grain  boundary is  discernible.  So,  the  grain  conductivity  was  chosen  from  where the  curve  intercepted  the  Z 5) axis  at  high  frequency  and  the  grain boundary  from  the  ﬁtting  to  a  single  RC  circuit.  Beyond  300 ◦C,  the grain  boundary  semicircle  was  not  discernible  (the  curvature  in the  impedance  plot  was  no  longer  obvious  in  the  frequency  range measured),  so  only  the  grain  conductivity  was  determined  from  the intercept  on  the  Z 5) axis.  At  25 ◦C,  the  value  of  the  grain  conductiv×   10−4 S/cm,  while  that  for  the  grain ity  was  estimated  to  be  1.35  ×   10−6 S/cm  (using  dimensions  of  the  sample), boundary  was  2.69  with  the  latter  dominating  the  total  conductivity  of  LLTO.  These values  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  reported  in  literature [43,46,47].

Fig.  2(c)  shows  the  Arrhenius  plots  of  the  grain  and  grain  boundary  conductivities  of  LLTO  as  a  function  of  temperature.  The  plot  for grain  conductivity  exhibits  a  change  in  the  slope  at  temperatures  of 100,  250,  and  375 ◦C,  whereas  the  plot  for  grain  boundary  does  not. The  activation  energy  for  grain  boundary  conduction  was  0.41  eV from  25  to  300 ◦C  and  agrees  well  with  literature  [33].  From  Fig.  2(c), it  is  possible  to  get  3  different  activation  energies  for  grain  conduction:  0.35  eV  for  25 ◦C  <  T  <  100 ◦C,  0.24  eV  for  100 ◦C  <  T  <  250 ◦C,  a transition  region  250 ◦C  <  T  <  375 ◦C,  and  0.16  eV  for  375 ◦C  <  T.  This phenomenon  has  been  noted  before,  and  explanations  include  a phase  transition  [33,48],  or  a  change  in  conduction  mechanism  at higher  temperature  (T  >  127 ◦C)  arising  from  tilting  or  rotating  of the  TiO6 octahedra  [34,37].

For  the  Hebb–Wagner  polarization  measurement,  the  sample

Total  ionic  conductivity  was   used  for  calculating  the  transference  number  it  was  not  possible  to  get grain-boundary  conductivity  for  LLTO  in  the  temperature  range between  300  and  500 ◦C,  the  linear  curve  shown  in  Fig.  2(c)  was extrapolated  to  500 ◦C,  and  the  values  obtained  were  added  to  the grain  conductivity  to  get  a  total  value.  The  calculation  conﬁrmed that  the  solid  electrolyte  LLLTO  has  almost  negligible  n-type  electronic  conductivity  from  300  to  500 ◦C,  consistent  with  literature [34].

With  Li2CO3 sensing  electrode Mixtures  of  Li0.35La0.55TiO3 and  Li2CO3 powders  were  heated at  500,  600,  and  700 ◦C  for  2  h  in  ambient  air  and  Fig.  4  show  the resulting  XRD  patterns.  With  heat-treatment  at  500 ◦C  (Fig.  4(b)), no  new  peaks  were  detected  and  all  peaks  were  assigned  to  LLTO ( 3),  JCPDS  #87-0935)  and  Li2CO3 (䊉,  JCPDS  #87-0728).  As  temperature  increased  to  600 ◦C  (Fig.  4(c)),  the  intensities  of  (1  0  1),  (1  1  0), (1  1  2),  (2  0  0),  and  (2  1  2)  peaks  of  LLTO  were  reduced.  At  700 ◦C (Fig.  4(d)),  the  peaks  from  Li2CO3 and  LLTO  almost  disappeared and  the  new  peaks  are  still  characteristic  of  a  perovskite  structure. Fig.  4(e)  shows  that  the  compound  synthesized  (procedure  similar to  LLTO)  with  the  composition  Li1.75La0.55TiO3 has  a  similar  diffraction  pattern  to  the  material  formed  at  700 ◦C.  The  morphological

A  mixture  of  Li2CO3 +  Au  particles  and  Au  were  used  as  a reversible  electrode  and  ion-blocking  electrode,  respectively.  Fig.  3 presents  the  change  in  the  current  density  with  applied  potential  at 300,  400,  and  500 ◦C  (inset).  As  the  applied  voltage  was   increased, the  current  density  reached  a  plateau  and  subsequently  increased again.  The  voltage–current  density  curve  from  Hebb–Wagner polarization  can  be  separated  into  the  electron  and  hole  currents [40]:

From  the  steady  state  (plateau) value  in  Fig.  3,  n-type  electronic  conductivity  of  LLTO  can  be  estimated  using  Eq.  (5).  The  calculated  electronic  conductivity  and

changes  also  suggest  a  reaction  between  LLTO  and  Li2CO3,  and  are shown  in  Supplementary  Section.

Mixtures  of  LLTO,  Li2TiO3,  and  TiO2 were  heated  at  650 ◦C  for  2  h in  air.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4(f),  XRD  results  of  the  powders  exhibited no  new  peaks  indicating  that  Li2TiO3 +  TiO2 reference  material  is stable  in  contact  with  LLTO  at  650 ◦C.

Fig.  5  compares  the  percent  Nernstian  behavior  calculated  from the  sensor  response  at  350 ◦C  for  several  samples  in  which  the sensing  electrode  Li2CO3 on  LLTO  was  fabricated  at  350,  400,  500, 650,  and  700 ◦C  for  2  h  in  air  (the  reference  electrode  was  ﬁrst assembled  at  650 ◦C).  As  the  fabrication  temperature  of  sensing electrode  increased  from  350  to  500 ◦C,  the  sensor  performance improved  (67%  to  81%).  However,  as  the  sensing  electrode  was   fabricated  above  500 ◦C,  e.g.   650  and  700 ◦C,  the  percent  Nernstian value  dropped  to  17%  and  11%,  respectively.  An  inset  in  Fig.  5  shows the  actual  transients  upon  change  of  CO2 gas  concentrations  (500, 1000,  2000,  and  4000  ppm)  at  350 ◦C  test  for  the  sensors  prepared at  500  and  700 ◦C.  For  the  sensor  with  500 ◦C  (inset  a),  the  emf response  transients  changed  with  CO2.  For  the  sensor  prepared  at 700 ◦C  (inset  b),  in  contrast,  the  emf   exhibited  very  little  change with  CO2 concentration. Since  the  devices  prepared  with  the  sensing  electrode  fabricated at  500 ◦C  in  air  produced  the  optimal  CO2 sensing  performance, more  detailed  studies  as  a  function  of  sensing  temperature  were carried  out  with  sensors  fabricated  at  this  temperature.  The  sensor  traces  and  the  percent  Nernstian  value  of  the  sensor  are  shown in  Fig.  6(a)  and  (b),  respectively.

from  500  to  4000  ppm  or  from  1000  to  4000  ppm  (Fig.  6(b)).  This sensor  approached  62%  of  theoretical  value  at  300 ◦C,  and  improved to  almost  ideal  Nernstian  behavior  (90–98%)  in  the  temperature range  of  425–450 ◦C.  The  response/recovery  times  also  improved with  temperature,  the  data  at  450 ◦C  indicates  a  response  time  of 1  min   and  recovery  of  4  min   (t90 in  both  cases).  After  testing  at 500–550 ◦C,  the  sensor  was   examined  again  at  350 ◦C,  but  it  was irreversibly  degraded  (data  not  shown).

In  Fig.  7(a),  the  sensing  traces  for  1000  ppm  CO2 measured  at 400 ◦C  in  differing  oxygen  backgrounds  are  presented.  There  is  a slight  change  in  baseline  (∼10  mV)   with  change  of  O2 concentration ∼250  mV  signal  for  CO2.  The  interfrom  21  to  16%,  as  compared  to  a  ference  with  humidity  is  more  pronounced  and  shown  in  Fig.  7(b). There  is  a  decrease  in  signal  with  100%  humidity  in  the  gas  stream, for  1000  ppm  CO2,  the  decrease  is  of  the  order  of  30%,  though  the percent  Nernstian  behavior  is  similar  in  the  dry  and  humid  cases.

The  sensor  performance  is  expected  to  follow  Eq.  (2),  as  long as  LLTO  is  a  pure  lithium  ionic  conductor,  as  veriﬁed  by  the Hebb–Wagner  measurements  (Fig.  3,  Table  1).  Fabrication  of  the sensor  devices  involved  heat  treatment  of  the  LLTO  with  Li2CO3 (sensing)  and  Li2TiO3 +  5  wt%  TiO2 (reference)  at  temperatures

ranging  from  500  to  700 ◦C.  There  is  no  chemical  reaction  between LLTO  and  the  reference  electrode  materials  (Fig.  4(f)).

However,  when  mixtures  of  Li0.35La0.55TiO3 and  Li2CO3 were heated,  there  were  changes  in  the  XRD  powder  patterns  beginning  at  600 ◦C  (Fig.  4(c)).  Morphological  examination  of  the  surface also  exhibited  changes  beginning  at  600 ◦C  (Supplementary  Section).  Thus,  there  are  indications  that  Li2CO3 and  LLTO  are  reacting ≥600 ◦C  in  air.  The  pattern  at  700 ◦C  is  assigned at  temperatures  to  LaLi1/3Ti2/3O3 formed  by  insertion  of  excess  Li+ into  LLTO [49–51].  Support  for  this  hypothesis  also  comes  from  the  XRD  of Li1.75La0.55TiO3 which  was  prepared  by  heating  the  corresponding  amounts  of  Li2CO3 (excess),  La2O3,  and  TiO2 at  1100 ◦C  (12  h) (compare  Fig.  4(e)  and  (d)).  These  results  explain  why  sensor  performance  was  poor  at  temperatures  >  600 ◦C. However,  what  is  puzzling  is  that  there  is  no  obvious  reaction between  LLTO  and  Li2CO3 at  500 ◦C  during  2  h  in  air  (Fig.  4(b)), yet  sensing  tests  indicated  that  sensor  performance  permanently deteriorated  above  475 ◦C  (Fig.  6).  Li2CO3 can  decompose  via  the following  reaction:

and  indicates  that  at  low  partial  pressures  of  CO2,  the  decompoG  of  reaction  (8)  at  various sition  of  Li2CO3 will  be  favored.  The  temperatures  and  CO2 partial  pressures  are  presented  in  Fig.  8(a). G  becomes  more  negative  as  the  CO2 At  a  ﬁxed  temperature,  the  partial  pressure  decreases.  Around  495 ◦C,  the  equilibrium  CO2 partial  pressure  for  reaction  (8)  is  calculated  as  100  ppb.  In  this  study, the  background  gas  (21%  O2/N2)  was  synthesized  by  mixing  50% O2/N2 and  99.99%  N2 and  thus  the  level  of  CO2 in  the  background

gas  would  be  at  low  ppb  level,  indicating  that  from  thermodynamic considerations,  reaction  (8)  can  indeed  occur. To  conﬁrm  that  LLTO  reacts  with  Li2CO3 at  500 ◦C  in  the  absence of  CO2,  a  mixture  of  LLTO  and  Li2CO3 was   heated  at  500 ◦C  for  55  h with/without  4000  ppm  CO2.  As  presented  in  Fig.  8(b),  no  additional  phase  was   identiﬁed  for  the  mixture  heated  in  the  presence of  4000  ppm  CO2.  However  the  XRD  patterns  in  the  absence  of  CO2, the  diffraction  peaks  from  Li0.33L0.557TiO3 disappeared.  We   propose that  at  low  levels  of  CO2,  Li2CO3 can  decompose  and  the  resulting Li2O  reacts  with  the  surface  of  the  sintered  LLTO  electrolyte,  ﬁlling Li+ vacancies  and  interstitials,  and  altering  its  electrical  properties leading  to  sensor  degradation.  Literature  reports  indicate  that  the kinetics  for  Eq.  (8)  is  slow,  even  at  low  partial  pressures  of  CO2,  and the  decomposition  reaction  is  promoted  by  the  presence  of  other solids,  such  as  silica  [52].  In  this  study,  LLTO  could  be  serving  in  that capacity. For  further  proof  of  the  relevance  of  reaction  (8),  two   sensor  devices  were  heated  at  500 ◦C  for  72  h  with  and  without  CO2 (4000  ppm)  in  21%  O2/N2 background  atmosphere,  respectively. After  the  heat-treatment,  the  sensors  were  tested  at  350 ◦C.  As  presented  in  Fig.  8(b)  (inset),  the  sensor  heated  in  presence  of  CO2 shows  sensing  performance  with  85%  of  Nernstian  value  and  the baseline  is  stable.  The  device  fabricated  in  the  absence  of  CO2, however,  showed  very  poor  sensing  characteristics.

Based  on  reaction  (8),  introduction  of  high  concentration  of CO2 (∼99.99%)  will  minimize  reaction  between  Li2CO3 and  LLTO

even  at  high  temperatures,  and  provides  an  opportunity  for  high temperature  fabrication,  which  will  improve  bonding  between  the electrode  and  the  electrolyte.  Fig.  9  shows  signiﬁcant  improvement of  the  sensor  fabricated  at  650 ◦C  by  introducing  99.99%  CO2 during  the  fabrication  ( 7)),  whereas  the  sensor  fabricated  in  air  showed poor  response  (䊉)  (percent  Nernstian  value  increased  from  20%  to 80%  at  350 ◦C  and  from  18%  to  85%  at  375 ◦C).

For  practical  long-term  sensor  operation,  the  presence  of  CO2 in  the  environment  will  prolong  long  term  operation  of  the  sensor temperature.  Fig.  10(a)  and  (b)  shows  CO2 sensing  responses  over long  periods  at  475 ◦C  with  and  without  background  400  ppm  CO2 (mimicking  an  ambient  environment)  respectively.  In  the  absence of  background  CO2,  the  sensor’s  performance  degraded.  In  the presence  of  background  CO2,  the  baseline  drifted  25  mV   during  a week  and  the  percent  Nernstian  value  changed  from  91%  to  88% ∼400  ppm  CO2 in  the (practically  within  experimental  error).  Thus,  background  is  enough  to  keep  reaction  (8)  from  happening  and stabilizing  the  sensor  response.  Therefore  the  sensor  system  as outlined  in  this  study  based  on  Li0.35La0.55TiO3-Li2CO3 will  be  suitable  for  detecting  changes  of  CO2 in  ambient  air,  or  other  high  CO2 environments  such  as  combustion  processes,  but  will  not  be  appropriate  for  long  term  sensing  measurements  in  zero  CO2 background environments.

The  sensor  exhibits  minimal  interference  to  oxygen  (Fig.  7(a)), as  expected,  since  according  to  Eq.  (2),  there  is  no  dependence  on oxygen  concentration  for  the  sensor  signal,  since  both  the  reference and  sensor  electrode  are  exposed  to  the  same  gas.  However,  with humidity,  there  is  considerable  interference  (Fig.  7(b)).  We  have not  examined  the  origin  of  this  interference,  but  it  is  reported  in the  literature  that  LLTO  will  react  with  water  [53].

of  CO2 that  prevented  the  LLTO-Li2CO3 reaction  and  improved  sensor  performance.  However,  for  long-term  practical  application  of these  sensors,  CO2 needs  to  be  present  in  the  measuring  environment.  For  example,  this  sensor  can  be  used  to  monitor  ﬂuctuations in  CO2 in  the  ambient  atmosphere  in  the  temperature  range  of 300–450 ◦C,  and  also  for  measuring  changes  of  CO2 in  combustion streams.  The  sensors  will  eventually  degrade  if  they  are  used  in  zero CO2 background  environments.
