Structure formation in this silicate system [4–6] is governed  by  both  thermodynamic  factors  (reaction temperature  and  pressure)  and  kinetic  parameters (ﬂows of Zr and Si particles from the dissolution zone to the growth zone). The ﬂow of Zr particles can be varied by introducing ZrO  in crystalline or nanocrystal2 line form and also by varying the solution concentration and the nature of the solvent (NaOH or Na ). 
Na–Zr silicates have recently attracted considerable research interest because these materials are potentially attractive as ion exchangers, selective adsorbents, and molecular sieves [4–11].
Korzhinskaya  and  Nekrasov  [12]  reported  that,  in  solutions containing mixCO 0.01, 0.1, and 1 M Na 3 2 tures  of  crystalline  ZrO   with  an ,  and  ZrSiO 4 2 overall Zr : Si atomic ratio of 1 : 1, only ZrO  (mono2 ° clinic form, baddeleyite) was formed at 200–400 C and ° C and 0.1 GPa, they obtained the anhy0.1 GPa. At 500  [13]. drous zirconosilicates  The objective of this work is to identify the phases O existing in the Na CO –ZrO (cr)–SiO (silica gel)–H 2 2 2 2 3 ° C and 0.1 GPa in broad ranges of ZrO system at 500  : 2 SiO CO  (1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6) and ZrO  : Na 3 2 2 2 (1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3) molar ratios and to examine their crystal chemistry.
Hydrothermal  synthesis  was  carried  out  using  the thermal gradient method [14]. The starting chemicals  (monoclinic, baddeleyused (reagent-grade) were ZrO 2 ite  structure),  SiO   (readily  soluble  silica  gel),  and 2 3 Na .  The  starting  mixture  was  sealed  in  12-cm CO 2 copper  tubes  of  10-mm  diameter,  which  were  then 3 mounted in 170-cm  autoclaves ﬁtted with cylindrical self-sealing  gates.  The  process  was  run  in  a  bottomheated furnace.
Hydrothermal crystallization in the Na2CO3–ZrO2– SiO2–H2O system was studied at a dissolution temperature of 500°C and a pressure of 0.1 GPa. The vertical temperature  gradient  along  the  autoclave  axis  was 1.5−2.0°C/cm. The pressure in the system was evaluated using the p–t diagram of water [21]. The temperature at the outer wall of the autoclave was maintained with an accuracy of ±2°ë. The reaction time was 240 h. We  carried  out  several  series  of  hydrothermal  runs (Table  1),  varying  the  ZrO2  :  SiO2  ratio  and  Na2CO3 concentration.
The resultant insoluble materials were washed with hot water, dried at room temperature, and analyzed.
Crystallization  products  were  identiﬁed  by  x-ray diffraction  (XRD)  analysis  (DRON-2  and  Rigaku D-Max  1500  diffractometers,  ëuKα  radiation)  using ICSD [1] and ICDD PDF [2] data. To reveal structural analogies  between  the  crystallization  products  and phases  described  in  the  ICSD  [1],  we  calculated  the XRD patterns of all the relevant phases and compared them  with  experimental  data.  Lineshapes  were  ﬁtted using the pseudo-Voigt function.
Hydrothermal  crystallization  yielded  colorless, transparent,  well-formed  single  crystals  0.1–1  mm  in size  or  microcrystalline  powder,  depending  on  the Na2CO3 concentration and oxide content.
The phase compositions of the crystallization products are listed in Table 1. The chemical compositions, crystal  data,  and  types  of  suprapolyhedral  structural units  (SSUs)  (precursor  clusters)  for  ﬁve  anhydrous Na–Zr silicates are summarized in Table 2.
At the lowest SiO2 content (Table 1, runs 1–3) and ZrO2 : SiO2 = 1 : 2 in the starting mixture, we obtained a mixture of ZrO2, Na2ZrSi2O7, and Na4Zr2Si3O12.
Types  of  cyclic  SSU  precursors. The  topological type  of  SSU  precursors  to  crystal  structures  can  be identiﬁed using the crystal-chemical approaches developed  earlier,  such  as  the  method  of  local  structural intersection  of  symmetry  groups  [14–16],  two-color decomposition  of  structural  graphs  into  primary  and secondary contours [16], and determination of equivalent coordination sequences [16, 17].
The  self-assembly  algorithm  for  reconstructing  a three-dimensional structure from its SSU precursors on the universal principle of the maximum connectivity of SSU precursors upon the transition to a higher level of structural  self-organization  of  the  system  [15,  16] makes it possible to gain detailed insight into the mechanism  of  structure  formation  from  data  for  a  local region.
Consider the types of SSU precursors to the synthesized silicates.
The  structure  of  zircon,  ZrSiO4,  is  composed  of four-polyhedron  cyclic  SSU  precursors  in  which  two dodecahedra are linked by orthotetrahedra (Fig. 1a) [22]. The structure of Na4Zr2Si3O12 [23] is also made up of four-polyhedron cyclic SSU precursors (Fig. 1b), in the form of M2T2, in which two octahedra are linked by two tetrahedra; the SSU contains two Na atoms.
The structures of the phases Na2ZrSi4O11 [24] and Na2ZrSi2O7 [25], obtained in the Na2CO3–ZrO2–SiO2– H2O system at 500°C, and the trihydrate Na2ZrSi6O15 · 3H2O [26], obtained at 450°C, are built from invariant SSU precursors in the form of six-polyhedron rings of composition M2T4, made up of two ZrO6 octahedra and four  SiO4  tetrahedra  connected  into  diorthogroups (Fig. 2, Table 2).
Thus,  the  anhydrous  phases  Na2ZrSi4O11  and Na2ZrSi2O7 and the trihydrate Na2ZrSi6O15 · 3H2O constitute a homologous series, with Na2ZrSi2O7 as the ﬁrst member.
The  structure  of  Na2ZrSi2O7  is  formed  via  direct packing of cyclic SSU precursors. The fact that the Si : Zr ratio in the SSU precursor (4SiO4 : 2ZrO6 = 2 : 1) coincides with that in Na2ZrSi2O7 (q = Si : Zr = 2 : 1) indicates  that  the  self-assembly  of  such  SSUs  [16] ensures the most rapid approach to the topology of the structure in question (Fig. 3).
The  chemical  composition  of  the  SSU  precursor Na2M2T4 (q = 2) imposes the lower limit on the silicon content in the series of framework Na–Zr silicates: q = 2, 4, 6 (Table 2). The structure of Na2ZrSi4O11 (q = 1.5) is based on another type of SSU precursor: cyclic fourpolyhedron clusters of composition M2T2 (Fig. 1b).
The structures of the Na–Zr silicates in the homologous series under consideration differ in the number of connecting tetrahedra participating consecutively in the evolution of SSU precursors and, as a consequence, in the complexity of the matrix-assembly algorithm [15, 16].
Role of thermodynamic and kinetic factors in the formation of silicate structures. Based on the matrixassembly model, we reveal several important features of the crystallization behavior of Na–Zr silicates in the Na2CO3–ZrO2(cr)–SiO2–H2O  system  at  450  and 500°C.
At  450°C,  rapid  dissolution  of  silica  in  alkaline solutions of Na2CO3 produces a medium in which the concentration of Si-containing species far exceeds that of  Zr-containing  species  because  of  the  low  ZrO2(cr) solubility. For this reason, Si-rich (q > 1), Na-containing SSU precursors with compositions M2T4 and M2T6 are the ﬁrst to form in the growth zone (Fig. 2). The change in MT composition from M2T4 to M2T6 is due to two  additional  tetrahedra  modifying  M2T4  to  give  a modiﬁed  SSU  precursor  of  composition  Na(M2T4  + 2T) = NaM2T6 (Figs. 2c, 2d).
Note that the M2T6 cluster features the highest possible (for Na-containing SSU precursors) connectivity of ZrO6 octahedra, which are linked by three diorthogroups. The center position of the cluster (Figs. 2c, 2d) is occupied by one Na atom. NaM2T6 is the basic unit in the matrix assembly of Na2ZrSi6O15 · 3H2O, which has a framework structure with the largest known Si : Zr ratio (6 : 1).
In the SSU precursors of composition Na2M2T4, two Na atoms sit above and below the plane of the six-membered  ring.  The  Na2M2T4  precursors,  as  well  as Na2M2T6  and  Na2M2T2,  are  spontaneously  formed  in silicate  solutions  containing  Na  and  Zr.  However,  at 450°C these precursors do not form three-dimensional Na–Zr silicate structures.
Raising  the  temperature  of  the  Na2CO3–ZrO2(cr)– SiO2–H2O  system  from  450  to  500°C  accelerates  the transport  of  Zr-containing  species  owing  to  the  more rapid ZrO2 dissolution in alkaline solutions of Na2CO3. This increases the number of Zr polyhedra linked to Si tetrahedra and, accordingly, reduces the number of free Si tetrahedra capable of serving as additional Si links in SSU precursors.
In these precursors, Zr : Si = 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. Note that,  because  of  the  smaller  number  of  the  simplest structural  units  in  the  crystal-forming  four and  sixpolyhedron clusters, these are more competitive since, other factors being the same, the formation and evolution of such clusters occur more rapidly than those of the eight-polyhedron clusters NaM2T6 (Zr : Si = 1 : 3). In  the  system  studied  in  this  work,  the  structural basis  of  Na2ZrSi4O11  and  Na2ZrSi2O7  is  formed  by Na2M2T4  clusters,  and  that  of  Na4Zr2Si3O12,  by Na2M2T2.
The crystallization behavior of these phases can be understood in terms of the matrix assembly of crystal structures  from  cyclic  clusters.  The  structures  of Na2ZrSi4O11 and Na2ZrSi2O7, as well as the structure of Na2ZrSi6O15 · 3H2O, the only phase obtained at 450°C, are shown to contain invariant six-polyhedron precursors made up of two ZrO6 octahedra and four SiO4 tetrahedra.  These  structures  constitute  a  homologous series,  with  Na2ZrSi2O7  as  the  ﬁrst  member.  The Na2M2T4 precursor (Si : Zr = 2) has the lowest silicon content in the series of framework Na–Zr silicates (q = 2, 4, 6). The structure of Na4Zr2Si3O12 (Si : Zr = 1.5) is based on another type of SSU precursor: cyclic fourpolyhedron clusters of composition Na2M2T2.
