A divalent strontium cation highly conducting solid was successfully developed by introducing Sr2+ cations into the NASICON-type HfNb(PO4)3 solid together with W6+ ions. The (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb1−yWy)5/(5+y)(PO4)3 solid exhibited Sr2+ conductivity that was 3300 times higher than that of previously reported NASICON-type Sr2+ conductors, which was caused by the effective reduction of electrostatic interaction between conducting Sr2+ and surrounding O2− ions due to the existence of high valent Nb5+ and W6+ cations in the structure. © The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All rights reserved.

In the ﬁeld of solid state ionics, ion conduction is generally inﬂuenced by the crystal structure, ionic size of the migrating ion, and the strength of interactions between the migrating ion and surrounding counter ions. Therefore, small size and low valence cations such as H+ and Li+ ions have been reported to migrate easily in various solid materials. In contrast, ions with large ionic size or high valence state are regarded to be poor migrating species in solids compared with small-size monovalent cations. However, divalent cation conductors are considered as candidates for next-generation electrical devices, such as rechargeable batteries and chemical sensors.

To date, some solids in which divalent cations can migrate have been reported,1–9 but most of them are limited to solids where the conducting cation is small sized, such as Mg2+. This is because small cation can migrate more easily among the cations holding the same valence state, even in a rigid crystal lattice, which means that higher ionic conductivity can be generally obtained for smaller cations. While other divalent cation conducting solids have been developed by selecting the B-Fe2(SO4)3 type structure, in which three-dimensional ion conduction, lower than those for Mg2+ ion conductors,6–8 due to bottlenecking of the ion conduction pathway caused by distortion of the B-Fe2(SO4)3 type structure. To obtain high ion conductivity for large-size divalent cations, it requires an expanded open space with a three-dimensional wellordered conduction pathway in the crystal structure and effective reduction of the electrostatic interactions between conducting ions and surrounding counter anions. One of the promising candidate structure is the NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor)-type structure, which is similar to the B-Fe2(SO4)3-type structure. The NASICON-type structure has a well-ordered three-dimensional network, whereas that of the B-Fe2(SO4)3 type is distorted. High divalent cation conduction would be expected to occur in a wellordered NASICON-type structure, even for large-size divalent cations such as Sr2+; however, Sr2+ ion conductivity in the 7 was considerably lower than that NASICON-type Sr0.5Zr2(PO4)3 for smaller divalent cations. Therefore, it is necessary to realize optimal conditions for smooth ion migration in a crystal lattice; reduction of surrounding counter anions and/or suitably sized conduction pathways in the NASICON-type structure.

Here, we have focused on HfNb(PO4)3 as a mother solid, which has been reported as a tetravalent Hf 4+ ion conductor with the NASICON-type structure.10 Sr2+ ions are also expected to migrate smoothly in the NASICON-type structure by the introduction of Sr2+ ions into the Hf 4+ sites in the HfNb(PO4)3 solid, considering that lower valence cations can migrate more easily in a solid lattice than higher valence cations.

In this study, the highly Sr2+ ion-conducting solid electrolyte (SrxHf1¹x)4/(4¹2x)Nb(PO4)3 was developed. In addition, the effect of hexavalent W6+ cation doping into the (SrxHf1¹x)4/(4¹2x)Nb(PO4)3 solid on the Sr2+ ion conduction properties was investigated.

After mixing Sr(NO3)2 and (NH4)2HPO4 nitric acid solutions with ethanol solutions of HfCl4 and NbCl5, the mixed solution was stirred at 130°C for 24 h. To prepare (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)(PO4)3 solids, an aqueous solution of (NH4)10W12O41 was also added to the mixed solution. The precipitates obtained were successively calcined at 600, 1000, 1200, and 1300°C, each for 12 h in air. After pulverizing the samples into powders, pellets were formed and sintered at 1300°C for 12 h in air. The synthesized samples were identiﬁed using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, SmartLab) analysis with Cu KA radiation in the 2ª range between 10° and 70°.

AC conductivities of the sintered sample pellets were measured using the complex impedance method with an impedance/gain phase analyzer (Solartron, 1260) in the frequency region from 5 Hz to 13 MHz at 600–900°C in air. Both AC and DC conductivities were measured at various oxygen partial pressures from 10¹15 to 105 Pa at 900°C to identify the conducting species in the samples. Furthermore, DC electrolysis of sample pellets sandwiched with Pt bulk electrodes was performed at 900°C in air to directly demonstrate Sr2+ ion migration in the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)(PO4)3 solids.

From the XRD analyses of the (SrxHf1¹x)4/(4¹2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids, the NASICON-type structure was clearly observed for all the prepared samples, while a NbPO5 impurity appeared in the solids with x > 0.05 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the cationic ratio in the samples were conﬁrmed to be the same as the mixing one by the ﬂuorescent X-ray analysis. Figure 2 shows that the lattice volume of the NASICON-type phase increased linearly with increasing x up to 0.05, because the ionic size of Sr2+ (ionic radius: 0.132 nm11) is larger than that of Hf4+ (0.085 nm11), whereas a constant value was maintained for the solids with x ² 0.05. The change in lattice volume for the solids with x ¯ 0.05 obeys Vegard’s law; therefore, the samples with x ¯ 0.05 form a solid it solution, in which large Sr2+ ions partially replace the Hf 4+ sites in the HfNb(PO4)3 solid. The electrical conductivity of the (SrxHf1¹x)4/(4¹2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids measured at 900°C is also depicted in Fig. 2. In the single phase region of the NASICON-type structure (x ¯ 0.05), the conductivity increased monotonically and the highest conductivity (2.5 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 900°C) was obtained for the solid solution composition of x = 0.05, due to the increase of Sr2+ in the solid. On the other hand, the conductivity of the solids containing the NbPO5 secondary phase was signiﬁcantly decreased because this phase may inhibit Sr2+ ion conduction in the solids. Such enhancement of Sr2+ ion conductivity (Sr2+ ion conduction in the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9Nb(PO4)3 solid was demonstrated by the same manner described below.) is considered to be by the presence of pentavalent Nb5+ cations in the NASICON-type structure, which effectively reduces the electrostatic interaction between Sr2+ ions and surrounding O2¹ ions; therefore, it can be expected that much higher Sr2+ conductivity could be realized by reducing the interactions more effectively, and hexavalent W6+ ions were introduced into the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9Nb(PO4)3 solid by the partial substitution of Nb5+ sites with W6+ ions.

Similar to the case for the (SrxHf1¹x)4/(4¹2x)Nb(PO4)3 solids, the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb1¹yWy)5/(5+y)(PO4)3 solids formed a solid solution with single phase NASICON-type structures for y ¯ 0.15, whereas the solids with y > 0.15 were a two-phase mixture of NASICON-type solid and HfP2O7. The lattice volume of the samples with y ¯ 0.15 decreased linearly with increasing content

Furthermore, an increase in conductivity with increased W6+ content was observed for the single phase samples (Fig. 3), while the lattice volume was reduced. The reason for the increase in conductivity for the solids with y ¯ 0.15, regardless of lattice volume contraction, is the effective reduction of the electrostatic interactions between Sr2+ and surrounding O2¹ ions caused by the presence of high valence W6+ ions in the structure. In contrast, the solids with y > 0.15 exhibited lower conductivity, although the lattice volumes were the same as that for y = 0.15. In this compositional region, the amount of the HfP2O7 insulator increases with y, so that the conductivity of these samples is reduced. To identify the conducting species in the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb0.85W0.15)5/5.15(PO4)3 solid, which had the highest conductivity among this series, the AC and DC conductivities were measured under various oxygen partial pressures from 10¹15 to 105 Pa. The (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb0.85W0.15)5/5.15(PO4)3 solid had constant AC conductivity above Po2 = 10¹8 Pa, indicating no electronic conduction in the sample. Furthermore, oxide anion conduction was also eliminated by investigation of the DC to AC conductivity ratio (Qdc/Qac) in an O2 atmosphere,12 and the cation transference number was identiﬁed to be over 0.99. These results suggest that the cations in the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb0.85W0.15)5/5.15(PO4)3 solid do not exhibit valence change over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures,

Furthermore, the conductivity of the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb0.85W0.15)5/5.15(PO4)3 solid is ca. 130 times higher than that of the smaller sized Ca2+ cation-conducting Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 at 900°C and is comparable to that of the Mgr0.5Zr2(PO4)3 solid, as shown in Fig. 5.

High Sr2+ cation conduction was successfully realized in the solid having the NASICON-type structure with a well-ordered three-dimensional network. The introduction of high valence cations such as Hf 4+, Nb5+, P5+, and W6+ into the structure enables Sr2+ cations to easily migrate in the rigid crystal the (Sr0.05Hf0.95)4/3.9(Nb0.85W0.15)5/5.15(PO4)3 solid exhibited an extraordinarily high divalent cation conductivity comparable to the Mg2+ cation conductor of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 with the same NASICON-type structure.
