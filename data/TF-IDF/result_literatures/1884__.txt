Phases with 0 v x ¡ 1.5 were synthesized within the system Li11xFexTi22x(PO4)3, of interest for applications as high Li1 mobility material. By powder X-ray diffractometry, three modiﬁcations were found to be stable for x ¡ 0.6 (Nasicon-type R3¯c), 0.6 v x v 1.1 (orthorhombic Pbca), and x ¢ 1.1 (orthorhombic Pbna). The compound Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 was employed for a detailed structural investigation by high resolution powder neutron diffraction (HRPD time-of-ﬂight diffractometer, ISIS spallation source, UK) at 298 and 673 K. Using Rietveld and Fourier difference techniques, lithium atoms were located and the two structures reﬁned to wRp ~ 0.053 and 0.035, respectively. Lithium was found to be highly disordered, and distributed in similar amounts between the M1 and M2 cavities of the Nasicon framework, unlike what is usually observed in lithium Nasicon phases. A particularly large ion mobility should thus be expected. 
The conﬁguration of Li sites within the M1 hollow is strongly affected on heating, so as to displace lithium towards the periphery of the cavity. The effects on the mobility pathways of Li1 ions are analyzed and discussed.
Lithium-containing transition metal phosphates with the rhombohedral, Nasicon-like structures have attracted a signiﬁcant in electrochemical devices. According to whether the transition metal can undergo a redox reaction or not, such phases can be used as intercalation electrode materials for reversible lithium batteries, or as solid lithium ion electrolytes for a number of applications.1–3 In both cases, their performance relies heavily upon the mobility of Li1 in the Nasicon structural framework. Features such as the order–disorder state of lithium, the length/strength of Li–O bonds and the distance between adjacent Li sites available for ion hopping strongly affect the Li1 mobility since they control directly the attempt frequency and energy barrier for thermally activated ionic jumps. Therefore, a detailed determination of the lithium structural environment in these phases is necessary in order to understand the microscopic basis of their performance as ionic materials.
The Nasicon framework (rhombohedral R3¯c, but also symmetry subgroups such as R3¯, C2/c, C1¯ and others are possible) is built up by MO6 coordination octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing all vertices, and can be thought to be derived from the Al2O3 corundum structure, by replacing all O atoms by PO4 tetrahedral groups.4 Two main cavities are present in the structure, surrounding the M1 and M2 (sometimes named M’ and M@) sites. M1 lies at Wyckoff position 6b (x ~ 0, y ~ 0, z ~ 0) with site symmetry 3¯, and corresponds to the in the (ABC)ABC… close-packed arrangement of corundum. M2 is located at 0.667, 0, 1/4 (or at 0, 0.333, 1/12), in position 18e with site symmetry 2, and the corresponding site in the corundum structure would be at the centre of an O3 triangle within a closepacked oxygen layer. Clearly, the multiplicity of M2 is three times that of M1.
The structures of Li-Nasicon phases of type LiM2(PO4)3 and Li3M2(PO4)3 were recently fully characterized by neutron diffraction techniques. In particular, in the ﬁrst case (space group R3¯c) lithium was located in the M1 cavity, either disordered in tetrahedral coordination [LiZr2(PO4)3]4,5 or ordered exactly on the octahedrally-coordinated M1 site [LiTi2(PO4)3].6 On like Li3In2(PO4)3, Li3Fe2(PO4)3, and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 (space group R3¯), lithium was found to be present only within the M2 cavity.7 This Li behaviour contrasts with that of Na in similar and Na3Zr2PO4(SiO4)2, compounds, where both the M1 and M2 cavities are populated at the same time.
It seemed therefore reasonable to assume that Li-Nasicon phases with a lithium content intermediate between 1 and 3 atoms per formula unit might show a partial occupation of both the M1 and M2 hollows by lithium, possibly improving the ionic mobility because of high disorder. Some indications in this direction came from previous studies of some systems Li11xM’xM22x(PO4)3 with M ~ Ti, Hf and M’ ~ In, Cr, where, however, the rhombohedral Nasicon structure was shown to be stable only for x v 1 and to transform into an orthorhombic phase for larger lithium content.8,9 We then began an investigation of the M’ ~ Fe, M ~ Ti system by ﬁrst determining the crystal structure of Li2FeTi(PO4)3, orthorhombic Pbca,10 for which ionic conductivity data had also been reported.11 Here, a crystallographic study of the Li11xFexTi22x(PO4)3 system12 is presented, with a twofold aim. The ﬁrst is to detect the lithium compositional range of stability of the rhombohedral Nasicon structure. 
The second is to select a phase at the upper Nasicon stability boundary to be studied by high resolution powder neutron diffraction, in order to determine the lithium distribution accurately, at room and high temperature, and to test the hypothesis of an improved lithium disorder.
Compounds with composition Li11xFexTi22x(PO4)3, with x ranging from 0.2 to 1.5, were synthesized by solid state reaction from reagent-grade Li2CO3, TiO2, Fe2O3 and NH4H2PO4 in stoichiometric ratios, with a ﬁrst thermal treatment of 4 h at 673 K on the powder mixture, followed by pelletization and a ﬁnal treatment of 9 h at 1363 K. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (CuKa radiation) in the 2h range 5 to 70u, with D(2h) ~ 0.02u and 4 s per step as counting time.
Neutron diffraction data were collected at 298 and 673 K on Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 using the time-of-ﬂight High Resolution Powder Diffractometer (HRPD) at the ISIS spallation pulsed source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Chilton, UK). A powder specimen of about 2 cm3, placed in a vanadium can under vacuum was used. For the high temperature experiment, the can was inserted into a resistance furnace. By use of the back-scattering counter bank at 2h ~ 168.3u, full intensity proﬁles were recorded in the dhkl range 0.7–2.5 A˚ with a maximum resolution of Dd/d # 4 6 1024. Preliminary data reduction was performed, including merging of outputs from single counters in the bank, normalization to the incident ﬂux distribution and correction for detector efﬁciency as a function of neutron wavelength.
All calculations for determining and reﬁning the crystal structure of Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 were performed using the GSAS computer package.13 A Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind with 12 coefﬁcients was used to model the intensity background, and the peak shape was represented by a convolution of a pseudo-Voigt function (linear combination of Gaussian and Lorentzian components, with s and c half-widths, sample contribution) with two back-to-back exponentials (instrumental and moderator contributions).14 Linear dependences of the s and c parameters on dhkl were assumed: s ~ s1dhkl, c ~ c1dhkl. The mixing coefﬁcient and the full width of the pseudo-Voigt function depend on s and c according to equations given in the literature.15
Powder samples were synthesized with compositions for x ~ 0.2, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.5. On the basis of X-ray diffractograms, collected with Si as internal standard, three different crystallographic phases could be identiﬁed, and the corresponding unit-cell constants were least-squares reﬁned (Table 1). It was found that two phase boundaries, located approximately at x ~ 0.70 and 1.05, separate the stability ﬁelds of the rhombohedral Nasicon-like R3¯c and orthorhombic Pbca phases, and of the two orthorhombic phases Pbca and Pbna, respectively. This sequence of structural modiﬁcations resembles that observed in the system Li11xInxTi22x(PO4)3 for the R3¯c to Pbca transition, but differs at higher x values because in that case the Pbca phase transforms into a monoclinic P21/n rather than the orthorhombic Pbna structure.8 In Fig. 1, the X-ray powder patterns of the three phases of Li11xFexTi22x(PO4)3 are shown. 
The Pbca and Pbna diffractograms are quite similar, as the corresponding lattices differ only for a doubling of the c vector in the ﬁrst phase (Table 1).10 In the Pbca pattern of Fig. 1, indices are shown only for the extra peaks not appearing in Pbna; all other peaks have the same indexes hkl as in Pbna, except for a doubling of the l index.
It is interesting to observe the discontinuous character of these phase transformations by considering the behaviour of the volume (V) per formula unit versus the x compositional parameter (Fig. 2). Within the stability range of each of the three phases, V increases with x because of the larger size of Fe31 with respect to Ti41, but at the phase boundaries two clear jumps appear in the curve, which are consistent with a larger density of the Pbca phase with respect to the other ones. The compound with x ~ 0.5 was selected for a full structural characterization by neutron diffraction, as the one close to the stability boundary of the Li-rich R3¯c Nasicon-like phase.

The last least-squares cycle converged to the agreement factors reported in Table 2. In Table 3, the ﬁnal atomic coordinates, occupancies and isotropic displacement factors are given. We also attempted to reﬁne the three Li occupancies with no constraint on their sum, but then an increase of about 30% with respect to the chemical composition value was observed, which is clearly due to correlation with thermal parameters and scale factor.
A similar procedure was used to analyze the data collected at 673 K. However, at variance with results at room temperature, no negative scattering density appeared at the M1 site (6b postion at 0,0,0) in the Fourier difference map. Further, the peaks corresponding to Li1’ and Li2 were substantially displaced with respect to room temperature. The least-squares reﬁnement, including the Li1’ and Li2 atoms with the usual constraint on the overall lithium content, converged successfully (cf. Table 2). The ﬁnal atomic coordinates, occupancies and isotropic displacement factors are reported in Table 3. Experimental, calculated and difference proﬁles corresponding to T ~ 298 and 673 K are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
An extensive disorder is shown by the lithium distribution in Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3, according to occupancies given in Table 3. Actually, about half of the total Li goes into the M1, and half into the M2 cavity at room temperature. Therefore, the conﬁguration observed is indeed intermediate between those found for LiM2(PO4)3 (all Li in M1) and for Li3M2(PO4)3 (all Li in M2) Nasicons, with a signiﬁcant increase of disorder with respect to both end phases. Further, less than one Li atom per formula unit (f.u.) lies in the M1 cavity, which is thus under occupied with respect to the LiM2(PO4)3 case, while the occupancy of the M2 hollow is only 20–25% of the maximum available (three Li atoms per f.u.).
By examining in more detail the lithium distribution inside each of the two cavities, and taking also into account the temperature effects, the following picture can be outlined (Figs. 5 and 6). At room temperature, Li in the M1 hollow is statistically distributed between the octahedrally coordinated 6b site [Li1 position, as in LiTi2(PO4)3], and the disordered 36f site with 1/6 population and C.N. ~ 4 (Li1’) resembling that occupied in a-LiZr2(PO4)3. Over 50% of lithium in the M1 hollow (Li 1 Li1’) is located on the disordered Li1’ site. 
After some attempts, three Li atoms could be successfully introduced in the Rietveld reﬁnement, corresponding to positions named Li1, Li1’, and Li2. The ﬁrst two are located within the M1 cavity: Li1 is exactly at its centre (6b site), and Li1’ in a displaced sixfold-disordered position (36f) quite similar to that observed in a-LiZr2(PO4)3. Li2 lies in a twofold disordered position (36f) inside the M2 hollow.

Important changes occur at higher temperature in the lithium distribution. Li1 disappears, and Li1’ is displaced much farther off the 6b site, reaching the boundary beween the M1 and M2 hollows, and its coordination surrounding is altered substantially. Two new Li1’–O bonds are acquired, one is lost, and another one gets very long (Table 4), so that a 4 1 1 coordination number is attained. 
The Li2 site is disordered over two positions related by the twofold axis inside the M2 hollow. Each position is roughly similar to those found for lithium in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 (therein named M3 sites), except for its larger z coordinate (0.065 against 0.045 and 0.049), indicating that it is closer to the M2 site at z ~ 0.083 (Table 5). At 673 K, the M2 site two Li3M2(PO4)3 compounds the space group is R3¯ instead of R3¯c, so that the twofold axis normal to c at z ~ 1/12 is removed. Thus, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows a fully ordered lithium conﬁguration, as the Li site corresponds to one of the two disordered positions of the R3¯c structure. In Li3Ti2(PO4)3 an intermediate situation is observed, i.e. a disordered distribution with unequal populations (about 2/3 and 1/3) between pseudosymmetrical positions related by a pseudo-twofold axis. 
The average Li2–O distance is larger in Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 with respect to the other two compounds, consistent with a position of Li2 shifted towards the centre of the M2 cavity. The coordination number is 4 1 1 at room temperature, but changes to 4 at 673 K with a parallel increase of the average Li– O bond length (Table 4).
In order to assess the inﬂuence of this high structural disorder on the lithium mobility path, the Li–Li interatomic distances should be considered (Table 6). Each distance of course relates a pair of positions which cannot be populated by Li atoms at the same time: in the local structure, only one of them may be occupied by a lithium atom. Therefore, we are dealing with jump distances in the process of hopping mobility of lithium. Owing to the larger Li disorder with respect to LiZr2(PO4)3, these Li…Li separations are here much shorter than in that phase (where they are not below 3.6 A˚ ), suggesting a higher lithium mobility.
In summary, the phase equilibrium boundaries vs. composition have been determined for the system Li11xFexTi22x(PO4)3, ﬁnding the upper the Nasicon rhombohedral phase. A detailed structural study by powder neutron diffraction of the compound with x ~ 0.5, at room and at high temperature, has shown a complex pattern of lithium disorder, involving sites lying within both cavities M1 and M2. This suggests a particularly high mobility of Li1 ions and contrasts with results generally obtained for LiM2(PO4)3 and Li3M2(PO4)3 Nasicon compounds, where Li is located in either one or the other hollow. On raising the temperature, the Li distribution within the M1 cavity changes substantially, with lithium leaving the M1 site and moving towards very peripheral positions. As ensuing effect on the mechanism of ion mobility, the Li1 jumps inside the M1 hollow become the bottle-neck step of the whole ionic transfer process.
