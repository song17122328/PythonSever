Optical and electrical properties of samples with Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 composition (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) prepared by a low temperature sol-gel method have been investigated. XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements respectively reveal the rhombohedral-Nasicon structure of the grown samples and a disorder of Li+ ions with increasing chromium content. Electrical properties were studied by impedance spectroscopy and both dc and grain boundary ionic conductivity increase with Cr content. A high ionic conductivity value of 1.4·10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.31 eV have been obtained for x = 0.1, which are comparable to those measured in the best ionic conductors reported to date. Photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence spectra indicate that self-trapped excitons and oxygen defects related to the TiO6 octahedra structural units are responsible for the observed luminescence in the visible spectral range, explaining the possible electronic origin of a residual conductivity measured in all the samples. Cr incorporation gives rise to infrared emission bands, attributed to different Cr3+ and Ti3+ intraionic transitions, that may be related to the better grain connectivity achieved by Cr doping.

Lithium based solid electrolytes have been extensively studied for their application in high energy density batteries and fuel cells [1,2]. LiTi2(PO4)3 and their derivatives are one of the best candidates, because the smaller ionic radius of the Ti4+, as compared to other tetravalent cations, ﬁts with the size of the Li ion, yielding an enhanced Li ion diffusivity [3–9]. The crystal structure of LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) is based in the NASICON rhombohedral structure ( R3c space group) and can be described as formed by inﬁnite ribbons of [Ti2(PO4)3]− units with [102] orientation formed by corner-sharing [TiO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra. Li+ cations may occupy two interstitial positions within this network, the so-called M1 site (one per formula unit, crystallographic position 6b) and the M2 sites (three per formula unit, crystallographic positions 18e). The M1 site is six-fold coordinated with the oxygen atoms and the M2 site has an eight-fold coordination. Both sites alternate along the channels which form a three-dimensional network. In the LiTi2(PO4)3 compound, Li+ ions occupy preferentially the low connectivity M1 positions [10]. Although the starting material LiTi2(PO4)3 shows moderate lithium conductivity, the appropriate substitution of Ti4+ with trivalent metals like Al3+, Fe3+ or Cr3+ improves the electrical properties as it was systematically shown for the ﬁrst time by Aono et al. [11,12]. These

authors reported that the increase of ionic conductivity observed in Li1 + xM3+ xTi2 − x(PO4)3 compounds was due both to the increase of the lithium content and to a better connectivity of the grains caused by a density increase associated to segregated phases in grain boundaries acting as binders. This is probably the origin of the high ionic conductivity of almost 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature [13] found for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. Since its ﬁnding, many studies have focused on the determination of the conduction mechanisms in bulk and grain boundaries in these Al-substituted materials [14–18] and also on their synthesis by alternative methods aimed to reduce grain boundary resistance [19–22].

Grain boundary connectivity, which plays a crucial role in the application of this family of compounds, is not a well-understood process and, in fact, secondary phases could cause a stoichiometry imbalance in the bulk of the grains which may yield unwanted electronic conductivity. Moreover, the properties of the NASICON-type Li+ conductor compounds critically depend on the Lithium stoichiometry and possible lithium losses associated to high temperature ceramic methods [18]. In this paper, we examine these concerns in the less explored Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 compound via soft synthesis. Samples with high Cr doping (x = 0.3–0.8) synthesized by solid state chemistry are known to produce samples with a highly porous microstructure, improving sample densiﬁcation with Cr content but causing phase segregation at grain boundaries [23]. In our approach, we have synthesized Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 in the low doping level range (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) via a sol-gel synthesis route to minimize synthesis temperature and possible lithium losses. Dielectric

spectroscopy shows the characteristic ionic conductivity of the material and a residual value at the lowest frequencies. A set of complementary structural characterization techniques; ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, as well as luminescence spectroscopies and transport measurements (dielectric spectroscopy) were used in order to investigate defects that can affect bulk and grain boundary dynamics.

Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 compounds with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1 were prepared by the Pechini method [24] using Li2NO3, Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O, NH4H2PO4 and TiC8H24O4 as starting materials. Citric acid (CA) and ethylene glycol (EG) were added as complexing and polymer agents respectively. TiC8H24O4 was added to a saturated solution of CA whose pH was previously adjusted to 8 to promote ionization and complexation of titanium. After total dissolution, the rest of the reactants were added to the solution. Then, the appropriate amount of EG was mixed and the temperature was increased to 140 °C to promote polyesteriﬁcation between CA-complexes and EG. During heating, solutions became more viscous until a polymeric gel was formed. The obtained gel was aged in air at room temperature during four days and subsequently heated up to 350 °C until a dark powder precursor was obtained. The powder precursors were heated in air at 750 °C during 4 h to obtain compounds of composition Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1. The nanometric particles obtained (60–200 nm) were cold pressed at 150 MPa and annealed at 1000 °C to increase compaction and improve the electrical grain boundary, resulting in sub-micron grains. In order to compare the structure and properties of our samples with those grown by the conventional solid state reactions [12,25,26], an additional Li1Ti2(PO4)3 sample was grown following the same procedure but using a synthesis temperature of 800 °C. Chemical analyses were carried out by Inductive Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Perkin Elmer Optima 3300 DV analyzer both before and after annealing at 1000 °C, in order to determine the lithium content. Analysis results are in good agreement with stoichiometry. Annealing did not yield to signiﬁcant variations in atomic composition and no evidence of lithium loss was found.

XRD patterns of the synthesized powders and pellets were collected on a Philips X'Pert PRO MPD instrument using CuKα1 radiation. A step scan of 0.033° (2θ) in the range 10–120° and a counting time of 0.4 s for each step were employed. The instrumental parameters were previously calibrated using the LaB6 standard NIST SRM 660b. Powder diffraction data were reﬁned by the Rietveld method using the FullProf software [27] and a Thompson Cox function to describe the peak shape. The morphological characterization of powders and pellets were performed by ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), using a JEOL6335F microscope working at 10 kV.

The electrical properties of the compacts, typically 13 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness, were analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out in a BDS80 Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy system (Novocontrol). The sample response was obtained from an Alpha Analyzer in the frequency range of 10−2–107 Hz and temperature range 123 to 523 K within ± 0.1 K temperature variation during measurement. 1 V voltage signal was applied to the sample, and silver paste was used to deﬁne the electrodes on the sample, which was kept under N2 ﬂow in the system cryostat during measurements.

Micro-Raman and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out at room temperature in a Horiba Jovin-Ybon LabRAM HR800 system. The samples were excited by a 325 nm He–Cd laser on an Olympus BX 41 confocal microscope with a 40× objective. A charge coupled device (CCD) detector was used to collect the scattered light dispersed by a 2400 lines/mm grating. Cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements were carried out in a Hitachi S-2500 scanning electron microscope. Measurements were performed using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV at temperatures between 90 and 295 K. CL spectra in

the UV-IR range (300–800 nm, equivalent to 4.14–1.55 eV) were recorded using a CCD camera with a built-in spectrograph (Hamamatsu PMA-111) and corrected for system response.

The crystal structure of materials of Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 composition, with x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1, was studied by X-ray diffraction, both powders and pellets. All the diffraction patterns can be indexed to rhombohedral symmetry with space group R3c corresponding to a NASICON-type structure. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of powder samples. Cell parameters, volume and agreement factors obtained by Rietveld reﬁnement are presented in Table 1. Lithium atoms were assumed to occupy the M1 site (6b special position) and not included in the reﬁnement due to their low X-ray scattering power. Small differences in cell parameters with the chromium content have been found in the studied compositional range, due to the similar atomic radii of Ti4+ (0.605 Å) and Cr3+ (0.615 Å) in octahedral coordination. In general, c increases with x, whereas the change in a is small and the c/a ratio keeps constant, in agreement with results reported by Lin et al. [23]. A systematic increase in a parameter with sintering treatment is observed which may be probably due to differences in lithium disposition within M1 and M2 cavities [14].

FESEM studies show that the Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 powder samples are formed by heterogeneous-sized agglomerates of small particles. The undoped powder sample, Fig. 2(a), is formed by individual particles of 100–200 nm in size. On the contrary, smaller particles, of about 60 nm, and spherical shape are found in the Cr-doped samples. Such particles are partially sintered, giving rise to larger grains, Fig. 2(c) and (e).

When powders were pressed and annealed, larger particles are found, as can be observed in Fig. 2(b), (d) and (f). The particle shape becomes prismatic and hexagonal faces can be clearly recognized in the undoped sample due to grain growth, while chromium-doped particles show irregular shape and lower size (600 nm against 800 nm in the undoped material). Density was determined from the weight and physical dimensions of the pellets and compared with theoretical density calculated from cell parameters. Relative density was found to increase with increasing chromium content: the undoped sample has a 50% of theoretical density while 53% and 60% were obtained from chromium-doped samples with x = 0.05 and 0.1 respectively. A decrease of porosity with chromium content has also been reported by Aono et al. [12]. Although it is well known that density can be increased by thermal treatments at higher temperatures and by the addition of binders, the aim of

this work is to minimize lithium losses and study the grain connectivity of the series without additives. Therefore, we avoided the addition of any phase acting as binder and used the lowest temperatures possible in order to prevent the loss of lithium and properly characterize the sintering mechanism and electrical behavior of Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3.

x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1 after annealing at 1000 °C. Since the two Cr-doped samples show the same qualitative behavior, Fig. 3(a) shows the ionic conductivity versus frequency of Li1.1Cr0.1Ti1.9(PO4)3 at different temperatures as a representative example. The typical features displayed by ion conductors can be clearly identiﬁed. In the lower temperature range, we observe the dispersive behavior of the bulk conductivity at the highest frequencies, with a power law frequency-dependent conductivity that originated in the correlated jumps of the lithium ions. By decreasing frequency, a plateau characteristic of the dc bulk conductivity (σdc) of the sample is expected. This plateau is not clearly observed in Fig. 3(a), since a long range or dc response cannot be fully developed within the grains as the grain size in the samples studied is only 600–800 nm. Nevertheless the value of σdc at each temperature can be extracted from the plots with the help of the dielectric modulus, a representation of the same data less sensitive to grain boundary blocking and simply related to the conductivity by:

We have investigated the ion dynamics by complex conductivity measurements of pellets of composition Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 with

maximum is located at a frequency characteristic of the diffusion process, and yields the dc conductivity using the formula: σ dc ¼ ε∞ε02πf M being ε∞ε0 the limiting value of the permittivity at the highest frequency, and fM the frequency of the maximum of the imaginary part of the modulus [28]. The dc conductivity as well as the crossover frequency to the ac power law regime, increase with temperature in a thermally activated fashion. By further decreasing frequency or increasing temperature, a sudden decrease of the conductivity occurs, due to the blocking of ions at grain boundaries. A well-deﬁned plateau yielding the grain boundary conductivity is observed crossing

our experimental frequency window towards higher frequencies when increasing temperature. The grain boundary conductivity σgb is also thermally activated with a similar activation energy as for σdc. In general this contribution is composed by at least two components, pores and grain–grain interconnectivity, being the latter the dominant one regarding electrical behavior. The same features of the ionic conductivity can be analyzed in the Nyquist plot of the sample (−Z” vs Z’). Fig. 3(b) shows the curves at two selected temperatures in which we have in our frequency window the bulk and dc conductivity contributions. In this representation each one appears as a distorted semicircle, as observed in Fig. 3(b) for the case of the grain boundary relaxation (main ﬁgure). The inset shows the bulk or dc response, with incomplete semicircles due to the sub-micron size of the grains of the sample.

At lower frequencies and higher temperatures, there is another large decrease in the conductivity [Fig. 3(a)] due to the blocking of ionic carriers at the metallic electrodes. This effect is an indication of the ionic nature of the carriers in the material, since electrons are not blocked at silver electrodes, and evidences that the charge transport in the samples is mostly ionic. Finally, only visible for the highest temperatures, another plateau develops at the lowest frequencies, indicating the possible presence of a small electronic conductivity at a level below 10−6 S/cm. In fact these low levels of residual conduction are present in the undoped sample, as evidenced in Fig. 4(a), in which the electrical conductivity of LTP sample is plotted versus frequency. In this sample, charge dynamics is governed by ions giving rise to the strong increase of the real part of the permittivity ε’ up to 108 (Fig. 4(b)), which is the typical increase in the capacitance of the ionic conducting samples when decreasing frequency at high temperatures due to the accumulation of ionic charge in the metallic contacts [29]. The residual contribution can be estimated from the conductivity data at the lowest frequency for the highest temperatures [Fig. 4(a)].

Fig. 5 shows the Arrhenius plot of de dc, grain boundary and “electronic” conductivities observed in the samples studied. The dc conductivity calculated from the modulus were double checked to test the uncertainty of the values by ﬁtting the data with a two parallel R-CPE circuits connected in series with the commercially available software Zview. Fits are shown as lines in Fig. 3(a), and yield the same values for the dc and grain boundary conductivity within ±20% error. To completely cover the error in the determination of the dc values, overestimated error bars of ±30% are presented in the Arrhenius plot, but they fall within the size of the points in Fig. 5.

In all cases a thermally activated behavior is observed for the dc conductivity (lines in Fig. 5), and data can be accurately described with a single exponential term, σ dc ¼ σ∞exp −Ea=kT Þ being Ea the activation energy and σ∞ the pre-exponential factor, which is customarily described in terms of the following expression:

where α is a geometrical factor, a is the jump distance, ν0 is the attempt frequency, N is the concentration of carriers, S is a conﬁgurational entropy term, e is the electron charge and kB is Boltzmann's constant. Table 2 summarizes the activation energy, pre-exponential factor and ionic conductivity at room temperature in the bulk and grain boundaries obtained from Arrhenius ﬁt. Since the structural parameters of all the samples are very similar and there is only a 10% difference in lithium concentration (1 versus 1.1 per formula unit), a similar σ∞ term is found (Table 2).

From the ﬁts of the dc conductivity data of Fig. 5 the activation energy of the bulk conductivity in the undoped sample is 0.67 eV.

Fig. 4. (a) LiTi2(PO4)3 ionic conductivity versus frequency at temperatures −130 to 210 °C from bottom to top, (b) spectra of the imaginary part of the permittivity ε’ at the same temperatures, from left to right.

This value is higher than the 0.35 eV activation energy reported [14] for ceramic samples prepared at 950 °C, which can be attributed to the lower temperature synthesis used in the present work, (750 °C). Actually, we ﬁnd out that an increase of only 50 °C is enough to recover the activation energy values reported in the literature, as we measured in the sample we prepared for this purpose. Instead of increasing synthesis temperature, we achieve the increase in the dc conductivity with the small addition of Cr. The same analysis is valid for the grain

boundary conductivity, whose value is much lower than that found in ceramic samples [14].

Focusing on the Cr doped compounds, dc activation energy decreases to 0.32–0.31 eV, a very similar value in agreement with the very same structural parameters of the samples obtained in the previous section. The decrease in the activation energy with Cr insertion can be rationalized as a consequence of the facilitation of favorable pathways for lithium motion [30,31]. As recent simulations have demonstrated, when lithium content is increased by doping with trivalent cations, part of the mobile lithium ions are transferred to the M2 positions which are high connectivity sites, leaving the same amount of vacancies in M1 bottlenecks [32]. Liberation of M1 bottleneck positions facilitates the ionic transport of lithium through the material as a low energy pathway is established along M1 and M2 sites.

The largest σdc is found in the most doped sample, showing conductivity values of 1.4 10−4 S/cm at room temperature. Note that these values are close to those of the fast ionic conductors (1 mS/cm at room temperature) [1,2,17,19,31,33,34].

A slightly different trend is observed for the grain boundary conductivity, the grain boundary (gb) activation energy decreases from 0.81 eV in the undoped sample to 0.44 and 0.39 eV when doping LTP wit Cr. The higher activation energy evidences a less effective grain connectivity in the undoped sample, which correlates with the differences in densiﬁcation. Small particles in the initial powder in Cr-doped samples (Fig. 2) increase the total surface area in the compact and the driving force for densiﬁcation during sintering is enhanced, improving the packing of the grains with increasing Cr content. On the other hand, we have no indication of nucleation of secondary phases at grain boundaries in this doping range upon sintering, which is reﬂected in the electrical connectivity. In fact, a minimum value of two orders of magnitude difference between dc and gb conductivity is found for the more doped Cr sample.

Also in Fig. 5, the tentatively “electronic” conductivity of the LiTi2(PO4)3 sample is plotted together with the residual contribution found in the Cr doped samples. It is remarkable that a very similar value, within experimental error, is obtained in the Cr doped samples, in the same range as the gb conductivity of the undoped LTP sample. A rough estimation of the activation energy of the residual contribution gives 0.66 ± 0.05 eV, lower than the 0.8 eV of the LTP. We may speculate that a weak semiconducting behavior is present giving rise to a very low electronic conduction, around 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the ionic transport at 200C.

In the following, important issues that cannot be addressed by dielectric spectroscopy, such as disorder in the cation sublattice, defects which may reduce gb conductivity and the support for a residual electronic conductivity, are investigated by optical spectroscopies.

positions of the observed bands and their corresponding assignments are shown in Table 3. Fig. 6 shows Raman spectra of the as-obtained powder samples. The frequency range has been divided in two intervals for comparison purposes.

The vibrational modes of LTP are usually divided into internal and external modes. Internal vibrations predominantly consist of intramolecular stretching and bending motions of the (PO4)3− groups and can be described in terms of the fundamental vibrations of this free anion (ν1–ν4) [35–38]. Raman bands corresponding to stretching vibrations (ν1 and ν3) are observed above 950 cm−1, while those corresponding to bending vibrations (ν2 and ν4) appear usually peaked between 420 and 650 cm−1. The external modes (lattice phonon modes) are composed of Li+, Ti4+ and (PO4)3− translational vibrations, as well as librations (pseudo-rotations) of the (PO4)3− anions [35–38]. Nevertheless, selection rules forbid Li+ ion translation motions (frequently termed “cage modes”) from being Raman active in LTP, since Li+ ions occupy sites with S6 symmetry [38]. External modes occur below ~350 cm−1 in the Raman spectra of LiTi2(PO4)3. In general, it is rather difﬁcult to assign a given frequency to a deﬁnite type of motion in this region of the spectrum, since the modes usually consist of mixtures of different types of atomic motions [35,36].

In the high frequency range [see Fig. 6(b)], the Raman spectra of our samples are dominated by two intense bands at 1095 and 1006 cm−1. Two other bands appear peaked at 989 and 970 cm−1, while two weak shoulders at about 1017 and 1072 cm−1 can be also discerned. Group theory predicts that ν1 will yield two Raman active modes (A1g + Eg), whereas ν3 will give six Raman active vibrations (A1g + 2A2g + 3Eg) at the Brillouin zone center for LiTi2(PO4)3 [35–38]. We attribute the bands observed at 989 and 970 cm−1 to symmetric stretching vibrations (ν1) of the (PO4)3− anions, and the peaks at 1095, 1072, 1017 and 1006 cm−1 to antisymmetric stretching vibrations (ν3) of the same anions. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that some authors [37] attribute the 1005 cm−1 band to the ν1 mode based on its intensity and dominant character observed in their Raman spectra of LixTi2(PO4)3 (x = 1,2,3). However, such assignments contradict the abovementioned theoretical prediction and the experimental fact that symmetric stretching modes typically occur at lower frequencies than the antisymmetric modes [36,37].

Moreover, the band centered at about 1095 cm−1 is the dominant peak for all the samples investigated in this work, except for the undoped powder where its intensity is, nevertheless, comparable to

Table 3 Peak positions (cm−1) of the observed Raman bands and proposed assignments.

the 1006 cm−1 peak. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been previously observed in Raman spectra of MIMIV 2(PO4)3 compounds (MI = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; MIV = Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr, Hf), where the 1095 cm−1 band is usually much weaker than the dominant Raman band centered near 1005 cm−1 [35–39]. In any case, it is not uncommon for distorted (PO4)3− anions to produce ν1 and ν3 bands of comparable intensity, mainly due to the high electrical charge of PO4 tetrahedra [39,40]. The

situation is further complicated because of possible mixing between ν1 and ν3 modes, which still remains an open question [35]. Raman spectra of Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 between 850 and 145 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 6(a). The symmetric bending modes (ν2) correspond to the bands peaked at 446 and 432 cm−1 [35–39], while the bands observed at 548, 591, 658 and 675 cm−1 are attributed to the symmetric bending motions (ν4) of the (PO4)3− anions [35–39], in agreement with factor group analysis that predicts four Raman active components for these vibrations [35].

As explained before, external modes appear below 350 cm−1 and their nature is difﬁcult to ascertain. Some works report on the assignment of these bands through isotopic substitution studies or by comparing series of isostructural compounds [35,41]. Based on these and other investigations [39], the bands at 309, 239, 214 and 197 cm−1 can be assigned to translational and/or vibrational motions of the (PO4)3− groups, the peak at 350 cm−1 is attributed to a Ti–O vibration mode [39] and the band at 273 cm−1 assigned to a translational vibration of the Ti4+ ions [38]. Other weak peaks, observed only in Raman spectra of the undoped powders, may not correspond to LTP vibrations but to minute amounts of second phases formed during the synthesis process and not detected by XRD measurements. The peak at 403 cm−1 was also observed by Cretin et al. [39] and attributed to an unidentiﬁed sub-product. A survey of the Raman spectra reported in the literature for possible second phases formed during the growth of our samples suggests that this band might be related to a P\O symmetric bending vibration in Li(TiO)PO4 [42]. The peak at 720 cm−1 can be attributed to a (P\O\P) bending motion characteristic of condensed phosphate groups, such as (P2O7)4−, or extended polyphosphate structures [38]. The disappearance of this band upon annealing at 1000 °C supports such assignment. The Raman peak at 857 cm−1 could be related to a stretching vibration of the shortest Li\O bond in Li0.3TiO2 [43]. Finally, the weak Raman band observed at about 640 cm−1 may indicate the presence of minute amounts of anatase TiO2 [44].

The partial substitution of Ti4+ ions by Cr3+ ions does not signiﬁcantly alter the positions of the above-mentioned Raman bands. However, some changes can be clearly appreciated in the width and relative intensity of several peaks. The intensity of the 1017 cm−1 band relative to the 1095 cm−1 band, decreases with increasing chromium content. There is still no deﬁnite explanation for such behavior, but a large inﬂuence of the cations on the Raman intensity of the (PO4) anion in orthophosphates with NASICON-like structure has been previously reported [36]. In addition, a progressive broadening of vibration bands in the 920–1150 cm−1 range is observed when the chromium content is increased [Fig. 6(b)], evidencing a certain distortion or non-equivalency of vibrations of different (PO4)3− groups due to the insertion of Cr3+ ions into the structure. A similar broadening was previously observed in Raman spectra of Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 [38] and Li2xMn0.5 − xTi2(PO4)3 [37] by respectively increasing the Al and Mn content. The increased lithium content associated to the higher chromium concentration may be also involved in the observed broadening, due to the establishment of static short range disorder associated to the ﬁlling of the available lithium sites [37]. In our case, this second mechanism seems to be more likely because of the similar ionic radius of Cr3+ (0.62 Ǻ) and Ti4+ (0.61 Ǻ).

The inﬂuence of chromium content and thermal treatment on the luminescence properties of all the as grown powders and annealed pellets was studied by PL and CL spectroscopies. PL spectra of the Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 powders are shown in Fig. 7(a), while PL spectra of the annealed pellets are shown in Fig. 7(b). The undoped material shows a complex PL emission in the visible range, centered near 526 nm (2.36 eV) with shoulders at about 419 nm (2.96 eV), 437 nm (2.84 eV) and 640 nm (1.94 eV). After annealing, the spectral distribution of the emission show only minor changes; it appears peaked at

521 nm (2.38 eV) and the intensity of the high wavelength shoulder is reduced. However, Cr incorporation strongly modiﬁes the PL emission of the samples. The intensity of the blue–green luminescence decreases and new bands in the infrared spectral range become the dominant emissions. In the case of the Li1.05Cr0.05Ti1.95(PO4)3 material, an asymmetric PL band peaked at 762 nm (1.63 eV) was found. Gaussian deconvolution (see Fig. 7(c)) reveals that two bands centered at 754 nm (1.64 eV) and 847 nm (1.46 eV) contribute to the observed emission. In the case of the Li1.1Cr0.1Ti1.9(PO4)3 compound, a band at 875 nm (1.42 eV) shows

the higher intensity in PL spectra. The doped annealed samples show identical PL spectral distribution. While the visible luminescence can be hardly observed, the strong and broad IR band peaked at 842 nm (1.47 eV) can be clearly appreciated.

Infrared emission was not observed in CL spectra of the samples investigated, irrespective of the Cr content or thermal treatments. CL spectra of the LTP powders recorded at different temperatures [Fig. 8(a)] appear peaked at 483 nm (2.56 eV), with clear shoulders at 532 nm (2.33 eV) and 380 nm (3.26 eV). The relative weight of this latter emission slightly increases by increasing temperature. CL spectra of the Cr-doped samples were found to be rather similar. Spectra of the Li1.05Cr0.05Ti1.95(PO4)3 powders at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 8(b). The emission shows two peaks at 90 K, respectively centered at 478 nm (2.59 eV) and 437 nm (2.84 eV), with shoulders at 380 and 550 nm. The intensity of the emission decreases by increasing temperature and is almost quenched at about 260 K.

Emission bands in the visible range observed both in CL as in PL spectra from the undoped and chromium-doped samples is very close to that reported in previous works for TiO2 and titanate micro and nanostructures [45–49]. Such bands appear peaked at about 380, 419, 437, 526 and 640 nm (3.26, 2.96, 2.84, 2.36 and 1.94 eV, respectively). Although the relative weight of these emissions depends on the excitation technique and the sample investigated, the obtained results strongly suggest that charge transfer transitions and/or oxygen related defects related to the TiO6 octahedra are responsible for the observed luminescence [45–49], since these are the structural units common to all the mentioned materials. A clear example is shown in Fig. 9, that compares a PL spectrum of TiO2 (anatase) material with the spectra of the undoped – both untreated and annealed – LTP samples, all of them

recorded under the same experimental conditions. Luminescence at higher wavelengths is usually attributed to self-trapped excitons in the TiO6 octahedra [46], while bands peaked between 450 and 650 nm have been associated with oxygen vacancies and related defects such as F centers [46] or electronic states bound to defects induced by coordinated groups on the surface [50]. Depending on their electronic charge, the related traps may act as radiative or non-radiative centers. According to different authors, the lower energy emissions would be related to oxygen vacancies [45], while PL bands centered near 483 and 525 nm have been respectively associated to surface F and F+ centers in anatase TiO2 nanowires [46]. Annealing in air at 1000 °C decreases both the surface state density and the concentration of oxygen vacancies, which results in the decrease of the visible luminescence intensity.

The PL band centered at about 754 nm in the Li1.05Cr0.05Ti1.95(PO4)3 sample (see Fig. 7) can be attributed to 4T2 → 4A2 intraionic transitions of Cr3+ ions in octahedral coordination [51–54]. This is a spin-allowed, parity forbidden, transition that can be partially allowed by a weak distortion of the crystal ﬁeld or by instantaneous distortions due to molecular vibrations [52]. The width of the associated PL emission implies strong electronic coupling to vibrations of the local environment. The appearance of this band and the absence of the so-called R lines, usually observed as sharp emissions peaked between 690 and 700 nm, indicate that Cr3+ ions occupy low crystal ﬁeld sites, in which the 4T2 levels lie below the 2E level [51]. This PL emission is quenched when the Cr content increases or the obtained materials are annealed at 1000 °C, probably due to a concentration quenching effect [55], meaning that the intensity of the ion luminescence decreases with increasing ion concentration. This effect dominates if the excitation energy is transferred between many ions in the time necessary for the radiative decay, frequently called energy transfer. In such a situation, the probability to reach a path of non-radiative decay is strongly enhanced. The energy transfer probability is increased with decreasing ion distance, i.e., increasing the ion concentration. Moreover, such emission is not observed in CL spectra. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including charge trapping and electron beam local heating. Actually, thermally assisted non-radiative decay of 4T2 → 4A2 intraionic transitions is favored for weak crystal ﬁelds [53]. Some authors [56] have also considered the possibility of P5+ substitution in double phosphate crystals by Cr6+ ions, with the resulting formation of deformed CrO4 tetrahedra containing (CrO4)2− groups. This possibility can be ruled out in the present case, since the weak luminescence of (CrO4)2− groups appears peaked between 625 and 670 nm approximately [57]. The infrared photoluminescence peaked between 842 nm and 875 nm is not related to Cr ions, but to 2T2g → 2Eg intraionic transitions of Ti3+ ions in octahedral coordination. Similar emission bands have been reported in different samples containing TiO6 structural units (as TiO2) or doped with Ti atoms [37,39,58]. The width of the observed band reveals a certain distortion of the TiO6 octahedra that may be in turn attributed to the effect of disordered phosphate groups, in agreement

with our Raman results. The PL spectrum of anatase TiO2 powder shown in Fig. 9, where the Ti3+ emission appears centered at 824 nm (1.50 eV), supports this assignment. Although this result conﬁrms that Cr3+ intraionic transitions are not responsible for the long wavelength IR emission, the increase of Cr concentration enhances the mentioned luminescence. This can be tentatively attributed to an increased oxygen vacancy concentration, as previously reported for Cr-doped TiO2 [59,60]. The two electrons left by the removed oxygen atom migrate into the conduction band, the bottom of which consists of Ti 3d states [61]. Both Ti atoms surrounding the removed oxygen atom capture an electron, increasing the number of Ti3+ ions. This electronic doping supports the existence of a residual electronic conductivity, as indicated in the dielectric spectroscopy experiments.

Besides, annealing at 1000 °C also enhances the 880 nm PL. An increase of the intensity of the Ti3+ luminescence together with a strong reduction of the visible emission has been observed in TiO2 annealed at 980 °C and attributed to grain growth and faceting [47]. In the present case, SEM images of the chromium-doped samples annealed at 1000 °C (Fig. 2) reveal a sintered polycrystalline material with grains of about (400–600) nm in size showing well-deﬁned faces, while the average grain size of the untreated samples is much smaller. This observation supports the possibility that the enhancement of the 880 nm IR luminescence may be related to an increased grain size, as proposed for titania ceramics.

Materials with Li1 + xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 (x = 0, 0.05 and 0.1) composition have been prepared as pure rombohedral Nasicon-type phases by the Pechini sol-gel synthesis method and the effect of chromium content on their optical and electrical properties has been studied. Dielectric spectroscopy evidences an enhanced ionic conductivity even for the addition of small amounts of Cr. We interpret this conductivity increase as a consequence of an enhanced lithium mobility due to the release of the bottleneck M1 positions of the Nasicon structure promoted by Cr insertion, resulting in a reduction of the activation energy. A room-temperature conductivity of 1.4·10−4 S cm−1 and an activation energy of 0.31 eV were obtained for x = 0.1 sample, which are comparable to those of the best ionic conductors reported to date. The ionic conductivity across grain boundaries correlates with the increased density of the pellets that takes place upon Cr addition, as revealed by SEM images. A residual electronic contribution to the conductivity is indicated in the doped samples, at similar level as the grain boundary undoped sample, but different activation energy.

The insertion of chromium gives rise to a progressive broadening of several vibration bands in the Raman spectra due to a static short range disorder associated to lithium ions, correlated to the delocalization of lithium ions within the crystal structure. PL and CL spectroscopies showed that self-trapped excitons and oxygen defects related to the TiO6 octahedra are responsible for the observed luminescence in the visible spectral range. Oxygen vacancies appear to be involved in the residual electronic conductivity found in the dielectric spectroscopy experiments. Cr incorporation strongly modiﬁes the PL emission of the samples, giving rise to IR emission bands that can be attributed to different Cr3+ and Ti3+ intraionic transitions. Cr incorporation thus modiﬁes the defect structure of the investigated phosphates that correlates with an increase in the grain boundary ionic conductivity. Systematic studies in different doped materials should elucidate the generality of the present results.
