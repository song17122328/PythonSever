Among the Ti-based anodes, sodium titanates (NaxTiyOz) [23‚Äì25] have been studied intensively due to their higher reversible capacity and lower average storage voltage than TiO2 [20] and Li4Ti5O12 [21], which are capable of achieving high power/energy densities in Na-ion full cell. A series of NaxTiyOz with different TiO6 zig-zag octahedral arrangement has been employed as SIB anodes. For example, layered Na2Ti3O7 proposed by Wang demonstrates a reversible capacity of more than 200 mAh g-1 [26]. Tunnel-structured Na2Ti6O13 with open crystal structure framework reported by Wu delivers excellent cycle stability [27]. However, most of the sodium titanates are still challenging to achieve high reversible capacity and long-term cycle stability simultaneously due to their intrinsic issues including low electronic conductivity and sluggish sodiation kinetics. √æ Moreover, the severe irreversible Na trapping and side reaction during de/sodiation processes will induce lattice distortion and structural collapse, and this unfavorable phenomenon ultimately leads to the rapid battery performance degrading, limiting their application in practical [28]. Strategies including conductive coating, nanostructure regulating

Herein, a crystallization-induced surface defect engineering to promote the electrochemical activity of LT by electronic structure modulation and diffusion kinetics regulation is proposed. It is found that a lowcrystalline modiÔ¨Åed layer forms on the surface or subsurface of LT nanowires during the crystallization process at the hydrothermal reaction. Such modiÔ¨Åed layer is more defective than its high-crystalline counterpart, thereby containing more defects or OVs that can ameliorate ionic diffusion environment. Moreover, the low-crystalline modiÔ¨Åed layer has been successfully applied as protective layers for unstable SEI Ô¨Ålm, which is beneÔ¨Åcial to inhibit irreversible Na-ions trapping and maintain structural stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the LCLT is equipped with narrower bandgap originated from the 3d orbital of √æ OVs -induced defective Ti atoms on the surface. Moreover, reduced Na √æ migration energies and interconnected Na diffusion pathways are predicted in LC-LT by density functional theory calculations and bond valence site energy (BVSE) analysis. As expected, the tailored LC-LT unfolds enhanced rate capability and cycle stability (8000 cycles, 88%). When applied in the Na-ion full cell with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode, the conÔ¨Åguration exhibits comparable rate performance and cycle stability (800 cycles, 81.6%).

Layered titanates (LT) nanowire (NW) arrays grown on Ti substrate were synthesized through a facile alkali hydrothermal process. The morphologies and crystal structures of LT nano-arrays can be easily tuned by adjusting the experimental parameters. By controlling the hydrothermal duration, high-crystalline LT (HC-LT) and low-crystalline layer modiÔ¨Åed LT (LC-LT) have been prepared. The LC-LT nanowires were grown perpendicular to the Ti-foil with an average diameter and length of about 40 nm and approximately 7.6 Œºm (Fig. S1, Supporting Information). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S2) demonstrate that both HC-LT and LC-LT can be indexed well with the body-centered orthorhombic crystalline phase of H2Ti2O5‚ãÖH2O with a space group of P (JCPDS No.47‚Äì0124). Unlike HC-LT with very strong and sharp peaks, the LC-LT exhibits weak and Ô¨Çat peaks, indicating the low-crystalline characteristic of LC-LT. It is observed that both samples display wellordered layered structure with an interlayer distance of 0.82 nm, which is lower than the 0.89 nm of pristine H2Ti2O5‚ãÖH2O [28,35-36], this may be attributed to the loss of free water when treated at 120 C (Fig. 1b and c). The thermal structural evolution of H2Ti2O5‚ãÖH2O had been studied by in-situ XRD in our previous work, it is found that the temperature to release crystalline water in H2Ti2O5‚ãÖH2O is much lower than that of lithium titanate hydrates (~190 C) and sodium titanate hydrates (~200 C), and about 8.87% and 8.67% weight loss within 25-120 C and 50‚Äì120 C [35-36]. Unlike HC-LT, a low-crystalline layer about 2.8 nm was uniformly modiÔ¨Åed on the surface of LC-LT NW as demonstrated in Fig. 1b. As shown in Fig. 1c, Ti and O distribute evenly in the single LC-LT NW. Compared to the bulk of LC-LT NW, the elementcontent in the outer amorphous layer is much lower. And such a phenomenon can be also observed in the STEM-EDS line scan proÔ¨Åles in Fig. 1d. These elemental analyses reveal that the modiÔ¨Åed layer on the surface of LC-LT NW mainly consists of Ti and O, which can be inferred that the outer layer is also H2Ti2O5‚ãÖH2O but with much-disordered structure. Generally, the low-crystalline phase contains more defects or oxygen vacancies (OVs) than its high-crystalline counterparts, therefore the X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra of HC-LT and LC-LT samples were further performed to verify this conjecture. In the Ti 2p spectra of HC-LT (Fig. 1e), two prominent peaks at 459.1 and 464.8eV which represented to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of Ti4√æ were observed. While in LC-LT, these two peaks negatively shifted to 458.7 and 464.4 eV, which suggests drawing of electrons from deÔ¨Åcient oxygen atoms. In the O 1s spectra (Fig. 1f), two prominent peaks at 453.0 and 453.7eV can be found in both HC-LT and LC-LT samples. Peak 1 is attributed to surface Ti‚ÄìOH, while peak 2 is assigned to crystal lattice oxygen. The area ratio of peak 1 to peak 2 of LC-LT is lower than that of HC-LT, inferring more OVs-induced surface defects in LC-LT [37].

It is signiÔ¨Åcant to reduce the polarization effect due to its adverse effect on sodiation kinetics and electrochemical performance [38]. The low-crystalline interfacial layer containing rich defects may provide fast ionic diffusion which can effectively reduce the polarization effect. Fig. 2a is the normalized capacity charge-discharge curves of the two samples, wherein LC-LT (0.22 V) exhibits a smaller voltage gap than that of HC-LT (0.45 V), manifesting the reduced polarization in LC-LT anode.

Such smaller voltage separation is also proved in the CV curves inserted in Fig. 1a. The cathodic peak of LC-LT (0.31 V) is higher than that of HC-LT (0.24 V), while the anodic peak of LC-LT (0.52 V) is lower than that of HC-LT (0.66 V). It is beneÔ¨Åcial to constructing high-voltage Na-ion full-cells. Due to the forming of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) Ô¨Ålm at the Ô¨Årst discharge process, both LC-LT and HC-LT exhibit relatively low initial Coulombic efÔ¨Åciencies, about 48% and 45%. Such poor Coulombic efÔ¨Åciencies make presodiation an indispensable step in assembling √æ Na-ion full cell to compensate for the Na loss during early SEI layer formation. Thus, more efforts should be made in the following research work to alleviate the problem.

As conÔ¨Årmed by ex-situ XRD and Raman analyses, the preformed defective amorphous outer layer is beneÔ¨Åcial to accommodate the strain associated with volume change during sodiation/desodiation processes. Here, the morphological and crystal structure evolution of LC-LT during the Ô¨Årst discharge/charge process is further observed by SEM and TEM images. As shown in Fig. 5a, the pristine electrode shows a loose and porous network forming by uniform nanowires. After deeply discharged, the nanowires would be wrapped by a thicker amorphous layer (~5 nm) based on the former one, and this can be attributed to the SEI Ô¨Ålm forming during the sodiation process at low voltage (Fig. 5b). While the thicker amorphous layer on the surface of LC-LT NW will disappear after fully charged. Such phenomenon can also be observed in the TEM images of the individual LC-LT NW at deep-discharged and full-charged states, which can be ascribed to the instability of SEI Ô¨Ålm, especially in the Ô¨Årst cycle (Fig. 5d and e). The LC-LT NW still maintains distinct lattice fringes after deeply discharged as shown in Fig. 5f, meaning that LC-LT is capable of withstanding the volume expansion during Na-ions insertion/ desertion.

To further gain insight into the structural transformation of LC-LT accompanying with the sodiation process, DFT calculations were applied to stimulate the sodiation mechanism of LC-LT within the optimized framework of H2Ti2O4(OH)4 (the bulk structure of LC-LT). As displayed inserted in Fig. 6a, H2Ti2O4(OH)4 shows a body-centered orthorhombic lattice consisting of edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra with protons situated between the host layers. The edge-shared TiO6 octahedra exhibit zig-zag layered conÔ¨Åguration along the [001] projection. Notably, the unique large interlayer spacing between the Ti slabs along the a-axis direction is favorite insertion site and diffusion path for Naions.

Such low barrier energies offer some qualitative insight into the fast kinetics of LC-LT, which is in good accordance with the above analysis.

To demonstrate the potential application of the LC-LT additive-free anode in SIBs, a full Na-ion battery was constructed by using NASICONtype Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as the cathode, as illustrated in Fig. 9a. The rate performance at various current densities and cycle stability at 1.0 C of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode in Na-ion half-cell are displayed in Fig. S7. It is found that Na3V2(PO4)2F3 delivers higher oxidation peak related to the redox reaction of V4√æ (~3.75 V) than Na3V2(PO4)3 (3.5 V) as shown in Fig. 9b. Moreover, higher reversible capacity can be achieved by Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode, about 125 mAh g-1, while it is only 106 mAh g-1 for Na3V2(PO4)3 (Fig. 9c) [28,48]. Due to the high redox potential of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode, the LC-LT//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cell has an average potential of 3.1 V (inserted in Fig. 9d), which is in great agreement with the predicted result as shown in Fig. 9c. Notably, the LC-LT//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 full cell presents high reversible capacities about 231, 186, 146, 120 and 89 mAh g-1 at current densities of 0.4, 0.8, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0C based on the mass of anode materials (Fig. 9d). After 800 cycles, about 81.6% capacity retention can be remained at 8C as displayed in Fig. 9e, which is better than that of the reported Na-ion full cells including asymmetrical systems based on Sb/rGO//Na3V2(PO4)3/rGO, Fe2O3,NiO//Na3V2(PO4)3, Hard carbon//NaNi0‚ãÖ5Ti0‚ãÖ5O2, C//(Na1Fe0‚ãÖ5 Mn0‚ãÖ5O2√æ10%Na3P), and symmetrical devices based on Na0‚ãÖ8Ni0‚ãÖ4Ti0‚ãÖ6 O2, Na0‚ãÖ6Cr0‚ãÖ6Ti0‚ãÖ4O2, and Na2‚ãÖ55V6O16‚ãÖ0.6H2O as illustrated in Table 2 [49‚Äì55]. Moreover, one charging coin-type LC-LT//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 battery can lighten the ‚ÄúHIT‚Äù pattern (consisted of 40 LEDs) and a blue LED (3.0‚Äì3.2V), revealing the high energy/power outputs, and highly practical application prospect of LC-LT//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 system (inserted in Fig. 9e).

In conclusion, the crystallization-induced surface defect has been introduced to relieve the intrinsic issues of layered titanates. This lowcrystalline modiÔ¨Åed layer containing defects or oxygen vacancies (OVs) is capable of boosting ion/electron transportation. As conÔ¨Årmed by electrochemical and structural evolution, the low-crystalline modiÔ¨Åed layer is beneÔ¨Åcial to reduce polarization, maintain structural stability, as well as boost ion diffusion. Theoretical calculations reveal that the LC-LT is equipped with narrower bandgap originated from the 3d orbital of √æ oxygen vacancies-induced defective Ti atoms. Moreover, reduced Na √æ migration energies and interconnected Na diffusion pathways are predicted in LC-LT by DFT calculations and BVSE maps. The tailored LC-LT unfolds enhanced rate capability and cycle stability (8000 cycles, 88%). When applied in the Na-ion full cell with NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode, the LC-LT//Na3V2(PO4)2F3 conÔ¨Åguration exhibits comparable rate performance and cycle stability (800 cycles, 81.6%). Therefore, this surface defect modiÔ¨Åcation strategy could offer a conceptual advance in the designing of advanced electrode materials for energy storage.
