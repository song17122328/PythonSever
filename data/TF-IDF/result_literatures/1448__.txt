Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) was synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions. The crystal structure (single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) data: cubic, space group P213 (No. 198), a = 10.2417(1) Å, V = 1074.28(2) Å3, Z = 4) contains a langbeiniteframework consisting of ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharing common corners. H2O molecules (crystal water) occupy the large cages extending along the 3-fold axes, thereby completing the langbeinite-type structural arrangement: {(H2O)2[Zr2(PO4)3]}vs K2[Mg2(SO4)3]. The ﬁlled langbeinite variant is completed by additional Li ions taking positions between two neighboring water molecules and via the formation of linear 3 OH2. The thermochemical properties of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2arrangements H2O 3 (PO4)3] (0 e x e 2) were studied by thermogravimetry-diﬀerential thermal analysis (TGDTA), as well as by isothermal annealing combined with powder XRD investigations. Above 200 °C, the crystal water of the cubic hydrate is irreversibly released and the dehydrated phase keeps the cubic host structure. The dehydrated phase is metastable and transforms exothermally to a stable phase (probably the R-phase; NASICON-type structure) during heating (dynamic, 10 °C/min) at ∼970 °C. Depending on the maximum temperatures chosen for long-time annealing procedures (1180 and 800 °C, respectively) the R and β high-temperature phases (rhombohedral and orthorhombic, respectively) low-temperature phases (∼300 °C), are formed, which undergo reversible phase transitions to the R0 respectively. Although the dehydrated cubic phase can be expected to show a high Li-ion conductivity, the metastable character of this phase will prevent any application without further stabilization of the crystal structure.

Langbeinites, which are named after the naturally occurring mineral K2Mg2(SO4)3 (space group P213),1 form a large group of compounds with the general chemical formula AxM2(XO4)3 , Co2þ (A = K , Cd2þ , etc.).2-6 Langbeinite-type compounds have attracted much attention, because of their ferroelastic and ferroelectric properties,7-11 as well as their structural phase transitions.12-17 Recent studies have shown that, by incorporation of lanthanide ions into langbeinite-type phases, new applications may be envisaged, such as laser materials and nonlinear optical systems.18 þ ; M = Ti4þ )19-22 form a comparably small group within the family of langbeinites, because most of these phosphates crystallize in the NASICON-type crystal structure (Sodium Super-Ionic Conductor, Na1þxZr2(SiO4)x(PO4)3-x, space group R3c).23-28 Both the langbeinite-type and the NASICONtype structures consist of a three-dimensional framework built of corner-sharing MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra containing cages (for langbeinite framework) or channels (for NASICONtype structure) that are occupied by the cations.29 There is one very interesting alkali metal-zirconium compound in the AxM2(PO4)3 family, (LiZr2(PO4)3), which is known to exhibit a complex polymorphism and a signiﬁcant Li-ion conductivity.30-33 Because of the diﬃculties in growing single crystals34 and the low scattering power of Li for X-ray radiation, Catti et al. investigated the polymorphism of LiZr2(PO4)3 via high-resolution neutron powder diﬀraction.35-38 According to their work, LiZr2(PO4)3 forms the rhombohedral NASICON-type structure (R-phase, space group R3c) when prepared via solid-state reactions at 1200 °C. R-LiZr2(PO4)3 is stable at temperatures above 60 °C and transforms to a triclinic R0 -phase (space group C1) during cooling. By limiting the synthesis temperature to 900 °C (and below), LiZr2(PO4)3 forms an orthorhombic structure (β-phase, space group Pbna) and transforms to a monoclinic β0 -phase (space group P21/n) at ∼300 °C during cooling. The R0 -phases represent distorted variants of the Rand β-phases, respectively. The solid-solid phase transitions R T R0 are fully reversible. Regarding the coordination and distribution of Li ions (distributed over in the crystal structures, it was found that Li several sites within the lattice) shows a distorted tetrahedral coordination in the R-, R0 -, and β-phase (d(Li-O) = 2.0892.272 Å), as well as signiﬁcant disorder, which can explain the signiﬁcant Li-ion conductivity.31,33,36 Only in the β0 -phase (space group P21/n), Li ions are fully ordered with a regular tetrahedral coordination characterized by a smaller average distance (Li-O) of 2.024 Å that is associated with a distinctly lower Li-ion mobility.36 Besides these phases obtained via solid-state reactions, there is also one report on the preparation of langbeinitetype (cubic) phases, “LiZr2(PO4)3” and “LiZr2(PO4)3 3 0.7H2O”, both of which were synthesized as powders by ion-exchange reactions of cubic “HZr2(PO4)3” in LiCl solutions.39 However, the crystal structures of the cubic phases were not investigated in detail. In the present work, we report on a Li-ﬁlled langbeinite variant, Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0), obtained under hydrothermal conditions. The crystal structure was determined from single-crystal X-ray data. In addition, the thermochemical properties of this compound were studied using thermogravimetrydiﬀerential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), combined with isothermal annealing experiments.

Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) was prepared under mild hydrothermal conditions. ZrCl4 (0.233 g, 1 mmol, Alfa, 99.5%), Li2B4O7 (0.324 g, 2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%), 0.1 mL H3PO4 (Merck 85 wt %) and water (5.0 mL) were mixed together under constant stirring, followed by transfer to 20 mL Teflon-lined autoclaves. The pH value was adjusted to 1 via the addition of diluted HCl (ca. 10 wt %). After a reaction time of 8 days (autogenous pressure at 180 °C), the obtained products were washed with water and the solids were collected via filtration. The isolated colorless crystals with a yield of ∼60 wt % (based on Zr) were first examined via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). All reflections could be indexed by a primitive cubic cell.

The data collection for Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) was carried out with a Rigaku AFC7 (Mercury CCD) diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at ambient temperature. A tetrahedral crystal (0.025 mm  0.025 mm  0.030 mm) was selected under a light microscope for single-crystal XRD analysis. Data with index ranges of -13 e h e 12, -6 e k e 13, -12 e l e 13 were collected. Based on the systematic absences, the cubic space group P213 (No. 198) was chosen. Direct methods were used to locate the Zr, P, and O atoms. The Li position was determined in the Fourier difference map. Hydrogen atoms of the crystal water molecules were not localized during the structure refinements. Direct methods implemented in the program SHELXS-9740 were used and subsequent refinements were performed with SHELXL-97,41 which are included in the program package WinGX.42 A summary of the crystallographic data and refinement parameters is given in Table 1.

The powder XRD patterns of members of the series Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (0 e x e 2) were collected at ambient temperature on a Huber G670 diﬀractometer that was equipped with a graphite monochromator (Cu KR1 radiation, λ = 1.54060 Å). The data were collected in the 2θ range of 3°-100° with a step width of 0.005°. The lattice parameters of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) were obtained from least-squares ﬁts using 80 reﬂection positions extracted from the powder XRD patterns (internal standard LaB6, NIST standard, a = 4.15692 Å at 295.5 K, WinCSD43 program).

Thermochemical properties of members of the series Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (0 e x e 2) were investigated in an argon atmosphere using simultaneous constant-rate TG-DTA up to 1200 °C (Netzsch STA 449, heating segment, 10 °C/min).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), were carried out on three single crystals with a Philips XL 30 system with a LaB6 cathode. With an average Zr:P molar ratio of 2.00(3):2.99(6), the obtained chemical composition agrees well with the chemical formula determined from the single-crystal structure refinements.

The content of lithium of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a Varian Vista RL spectrometer with radial plasma observation. The sample was dissolved in hydrochloric acid. Li content: expt./theor. = 0.93/1.36 (w/w) (the lower experimental Li content is due to the existence of an unidentified amorphous phase in the powder sample).

Selected parts of the microcrystalline powder of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) were investigated by SEM to study the morphology. A SEM image and a simulated (indexed) model are given in Figure 1. The crystal shape is perfectly tetrahedral. Interestingly, it was reported that the parent mineral langbeinite exhibits the same morphology with edge lengths up to 15 cm.44 The four faces of each crystal represent the closed polyhedron {111}. This is consistent with the space group P213 determined by single-crystal XRD (crystal class 23).

Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) crystallizes in space group P213 (No. 198) with four formula units per unit cell (a = 10.2417(1) Å, V = 1074.28(2) Å3). Atom positions are given in Table 2, and selected interatomic distances and angles in the crystal structure of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) are summarized in Table 3. The crystal structure represents the langbeinite framework, which consists of ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing all of their corners (Figure 2). There are two different crystallographic sites occupied by Zr4þ ions. Both are located on the 3-fold axes and are 6-fold coordinated by oxygen atoms. The Zr1 coordination octahedron is slightly distorted with Zr1-O distances of 3  2.048(5) Å and 3 2.091(6) Å, whereas the Zr2-O distances are equal, within the standard deviations: 3  2.071(5) Å and 3  2.077(5) Å. P-O distances in the phosphate tetrahedra vary from 1.517(5) Å to 1.528(5) Å, with an average distance of 1.524(5) Å, which is in accordance with the expectations for nonprotonated phosphate groups.45 The alternating ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra form ellipsoidal cages via an arrangement of six 6-membered and three 4-membered rings of polyhedra (Figure 3a). The cages are þ ion and two crystal water molecules. As shown filled by one Li in the left part of Figure 3a, an asymmetric linear coordination of Li by the two water molecules is formed, characterized by H2OLi distances d(Li-O5w) = 1.79(7) Å and d(Li-O6w) = 1.91(7) Å (Table 3). Six oxygen atoms of the framework complete the [2 þ 6] coordination around Li (d(O-Li) = 3  2.536(6) Å and 3 2.675(10) Å; the corresponding angles for O-Li-O are 3 56.91(18)° and 3  64.14(18)°; see Table 3. Several attempts were made to rationalize the overall crystal structure of langbeinite-type compounds,29,46 especially with respect to the NASICON framework. The simplest approach just describes the langbeinite-type structure as a cubic rod packing of cation coordination polyhedra, whereas the NASICON structure exhibits a hexagonal arrangement. In this description, the rods in the cubic phase are aligned along the [111] direction.47

For comparison, the crystal structure of the mineral langbeinite, K2Mg2(SO4)3, is shown in Figure 3b. In the parent structure ions on two crystaltype, each cage is occupied by two K 3 K distance = 3.98 Å).1 In lographically independent sites (K 3 the crystal structure of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0), the large cages extending along the 3-fold axes were occupied by water molecules, thereby completing the langbeinite-type structural arrangement: {(H2O)2[Zr2(PO4)3]}vs K2[Mg2(SO4)3]. ions The ﬁlled langbeinite variant is completed by additional Li by taking positions between two neighboring water molecules and via the formation of linear arrangements H2O 3 3 3 OH2 (Figure 3a). The two positions within the cage Li taken by neutral water molecules (H2O 3 3 OH2 distance of 3.70 Å), together with one Li ion being placed between them, is a novel situation in the structural chemistry of langbeinites and displays a rare coordination environment for Li. A similar, but linear group was reported for LiCl 3 H2O only symmetric, recently;48 however, the H2O-Li distance is signiﬁcantly longer ions complete the ﬁrst coordination (2.036(1) Å) and four Cl sphere (4  2.630(1) Å). In the crystal structure of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0), six non-Ow oxygen atoms, which are arranged to form an almost planar hexagon (Figure 3a), are the next neighbors around Li. According to the values of the Li-O distances (3  2.536(6) Å and 3  2.675(10) Å), these Li-O interactions are rather weak (8-fold coordination: sum of ionic and O2ions is calculated to be 2.34 Å49). Besides, it radii of Li was suggested, for langbeinite-type zirconium phosphates AZr2þ ) obtained as powders,39 (PO4)3 (A = NH4 that the monovalent ion takes both crystallographic sites with half occupation, thereby leaving a lot of space within the cage. Consequently, it was suspected39 that additional water can be incorporated and the lattice parameters could increase as the amount of water molecules increases. This scenario can now be veriﬁed with the crystal structure determination of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0). Compared to the value of a = 10.200 Å for LiZr2(PO4)3 3 0.7H2O,39 the maximum water content in Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) results in an increase of the lattice parameter to 10.2417(1) Å. A more-detailed discussion on water contents and cell parameters is given below (see also Figure 5).

The thermochemical properties of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (0 e x e 2) were investigated via TG-DTA, accompanied by isothermal annealing. The TG curve (Figure 4) of the fully hydrated phase shows a broad weight loss (7.13 wt %) between ambient temperature and 1200 °C, which is attributed to the release of crystal water (calculated: 7.05 wt %). The corresponding DTA curve indicates that the crystal water is removed gradually, according to the two endothermic peaks with their maxima at 188 and 322 °C. After TG-DTA up to 1200 °C, the decomposition product was found to be the R0 -phase (via powder XRD analysis) at ambient temperature. To study the intermediate products during the dehydration process, further isothermal annealing experiments on Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) were carried out at 250, 600, 800, and 1180 °C, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 4. Powder XRD analyses show that lattice parameter a decreases gradually with the loss of crystal water until the anhydrous cubic phase is formed (attempts to rehydrate the anhydrous cubic phase in water failed). Assuming that the lattice parameter a changes linearly (Vegard’s law) with the amount of water released from members of the series Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (0 e x e 2), the x value for a sample treated at 250 °C for 5 h (see Table 4) is estimated to be 1.75 (see Figure 5). By taking into account the relations shown in Figure 5, the compound reported to contain 0.7H2O (a = 10.200 Å)39 would be more consistent with a monohydrate. According to the DTA curve (Figure 4), the anhydrous cubic phase is metastable and transforms exothermally at 970 °C to a stable phase (probably the known R-phase; NASICON-type structure). The feature of the irreversible release of crystal water, together with the fact that the dehydrated phase retains the cubic host structure, demonstrate that Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) is a suitable precursor for the metastable dehydrated phase (x = 2). Depending on the maximum

temperatures chosen for long-time annealing procedures (1180 and 800 °C), the rhombohedral R and orthorhombic β high-temperature phases are formed, which undergo reversible phase transitions to the triclinic R0 low-temperature phases (∼300 °C),36 respectively. Langbeinite-type compounds exhibit their cubic crystal structures at ambient temperature. For some compounds, such as Tl2Cd2(SO4)3, however, a sequence of phase transitions is observed at low temperatures:P213 sf 128 K P21 sf 119 K P1 sf98 K P212121.

With this in mind, the title phases (hydrated, dehydrated) were investigated down to -170 °C via DTA. No indications for phase transitions at low temperatures were observed (see the

Supporting Information). In addition, DTA investigations of the R0 and β0 -phases were performed and the following observations were made:34 R0 f R solid-solid phase transition (endothermic peak during heating at 59 °C); R f R0 solid-solid phase transition (exothermic peak during cooling at 38 °C); β0 f β solid-solid phase transition (endothermic peak during heating at 318 °C); and β f β0 solid-solid phase transition (exothermic peak during cooling at 315 °C)(See the Supporting Information.) A summary of the thermochemical behavior of Li(H2O)2-x-[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) is presented in Figure 6.

A Li-ﬁlled langbeinite variant Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (x = 0) was synthesized under mild hydrothermal conditions and was structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction. The crystal structure exhibits a langbeinite-type framework by interconnection of corner-sharing octahedra and tetrahedra, thereby forming ellipsoidal cages that are ﬁlled with asymmetric linear H2O-Li-OH2 units. Six oxygen atoms from the framework complete a [2 þ 6] coordination around Li. This type of cation coordination is novel in the structural chemistry of langbeinites. The thermochemical properties of Li(H2O)2-x[Zr2(PO4)3] (0 e x e 2) were investigated by TG-DTA, as well as via isothermal annealing. The results reveal the formation of a dehydrated metastable cubic phase after the irreversible release of crystal water. Depending on the maximum temperatures of heat treatment, the dehydrated metastable cubic phase exothermally transforms to the known monoclinic β-phase or triclinic R-phase of LiZr2(PO4)3, which then undergo reversible phase transitions (∼300 °C), to the low-temperature phases R0 respectively. The dehydrated cubic phase is expected to show a high Li-ion conductivity. Because of the metastable character of this phase, a stabilization of the crystal structure is needed to prevent a monotropic phase transformation.
