Abstract. Powders and pellets of new NASICON compositions have been synthesized using a mixed inorganicorganic sol-gel synthesis, by the preliminary formation of a pre-hydrolized TEOS xerogel. The investigated compositions can be described by the general formula Na3Zr2 255) 133)x=4 134)Si2 255)xP1 135) xO12, obtained by keeping the Na concentration constant  133) 136) 3 134) at the optimum value reported for ionic conductivity, with x  136) 0 (the usual NASICON composition), 0.667, and 1.333. The xerogels were calcined at various temperatures in the range 400– 1200 14)C. The powder samples were analyzed by TG/DTA, BET measurements, XRD, and SEM. The powders calcined at 500 14)C were sintered into pellets at 1100 14)C for 6 h. The sintering behavior of the pellets was investigated by dilatometric measurements and SEM observations. The sinterability increased with increasing x value. Dense samples of the new compositions were obtained by sintering at only 1100 14)C. This is attributed to the occurrence of liquid phase sintering. The electrical conductivity of the NASICON sintered bodies was measured by ac impedance spectroscopy. The conductivity decreased with decreasing c0 lattice parameter of the hexagonal structure or increasing x value. The CO2 gas sensors, using as electrolyte the dense samples of the new NASICON compositions, showed good EMF response that was very close to the theoretical value, even for the sample with x  136) 1:333 that showed much lower conductivity.

The problem of global warming, associated with the increased level of carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere, needs the development of low-cost CO2 detection methods. For this purpose, potentiometric sensors using alkali-ion-conducting solid electrolyte

are very promising being very selective to CO2 [1–6]. The properties of NASICON are suitable for use in electrochemical devices, provided that the ceramic is dense. A commercial NASICON product (NGK Co. Ltd, Japan) with nominal composition Na3Zr2Si2PO12 was investigated as a CO2 electrochemical sensor [7– 9]. However, the porosity of the NASICON materials was too high to guarantee a sensing performance adequate for practical applications. One of the main challenges in the preparation of NASICON ceramics is the lowering of their sintering temperature [10]. Below

NASICON-type structures exist in a large triangular portion of the quaternary phase diagram Na2O-ZrO2-P2O5-SiO2, delimited by the compositions: NaZr2P3O12, Na4Zr2Si3O12, and Na4Zr1:25 P2O12 [12]. Nevertheless, most of the studies on NASICON have been concentrated on the above reported general formula, in the composition range 1:8 5 x 5 2:4 [13–17], because the compounds in that range showed the highest conductivity values [18,19]. Only few investigations were devoted to different compositions [12,20–24]: Kohler et al. [12] and later Rudolf et al. [21,22] succeeded in preparing Zr-deﬁcient monoclinic compositions. Outside the aforesaid triangular portion of the phase diagram, metastable NASICON phases were also synthesized [25].

The synthesis of NASICON as a pure phase is very difﬁcult, especially when performed by solid-state reaction [15,26,27]. The NASICON phase can be accompanied by formation of zirconia and a glassy phase [28]. In order to obtain zirconia-free materials, Von Alpen et al. [29] proposed a different general formula: Na1 135) xZr2 255) x=3SixP3 255) xO12 255) 2x=3. However, though zirconia-free, the materials with this formula also consisted of two phases [30]. The formation of a glassy phase (which is basically a sodium silicophosphate with some dissolved zirconia [28]) has been ascertained for many compositions, [24,28,30] mostly in the silica-rich side. The glassy phase has a large ionic conductivity, but it is rapidly degraded upon contact with water. Moreover, new, liquid phases were formed after high temperature treatments, which were found to improve the powder sinterability [28,30,31].

The ﬁrst sol-gel synthesis of NASICON dates back to 1983 [16], and since then the gel syntheses of NASICON ceramics have been extensively explored [41,42]. However, the preparation of pure NASICON by sol-gel starting from all organic precursors is somewhat problematic, [24,43] while the use of inorganic precursors in aqueous solutions produced NASICON powders of improved quality [44].

Recently, the authors of this paper proposed the synthesis of new NASICON compositions in order to In particular, we improve its sinterability [45]. the Na3Zr2 255) 133)x=4 134) selected Si2 255) xP1  135) x O12 range, thus keeping the Na concentration constant  133) 136) 3 134) at the optimum value reported for ionic conductivity. The materials were prepared using a mixed inorganic-organic sol-gel synthesis, reported in the literature for the preparation of other heterometallic oxides [46,47].

these new NASICON compositions, the correlation between the phase, the sinterability, the microstructural evolution during the sintering, and the electrical conductivity is reported in this paper. Given that a direct relationship between conductivity and the size of the c parameter in the hexagonal cell has been clearly established [20], the resulting modiﬁcations of the cell parameters as a function of the composition were especially studied. Finally, pellets made with the NASICON powders with the new compositions were tested in CO2 gas sensing performance was correlated with the materials characteristics.

NASICON-type materials in the Na3Zr2 255) 133)x=4 134)Si2  255) x P1 135) xO12 system, with x  136) 0 (the standard NASICON

composition, used as reference), 0.667, 1.333, and 2, labeled A, B, C, and D, respectively, were prepared. For sample B, in order to verify the structural and microstructural modiﬁcations induced by limited compositional content was changed slightly keeping the Zr content conto get a Na-excess (Na3:2Zr1:833 stant, Si1:532P1:467O12, B  135) 0:2 sample) and a Na-deﬁcient (Na2:8Zr1:833Si1:132P1:868O12, B  255) 0:2

The powders were prepared using a mixed organicinorganic sol-gel technique, which involved the preliminary formation of an amorphous solid (xerogel), by modifying the molar ratios between the metalorganic reagent, tetraethylortosilicate (TEOS), absolute ethanol (EtOH) and water, according to an improvement of a procedure previously reported [48]. A measured volume of TEOS was added to ethanol and distilled water to have a TEOS : EtOH : water molar ratio of 1 : 10 : 4. These values were chosen considering the TEOS-waterEtOH ternary phase diagram [49], in order to perform the synthesis in the miscible area of the diagram, and thus to better homogenize the reactants and to limit the segregation of zirconia.

The mixture was stirred for 30 min adjusting the pH at about 1–1.5 with the addition of a 1 M solution of HNO3. Stoichiometric quantities of NaNO3 and ZrO(NO3)2 were dissolved in water and added to the previous solution under stirring until a clear phase was obtained. After of (NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution was quickly added, always under stirring. A gelatinous precipitate appeared, which after about half an hour of stirring was dried at 105 14)C in an oven and then calcined in air for 30 min at various temperatures in the 400–1200 14)C range.

The powders were then ground in a planetary mill for 4 h in absolute ethanol to obtain a narrow particle size distribution, lower than 5 mm, as conﬁrmed by laser granulometry (Malvern Particle Sizer 3600D). The powders calcined at 500 14)C were uniaxially (150 MPa) and then isostatically (200 MPa) pressed into pellets of 10 mm in diameter, and sintered at

 Sintering at 1100 14)C was performed in the loss of Na during the heat order to control treatments, even though this temperature is lower than the sintering temperatures usually reported by other authors [50].

The dried powders were analysed by simultaneous thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, Netzsch mod. STA 409, with a heating rate of 10 14)C/min in ﬂowing air), in order to determine the crystallization temperature of the xerogels.

The phase evolution of the powders was analyzed radiation, by X-ray l  136) 1:54060 temperatures. The XRD patterns were recorded at room temperature (20 14)C) with a Philips PW1710 diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator in the diffracted beam and a sample spinner (40 kV, 25 mA, 0.01 y step, 5 s counting time). The lattice parameters, the cell volume and the corresponding theoretical density were determined as a function of composition, as reported in detail elsewhere [51]. The changes in the speciﬁc surface area after calcination at various temperatures were investigated by nitrogen adsorption.

The sintering behavior of the pellets was investigated by dilatometric measurements (Netzsch 402E Dilatometer; heating and cooling rate of 5 14)C/min, isothermal step of 6 h at the max temperature of 1100 14)C). The ﬁnal densities were evaluated by geometrical measurements and weight determination.

treatments) and of

For the electrical conductivity measurements, Au electrodes were deposited by sputtering on both sides of the NASICON pellets. The electrical conductivity of the pellets was determined by means of ac impedance spectroscopy measurements, performed as a function of the temperature in the frequency range 100 Hz to 10 MHz.

electrode was painted onto both sides of the NASICON disks and then heated to 800 14)C. The Pt electrode on the pellet inside the tube acted as a reference electrode. A porous Na2CO3 layer on the measuring platinum electrode was used as auxiliary electrode. For its preparation, a saturated Na2CO3 solution was dripped on the Pt electrode on the outside face and then dried at 80 14)C. The as-prepared element was set in a quartz chamber of 20 ml in volume. For the reference electrode, ambient air was introduced inside the alumina tube at a ﬂow rate of 100 ml/min. A controlled ﬂow, at a ﬂow rate of 100 ml/min, of artiﬁcial air (CO51 ppm, CO252 ppm, HCl5 1 ppm, and H2O510 ppm), without or with CO2 at 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 ppm concentrations, was introduced in the chamber in contact with the sensing electrode side. The EMF of the sensor was measured using a digital electrometer.

The TG-DTA curves for the samples tested showed a large weight in two steps, attributed to the loss of adsorbed water and to the oxidative decomposition of the organic chains (between 300 14)C and 500 14)C, accompanied by an exothermic effect), respectively. A broad DTA peak was observed in the temperature range 650 14)C–800 14)C, which might be associated with NASICON crystallization [14]. The presence of two overlapping peaks was observed at the same temperature range only for sample D.

Given the TG-DTA results, the NASICON powders started their crystallization around 700 14)C. The XRD patterns of the samples heated at the as-determined crystallization temperatures showed only broad peaks of the NASICON structure. The powders were

calcined at 900 14)C and 1200 14)C for 30 min to obtain well crystallized samples. All the products heated to 900 14)C showed broad peaks of the NASICON structure and were free of zirconia peaks. After calcination at 1200 14)C, all the compositions but D were free from foreign phases, such as zirconia. The NASICON structure presented a monoclinic symmetry for composition A and a rhombohedral symmetry for all the others. The sample D was formed by a mixture of two phases: Na2ZrP2O8 [52], and a hexagonal NASICON phase. For this reason, we did not consider sample D for further investigations.

The XRD data for the NASICON samples are summarized in Table 1. A signiﬁcant evolution of the cell parameters and volume was found as a function of the composition. It has been previously reported that a continuous reduction of the cell parameters was measured with decreasing zirconium and silicon content [51], and the same trend was observed for the samples studied in this work. For samples B and C, the Na molar content in the formula was kept constant and equal to the value of sample A, the reference NASICON, while their composition evolved with a progressive decrease in the Zr and Si molar contents. The cell parameters and related cell volume are expected to decrease with a reduction of Zr and Si ions. In fact, given that the principal building units of the characteristic NASICON three-dimensional network are ZrO6 octahedra with corners shared by (Si,P)O4 tetrahedra [11,12], a lower Zr composition has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence in reducing the cell dimension. The Zr ion content in the formula is constant for samples B, B  135) 0:2, and B  255) 0:2. For the classical NASICON composition, Na1 135) xZr2SixP3 255) xO12, it has been reported that an increase in the x value, which means the substitution of the larger Si ions for P ions and associated insertion of charge-compensating Na ions, causes the a0 axis to increase monotonically, while the c0 parameter rises up to a maximum at x  136) 2

and then decreases [53]. A similar relationship was found for the cell parameters of the NASICON samples B, B  135) 0:2, and B  255) 0:2, as shown in Fig. 2, which reports the changes in a0 and c0 cell parameters as a function of the Na content for the present compositions in the B-series and the classical NASICON composition with 1:8 5 x 5 2:2 (data from [53]). The a0 and c0 parameters for classical NASICON were evaluated considering a pseudohexagonal cell the

The variation of the a0 parameter has a more signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the cell volume, which monotonically increases with an increase in the Na content. The room-temperature c0 parameter values for the new compositions are larger than those for the classical NASICON, being closer to those shown by Na3Zr2Si2PO12 at higher tempera 14) A at 350 14)C [53]). tures (22.980 Higher speciﬁc surface area (SSA) were measured for the samples richer in Si, at lower calcination temperatures. However, the SSA strongly decreased

for the Si-rich samples with increasing temperature and approaching their crystallization, while the SSA reduction was less sharp for powder C [45]. The decrease in SSA for the powder A was nearly concentrated between 400 and 500 14)C, which is the temperature range corresponding to the decomposition of the organic residues, as observed in the TGDTA curve.

The above data allowed us to select 500 14)C as the more suitable calcination temperature of the powders, before forming and sintering; this

temperature the weight loss of the precursors was almost completed. Thus, this temperature avoids large shrinkage during sintering induced by signiﬁcant residual weight loss, but also keeps the powders reactive enough during densiﬁcation. After calcination and milling, all the powders presented a similar, narrow particle size distribution, very close to the mean value of 5–6 mm, with an upper limit of about 15 mm.

Figure 3 shows the dilatometric curves during heating measured for the NASICON samples. Several dilatometric curves showed a slight contraction up to 100 14)C, followed by an expansion, as already reported in the literature for NASICON or NASICONtype materials [13,15,54]. Signiﬁcant differences in sintering are evident; sample A underwent a singlestep sintering process having an onset temperature of about 700 14)C. The total shrinkage was about 11% and it was almost completed at about 900 14)C. This process can be ascribed to crystallization of the NASICON powder, as determined by DTA, which is overlapped by the solid-state sintering of the reactive grains. The samples in the B-series showed a two-step sintering process, having an onset temperature of about 740 14)C and about 1000 14)C, respectively. The total shrinkage ranged between 15% for sample B and 23% for sample B  255) 0:2. The contribution of the two steps changed with the P content; the shrinkage associated with the lower temperature step become larger while the shrinkage at higher temperatures become smaller with decreasing the P content. A two-step sintering process, with onset temperatures at about 680 14)C and 950 14)C, was observed for sample C, although most of the shrinkage was associated with the step at higher temperature. This sample underwent a total shrinkage of about 25%.

Also in the A, B, and C series the inﬂuence of the second sintering step is larger with increasing P content. Thus, the second step of the sintering process is ascribable to liquid phase sintering, due to the formation of a glassy phase in the temperature range 950–1050 14)C. The high temperature liquid phase is formed due to the high content of glass-forming oxides, such as silica and phosphorous oxide [30]. In fact, the onset temperature of liquid phase formation decreased with increasing P content, being minimum (950 14)C) for sample C. These ﬁndings support the

Table 2 shows the ﬁnal densities of the NASICON pellets. The density of the sample A sintered at 1100 14)C did not exceed 75% of the theoretical value
Table 2. Final density and phases present as obtained from XRD analysis for the NASICON pellets sintered at 1100 14)C for 6 h

(3.259 g/cm3), even though the green density was large (about 55–65%). This conﬁrmed the poor sinterability of the typical NASICON composition [24]. On the other hand, all the new NASICON materials showed a better densiﬁcation, their density ranging between 88% and 92% of the theoretical value (3.196 g/cm3). This good sinterability was obtained at a temperature which is lower than the sintering temperatures usually reported in the literature for NASICON materials [50]. Given that all the samples underwent the same type of processing and thermal histories, their different behavior should be attributed only to their different composition.

Results of XRD analysis for the pellets sintered at 1100 14)C made of the ﬁve NASICON compositions are also reported in Table 2. While a single NASICON phase was observed for the powders for all the compositions, the separation of a small amount of tetragonal zirconia was clearly observed for the A and B  255) 0:2 compositions. Figure 4 shows the SEM micrographs of the surface for the pellets sintered at 1100 14)C made of the ﬁve NASICON compositions. Pellet A (Fig. 4(a)) showed the presence of large porosity. In the dense areas, relatively small grains (around 500 nm) seem to be embedded in a glassy phase. According to SEM observations, the low sinterability of composition A was due to the presence in the powder of hard agglomerates, which generated a structure with both dense and highly porous regions.

In agreement with the density measurements (Table 2), the presence of pores was hardly detected for the other pellets, while small cracks were observed for pellet C (Fig. 4(e)). SEM observations clearly showed the presence of a glassy phase on the surface of sample B, which makes the observation of the crystalline grains difﬁcult (Fig. 4(b)). The morphology of pellet B  135) 0:2 was somewhat similar to

that of pellet A, with a sharp reduction in porosity and an increase in the glassy phase amount (Fig. 4(c)). Sample B  255) 0:2 showed a homogeneous microstructure of micron-sized equiaxed grains, with a reduced amount of glassy phase (Fig. 4(d)). However, the more signiﬁcant microstructural change was observed for pellet C, which showed a substantial amount of glassy phase embedding large (5 to 10 mm in size) and regularly-shaped grains, with a well-faceted appearance (Fig. 4(e)).

SEM observations of these samples clearly showed the presence of a glassy phase at the high sintering temperature, in agreement with the other ﬁndings reported above. The high temperature liquid or transitory viscous phase gave rise to a glassy phase on cooling. The appearance of this liquid phase may induce the segregation of zirconia crystals by a dissolution-precipitation process. The preferential growth of NASICON crystals is also ascribed to the presence of the glassy phase, observed for pellets C and B  255) 0:2, the richest in P. According to SEM observations, grain growth can again be favored by a dissolution-recrystallization mechanism in the liquid phase.

The electrical conductivity of the NASICON sintered bodies was measured by ac impedance spectroscopy, which in general allows one to distinguish the bulk and the grain boundary resistances in polycrystalline electrolytes [55]. A typical impedance spectra in the complex impedance plane for the NASICON pellets at all the temperatures tested showed the presence of a single semicircle at higher frequencies, together with a linear Warburg-like spike inclined at about 45 14) at lower frequencies. The behavior at low frequency can be ascribed to the electrolyte/electrode interface. The electrodes used were made of Au, an electron conductor, while the charge carriers in NASICON are Na 135) ions. The excess charge due to the charge build-up at the metal electrodes causes a polarization effect at the electrodes.

Since a single semicircle was observed in the impedance, this did not allow separation of the bulk and of the grain boundary contributions [56]. In this case, the values of total conductivity were evaluated from the complex impedance plane plots, calculated from the intercepts of the semicircle with the real axis.

Fig. 4. SEM micrographs of the surface of the pellets sintered at 1100 14)C made of the ﬁve NASICON compositions, A (a), B (b), B  135) 0:2 (c), B  255) 0:2 (d), and C (e).
These values are attributed to a prevalent effect of bulk conductivity and thus will be discussed.
Figure 5 shows the temperature-dependence of the conductivity for the A, B, and C samples. The highest conductivity was shown by sample B at lower the NASICON temperatures. conductivity decreases with a decrease in the lattice constants because of a reduction of the tunnel size for Na 135) migration [20,56]. Thus, the larger conductivity should be expected for the sample A because it has larger lattice constants than the sample B. However, sample A was very porous, and the conductivity of the sample B, we believe, was increased with respect to sample A by its higher density.

A change in slope of the Arrhenius plots was observed for all samples at a temperature around 450– 500K, as reported in the literature [10,28]. The change in slope indicates a change in the conduction mechanisms, which has been earlier correlated with a phase transition [40,57]. However, there is uncertainty in this attribution, as in the present case; in fact, a change from rhombohedral to monoclinic phase is possible for the NASICON structure with conventional Na3Zr2Si2PO12 composition, but phase changes were not observed for the other compositions.

The calculated activation energies were 0.31 eV at low T and 0.19 eV at high T for sample A, and 0.27 eV at low T and 0.16 eV at high T for sample B. The measured conductivity and activation energy values are in line with the values reported in the literature for NASICON [40], although the sintering temperature was as low as 1100 14)C. On the other hand, the conductivity of the sample C was much lower and the activation energy for ion migration was much larger (0.51 eV at low T and 0.40 eV at high T). In this case, the smaller size strongly inﬂuenced the conductivity of sample C. Another explanation of the smaller conductivity of sample C is the presence of a larger amount of glassy phase, which should possess a lower conductivity than that of the NASICON phase [60]. Figure 6 shows the temperature-dependence of the conductivity for the B, B  135) 0:2, and B  255) 0:2 samples. The density of the three samples was nearly the in the order: same. The B4B  135) 0:24B  255) 0:2. The activation energies at high and low temperatures increased in the opposite order: B5B  135) 0:25B  255) 0:2. At T5450K, sample B showed larger conductivity, and the conductivity values observed for sample B  135) 0:2 were larger than those for sample B  255) 0:2, though very slightly. However, at higher the trend of conductivity was the opposite. This trend was not always reproducible, so that a correlation with the lattice parameters is uncertain.

exposing it to air. The electrode reactions are reported in Yamazoe and Miura [61].

Figures 7 and 8 show the EMF response to different concentrations of CO2 for samples B and C, respectively, measured at 470 14)C. A stable EMF response with a good performance was obtained for both samples, also for the sample C which showed a lower conductivity. The response time, both in adsorption and desorption of CO2, was very low especially at high CO2 concentrations. Figure 9 shows the relationship between the EMF and the CO2 gas concentration for the gas sensors prepared using the A, B, and C samples. The EMF values for the sensor using sample A were close to zero. The large porosity of this sample allowed the gas to ﬂow through the electrolyte from the measuring electrode to the reference electrode. In the case of the sensor using the dense B or C electrolyte, the measured sensitivity of 72.5 mV/decade was in good agreement with the theoretical value of 74.0 mV/decade based on a twoelectron electrochemical reaction [6].

These ﬁndings allow us to state that the dense NASICON electrolytes with new compositions, even though their conductivity is smaller than the conductivity of the classical NASICON composition, are promising for the application as solid electrolyte in

presence of a glassy phase and occurrence of liquid phase sintering. The high temperature liquid phase, due to its composition, probably allows the growth of only NASICON crystals by a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism. The conductivity of the samples was affected both by their porosity and lattice parameters. With increasing x, a reduction in conductivity was observed due to the decrease in the tunnel size for fast Na conductivity decreased, these dense electrolyte systems are suitable for application as electrochemical gas sensors. The CO2 gas sensors using highly dense B and C samples show a stable EMF response, very close to the theoretical value.
