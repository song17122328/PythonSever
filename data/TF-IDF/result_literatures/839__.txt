A   new   trivalent   gallium   (Ga3+)  ion  conducting   solid   was   successfully   developed   by   selecting   the   three dimensionally   well-ordered   NASICON-type   structure.   Although   Ga  is  accepted   as   a  species   whose   covalency   is  so   high   that   trivalent   Ga3+ ion   is  inappropriate   ionic   species   in   solids   to  migrate   due   to  its  strong bonding   with   surrounding   ions   such   as   oxide   anion,   we   demonstrated   the  trivalent   Ga3+ ion   conduction   in the   NASICON-type   (GaxTi1−x)4/(4−x)Nb(PO4)3 solids   by   strictly   selecting   the   constituent   cations.   Among   the   10−5 S  cm−1 samples   prepared,   (Ga0.   Among   the   10−5 S  cm−1 samples   prepared,   (Ga0.1Ti0.1Ti0.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 showed   the  highest   Ga3+ ion  conductivity   of   5.9)40/39Nb(PO4)3 showed   the  highest   Ga3+ ion  conductivity   of   5.1   at   600 ◦C.

Solid  electrolytes  are  functional  materials  in  which  single  ion species  generally  migrate  as  a  charge  carrier  in  solids,  and  they are  greatly  expected  to  apply  to  various  electrochemical  devices such  as  rechargeable  batteries  (Li+ ion  conductors  [1]),  fuel  cells (H+ [2]  or  O2− ion  conductors  [3]),  and  chemical  sensors  (many kinds  of  cation  and  anion  conductors)  from  such  a  unique  property of  mass  migration  accompanying  with  electric  charge.  However, most  of  them  are  limited  to  solids  whose  conducting  species  are monovalent  cations  or  divalent  O2− ion  because  they  possess  a  high ionic  conductivity  or  high  chemical  stability,  while  many  kinds  of ions  whose  valence  state  is  from  monovalent  to  tetravalent  have been  discovered  to  migrate  in  solids.

In  general,  ion  conduction  in  solids  depends  on  the  valence state;  the  lower  valence  ions  readily  migrate  compared  to  higher ones  from  the  consideration  of  bond  strength  with  surrounding counter  ions.  As  a  result,  high  valence  cations  such  as  trivalent and  tetravalent  cations  have  been  believed  to  be  poor  migrants in  solids.  However,  after  the  ﬁrst  discovering  of  the  trivalent  Sc3+ cation  conduction  in  Sc2(WO4)3 [4],  various  kinds  of  trivalent  [5] and  tetravalent  cations  [6–8]  have  been  reported  to  migrate  in solids  by  strictly  selecting  both  the  crystal  structure  appropriate  for  ion  migration  and  its  constituents.For  realizing  the  highTherefore,  in  order  to  realize  a  trivalent  Ga3+ ion  conduction  in  solids, it  should  be  required  to  reduce  the  bond  strength  with  oxygen by  introducing  the  cations  which  has  much  higher  valency  and/or higher  electronegativity.

(GaxTi1−x)4/(4−x)Nb(PO4)3 solids  were  synthesized  by  a  conventional  solid-state  reaction  with  high  purity  starting  materials  of Ga2O3 (99.(GaxTi1−x)4/(4−x)Nb(PO4)3 solids  were  synthesized  by  a  conventional  solid-state  reaction  with  high  purity  starting  materials  of Ga2O3 (99.99%,  Kojundo  Chemical  Lab.

After  mixing these  starting  materials  in  a  stoichiometric  ratio  with  an  agate  mortar,  the  mixed  powder  was   calcined  within  alumina  boat  at  600 ◦C for  6  h,  1100 ◦C  for  6  h,  and  1200 ◦C  for  6  h  in  an  air  atmosphere  with interval  mixing  of  the  powder  between  each  calcination  step.

The  obtained  samples  were  identiﬁed  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  analysis  using  Cu  K␣   radiation  (SmartLab,  Rigaku)  with   range  from  10◦ to  40◦ with  a  step a  step  scanning  method  in  the  2 width  of  0.The  obtained  samples  were  identiﬁed  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  analysis  using  Cu  K␣   radiation  (SmartLab,  Rigaku)  with   range  from  10◦ to  40◦ with  a  step a  step  scanning  method  in  the  2 width  of  0.04◦.  The  lattice  volume  of  the  samples  was   calculated ␣-Al2O3 as from  the  XRD  peak  angles,  which  were  reﬁned  using  a  standard.  After  identifying  the  crystal  phase  of  the  samples,  the sample  powders  were  pressed  into  a  pellet  shape  and  sintered  at 1200 ◦C  for  12  h  in  an  air  atmosphere.

The  acconductivity  of  a  sintered  sample  pellet  with  a  sputtered platinum  layer  on  both  center  surfaces  was  measured  using  the complex  impedance  method  in  the  frequency  region  from  5  Hz  to 13  MHz   (1260  Impedance/Gain-Phase  Analyzer,  Solartron)  at  temperatures  between  300  and  600 ◦C  in  various  atmospheres  whose oxygen  partial  pressure  range  was  between  10−9 and  105 Pa.  

Dc electrolysis  was  carried  out  by  applying  a  dc  voltage  of  6  V  to  a sample  pellet  sandwiched  between  Pt  bulk  electrodes  at  800 ◦C  for 168  h  in  atmospheric  air.  After  the  dc  electrolysis,  the  elemental distribution  in  the  electrolyzed  sample  was  examined  by  energy dispersive  X-ray  spectroscopy  (EDX;  SSX-550,  Shimadzu).  Modiﬁed  Tubandt  dc  electrolysis  using  three  sample  pellets  and  Pt  bulk electrodes  was  conducted  at  800 ◦C  for  168  h  by  applying  4  V  in  air, and  the  weight  change  of  each  sample  pellet  was  measured  in  order to  quantitatively  demonstrate  the  Ga3+ migration.

Although  the  conductivity reduced  with  introducing  the  Ga3+ into  the  TiNb(PO4)3 due  to its  large  ionic  size  (larger  ions  may   be  difﬁcult  to  migrate  in rigid  crystal  lattice  compared  to  smaller  ones),  the  conductivity monotonically  increased  with  increasing  the  Ga  content  (x)  in  the ≤ single  phase  region  of  the  NASICON-type  structure  (0.

 Only  Ga  segregation  at  the  cathodic surface  of  the  sample  was  observed  whereas  the  other  cationic species  were  homogeneously  distributed  in  the  sample  pellet, clearly  suggesting  that  the  conducting  cationic  species  in  the (Ga0.  

Only  Ga  segregation  at  the  cathodic surface  of  the  sample  was  observed  whereas  the  other  cationic species  were  homogeneously  distributed  in  the  sample  pellet, clearly  suggesting  that  the  conducting  cationic  species  in  the (Ga0.1Ti0.1Ti0.9)4/3.9)4/3.9Nb(PO4)3 solid  is  only  Ga3+.  

While  the  increase  of the  Ti  concentration  at  anodic  side  was   observed  for  the  electrolyzed  sample,  this  behavior  may   be  caused  by  the  experimental matter;  the  EDX  line  analysis  gives  the  qualitative  result.  After migration  of  Ga3+ from  the  anodic  side,  certain  amount  of  Ti  which occupy  the  same  site  of  Ga  in  the  structure  might  be  increased relatively  at  anodic  side  compared  to  that  inside  of  the  sample pellet. 

 Furthermore,  modiﬁed  Tubandt  dc  electrolysis  using  three sample  pellets  and  Pt  bulk  electrodes  was  conducted  at  800 ◦C (Fig.  4).  If  Ga3+ ion  is  the  conducting  species  in  solid,  clear  weight loss  is  observed  at  the  anodic  pellet  (A)  due  to  the  Ga3+ migration from  pellet  A  to  B  as  well  as  oxygen  release.  After  the  migration of  Ga3+ ions  to  the  cathodic  pellet  C  through  the  middle  pellet  B, Ga3+ ions  should  be  blocked  by  the  cathodic  Pt  bulk  electrode,  and then  segregate  at  the  cathodic  surface,  meaning  that  the  weight gain  is  expected  for  the  pellet  C.  For  the  pellet  B,  any  meaningful weight  change  is  not  observed  theoretically  because  the  Ga3+ ions pass  through  the  pellet.  

Table  1  tabulates  the  observed  weight change  for  each  sample  pellet  together  with  the  theoretical  weight change  estimated  from  the  quantity  of  electron  passed  during  the electrolysis  in  the  case  that  only  Ga3+ ion  is  the  conducting  species. Clear  weight  loss  for  the  anodic  pellet  A  and  weight  gain  for  the cathodic  pellet  C,  which  coincide  well  with  the  theoretical  ones (ca.  99%),  were  observed.  

Since  we  also  elucidated  the  possibility  of electronic  conduction  (e− or  h+)  in  the  sample  by  the  investigation of  dc  and  ac  conductivities  in  various  atmospheres  whose  oxygen partial  pressure  was   varied  between  10−9 and  105 Pa  (the  results are  not  shown  here),  and  estimated  that  the  cationic  transference number  was  over  0.  Since  we  also  elucidated  the  possibility  of electronic  conduction  (e− or  h+)  in  the  sample  by  the  investigation of  dc  and  ac  conductivities  in  various  atmospheres  whose  oxygen partial  pressure  was   varied  between  10−9 and  105 Pa  (the  results are  not  shown  here),  and  estimated  that  the  cationic  transference number  was  over  0.99  in  the  atmospheric  air,  we  can  conclude that  the  conducting  species  in  the  (Ga0.99  in  the  atmospheric  air,  we  can  conclude that  the  conducting  species  in  the  (Ga0.1Ti0.1Ti0.9)4/3.9)4/3.9Nb(PO4)3 solid is  only  Ga3+.  

While  it  was   reported  that  monovalent  Ga+ ion  can be  obtained  in  a  unique  circumstance  such  as  strong  reducing atmosphere  or  non-oxide  material,  the  present  sample  was  prepared  in  air  atmosphere  including  enough  oxygen  (ca.  0.  0.21  atm). Furthermore,  we  successfully  obtained  the  target  composition which  is  estimated  from  the  trivalent  Ga3+ without  any  impurities ≤ for  the  samples  with    0. Furthermore,  we  successfully  obtained  the  target  composition which  is  estimated  from  the  trivalent  Ga3+ without  any  impurities ≤ for  the  samples  with    0.1.1.  From  these  results,  we  can  regard  that the  Ga  ions  in  the  samples  hold  the  trivalent  state.

Although  the  Ga3+ conductivity in  solids  was   still  lower  than  the  other  trivalent  cation  species such  as  Al3+ due  to  its  large  ionic  size  and  its  high  electronegativity,  the  fact  that  such  a  cation  whose  covalency  is  relatively high  can  also  conduct  in  solid  is  important  for  discovering  a  new conducting  species  which  has  been  believed  not  to  migrate  in solids.
