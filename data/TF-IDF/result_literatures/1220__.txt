Solid ionic conductors composed of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.0) with the NASICON-type structure were synthesized with a precursor prepared using the sol–gel method. The electrical conductivity was examined as a function of x in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 at various sintering temperatures and for various sintering periods. The highest electrical conductivity was obtained for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 sintered at 900 °C for 11 h in air. The total and bulk conductivities of the sintered pellet were 1.29 × 10−3 and 2.35 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 was signiﬁcantly increased to 552 Ω cm2 from 12.2 Ω cm2 by immersion in distilled water at 50 °C for one week, whereas the bulk resistance was not increased. However, no signiﬁcant increase of the bulk and grain boundary resistance was observed after immersion in a saturated aqueous solution of LiOH and LiCl. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The lithium–air battery is a promising power source for electric vehicles because of its high theoretical speciﬁc energy density [1]. Two types of Li–air batteries, non-aqueous [2] and aqueous [3], have been developed. The speciﬁc energy density of the nonaqueous system (3460 Wh kg−1) is higher than that of the aqueous system (1910 Wh kg−1); however, the non-aqueous system has some severe problems that must still be addressed, such as lithium corrosion by water and CO2 ingression when operated in air, precipitation of high resistance reaction products (lithium oxide) on the air electrode, and high polarization during charge process. The aqueous system could avoid these problems observed for the non-aqueous system by using a water-stable lithium electrode and an aqueous electrolyte. Lithium metal reacts intensely with water; therefore, the key material of a water-stable lithium electrode is the water-stable lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte, which is used to prevent direct contact of lithium with water [4]. At present, only two types of high lithium ion conducing solid electrolytes are known to be stable in water; one is the Li analog of NASICON, Li1 + xAxM2 − x(PO4)3 (LAMP; A = Al, Sc, M = Ti or Ge) [5], and the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) [6]. The reaction product of the aqueous lithium–air system is LiOH and the concentration of LiOH increases with increasing discharge depth. LAMP and LLZ are unstable in concentrated LiOH aqueous solution, but

are stable in aqueous solution saturated with LiOH and LiCl [7,8]. Therefore, these compounds could be used as the protective layer of the lithium metal electrode for lithium–air batteries with a LiCl saturated aqueous solution. The electrical conductivities of the sintered LLZ and Nbor Y-doped LLZ were reported to be 2 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [6,8–11] and LLZ is stable in contact with lithium metal [6], but it is difﬁcult to prepare a pore-free dense plate of LLZ due to the evaporation of lithium during high temperature sintering. The electrical conductivity of LAMP is dependent on the composition and the preparation method. The respective conductivities of the Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 glass ceramic [12] and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 [13] were as high as 1.3 × 10−3 and 5.08 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. LAMP is unstable in contact with lithium metal; therefore, an interface layer should be used between the lithium metal and LAMP. Zhang et al. [14] reported the fabrication of a cell that consisted of a lithium metal anode, a lithium conducting polymer electrolyte composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with Li(CF3SO2)2N (LiTFSI)-BaTiO3 and a water-stable NASICON-type lithium ion conducting Li1 + x + yAly(Ti,Ge)2 − xP3 − ySiyO12 glass ceramic (Ohara plate), which had an electrode resistance of 173 Ω cm2 at room temperature. The electrical conductivity of the Ohara plate is around 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature.

To reduce the resistance of the water-stable lithium metal electrode, a solid lithium ion conductor with a total conductivity above 10−3 S cm−1 is desirable. However, the total ionic conductivity of polycrystalline lithium ion conductors with the NASICON-type structure is usually in the order of 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, except for the Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 [12] and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3

glass ceramics [13]. The Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic is attractive, because the conductivity of a pelletized sample of the sintered glass ceramic powder was reported to be 4.62 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C [13]. The preparation of the glass ceramics is a little complex and germanium is an expensive element. Fu [15] also studied the Li1 + xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 glass ceramic and found the highest electrical conductivity of 4.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3. The solid solution of Li1 + xAlxGeyTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8, 0.8 ≤ y ≤ 1.0) was synthesized and studied by Maddonado-Manso et al. [16]. The highest bulk and total conductivities at room temperature were 7 × 10−4 and 1.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 for Li1.5Al0.5Ti0.7Ge0.8(PO4)3, respectively. Xu et al. [17] have investigated the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 glass ceramics and reported a maximum room temperature conductivity of 6.21 × 10−4 S cm−1 for Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.53Ge1.07(PO4)4. In this study, the effect of substitution of Ge for Ti on the electrical conductivity have been examined for the whole Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.0) system. The highest total electrical conductivity of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was found for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3. The stability of this high conducting solid electrolyte in aqueous solutions was also studied for application as the protective layer of the water-stable lithium electrode for lithium–air batteries.

The precursor of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 was prepared by the sol–gel method using citric acid, as reported previously [18]. Stoichiometric amounts of Ge(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich) and Ti(OC4H9)4 (Aldrich) were dissolved in ethylene glycol, and then added to a 0.2 M aqueous solution of citric acid and stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. After preparation of the gel was completed, stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were added to the gel solution. The molar ratio of citric acid to Li+ + Al3+ + Ge4+ + Ti4+ was 4:1. After a homogeneous solution was formed, the gel was kept at 170 °C for several hours to allow evaporation of the water and to promote esteriﬁcation and polymerization. The gel was then heated at 500 °C for 4 h to complete the chemical decomposition of nitrates and organic compounds. The black product with residual carbon was ground to a uniformly ﬁne powder with an agate mortar and pestle to increase the surface area of the samples before sintering at 800 °C for 5 h to complete the chemical reaction. The precursor was then grounded by wet milling with a planetary mill (Fritsch) for 15 h to make ﬁne powders, which are necessary to achieve dense ceramic sintering. The ﬁne powder was isostatically pressed (150 MPa) into a pellet (ca. 12 mm diameter, ca. 1.5 mm thick) and then sintered at various temperatures on a gold sheet to protect the samples from reaction with the alumina refractory board.

The crystal structure of the synthesized samples was analyzed using X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD; Rigaku RINT 2500) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a scanning step rate of 0.02° s−1 and using Si powder as an internal standard. The microstructure and morphology of the pellets was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi SEM S-4000).

The AC impedance of sintered pellets with sputtered gold electrodes was measured in air using a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the temperature range from 20 to 80 °C and the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The impedance proﬁles were analyzed to estimate the bulk and grain boundary conductivities using a non-linear instant ﬁt program in the ZView software package. The stability of the sintered pellets was investigated by immersion into distilled water, saturated LiOH, saturated LiCl, and saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solutions at 50 °C for one week. The pellets immersed into these solutions were then carefully washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum at 220 °C for 20 h before measuring electrical conductivity and XRD patterns.

The sol–gel precursor of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 was sintered in the temperature range of 880 to 950 °C for 11 h. The XRD patterns of the samples sintered at 880 and 900 °C indicate the NASICON-type structure without an impurity phases, although an impurity phase of AlPO4 was observed for those samples sintered at 950 °C, as reported by Xu et al., [17] and Mariappan et al. [19] for the glass ceramics. The pellet sintered at 880 °C had a low relative density of 77.9%; therefore, the sintering temperature was ﬁxed at 900 °C for this study.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.6) series sintered at 900 °C for 11 h. These diffraction patterns were indexed according to the NASICON-type structure and impurity phases such as Li3PO4, AlPO4, GeO2, TiO2, GeP2O7, and Li3PO4, which were observed in previous studies [19–21], were below the detection limit. The intensity ratio of the diffraction peaks are changed slightly with x, especially the peaks for the (137) and (2110) planes were diminished for the samples with x = 1.2 and 1.6. Fig. 2 shows the change in the lattice constants with x for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4) at room temperature, where the lattice constants were calculated using the hexagonal unit cell. The lattice constants of both aand c-axes were decreased by substitution of Ti with Ge, which has a smaller ionic radius (0.053 nm) than Ti (0.0605 nm); however, the change does not obey Vegard's law in a range of x = 0 to 1.6. The lattice parameter change suggests that Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 may have a slightly different crystalline structure with Li1.4Al0.4Ge(PO4)3 and in the range of x = 0.3 to 1.2, two phases of the solid solution of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.3Ge0.3(PO4)3 and that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 may exist at room temperature. The miscibility gap was conﬁrmed by the electrical conductivity dependence on x in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3, as discussed later. Fig. 3 shows the relative densities of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 pellets sintered at 900 °C for 11 h as a function of x. The relative densities were calculated from the ratios of the observed densities calculated using the sintered pellet dimensions and weight and those calculated using the lattice parameters. The relative densities of the sintered pellets were increased by the substitution of Ti with Ge and a maximum density of 94.4% was obtained for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3. Further substitution of Ge for Ti provided the second maximum density for Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3. This relative density behavior also suggests that there is a miscibility gap for the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 system.

attributed to the grain boundary resistance [22]. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance, and the diameter of the semicircle indicates the grain boundary resistance. The grain boundary and bulk resistances are dependent on the sintering temperature and period. The highest total conductivity was found for the sample sintered at 900 °C for 11 h; the total electrical conductivity for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.2Ge0.2(PO4)3 at 25 °C was as high as 2.25 × 10−3 S cm−1. However, the electrical conductivity of the as-sintered samples was subject to an aging effect, and the grain boundary resistance was signiﬁcantly increased with the aging period. Fig. 5 shows the total, grain boundary, and bulk conductivities at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.44Ge0.16(PO4)3, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.40Ge0.20(PO4)3, and Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.3Ge0.30(PO4)3 as a function of the aging period. The bulk conductivities of these samples showed no signiﬁcant aging effect, but the grain boundary conductivities of all samples decreased signiﬁcantly with the aging period. Stable conductivity was observed after approximately one month. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.40Ge0.20(PO4)3 sample stored in a glove box also showed a similar increase in grain boundary resistance by aging, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The grain boundary conductivity is affected by impurity phases at the grain boundary. Impurity phases such as Li2O and AlPO4 exhibit both blocking and a space charge effect for lithium ion transport [21]. The increase in grain boundary resistance with the aging period could be explained by a metastable impurity phase with high conductivity in the as-sintered sample, which may change to the stable low conductivity phase by aging. Similar aging behavior was observed for the grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 wt.% ZrO2 (and 3 wt.% Al2O3) [23].

x and that stored in air for one month. The conductivity measured at 25 °C for the as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (4.79 × 10−4 S cm−1) is comparable to that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 prepared using sol–gel precursors (6.13 × 10−4 S cm−1) [24]. The conductivity vs. x curves shows two conductivity peaks at x = 0.2 and 1.2, which suggest the formation of a miscibility gap at room temperature in the solid solution of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3, as observed in the lattice constant change with x. The highest total conductivity of 2.25 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4). The conductivity was decreased with the aging period and a stable total conductivity of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 was observed after one month storage; the stable bulk and grain boundary conductivities were 2.35 × 10−3 and 2.87 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The bulk conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was enhanced approximately 3 times and the grain boundary conductivity by one order when Ge was substituted for Ti. The high total steady state conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4) could be explained by the formation of a high lithium ion mobility phase in the grains and a high grain boundary conductivity phase by the substitution of Ge for Ti. The second conductivity peak was observed at x = 1.2 in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3. The steady state total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities of Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 were 3.43 × 10−4, 6.67 × 10−4 and 7.65 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependence of the bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 in the temperature range of 20 to 80 °C, where the samples were stored at room temperature for one month. These Arrhenius plots are linear in the examined temperature range; therefore, the activation energies for the bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities were calculated from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots and are summarized with the conductivity data in Table 1. The activation energies for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 were calculated to be 20.2 kJ mol−1 for bulk conduction and 55.0 kJ mol−1 for grain boundary conduction, and those for Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3

Fig. 6. Total and bulk electrical conductivities measured at 25 °C for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.6) and the total electrical conductivity measured at 25 °C for stored Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.6) for one month in air.

The NASICON-type structure of LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti or Ge) consists of a three dimensional framework of PO4 tetrahedra corner-sharing with MO6 octahedra, Li+ ions partially occupying at intermediate of the framework [26]. The high bulk conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 suggests that the rigid [(Ti1.4Ge0.2,Al0.4)(PO4)3] skeleton provides easier pathways for migration than that in the [(Ti1.6Al)(PO4)3] skeleton, because the covalency of the Ge\O bond is stronger than that of the Ti\O bond [20]. The slightly higher bulk activation energy for Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 than that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 may be due to their slightly different crystal structures. The detailed differences in the crystal structures should be analyzed to conﬁrm the change in activation energy. The activation energy for the grain boundary conduction of as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 was as low as 30 kJ mol−1 and the grain boundary conductivity was as high as 1.03 × 10−2 S cm−1, while the activation energy of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 stored at room

were 25.7 kJ mol−1 for bulk conduction and 53.3 kJ mol−1 for grain boundary conduction. The activation energy for bulk conduction in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 is slightly lower than that for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (21.1 kJ mol− 1). These activation energies for bulk conduction are lower than those for the high lithium ion conducting glass ceramics of Li1 + xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 (24.4 kJ mol−1) [25], and for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (31.8 kJ mol−1) [20] and Li1.6Al0.6Ti0.7Ge0.8(PO4)3 (33.8 kJ mol−1) [16]. Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 has the lowest activation energy for bulk conduction of the NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solids. The activation energy for bulk conduction in Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 is slightly higher than that for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 and lower than that for Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3. The difference in the activation energy for bulk conduction between Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 could be explained by the miscibility gap of the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 system at room temperature, as observed by the change in the lattice constant with x shown in Fig. 2.

temperature for one month increased to 55.0 kJ mol−1,while the grain boundary conductivity was decreased to 2.87 × 10− 4 S cm− 1. The activation energies for the grain boundary conduction of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 are slightly lower than those of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3. The grain boundary conduction may be inﬂuenced by impurity phases such as Li2O and AlPO4 [21], and the similar grain boundary activation energies for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ti0.4Ge1.2(PO4)3 suggest that the grain boundary impurity phase is similar in these phases.

The stability of the Li1 + x + yAlx(Ti,Ge)2 − xSiyP3O12 glass ceramic (Ohara plate) in aqueous solutions has been extensively studied by Imanishi and coworkers [7,27]. The glass ceramic decomposes in strong acid solution and dissolves in strong alkaline solution. They found that the glass ceramic is stable in saturated LiCl and LiOH aqueous solution, due to the low dissociation of LiOH to ions in the presence of a high Li+ ion content [7]. The stability of the high lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte in saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution is a key issue for application as the protective layer of the lithium metal electrode in aqueous lithium–air batteries, because the reaction product for aqueous lithium–air batteries is LiOH. The stability of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 stored in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, saturated LiOH solution, and saturated LiCl and LiOH solution at 50 °C for one week was examined. The XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in these solutions revealed no impurity phases and there was no change in the ratio of diffraction peaks before and after immersion in these solutions. However, the impedance proﬁles showed a change after immersion in these solutions, as shown in Fig. 8, where the as-sintered samples were used. The grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in aqueous solution increased from 12.2 to 552 Ω cm2, while the bulk resistance increased slightly. A similar increase in grain boundary resistance was observed for the Li1 + x + yAlx(Ti,Ge)2 − xP3 − ySiyO12 glass ceramic (Ohara plate) [27]. This could be explained by the ion-exchange

reaction between Li+ and H+, as observed in Li3xLa2/3TiO3 [28]. The mechanical strength of the pellet also became very poor by immersion in distilled water at 50 °C for 1 week. An increase in the grain boundary resistance was observed for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiOH aqueous solution. On the other hand, the change in the electrical conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 by immersion in saturated LiCl aqueous solution and in saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution was not signiﬁcant. The conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution at 50 °C for one week was 1.66 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is comparable to that of the sample after one week aging shown in Fig. 5. It could be concluded that Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 with high lithium ion electrical conductivity is stable in LiOH and LiCl saturated aqueous solution, and is thus acceptable for use as the protective layer in a water-stable lithium electrode.

The NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3, was prepared using a sol–gel precursor at 900 °C for 11 h. The electrical conductivity of the as-sintered sample exhibited an aging effect and stable conductivity was obtained after storage for approximately one month. The electrical conductivity vs. x curve for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3 has two peaks at x = 0.2 and 1.2. The highest total lithium ion conductivity of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was found for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.4(PO4)3 with a high relative density of 94.4%. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of this sample at 25 °C are 2.35 × 10−3 and 2.87 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively, and the total conductivity of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 is approximately one order higher than that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3. The high lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte exhibited stability in LiOH and LiCl saturated aqueous solution. The high lithium ion conductivity and stability in LiOH and LiCl aqueous solution of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 suggests that this compound is an attractive candidate as the protective layer for the lithium metal electrode in aqueous lithium–air batteries.
