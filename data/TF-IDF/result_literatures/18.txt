Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with 0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 compounds were synthesized using water-based citrate sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction and its Rietveld refinement analysis for x ≤ 0.6 confirmed the formation of a monoclinic NASICON structured compound with a space group P21/n upon sintering at 800 °C for 24 hours. The total conductivity value obtained for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 is 2.47 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 500 oC which is two order of magnitude higher compared to the pristine Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3. The activation energy value for pristine Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 are Ea = 0.84 ± 0.05 eV and Ea = 0.79 ± 0.04 eV respectively. Furthermore, exponent s(T) behaviour was found to increase with rising temperature and is in good agreement with the correlated barrier hopping model. It seems that Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 achieved higher conductivity and lower activation energy than the pristine Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3, indicates that the Sn4+ ion substituted compound make a desirable solid electrolytes for magnesium power storage. 
Rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIB) are considered as an ultimate power storage for numerous applications from portable electronics to hybrid electric vehicle. However, the weaknesses of LIB such as the lower supply of lithium, rising costs and safety issues limit the future utilization of lithium batteries for large-scale applications. Therefore, new, inexpensive, safer and efficient electrical power storage has been explored for possible commercialization. Compared to LIB, a magnesium ion battery is a promising alternative because of many advantages like superior energy, power density, inexpensive, abundant and environmentally benign. One of the main challenges is the absence of a suitable magnesium electrolyte which has set back the realization of the magnesium battery. The capability of the Mg2+ ion migration is the important indicator to be a solid electrolyte in the energy storage systems. Despite a lower Mg2+ ion migration owing to the ionic size and valence state, a preferred suitable crystal structure as a host is crucial in order to assure Mg2+ ion conduction in solid crystalline. Therefore, NASICON (Natrium Super Ionic Conductor) structure have been reported as a successful host for Mg2+ ion transport due to the three-dimension (3D) structure stability and huge interstitial sites for occupying guest ions. NASICON structure was originated by Hong and Goodenough in 1976. The general formula of NASICON, AxB2(PO4)3 where A is usually a mono or divalent cation and B are divalent, trivalent or tetravalent cations can be described as a covalent skeleton [B2P3O12] constituted of PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with BO6 octahedra, which forms 3D interconnected channels for ion migration. Depending on its compositions and temperatures, the NASICON compounds can form crystallographic structure either a rhombohedral, orthorhombic, monoclinic, etc. In rhombohedral structure, there are two conduction sites, M1 and M2 for mobile ion migration inside the channels. These two sites are connected through bottlenecks, where the bottleneck is formed by three oxygen atoms whose make up an isosceles triangle. Meanwhile in monoclinic structure, there are three conduction sites which is M1 and M2 splits the into Mα2 and Mβ2 sites that responsible in creating favourable conduction pathways for ion migration.  Limited number of researches have been done on Mg2+ ion conduction in crystalline solids. Previously, Ikeda et al. (1987) reported on Mg2+ ion conduction with conductivity of 2.9 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 400 °C, and 6.1 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 800 °C for composition MgZr4(PO4)6 compound. In 1992, Nomura et al. investigated substitution of Si4+ for P5+ in MgZr4(PO4)6 solid electrolytes and obtained conductivity of 1.4 × 10-5 S cm-1. Anuar et al. (2014) have successfully synthesized the NASICON-type compound Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and found lower ionic conductivity of 1.0 × 10-6 S cm-1 due to the difficulty of Mg2+ to migrate in large size of NASICON skeleton. Furthermore, Adamu et al. (2016) found that ionic conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was 7.23 × 10-3 S cm-1 at 725 oC.  The main obstacle with Mg2+ ion conducting in crystalline solids is its lower ionic conductivity, which are greatly influence by mobile ion concentration and the crystal structure. This can be done by the substitution of different size of tetravalent B4+ cations. The small difference in ionic radius of B4+ cations and Zr4+ (ionic radius of 0.72 Å) ions may lead to higher conductivity. In 2016, Halim et al.reported increased conductivity by an order of magnitude by substitution of Zr4+ using smaller size Si4+ (ionic radius of 0.40 Å). Another NASICON-type material is Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with R3c space group was first discovered by Barth et al. (1993), The replacement of Zr4+ by Ti4+ (ionic radius of 0.61 Å) was reported to be successful but the compound was investigated as cathode materials. In the present work, not too small nor too large Sn4+ (ionic radius of 0.69 Å) is used to substitute Zr4+ (ionic radius of 0.72 Å) in Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 with the aim to enhance the properties of NASICON structured compound. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge Sn substituted Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 has not yet been reported in the literature. The Sn substitution is expected to produce new promising NASICON structured compound to be used as potential host for development of solid electrolytes for magnesium power storage. Thus, the Sn4+ substituted compounds, Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with composition of 0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 were synthesized by employing water-based citrate sol gel method. The structural, morphological and electrical characteristics of Sn4+ substituted compounds were analyzed and compared with the pristine compound, x = 0.0.  
Firstly, a reference compound of Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with x = 0.0 were synthesized by water-based citrate sol gel method that is slightly different approach from the previous study. High purity starting materials magnesium acetate tetrahydrate (MgCH3COO2)2·H2O), ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH6PO4), zirconium (IV) acetate hydroxide (C6H10O7Zr) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratios. Citric acids (C6H8O7) as chelating agent were used to assist the gelation process. All the materials were dissolved separately in deionized water except zirconium (IV) acetate hydroxide (C6H10O7Zr) were dissolved in acetic acid and continuously stirred until homogenous. The solutions were transferred into a reflux system for 24 hours at 80 oC to obtain homogeneous colloidal solutions. The solutions were vaporized for about 6 hours at 80 oC. 
The resulting gel were then dried in an oven at 120 oC for 24 hours. The acquired precursor powders were then ground and subjected to calcine for 4 hours at 400 oC to remove undesirable organic groups.  The calcined powders were ground and sieved in order to obtain very fine powder and pelletized before sintered at 800 oC for 24 hours. Then, for Sn substituted compounds with composition of x > 0.0, tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·H2O) was added according to the stoichiometric ratio and were synthesized using the above mention method. Furthermore, acetic acid was added dropwise into tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate solution to remove residual chloride salt from starting reagent. The order of mixing precursor solution is also crucial to obtain a homogeneous gel which produce a single-phase compound. 
Thermal behaviour was done by thermal analyser (TGA) using Labsys Evo (Setaram) through heating the precursor powder with temperature range from 30 °C to 1000 °C at 10 °C min-1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer was measured on the sintered powders using PANalytical-Empyrean with Cu-Kα radiation wavelength of 1.5406 Å. The measurement was done with 2θ in range from 5o to 90o at a rate of 0.026o step size at room temperature. The XRD pattern were refined by Rietveld refinement using HighScore Plus 3.0 software for detail structural. Meanwhile, VESTA program was used to obtain the schematic diagram of the detail structural. The surface morphology and chemical composition of sintered pellets were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy which were carried out using cold field emission source of FESEM-EDAX (Hitachi SU8220 series) with acceleration voltage of 2.0 kV. The chemical composition of the sintered compounds was compared using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis obtained by Perkin Elmer Frontier Spectrometer in the wave number range from 500 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 with a resolution of 2 cm-1 at room temperature. The temperature dependent ofimpedance measurements (EIS) were determined by impedance analyzer (Solartron 1260) using two-blocking stainless steel electrode cells sandwiching the sample pellet over frequency range from 1 Hz to 106 Hz and temperature ranging from 300 oC to 500 oC at 25 °C step. The impedance fitting analysis was performed using ZView software. 
TGA for the precursor powder of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 was done to determine the weight changes and the amount of heat absorbed or released by the compound. Figure 1 shows thar there are mainly three stages of weight losses identified in the TG curves upon heating treatment from ambient temperature to 1000 °C. The first weight loss with a reduction of 7.7% between 50 oC to 180 °C is due to evaporation of water followed by endothermic peak at 100 oC. The most significant weight loss is of 13.2% observed between 200 °C and 420 °C as a result of the decomposition process of the combustion residual organic compounds. The third weight loss is 2.5% is observed between 420 °C and 650 °C which is accompanied by a broad exothermic peak at 450 °C corresponds to the crystallization process of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound. The last negligible weight loss of 0.1% is between 850 oC to 900 oC and supported by the presence of a small exothermic peak at 880 oC owing to the reaction of formation of secondary phase ZrO2. Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound is relatively stable without weight loss and heat flow changes below 850 °C. Therefore, for that reason and according to the previous study by Anuar et al., an appropriate temperature of 800 °C is adopted to sinter Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with different compositions. 
The XRD patterns of Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compounds sintered at 800 oC for 24 hours are shown in Figure 2. The XRD data were analyzed by Rietveld refinement based on monoclinic crystal structure (ICSD 98-025-0452). As can be observed for Sn-added compounds with composition of x ≤ 0.6, the well crystallized XRD patterns can be indexed with monoclinic crystal structure and a space group of P21/n with a small amount of SnP2O7 as a secondary phase in the compound of x = 0.6. No other phases are detected in the XRD peaks including chloride salts. Nevertheless, the space group P21/n did not conserve for the whole composition range as SnP2O7 phase started to dominate in the compound Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with composition of x = 0.75. When the composition of x is increase to 1.0, the crystalline phase was not able to be identified or indexed with standard crystal structure due to multiple phases exist. The Rietveld refinement of the selected Sn composition is shown in Figure 3 (a), (b), (c) and (d). The refinement shows a good agreement between the fitted and experimental XRD pattern with Rietveld refinement reliability factors, unit cell parameters and the fraction of the secondary phases as listed in Table 1 for Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compounds.  The obtained lattice parameters of the reference compound of x = 0.0 are similar with the findings reported by Pet’kov et al. Meanwhile, the Rietveld refinement for composition of x ≥ 0.75 confirms that the monoclinic phase with a space group P21/n is no longer persist in the crystal structure. Instead, SnP2O7 phase is identified from the Mg0.5Zr0.25Sn0.75(PO4)3 peak and can be refined as 74.3% with the R-factor values of weighted R-profile, Rwp = 6.74 and good of fitness, χ2 = 1.48. However, the crystalline phase of Mg0.5Sn2(PO4)3 was not present and unable to be refined due to multiple phases exist.  The refined lattice parameters (a, b, c) and unit-cell volume (V) as a function of the Sn composition decreases with increment of Sn content attributed to the difference of ionic radius between Zr4+ (0.72 Å) and Sn4+ (0.69 Å) ions. The reduction in lattice parameters and shift of XRD peaks (31-1) towards higher angle with increase in Sn composition confirms that the substitution of Sn4+ ions have been incorporated into the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 NASICON-type structure. The successful substitution of Zr4+ by Sn4+ ion on the octahedral site results in lower lattice parameters and the shrinkage of the unit cell volumes, implying a change in bottleneck size for conduction channel for Mg2+ ions.  The refined crystal structure of (a) Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and (b) Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 NASICON structured compounds with two different orientations are shown in Figure 4. The schematic diagram of monoclinic crystal structure with space group P21/n is generated using VESTA software. In P21/n space group, there are γ1 site and β2 (M2) site, which γ1 site splits into β1 (M1) site and β3 (M3) site. The schematic diagram shows that both studied Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compounds consist of regular ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra connected to oxygen atoms. However, for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound, it can be observed that Sn4+ substituted Zr4+ ion produced 5-fold coordination and form distorted trigonal bipyramid interconnected to two corners of oxygen with Mg atoms and also 4-fold coordination distorted tetrahedra. The monoclinic NASICON structured compound has three conduction sites which is M1, M2 and M3 with M1 site of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 is half occupied at 4e Wyckoff site by Mg2+ ions. It is predicted that the conduction of Mg2+ ion through the interstitial site of the corner shared network. The obtained average P – O, Zr – O, Mg – O, distorted trigonal bipyramid and tetrahedral bond length and polyhedral volumes are listed in Table 2. The decrease of bond length and also polyhedral volume is correlated to the unit cell reduction. The values of PO4 tetrahedral bond length for both compounds are in good agreement with those typically observed in NASICON phosphates. The decrease in polyhedral volumes of Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compared with reference compound shows an increase in polyhedral distortion.  The relation between crystallite size to the peak width, is derived from Scherrer formula: where k is the Scherer constant value (0.94), λ is the wavelength of the source (Copper-K, λ=1.5406Å), β is the full-width at half-maximum, FWHM (in radians) and ϑ is the Bragg angle (in radians). The crystallite sizes are found decreases in the range from 39.9 nm to 29.9 nm as the Sn composition increases. The theoretical value of density for Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compounds is in close agreement with that given by ICSD (98-025-0452). The smaller crystallite size contributes to the intensity of the XRD peak broadening suggesting lower crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystallite size and increased densification in the compounds may be related to the sol gel method. This lower temperature synthesis control the dimensions of a material on a nanometer scale from the initial stages that resulted in the formation of nanocrystalline instead of where k is the Scherer constant value (0.94), λ is the wavelength of the source (Copper-K, λ=1.5406Å), β is the full-width at half-maximum, FWHM (in radians) and ϑ is the Bragg angle (in radians). The crystallite sizes are found decreases in the range from 39.9 nm to 29.9 nm as the Sn composition increases. The theoretical value of density for Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compounds is in close agreement with that given by ICSD (98-025-0452). The smaller crystallite size contributes to the intensity of the XRD peak broadening suggesting lower crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystallite size and increased densification in the compounds may be related to the sol gel method. This lower temperature synthesis control the dimensions of a material on a nanometer scale from the initial stages that resulted in the formation of nanocrystalline instead of microcrystalline materials. Based on the best Rietveld refinement agreement factors values, the Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound is chosen for further analysis.
Figure 5 displays FTIR spectrum in the spectral region from 500 to 2000 cm−1 as an additional confirmation of the formation of Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compound. The spectrum of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 is also displayed for comparison purpose.  The characteristic bands for PO43− vibration are observed in the expected regions. It can be clearly seen that both spectrum (x = 0.0 and 0.5) in the range spectral region are dominated by the fundamental vibrations of the PO43− tetrahedral and they appear at different positions in the range from 500 to 2000 cm−1 for both compounds. The O-P-O asymmetric bending vibration at the range of 550 to 650 cm-1 band can be observed the IR spectra. The absorption peaks in the range of 700 - 750 cm-1 are assigned to the stretching vibration of P-O-P.  Meanwhile, the most significant absorption bands in the region of 900 to 1070 cm−1 are assigned to the V1 symmetric stretching vibrations of the PO43− ions, and bands in the region of 1100 to 1200 cm−1 are attributed to the V3 antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the PO43− ions. The vibration bands are observed at the same wavenumbers in both compounds. With the addition of Sn, the PO43− stretching vibration peaks is shifted towards the high wavenumber. This is due to shorter P-O distance (1.5450 Å) in Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compared to Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (1.5763 Å) that confirms the substitution of Sn4+ ions in Zr site induced a distorted tetrahedra. The intensity of the absorption peaks of the compound with x = 0.5 is lower compared to that with x = 0.0 indicating lower crystallinity. This is consistent with smaller crystallite size as mentioned earlier. 
The morphological features for both surfaces and fractured (cross-section) surfaces for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compounds sintered at 800 oC are shown in Figure 6. The cross-section image shows similar microstructure with the top surfaces FESEM images. The morphology image of both compounds consisted of an irregular grain in the range of 200 nm – 500 nm size consistent with nano crystallite size mentioned earlier. High temperature sintering process induced neck growth where the grains were interconnected with each other. The growth and aggregating of irregular grains have decreased pores and increased densification of the compounds.  The experimental density was calculated by geometrical methods and found to be 3.02 gcm-3 for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and increased to 3.29 gcm-3 for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3. Meanwhile, the ratio between the density obtained experimentally and theoretically is 92.98% for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and 97.92% for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound. The morphology image shows Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 are more porous compared to the Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound which is denser and proved by both increasing theoretical and experimental density. The Sn ion substitution resulted in better neck formation, grain growth and substantially reduced the amount of porosity by making the grains move closer, thus improved the relative density of pellets. The lower relative density indicates the formation of higher amount of pores in Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compared to Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound. 
Figure 7 shows EDX elemental analysis for both Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compounds. The point analysis of the elemental examination for both compounds was conducted by EDX measurements at different points on the surface of the grains. The obtained results show a good agreement with initial stoichiometry for each compound. The obtained stoichiometric ratio proves that Sn4+ have been successfully substituted into Zr4+ site in Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 compounds. Table 3 shows the elemental analysis stoichiometric atomic ratio of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3. The average size of the particles obtained from particle size distributions curve as shown in Figure 8 is 27.1 μm and 25.9 μm for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compounds respectively. The difference in particle size may have been due to the substitutions of Zr4+ ion (0.72 Å) with smaller Sn4+ ion (0.69 Å). The size of the particles in the compounds becomes smaller as when Sn is substituted to the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and consistent with crystallite size as discussed earlier. The average particle size of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 is much smaller compared to the particle size synthesized by Anuar et al. due to the sieving process. 
The complex impedance spectra were recorded for both Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 at stable high temperatures from 350 oC to 500 oC. Figure 9 (a) and (b) show the selected fitted experimental impedance data for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3  at 500oC. The complex impedance plot shows two overlapping semicircles at low and high frequency regions, indicating electrical contribution from bulk and grain boundary effects. Further, the presence of two semicircles with its intercept at the x-axis assigned to bulk resistance (Rb) and intercept at low frequency corresponds to grain boundary resistance (Rgb). The best fit (presented as a solid red line) is obtained using the ZView software by employing an equivalent circuit representing the complex impedance plot which are shown in the inset of Figure 9 (a) and (b). It is includes (Rs) for high frequency contact resistance in series with parallel constant-phase element (CPEb) and a resistance (Rb) attributed to the bulk response and in series with parallel constant-phase element (CPEgb) and a resistance (Rgb) attributed to the grain boundary response for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound. Furthermore, a slope is seen at low frequency indicating the presence of charge carriers accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface, hence the additional (CPEi) component connected in series. Meanwhile, the equivalent circuit for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound consisting of a parallel combination of Rb|CPEb and Rgb|CPEgb in series with resistance (Rs) for high frequency contact resistance. When the electrode contacts with the electrolyte, there will be a thermodynamic potential gap between the electrode and electrolyte and its effects the diffusion of charge carriers. The good surface area contact between the Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound and the electrode (since the average particle size of this compound decreases compared to the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound) may cause the decreases of charge carriers accumulation at the electrode/electrolyte interface, hence no slope observed at low frequency. The general expression of the CPE is where C is the ideal capacitance when n = 1, j = (-1)1/2, and ω is the angular frequency.
The bulk conductivity,  and grain boundary conductivity,  of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 is calculated from the bulk resistance and grain boundary resistance using the following equations: where t is the thickness of the pellet, A is the contact area with the electrode, Rb is the bulk resistance and Rgb is grain boundary resistance, which is determined from the complex impedance plot. As temperature increases, the value of both bulk resistances, Rb and grain boundary resistance, Rgb moved to lower impedance values indicating the increment in conductivity. Total conductivity is calculated from the equation: where σt is the total conductivity, σb is bulk conductivity and σgb is grain boundary conductivity. It can be observed that total conductivity increasing from ~ 3.54 × 10−7 S cm−1 to 2.47 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 500 °C for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 respectively. The smaller values of lattice parameters and volumes in Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 due to the Sn4+ ion substituted in Zr4+ site contributes to the ionic conductivity enhancement by optimizing bottleneck size to ease Mg2+ ion hopping in the structure. Furthermore, higher relative density in Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 could provide more access for the Mg2+ ion migration at the grain boundary to assist the enhancement of total ionic conductivity.
The DC activation energy, Ea is calculated by using the Arrhenius equation:where σt is total conductivity, Ea is activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is absolute temperature and Ao is pre-exponential factor. Figure 10 shows the Arrhenius plots for Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3, x = 0.0 and 0.5 compound respectively with regression value of the plots (R2 ~ 1.0). From Arrhenius plot, the obtained activation energy, Ea = (0.84 ± 0.05) eV decreasing to Ea = (0.79 ± 0.04) eV for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 respectively, owing to high mobility of the Mg2+ ions leading to the higher conductivity values. The activation energy value for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 is comparable with those reported by Adamu et al. On the other hand, the shorter interatomic distance between Mg-O atoms and distorted polyhedral appears to lower the activation energy by unblock the conduction pathway, and as well become favourable hoping distances through optimum bottleneck sizes for Mg2+ ion conduction. There are no changes of crystal structure and phase are involved in this temperature range measurement. The smaller unit-cell volume corresponds to the successful Sn4+ ion substitution, which leads to optimum size of conduction channels for Mg2+ ion mobility and thus lower the activation energy. The lower values of activation energy of Ea = 0.79 ± 0.04 eV and higher ionic conductivity of 2.47 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 500 °C is achieved for the Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound. 
Figure 11 (a) and (b) shows the variation of the real part of conductivity, σac as a function of frequency, ω at elevated temperatures for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compounds. The plots show typical behaviour of ionic materials, consisting of two different regions which is a frequency independent plateau region correlated to dc conductivity and a higher frequency dispersion region.  At low frequency, the dc conductivity plateau attributed to the short-range successful hopping between neighbouring sites, while at higher frequencies, the acconductivity starts increasing with a noticeable dispersion. The dispersion becomes prominent and shifts as the temperature increases. The increasing conductivity with elevated temperature corresponding to the thermal activation of conducting species in the compounds. This relaxation behaviour is due to the probability of the ion to turn back to its initial site attributed to the short periods of time. The σac vs ω lines are fitted by Jonscher’s universal power law: where σdc is the ω → 0 limit value for σac (ω). A is constant and are the frequency exponents represents the interaction between mobile ions with the surrounding lattice. Exponent value of s change with the temperature and frequency indicate the type of conduction mechanism in the material. The temperature dependence of s suggests several theoretical models correlating the conduction mechanism. The quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) model is based on phonon-assisted electron tunneling and predicts the value of s increases slightly with rising temperature. Meanwhile, the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model signify the values of s decrease with rising temperatures. The value of the exponent s in the range 0 < s < 1 which is the characteristic for hopping of mobile charge carrier phenomena. The values of s obtained from the power law equation fitting at high frequency region slopes with regression coefficients, R2 close to unity are in the range 0.984 - 0.703 and 0.876 - 0.548 to for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 respectively. Figure 12 shows the temperature dependence of the exponent s for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 compound. It is found that the value of s is decreasing with increasing temperature, suggests correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model to describe the conduction mechanism. CBH model verify that conduction is associated with charge carriers hopping process between two sites over a barrier separating them. The crossover frequency from σdc to the dispersive region is characterized as hopping frequency of the charge carrier, ωh can be determined from the graph in Figure 11 when σac (ω) = 2σdc. Figure 13 shows the variation of log ωh versus 1000/T. The activation energy for hopping frequency obey the Arrhenius relation resulting in Eh = (0.89 ± 0.05) eV for Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 and Eh = (0.78 ± 0.02) for Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3. The activation energy, Ea determined from dc conductivity are similar with the energy for hopping frequency, Eh determined from the ac conductivity indicates that the mobility of the charge carriers is due to a hopping mechanism. Hence, suggests that the charge carriers need to overcome the same energy barrier during both conduction and relaxation processes. Mg0.5(Zr1-xSnx)2(PO4)3 with 0.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 was successfully synthesized by water-based citrate sol-gel method. Rietveld refinement of XRD measurements revealed the formation of NASICON-type monoclinic P21/n for Sn4+ substituted compound with composition of x ≤ 0.6. The optimum composition based on Rietveld refinement analysis is Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 which improved ionic conductivity of 2.47 × 10−5 S cm−1 by two order of magnitude compared to the pristine compound. Furthermore, Mg0.5ZrSn(PO4)3 obtained lower activation energy Ea = 0.79 ± 0.04 eV as a result of wider triangular window due to unblocking by distorted polyhedral. This work shows that the Sn4+ substitution yield alternative parent compound for development of potential solid electrolyte for magnesium energy storage applications.
