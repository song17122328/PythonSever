A NASICON-structure Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by carbothermal reduction method is employed in a hybrid-ion battery with Li-involved electrolyte and anode. The ion-transportation mechanism is firstly investigated in this complicated system for an open three-dimensional framework Na3V2(PO4)3. Ionexchange is greatly influenced by the standing time, for example, the 1 hour battery presents a specific capacity of 128 mA h g 1 while the 24 hour battery exhibits a value of 148 mA h g 1 with improved rate and cycling performances over existing literature reported Li-ion batteries. In the hybrid-ion system, an ion-exchange process likely takes place between the two Na(2) sites in the rhombohedral structure. NaLi2V2(PO4)3 could be produced by ion-transportation since the Na+ in the Na(1) site is stationary and the three Na(2) sites could be used to accommodate the incoming alkali ions; LixNayV2(PO4)3 would come out when the vacant site in Na(2) was occupied depending on the applied voltage range. The reported methodology and power characteristics are greater than those previously reported.

Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) dominate over other rechargeable batteries as power sources for various types of applications, such as mobile electronics and electrical vehicles due to their superior properties in power and energy densities.1 However, LIBs are becoming questionable, now from not only the low abundance of lithium in the earth’s crust (0.0065%) with the corresponding high cost, but also a low eﬃcient recycling,2–4 though they have been viewed as the best solution for demanding energy storage.5 Alternatively, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have come up as more suitable stationary batteries targeting smart grid applications and renewable energy storage because of the easy accessibility of sodium reserves (2.8% in the earth’s crust) making the device scalable and low cost in addition to the high power performance to fulfill high rate operations which is also a critical standard for batteries.6,7

5,15,16 have been proved to be NaTi2(PO4)3 promising as active materials in cathodes or anodes. Among these, NASICON (for Na+ superionic conductor)-type polyanion Na3V2(PO4)3 has shown great potential as a lithium-insertion cathode due to the open framework with highest ionic mobility. The well-known NASICON skeleton is built of XO4 (X = P, Si, etc.) tetrahedra corner-sharing with MO6 (M = transition metal) octahedra that form the lantern units, which are assembled into a 3D M2X3O12 structure with large tunnels with defined M(1) (one position per formula unit) and M(2) (three positions per formula unit) interstitial sites in the rhombohedral form that are usually employed to accommodate mobile alkali ions (A = Li, Na) (fully or partially filled) for a lattice perturbationfree intercalation/de-intercalation process.17 The Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) with rhombohedral NASICON structure can be prepared by a direct solid-state reaction and another monoclinic b-Fe2(SO4)3 type crystallization as reported by Shigeto et al.18

Rhombohedral NVP assembled into a sodium rechargeable battery possesses two redox electric potentials (3.4 and 1.6 V vs. Na+/Na) based on the V4+/V3+ and V3+/V2+ redox couples, respectively, from which properties allow this material to be used, not only as cathodes, but also as anodes. NVP as electrodes in a full symmetric cell and as an anode in a sodium cell have been constructed and electrochemically investigated,18,19 and its lower intercalation/ de-intercalation potential alongside the NASICON structure may promote it to be used as an aqueous battery.20 The multifunctional NVP cathode delivered a specific capacity of 84.8 mA h g 1, and

maintained good thermal stability up to 450 1C even in the desodiated state.6 Notably, carbon coated and porous NVPs have displayed impressive performances with capacities of 98.6 and 116 mA h g 1 and remarkable capacity retention and excellent rate capabilities, attributed to there being no fundamental change in the host 3D structure occurring as the intercalation proceeds.5,18,19 Recently, a hybrid ion battery using a NVP cathode and a lithium anode exhibited an initial specific capacity of 114.2 mA h g 1 21 while only two-thirds of the Na+ (or Li+) can be reversibly extracted/inserted from the NASICON framework, resulting from the lower electronic/ionic conductivity of the end-member of V2(PO4)3 and the consumption of higher energies associated with the V5+/V4+ redox couple.22,23 However, the performance of a hybrid NVP–LiPF6–Li cell system should be mainly dependent on the properties of a generated LixNayV2(PO4)3 phase which will be investigated herein. This work demonstrates superior performance characteristics over existing literature reports (see above), namely, the 1 hour battery presents a specific capacity of 128 mA h g 1 while the 24 hour battery has 148 mA h g 1.

section 2.1. Synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3 NVP was prepared by a carbothermal reduction method with stoichiometric amounts of analytical purity Na2CO3, NH4H2PO4, V2O5 and acetylene black powders (5 wt% excess acetylene black was used as the conductive agent while the rest was used as the reducer for the reaction in order to keep the stoichiometric ratio) being mixed and ground. The mixture was reground and fired at 700 1C in an argon atmosphere for 8 h after preheating at 350 1C in argon for 4 h.

The crystallographic structure of the material was studied by X-ray powder diﬀraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 diﬀractometer with monochromatic Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5406 Å), and the diﬀraction data were recorded in the 2y range 10–601 with a scan rate of 81 per min. The infrared (IR) spectra were obtained using an FT-IR Spectrometer (Jasco, FT/TR-4100, Japan) under transmission mode based on the KBr pellet method in the range 500–2000 cm 1. The particle morphology of the composite was investigated by a FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) of the samples was carried out on a Diamond TG thermo-analyzer.

The cathode was fabricated with the active material, acetylene black, and binder (Polyvinylidene Fluoride, PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 by using NMP as a solvent and an aluminum foil as a current collector (B4.5 mg cm 2), followed by drying in a vacuum at 110 1C for 24 h. The R2016 coin cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box using lithium foil as an anode, and a Celgard 2500 membrane as a separator. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (v/v/v, 1/1/1). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge

cycling tests were carried out in a setting voltage range by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C) and a CT2001A LAND battery tester, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was studied using a Modulab (Solartron Analytical) with an amplitude of 5 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 10 MHz. All electrochemical tests were carried out at room temperature.

Fig. 1 depicts the XRD pattern of the as-prepared NVP with the crystal structure at diﬀerent orientations. All the peaks compare well with previous reports5,6,19 and the structural parameters are a = 8.724 Å and c = 21.764 Å, which were indexed to the NASICON structure with a R%3c space group (rhombohedral unit cell). The crystal structure shows that the octahedral VO6 interlinks via corners with tetrahedral PO4 to establish the polyanion [V2(PO4)3] units in the c-axis direction which are interconnected through PO4 to the same neighboring units, and each primitive cell of NVP contains six formula units built up from a [V2(PO4)3] framework anion and two diﬀerent oxygen environment sodium atoms, of which the first one is six fold coordination [Na(1)] and the other is eight fold coordination [Na(2)]. Four cations could be hosted in the voids/channels per formula unit of [V2(PO4)3] if all the Na sites could be occupied; one Na(1) site and three Na(2) sites. However, the Na3V2(PO4)3 with a stable oxidation state of V3+ would be more favorable to be prepared compared with the Na4V2(PO4)3 with an unstable state of V2+, while the V2+ state could be easily achieved by an electrochemical reaction within a controllable voltage range.

The formation of the as-prepared NVP was also confirmed by FT-IR analysis as shown in Fig. 2, and the result agrees well with Jang’s work.6 For NVP (700 1C), the bands appeared obviously compared with that of the NVP precursor (350 1C) indicating a fine crystallization of NVP at 700 1C. The bands at 577 and 1050 cm 1 suggest the presence of P–O bonds in PO4 tetrahedra, and the vibration from the V3+–O2  bonds in isolated VO6 octahedra was detected at 629 and 978 cm 1. Moreover, the bands at 760 and 950 cm 1 which are characteristic of the occurrence of

NVP sample in an air atmosphere as shown in the inset, as a result of the decomposition and escape of gases from the reactive agents.

The five anterior CV cyclic curves of the NVP electrode at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s 1 are displayed in Fig. 4. Two redox couples can be observed which were assigned to the V3+/V4+ reaction accompanied by the extraction/insertion of two hybrid ions (Na+ or Li+), while the first CV curves performed very diﬀerently from the following ones with the redox peaks shifting and one redox couple almost disappearing after the fifth CV cycle. The reason for this is that the transported hybrid ions involved Na+/Li+ in the first cycle and then predominately favored Li+ in the sequential cycles due to the irreversibility of Na+ and a vast excess of Li+. Furthermore, the hysteresis between the two redox peaks increased gradually with the cycles indicating an enlarged electrode polarization and an electrode reformation.13

The NVP electrode which has undergone 10 CV cycles at 0.5 mV s 1 in a voltage window 2.3–4.8 V vs. Li+/Li, continued to be tested at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1 mV s 1, respectively, and the results are displayed in Fig. 5. Herein these CV curves are only composed of one obvious symmetric redox couple demonstrating that the predominant Li+ transportation was absent during the cycles after the 10th, otherwise two redox couples should come out as the different insertion–desertion behaviors between the Li+ and Na+ ions like that shown in Fig. 4. The good linear relationships between the square root of the scan rate v1/2 and peak current ip in the inset illustrate a diffusion-controlled process for the whole electrode reaction and a typical equilibrium behavior of an intercalated type electrode.

V5+ in VO6 octahedra were not observed illustrating that the V5+ have been reduced to V3+, and the infrared bands in the range 1150–1250 cm 1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of terminal PO4 units.24 The combination of XRD and FT-IR analyses demonstrate that the as-prepared NVP with a rhombohedral NASICON structure was properly synthesized by the utilized carbothermal reduction method. SEM images of the NVP (Fig. 2 inset) show a network of particles distributed in the range 100–200 nm with an irregular morphology. The growth of NVP particles was hindered as the existing carbon source in carbothermal reduction and some particles have been interconnected closely which might be convenient to improve electron transport.

According to the TG/DTG curves of the NVP precursor in an argon atmosphere, as shown in Fig. 3, the sharp endothermic peaks between 100 1C and 300 1C mainly originate from the evaporation of water, carbon dioxide and ammonia from the precursor, and the peaks between 643 1C and 720 1C indicate the formation of NVP crystals. Furthermore, the TG/DTG curves became flat above 720 1C demonstrating the completion of the entire reaction. In addition, the carbon content of the sample was about 6.9% obtained from the TG curves of the

Fig. 5 CV curves at diﬀerent scan rates of NVP after 10 CV cycles at 0.5 mV s 1 in a voltage range 2.3–4.8 V vs. Li+/Li, and the corresponding relationship between the square root of the scan rate v1/2 and peak current ip shown in the inset.

could be obtained, while the NVP has a theoretical capacity of 117 mA h g 1 presuming two V3+ are oxidized to V4+ with two Na+ ions inserted/extracted, which has been confirmed independently by ex situ XPS studies.5 The voltage polarizations of the batteries seemed to decrease from 0.12 V to 0.08 V when the hybrid-ion system batteries were operated as long as 24 hr. These high capacities and low polarizations for the hybrid-ion batteries mainly resulted from the effect of ion-exchange between the electrolyte and the NVP which was confirmed by ICP-AES analysis,21 introducing many lighter and smaller lithium ions in the NVP electrode system. The incoming lithium ions which occupy two Na(2) sites and extract/insert in a faster and more facile way compared to the pristine sodium ions, could improve the electrochemical behavior and the specific capacity found using Faraday’s law (C = 26.8n/M A h g 1, where C is the theoretical capacity of the active material, n is the number of electrons in the reaction and M is the relative molecular mass).

Galvanostatic cycling is another means to make ions exchange, and the initial and sixth charge–discharge curves of the 1 h-operated battery tested at 0.1 C in the range 1.6–4.6 V are displayed in Fig. 6b. Obviously, the charge curve and discharge curve of the sixth charge is steep compared with the initial one before and after the voltage plateau, illustrating a faster insertion and desertion process of the hybrid-ion battery as a result of the exchanged lithium ions. The inset of Fig. 6b and c shows the cycling performance of the 1 h-operated and 24 h-operated hybrid-ion batteries at different current rates and a better result of 114 mA h g 1 (corresponding to a retention of 90.5%) after 100 cycles was achieved for the 24 h-operated hybridion batteries. The obtained coulomb efficiency was always over 98% as shown in Fig. 6c. This is likely since the two Na(2) sites have been totally occupied by smaller ionic radius lithium ions through adequate ion-exchange (24 h-operated) which allows facile accommodation and transport, while an inadequate process (1 h-operated) causes ions piling up in charge–discharge to block the ions embedding in the crystal sites and decreasing the

corresponding properties (Scheme 1). The discharge capacity was diminished by increasing current density and recovered when the current was lowered back to 0.1 C, indicating a kinetically slow ion diffusion process as a result of the poor electronic conductivity of the NASICON cathode material.25

Fig. 7 EIS results of the NVP/Li hybrid-ion coin cell having undergone 30 galvanostatic cycles and charged to 3.0 and 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li, respectively. The inset shows the EIS results of a battery after 1 and 30 galvanostatic cycles at 3.7 V vs. Li+/Li.

Through the analysis of the results of the NVP hybrid-ion battery presented here, Goodenough suggested that the Na ion tends to remain immobilized in the Na(1) site and a direct lithium-transport mechanism between two Na(2) sites25 could explain experimental performances, although Nazar26 and Gopalakrishnan27 have also reported complete extraction of Na+ from NVP and suggested this be attributed to the diﬀerences in experimental methods.25 The established ion-transport mechanism as described in eqn (1) of the rhombohedral NASICON structure require a correlated motion involving both Na(1) and Na(2) sites which seems diﬃcult to reconcile with our results where the number in parentheses denotes the alkali ions in Na(1) or Na(2) sites and U represents a vacancy in the NVP material, because the obtained charge–discharge curves aren’t correlated with that of ion-exchanged LixV2(PO4)3. If the Na+ ion in the Na(1) site is not selective it should be exchanged, while the Na+ ions could still remain in the cathode after 100 cycles even for Li2NaV2(PO4)3.25 Thus the Na+(1) ion seems stationary and the Li+ or Na+(2) alkali ions may favor a direct exchange among the Na(2) sites as described by eqn (2) and (3).

Fig. 7 shows the EIS results of the NVP/Li hybrid-ion coin cell which have undergone 1 or 30 charge–discharge cycles to ensure stable SEI film formation and charged to 3.0 or 3.7 V for 30th-cycle battery to stabilize the percolation of the electrolyte under various open-circuit conditions. The high-frequency intercept on the Zre represents the solution resistance which consists of the resistance of the electrolyte and an electrode, while the

semicircle designates the charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrolyte and the active material and the straight line in the low frequency region is attributed to the solid phase diffusion resistance of alkali ions. As the inset in Fig. 7 shows, the Rct appears to decrease when the battery is cycled from the 1st to the 30th cycle which indicates that more Li+ transportation is causing a lower resistance to extract from the NVP cathode compared with the heavier Na+ ions. Moreover, the Rct also has diminished when the open-circuit is charged from 3.0 to 3.7 V demonstrating an increase in electrochemical reactivity and ionic conductivity during the first two alkali ion extraction processes.24

The electrochemical voltage–composition curves as Fig. 8 displays, were obtained by galvanostatic cycling at a current density of 0.1 C on the ion-exchanged 24 h-operated NVP battery, and the inset shows the corresponding charge–discharge profiles with a specific capacity of 148 mA h g 1. The number of ions (Dx) in charge (1.47) and discharge (1.27) at the plateau of close to 3.7 V associated with a V3+/V4+ redox couple are different, demonstrating a hybrid-ion extraction/insertion behavior composed by un-ion-exchanged Na+ ions and ion-exchanged Li+ ions. The difference is because the irreversible Na+ ions take more energy (charging capacity) to migrate out from the NVP structure, mainly due to SEI resistance, and have been substituted by smaller and lighter Li+ ions which need less energy (discharging capacity) to insert into the NASICON structure. Until the discharging voltage is 1.6 V, the number of lithium ions in NaLixV2(PO4)3 is about 2.5 postulating that the inserted alkali ions are without Na+ ions and a phase transition occurred at 1.95 V corresponding to about 1.5 lithium ions having been back inserted. When charging begins, 1.93 lithium ions have been ion-exchanged within the NASICON structure and the V3+/ V4+ redox during charging is mainly carried out at 3.7 V, but during discharge, this process is divided into two ion-insertion processes in which insertion of another 0.5 lithium ions takes place below 1.95 V. Combining the reported voltage region to transform the V state in the NVP/Na battery with the standard electrode potential of Li+/Li ( 3.04 V vs. SHE) and Na+/Na

Li ion in the cathode calculated from the crystallographic cell parameter of NVP. From using eqn (4), it was deduced that the reaction-synthesized NaLi2V2(PO4)3 phase could give an anodic and cathodic D value of 2.42  10 10 cm2 s 1 and 1.54  10 10 cm2 s 1, respectively, with a high magnitude of 10 10 cm2 s 1 compared to other NASICON structure materials.13,28,29 The high chemical diﬀusion likely originates from the open 3D structure based on the NASICON material for ion migration which is also expected to be less sensitive to defects as compared with 2D and 1D framework structures.30

A novel NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material was prepared by a carbothermal reduction method with an open threedimensional framework. The NVP was applied as a cathode in a NVP/Li hybrid-ion battery and has an ion-exchange process between the Na+ ions in a rhombohedral Na(2) site and the Li+ ions in the electrolyte and gives a specific capacity of 148 mA h g 1 with good rate and cycling performances for the hybrid-ion battery. The ion-transportation mechanism in the NVP-based hybrid-ion battery and cycling processes were investigated where the NVP likely transforms to NaLi2V2(PO4)3 where the ion transportation or exchange adopts the Na(2) sites to form LixNayV2(PO4)3 depending on the applied voltage range. Additionally the ion diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the NVP hybrid-ion battery was calculated by cyclic voltammetry results with a magnitude of 10 10 cm2 s 1, which is due to Li+ ions eﬀects in the NASICON cathode based hybrid-ion battery.
