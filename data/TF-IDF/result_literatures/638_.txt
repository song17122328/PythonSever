A NASICON-based mixed-potential gas sensor utilizing the perovskite-typeorthoferrite LaxSm1-xFeO3 (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8) sensing electrode (SE) wasdesigned for SO2 detection.
The research mainly put emphasis on the effect ofdifferent La3+ doping ratios in LaxSm1-xFeO3 on the sensing characteristics, and thehighest response value (-86.5mV) to 1ppm SO2 was observed for the sensor usingLa0.5Sm0.5FeO3-SE.
The response value of the fabricated sensor displayed segmentallylinear relationship with the logarithm of SO2 concentration in the ranges of 0.005-0.2ppm and 0.2-5 ppm, and the slopes were -8 and -86 mV/decade, respectively.
Otherwise, the low detection limit of the present sensor even could reach to 5ppb withan accurate response value (-8.4mV).
Meanwhile, the sensor also showed goodrepeatability, long-term stability and selectivity toward other interfering gases.
Furthermore, the electrochemical impendence curves indicated the reason that thesensor attached with La0.5Sm0.5FeO3-SE displayed the higher response values than theother sensors.
The result indicated that differences of electrocatalytic activity wascaused by diverse La3+ doping content in sensing electrode.
The sensing mechanismrelated to the mixed potential was demonstrated by the polarization curve.
In summary, the sensing material LaxSm1-xFeO3(x=0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8) wassynthesized via a facile sol-gel method, and the NASICON-based sensor usingLaxSm1-xFeO3-SE was fabricated and used for SO2 detection at 275°C.
The sensorutilizing La0.5Sm0.5FeO3-SE displayed the highest response value towards SO2 andwas confirmed to reach to the low detection limit of 5ppb.
The response value (ΔV) ofthe sensor was sectionally linearly changed with the logarithm of SO2 concentrationwithin the ranges of 0.005-0.2ppm and 0.2-5ppm, and the sensitivities were -8 and-86mV/decade, respectively.
At the same time, the fabricated sensor also showed thegood repeatability, swift response and recovery times, long-term stability and prettygood selectivity.
Hence, the fabricated sensor utilizing La0.5Sm0.5FeO3-SE wasthought to be a promising candidate to monitor SO2 at low concentrat.
