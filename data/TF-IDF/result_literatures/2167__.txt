NASICON  (Na  Superlonic  CONductor)  compounds  exhibit  remarkable  ionic  conductivities  (Hong,  1976;  Goodenough et al,  1976; Boilot et ah,  1988) as a consequence of their open structure with Na cations in the channels. There is much  current  interest  in  the  analogous  lithium  compounds LiM2(PO4)3 (M=Ti,  Zr, Hf,  Ge, or Sn) for their possible use as  solid  electrolytes  in  high  energy  density  batteries  if  their conductivity  properties  at  room  temperature  are  enhanced (Petit et al,  1986; Delmas et al,  1988; Sudreau et al,  1989; Winand  et al,  1991; Alami  et al,  1991; Aono  et al,  1993; Kuwano  et al,  1994).

Most  Li-NASICON  compounds  undergo  phase  transitions  from  a high-temperature  phase  (high-symmetry  rhombohedral R3  or R3c)  to a low-temperature  phase reported  to be  monoclinic  (space  group  Cc):  Kuwano  et al.  (1994)  for M=Ti,  Zr,  Hf;  Petit  et al.  (1986),  Sudreau  et al  (1989), Sanz et al. (1993) for M=Zr;  Aono et al. (1993) for  M=Hf; Angenault  et al.  (1992),  Martinez  et al  (1994,  1995)  for M=Sn.  The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  carry  out  a whole  crystallographic characterization  of LiM2(PO4)3 compounds with M=Hf  or  Sn,  above  and  below  their  phase  transitions.  No ICDD-card  exists  for  these  two  compounds.

The samples were prepared  by  solid  state reaction  using Li2CO3, MO2 (M=Hf  or Sn) and (NH4)2HPO4 as the starting materials. The mixtures were heated in a platinum crucible at 453 K for 6 h, then for  12 h at 673 K in order to decompose (NH4)2HPO4 and Li2CO3.  After  grinding  and pressing  into a pellet, the mixture  with  tin  was heated  for  48 h at  1173 K. The  synthesis  of  LiHf2(PO4)3  is  more  delicate  owing  to the weak reactivity  of  HfO2  and the formation  of  HfP2O7  as unreactive  product  if  the  temperature  is  increased  very  rapidly  (Losilla  et al,  1997).  Thus  a  low  heating  rate (0.5Kmin~')  was  used  and  intermediate  regrindings  were

The  rhombohedral  high-temperature  phases  are  analogous  to  the  classical  NASICON  one. The  low-temperature phases,  previously  reported  to  be  monoclinic,  are  triclinic P1.  In agreement with distoitional character of the transition phase,  the cell  parameters  are correlated  by  following  relations:  at=-ah-bh,  b, = ah,  and  c,= l/3(-ah  + bh + ch) (index  t  refers  to triclinic  cell  of LT  forms  and  index  h  to hexagonal cell of the HT forms). In the NASICON  structural family  no  other  triclinic  phase  has  been  reported  so  far. Therefore,  the  present  distortion  would  be  a  specificity  of


lithium  compounds, probably  related  to the small  size of the Li+  cation.  Hence,  other  compounds  such  as  LiM2(PO4)3 (M=Zr,  Ge)  should  be  restudied  to  determine  if  the lowtemperature  phases are also  triclinia
