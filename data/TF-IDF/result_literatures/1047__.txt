 
Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 holding  a NASICON structure is synthesized via ion exchange  from  Na3V2(PO4)2F3.  The  Na+  ions  at  Na(2)  sites  and  inserted  Li+  ions  in  this 

NASICON  structure  are  suggested  to  give  a  large  initial  specific  capacity  and  a 

hybrid-ion  migration  during  electrochemical  cycling.  As  a  lithium-inserted  cathode 

material, Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 exhibits a specific capacity of 123 mAhg-1 at a current  density of 0.1 C with two plateaus around 3.77 and 4.19 V vs. Li+/Li. The capacity of 

the  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li  battery  can  retain  104  mAhg-1  with  a  high  coulombic 

efficiency of 98.6% at 0.1 C after 151 cycles.    Keywords:  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3;  lithium-insertion  cathode;  battery;  ion-exchange;  hybrid-ion

Since  NASICON  (Na+  superionic  conductor)-related  compounds  could  exhibit  high 

Li+ or Na+ mobility as well as the reasonable discharge capacities in both lithiumand 

sodium-ion  batteries,  numerous  studies  have  been  and  continue  to  be  carried  out  to 

investigate their attractive properties as promising electrode materials in batteries[1-5]. 

The well-known NASICON skeleton is composed by corner-sharing XO4 tetrahedra 

and MO6 octahedra that create the so-called lantern units, which are assembled into a 

three-dimensional  M2X3O12  framework  that  defines  M(1)  (one  position  per  formula 

unit) and M(2) (three positions per formula unit) interstitial sites in the rhombohedral 

structure  that  are  usually  filled  (fully  or  partially)  by  alkali  ions  (Li,  Na)[6].  To  be 

specific, NASICON phosphates and fluorophosphates have driven  great  attention as 

cathode  materials  for  electrochemical  systems  in  recent  years  due  to  the  potential 

electrochemical  properties  and  the  inherent  thermal  stability  which  could  be 

associated with the phosphate-metal bonds greatly reducing the likelihood of oxygen 

liberation[7-11]. Moreover, the participation of fluorine into the NASICON phosphate 

has been demonstrated that could increase the working voltage of the fluorine-inserted 

cathode  (fluorophosphates)  in  both  sodium and  lithium-ion  batteries.  The  principal 

reason should be attributed to the inductive effect of (PO4)3polyanion and the strong 

F-M (transition metal) bonds with high ionicity which can adjust the energetics of the 

transition metal redox couple[12].   

  A NASICON phase, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with a tetragonal structure, has exhibited rich 

chemistry, attractive lithium/sodium insertion properties and thus can offer promising 

electrochemical  properties[13,  14].  The  sodium  vanadium  three-fluorophosphates, 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3, was firstly reported by Meins et al. in 1999 to have a space group of 

P42/mnm by solid state sintering in both high temperature and pressure[15]. After that, 

Barker et al. attributed Na3V2(PO4)2F3 as a potential cathode material in conventional  lithium-ion  cells  (graphite/Li+  electrolyte/Na3V2(PO4)2F3)  or  hybrid-ion  cells  as  named  commonly  now,  with  a  specific  capacity  of  126  mAhg-1  undergoing  mixed 

Li/Na  migration[13].  Moreover,  Jiang  et  al.  have  successfully  prepared 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C composites by sol-gel method with a carbon content of 8.5wt.% for 

use in a Na3V2(PO4)2F3/LiPF6/  Li cell, of  which the reversible capacity  could reach  117 mAhg-1 along with a good capacity retention and the ion diffusion coefficient was 

calculated to be a larger value of 7.2×10-10 cm2s-1 as compared[11, 16, 17]. Besides, 

with the increasing attention on the cost and lithium resources concerning lithium-ion 

battery,  sodium-ion  battery  as  a  kind  of  alternative  energy-storage  equipment  has 

achieved remarkable development in recent years and Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was also viewed 

as  an  enabling  sodium-based  cathode  material.  Kang  et  al.  have  investigated  the 

electrochemical  behaviors  of  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  by  a  combined  first  principles  and 

experimental study[5]. As reported, the phase structure could remain quite stable upon 

ion extraction and insertion of sodium from/into two kinds of sites namely Na(1) and 

Na(2) site, of which two Na(1) sites could be fully occupied while the other two Na(2) 

sites were only half occupied by Na ions because of the large electrostatic repulsions 

of  Na-Na.  Song  et  al.  also  reported  the  sodium  ion  pathway  and  detailed  cathode 

behavior in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 with reasonable properties[14].   

Even though Gover et al. have pointed out that all three Na ions could successfully 

extracted from Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (with a theoretical capacity of 192 mAh g-1) when the 

voltage  applied  to  5  V  (vs.  Li),  it’s  mostly  likely  accompanied  by  some  concurrent 

structural  degradation[18].  Under  the  same  current  density,  the  specific  capacity  of 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3  has  been  illustrated  to  be  lower  than  the  non-fluorine  phase, 

Na3V2(PO4)3 as a result of the changed ion configuration according to Song et al.[12].  While the value is capable to enlarge if the small molecular mass Li+ could substitute 

partial Na+ in the compound based on Faraday’s Law (C = 26.8n/M Ah/g, where C is 

the theoretical capacity of the active material, n is the number of electrons in reaction 

and M is the relative molecular mass). Referred to the feasibility of a topotactic ion 

exchange of Li for Na to obtain Li2NaV2(PO4)3 for use in lithium-ion battery[19, 20], 

a  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 was  prepared  from  Na3V2(PO4)2F3 and  studied  in  lithium-ion 

battery. The novel compound is expected to improve the specific capacity along with 

the cycling stability, and is of great significance to effectively perfect the employment 

of lithium ions in charge/discharge thus reducing the depletion of lithium resources.     

A solution-based carbothermal reduction (CTR) methodology was used to synthesize 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3  material  as  reported.  Firstly,  stoichiometric  amounts  of  analytical 

purity  Na2CO3,  NH4H2PO4,  NaF  and  V2O5  were  adequately  dissolved  into  distilled 

water and dried under 50 ºC by forced-air drying. Then, the acetylene black powders 

as reducer (the mass was as calculated) and conductive agent (5 wt.%) are mixed in 

the  abovementioned  precursor.  Afterwards,  the  mixed  precursor  was  ground  to  a 

uniformly  particle  distribution,  then  preheated  at  350  ºC  in  flow  argon  for  4h,  and 

reground  before  being  re-fired  at  650  ºC  in  argon  atmosphere  for  8h  to  generate 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3.  Ion  exchange  of  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  was  carried  out  in  an  aqueous  saturated  solution  containing  LiNO3  (analytical  purity)  at  ~30  oC.  The  NASICON 

phase was stirred in the nitrate solution overnight, collected by filtration and washed 

with de-ionized water, following with a process under 50 ºC by forced-air drying to 

obtain the goal product. 

The  crystallographic  structure  of  the  as  prepared  material  was  studied  by  X-ray 

powder diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 diffractometer with monochromatic Cu  Ka

 radiation (λ=1.5406 Å), and the diffraction data was recorded in the 2q

 range of 

10–70 º with a scan  rate of 5 º/min. The particle morphology of the composite was 

investigated  by  a  FEI  Quanta  200  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM).  The 

thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DSC) of the samples was carried on a Diamond TG 

thermo-analyzer.  The  inductively  coupled  plasma  atomic  emission  spectroscopy 

(ICP-AES, Optima 4300DV) was used to detect the concentration of sodium, lithium, 

vanadium and phosphorous of the prepared samples. 

The cathode electrode was fabricated with the active material, acetylene black, and 

binder (Polyvinylidene Fluoride, PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8:1:1 by using NMP as 

solvent and an aluminum foil as current collector (~ 4.5 mg/cm2), followed by drying 

in vacuum at 110 ºC for 24 h. The R2016 coin cell was assembled in an argon-filled 

glove box using lithium foil as the anode with a Celgard 2500 membrane as separator. 

The  electrolyte  was  1  M  LiPF6  dissolved  in  a  mixture  of  ethylene  carbonate  (EC), 

dimethyl  carbonate  (DMC),  diethyl  carbonate  (DEC)  (v/v/v,  1/1/1).  Cyclic 

voltammetry  (CV)  and  galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling tests  were  carried out 

in a setting voltage range by using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C) and a 

CT2001A  LAND  battery 

respectively.

The  GGA+U  approach  was  utilized  with  values  of  U=5  eV  and 

J=1eV of which U is the onsite coulomb term and J is the exchange term when the 

strongly correlated character of d orbital of vanadium ion has been considered[5].   

As listed in Table 1, the molar ratios of Li:Na:V:P of the synthesized samples which 

were obtained from quantitative elemental analysis of ICP, reveal a final composition 

of  Li0.59Na2.41V2.04(PO4)1.96F3  from  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  via  the  ion  exchange  in  LiNO3 

solution,  and  it  was  referred  to  here  as  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 by  approximation[19]. 

The compared XRD results in Fig.1 illustrate that Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 still retains the 

tetragonal  NASICON  structure  similar  with  its  precursor,  Na3V2(PO4)2F3.

The Rietveld refined XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2 and the 

lattice  parameters  for  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  and  Na3V2(PO4)2F3  are  a=b=9.047  Å,  c=10.659 Å, V=872.42 Å3 and a=b=9.05 Å, c=10.679 Å, V=874.64 Å3, respectively, 

of which these structural parameters could be indexed to a P42/mnm space group[14, 

15,  18].  Moreover,  the  changes  of  these  parameters  for  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  were 

suggested  to  be  ascribed  to  a  redistribution  of  the  alkali  ions  away  from  Na  sites 

associated with an introduction of the strong electrostatic repulsion[19, 21].   

The crystal structure of Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 projected on the ac plane is displayed 

in Fig. 3, which could be viewed as a three-dimensional (3D) NASICON framework. 

Similar  to  Na3V2(PO4)2F3,  the  crystal  structure  of  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  is  built  up 

from [V2O8F3] bi-octahedral and [PO4] tetrahedral units, among which the [V2O8F3] 

bi-octahedra  is  bridged  with  two  [VO4F2]  octahedral  united  by  one  fluorine  atom, 

whereas [VO6] octahedrons share oxygen at vertexes with [PO4] tetrahedron. Hence 

the  arrangement  has  led  to  the  formation  of  channels  along  a,  b  and  c  directions, 

fabricating  the  interlayer  ion-located  sites,  denoted  as  Na(1)  and  Na(2)  sites,  where 

two Na(1) sites are fully occupied and the other two Na(2) sites are half occupied by 

alkali  ions[5].  Moreover,  as  a  result  of  the  high  chemical  potential[5,  22]  and  low 

bond  populations[11,  14,  22]  of  Na(2)  sites,  the  Na(2)-occupied  sodium  ions  are 

potential  easily  to  be  exchanged  with  Li  ions  by  long-time  stirring,  and  a  largest 

degree  configuration  of  LiNa2V2(PO4)2F3  can  be  proposed  by  strengthened  stirring, 

In order to explore the possible location of the inserted Li+ in Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3, 

DFT  simulation  was  employed  to  construct  the  models  for  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 

transformed from Na3V2(PO4)2F3 configuration by substituting Na ions at different Na 

sites with Li ions, and the corresponding XRD  patterns after structural optimization 

derived  from  two  kinds  of  ion-exchange  results  are  shown  in  Fig.4.  Noticeably,  the 

XRD peaks and reflection Bragg positions from Fig.4b of the circumstance that the 

Na  ions  from  Na(2)  sites  were  assumed  to  be  totally  exchanged  by  Li  ions,  are  in 

better agreement with the experimental XRD patterns of Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 than the 

other  one  shown  in  Fig.4a  when  Na  ions  from  Na(1)  sites  were  presumably 

substituted by Li ions, as some characteristic peaks were absent from the patterns in 

Fig.4a.  Besides,  Li+  is  too  small  to  coordinate  at  the  triangular  prismatic  sites[19] 

denoted  as  Na(1)  sites,  which  are  surrounded  by  two  F  ions  and  for  O  ions  with  a 

larger bond population meaning more restricted conditions[23, 24] as compared with 

the    augmented  triangular  prismatic  sites  attached  to  the  F  apex-square  pyramid 

known as Na(2) sites[5, 17]. Therefore, the Na ions at Na(2) sites are much easier to 

be  exchanged  by  the  Li  ions  as  suggested  previously  [14,  17]  to  form  the 

lithium-inserted  fluorophosphates.  And  more  detailed  work  needs  to  be  utilized  to 

accurately confirm the location of the inserted Li ions in this NASICON structure.           

TG/DSC analysis (Fig.5) in air atmosphere was carried out to estimate the carbon 

content  of  the  as-prepared  material.  There  is  a  carbon  content  of  12.7  wt.%  in  the 

composite,  higher  than  that  of  its  precursor,  Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C  with  ca.  9  wt.%[11], 

due to the loss of soluble impurities or uncoated Na3V2(PO4)2F3 particles during ion 

exchange and washing. The SEM morphology of Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/C composite as 

displayed  in  Fig.6  shows  irregular  particles  and  malformed  surface  bulk  materials 

resulting from the molecular mixing and mechanically chemical activation processes 

applied  before  sintering[3,  25].  What’s  more,  the  porosity/pores  in  bulk  material 

generated  during 

the  forming  process  of  secondary  particles  and  particle 

agglomeration are likely helpful for ion diffusion[3].   

The CV curve of the first cycle for Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/C composite in a voltage  range of 2.5 to 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mVs-1 is displayed in Fig. 7. It 

could be observed that there are two couples of sharp redox peaks, of which the two 

oxidation peaks located at 3.87 and 4.25 V vs. Li+/Li and the reduction peaks at 3.73 

and 4.17 V vs. Li+/Li. As suggested before[17, 18], when a Na3V2(PO4)2F3 hybrid-ion  battery was fully charged to 4.6 V vs. Li+/Li, a cathode composition approximating to 

NaV2(PO4)2F3  can  be  produced,  a  condition  in  which  all  the  vanadium  has  been  oxidized to V4+. What’s more, the electrochemical activity of NaxV2(PO4)2F3 at 1≤x≤3  has been demonstrated to be mainly attributed to V4+/V3+ redox reaction according to 

the results of net spin moment integrated as a  function of the distance from the ion 

core [5]. Thus, the two oxidative peaks responsible for the couple V4+/V3+, signify the 

de-insertion of 0.6 lithium ion and 1.4 sodium ions from Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3, among 

which  the  weaker  limiting  conditions  and  smaller  bond  populations  of  the  ions  at 

Na(2) sites can make the ions capable to extract at an earlier charging stage[12, 14]. 

Meanwhile,  these  mainly  extracted  lithium  ions  at  3.87  V  have  produced  a  larger 

current  peak,  due  to  the  faster  diffusion  of  Li+  compared  with  Na+  in  a  battery 

system[17]  and  the  proportional  relationship  between  the  peak  current  Ip  and  the  square root of diffusion coefficient D1/2.

As  illustrated  in  the  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  profiles  in  Fig.8a,  the 

Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li  battery  could  deliver  the  initial  discharge  capacities  of  125,  123, 113, 103 and 96 mAhg-1  at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,  0.5 and 1 C rates, respectively, in  a 

voltage range of 1.6—4.6 V vs. Li+/Li. Furthermore, the profiles have presented two 

couples of charge/discharge plateaus of 3.79 vs. 3.77 and 4.22 vs. 4.19 V vs. Li+/Li, 

corresponding  well  to  the  two  couples  of  peaks  in  CV  curves.  Consequently,  an 

average discharge voltage of nearly 4 V vs. Li+/Li could be considered as the highest 

among cathode materials with the same redox coupe V4+/V3+, as compared with 3.8 V 

for  NASICON-type  Li2-xNaV2(PO4)3  [25,  27]  and  3.7  V  for  Li2NaV2(PO4)3[19].  Fig.8b shows that the specific capacity of Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 can retain 104 mAhg-1 

with  a  high  coulombic  efficiency  of  98.6%  at  0.1  C  after  151  cycles  continuously 

undergoing diverse current rates even as high as 1C. The excellent C-rate and cycling 

performances  of  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  mainly  ascribe  to  the  negligible  variation  in  lattice  parameters  (~1%)  and  cell  volume  (~2%)[5]  and  the  predominant  Li+  ions 

migration substituting Na+ ions confirmed by ICP analysis[16].   

The CV curves of the Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li battery in a voltage range of 2.5–4.6  V vs. Li+/Li at scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 mV/s are shown in Fig. 9a, 

respectively.  As  the  peak  area  divided  by  the  scan  rate  yields  the  capacity  of  the 

electrode that should be a constant, the height and area of the redox peaks increased 

with  the  increase  of  scan  rates[28].  In  addition,  the  irreversibility  of  the  redox 

reactions for Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li battery was becoming more and more manifest 

at  larger  scan  rates,  because  the  anodic  peaks  seemed  to  shift  to  higher  potentials 

while  the  corresponding  cathodic  peaks  to  lower  values  leading  to  larger  values  of 

peak  potential  difference,  440)Ep.  The  main  reason  for  that  was  the  uncompleted  ion 

extraction/insertion from/into the electrode producing an un-sufficient redox reaction 

during  the  time  interval  of  a  high-rate  scan,  which  could  cause  the  irreversible 

behaviors[28].  In  addition,  the  hysteretic  behaviors  of  heavier  Na+  ions  in  the 

electrochemical extraction/insertion reaction compared with Li+ ions also could make 

a contribution to its irreversibility.   

Theoretically, two alkali ions involving Na+ and Li+ could extract/insert from/into 

the crystallographic sites beginning within a unit, Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 in this setting  voltage range[17]. By the continuous CV tests from 0.1 to 1.2 mVs-1 as depicted in 

Fig.9a, the electrochemically formed phase LixNa3-xV2(PO4)2F3 (x≤2) would present a 

constant  concentration  of  the  alkali  ions.  Moreover,  considering  the  good  liner 

relationships  between  the  square  root  of  the  scan  rate  v1/2  and  peak  current  ip  as 

illustrated  in  Fig.9b,  the  intercalated  type  electrode  due  to  its  typical  equilibrium 

behavior  showed  a  diffusion-controlled  process  for  the  electrode  reaction.  Then, 

according  to  Randles-Sevcik  equation  (Eq.  1)  which  describes  the  relationship 

between  the  peak  current  ip  and  the  square  root  of  the  scan  rate  v1/2[25,  28],  the 

diffusion constant D could be calculated.   

where  m  is  the  mass  of  active  cathode  material,  F  the  Faraday  constant,  R  the  gas 

constant, T the absolute temperature, n the number of electrons in reaction (n = 2), A 

the  effective  contact  area  between  the  electrode  and  electrolyte  (here  the  geometric 

area of electrode, 0.79 cm2 is used for simplicity) and C is the concentration of alkali 

ion 

the  cathode  calculated  from 

the  crystallographic  cell  parameter  of 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3[17].  D  values  of  the  anodic  and  cathodic  reactions  are  calculated  as  8.42×10-11 cm2/s (A), 1.32×10-10 cm2/s (B) and 4.87×10-11 cm2/s (C), 4.47×10-11 cm2/s 

(D), respectively. Obviously, the values are much larger that those for olivine LiFePO4  measured  by  Prosini  et  al.(2.2×10-16~1.8×10-14cm2/s)  on  account  of  the  NASICON 

structure of Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 allowing ion transportation in an opening 3D way.   

Electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  was  taken  on  a  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li 

battery after 1 cycle with an open circuit voltage of 3.7 V. The corresponding Nyquist 

plots  are  given  in  Fig.  10,  in  which  the  small  intercept  at  the  Zre  axis  signifies  the 

internal resistance of the battery, and the semi-circle in the high frequency region is 

due  to  the  charge  transfer  resistance.  The  sloping  line  in  the  low  frequency  region 

corresponds  to  the  diffusion  of  alkali  ions  in  the  electrode  bulk,  namely  Warburg 

impedance.

R4  denotes  the  Warburg  resistance  originated  from  the  diffusion  of  alkali 

ions in the electrode bulk as depicted in the low frequency region of the sloping line. 

C1 demonstrate the double layer capacitance caused by ion transfer in the electrode 

material.  As  shown  in  Fig.11,  the  charge  transfer  resistance  is  found  to  increase 

greatly  when  the  experimental  cell  undertook  100th  cycles,  from  which  the  charge 

transfer resistance can be deduced to be strongly influenced by cycling[16], causing 

enlarging polarization of the electrode. Meanwhile, this enlarged resistance should be 

mainly responsible for the capacity fading in cycling and high C-rate performances. 

Besides, the slopes of the Nyquist plots at low frequency which is nearly approaching 

45º could further demonstrate a diffusion-controlled electrode reaction[17].   



A novel cathode material, Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3 was prepared via ion exchange from 

Na3V2(PO4)2F3, still holding a NASICON structure. Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/C composite 

showed  irregularly  shaped  and  bulk  secondary  particles  with  malformed  surface 

structure.  As  a  result  of  the  weaker  limiting  conditions  for  Na(2)  sites  in 


Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  or  Na3V2(PO4)2F3,  the  Na+  ions  at  Na(2)  sites  are  easy  to  be  exchanged by Li+ ions and exhibit a hybrid-ion migration. Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3, as a 

promising  lithium-insertion  cathode  material  could  give  a  specific  capacity  of  123 

mAhg-1 at a current density of 0.1 C with an average plateaus of 4 V vs. Li+/Li. The 

capacity  of  the  Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3/Li  battery  can  retain  104  mAhg-1  with  a 

coulombic efficiency of 98.6% at 0.1 C after 151 cycles. The NASICON structure of 

Li0.6Na2.4V2(PO4)2F3  provides  a  3D  way  for  ion  transportation,  producing  larger  diffusion coefficient D with a magnitude of 10-11 cm2/s.
