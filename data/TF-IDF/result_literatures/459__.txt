NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 with open framework shows great prospect in anode for aqueous lithium ion battery (ALIB). Nevertheless, low electrical conductivity and limited structure stability of NaTi2(PO4)3 in aqueous electrolyte result in poor rate and cycling performance. In this work, two strategies of carbon coating and related nitrogen doping were utilized to enhance performance of NaTi2(PO4)3 by sol-gel way, and employed as anode in ALIB. Carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3 with various carbon content were controlled by dosage of phenolic resin, and the best sample with carbon content of 4.9% was found. Based on this, loose nanostructured NaTi2(PO4)3 coated by nitrogen-doped carbon (NTP-2-N) was synthesized using urea as pore former and nitrogen source. NTP-2-N demonstrates excellent rate and cycling performance. It delivers the discharge capacity of 115.6, 103.4, and 74.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 5, and 20 C, respectively. And 80.7% of discharge capacity is retained after 1000 cycles at 5 C. The outstanding electrochemical performance of NTP-2-N mainly comes from the loose structure, carbon coating, and nitrogen doping, which protect NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal from H2O attack and accelerate the electron/Li ion transfer.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, modern industries based on fossil fuels have brought a series of serious environmental problems. Development of green energy, such as solar and tide energy, becomes a hot research topic for the sustainable development of human society [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. However, these clean energy sources are characterized by locality and instability [[8], [9], [10]]. It is difficult to be effectively utilized in large-scale power grid. Electrochemical energy storage secondary battery system is one of efficient ways to realize energy conversion and storage [11]. Among them, lithium ion battery (LIB) has advantages of long cycling life, high energy density, and high operating voltage [[12], [13], [14]]. It is acknowledged as a promising energy storage equipment. With the rapid development of portable electronic product and electric vehicle, the demand for high-energy density, long-life, and high-safety LIB has increased dramatically.

Conventional LIB uses organic electrolyte to transfer Li ions between anode and cathode. However, the flammability and low ionic conductivity resulting from the usage of organic electrolyte limit extensive applications of LIB [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. ALIB using salt aqueous solution can solve above problems, having advantages of low price, environmental friendliness, and high safety. As for ALIB, anode materials is the main hindrance for its development [19]. Generally, vanadium oxide (VO2 [20]) and vanadate (LiV3O8 [21,22], NaV3O8 [23], etc.) are selected as anode for ALIB. However, they face the fact of low rate property and poor cycle performance. Recently, LiTi2(PO4)3 and NaTi2(PO4)3 as a kind of polyanionic materials have been applied as anode, which shows great prospect in ALIB [17].

NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 like LiTi2(PO4)3 shows great prospect as anode in ALIB [24]. NaTi2(PO4)3 exhibits higher capacity, lower price, and better Li ion diffusion kinetics. Nevertheless, low conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3 and attack from aqueous electrolyte limits its electrochemical performance. Carbon coating is effectual way to enhance conductivity of electrode materials [25]. Moreover, coated carbon can hinder the direct contact of electrolyte and electrode, further avoiding corrosion for electrode from electrolyte. Nitrogen doping for carbon materials can enhance the electrical conductivity and form a large number of surface defects [[26], [27], [28]]. Surface defects can facilitate the transfer of Li ion into/out the anode materials. Moreover, the porous structure and nanoparticle can shorten migration path for Li ion, which enhances electrode properties.

Herein, we legitimately designed and synthesized a series of NaTi2(PO4)3 composites with carbon coating and nitrogen doping strategies by sol-gel method successfully. The materials synthesis process is illustrated in Fig. 1. Synthetic loose nanostructured NaTi2(PO4)3 coated by nitrogen-doped carbon layer (NTP-2-N) should exhibits the following advantages: (a) The protection of carbon layer enhances the stability in aqueous electrolyte; (b) The outside carbon layer and its doped nitrogen enhance the electrical conductivity; (c) The nano-scale size of particles and loose structure accelerate the transfer of Li ions. NTP-2-N demonstrates the excellent electrochemical properties in ALIB. NTP-2-N delivers the discharge capacity of 115.9, 103.3, and 74.5 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 5, and 20 C, separately. Capacity retention of NTP-2-N can reach 80.7%, which is larger than that of carbon coated NaTi2(PO)3 without nitrogen doping (58.7%) after 1000 cycles at 5 C.

Firstly, 1.7204 g of Ti(OC4H9)4 was added into 20 mL of C2H5OH with magnetic stirring. 0.3404 g of CH3COONa·3H2O and 2 mL of concentrated HCl were dissolved into above solution with magnetic stirring, successively. 0.8566 g of concentrated H3PO4 was added into 15 mL of C2H5OH. H3PO4/C2H5OH solution was added into mixed solution. System was sealed with plastic wrap and stirred at 55 °C for 3 h, then opened system for evaporating C2H5OH. Precursor deposited at the bottom of beaker was collected. After grinding, precursor was sintered at 750 °C for 5 h in Ar atmosphere. As-synthesized NaTi2(PO4)3 was denoted as NTP.

Carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 was synthesized on the base of NTP. Phenolic resin was added into the mixed solution before adding concentrated HCl. The amount of phenolic resin was controlled at 0.08, 0.17, and 0.26 g, respectively, and the corresponding composites were named after NTP-1, NTP-2, and NTP-3, respectively. Nitrogen-doped carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 was prepared on the base of NTP-2.0.1 g of urea was dissolved into 15 mL of C2H5OH and added into mixed solution before adding concentrated H3PO4. The as-prepared nitrogen-doped carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 was named after NTP-2-N.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted to achieve crystallographic information of composites by X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX2500PC, Rigaku). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of composites and cycled electrodes were collected by S-4800 from Japan. The electrodes after cycles were washed with deionized water after disassembly, and followed by drying at 80 °C for 8 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted on JEOL JEM-2100F TEM. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed by thermal analyzer (STA 449 F3, Germany). The wetting properties of composites were tested on graphite plate covered by NTP-2 and NTP-2-N on contact angle goniometer (JC2001, Shanghai).

Test electrodes were prepared by following step. Polytetrafluoroethylene as adhesive, acetylene black as conductive agent, and active materials were mixed together at the mass ratio of 1:1:8 with C2H5OH as solvent. The mixture was pressed on steel mesh (diameter: 14 mm) as current collector on tableting machine, and then dried at 80 °C for 10 h. Anode and cathode (mass ratio: 1:2) were used to assemble CR2016 coin-type cell consisting of LiMn2O4 cathode, NaTi2(PO4)3 anode, saturated Li2SO4 electrolyte, and glass fiber membrane.

Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted on electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua). Three-electrode system was employed for the measurement of cyclic voltammetry to investigate intercalation/deintercalation behavior of Li ion at 0.4 mV s−1. Three-electrode system consists of saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and Pt sheet as reference and counter electrodes, NTP-2 and LiMn2O4 as working electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements of cells were carried out in 0.2–1.9 V at 0.4 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted by cell in 105–10−2 Hz. Before electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement, the cell was cycled at 0.2 C for 5 cycles followed by charging at a constant voltage (1.6 V) for 2 h for electrode activation. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed in 0–1.85 V on Neware testing system (CT-3008W, Shenzhen). Rate performance was assessed at rate of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 1 C. Cycling performance of composite was assessed at 5 C for 1000 cycles.

XRD patterns of all samples are displayed in Fig. 2. As seen, main diffraction peaks are ascribed to NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 with R-3c space group (JCPDS no. 01-084-2008). All samples demonstrate the same diffraction peaks, and pure NaTi2(PO4)3 phase is obtained. XRD results indicate that pure NaTi2(PO4)3 was synthesized by sol-gel way, and carbon coating and nitrogen doping have no effect on NaTi2(PO4)3 structure.

Representative SEM images of NTP, NTP-2, and NTP-2-N are presented in Fig. 3. As observed, all samples consist of nano-size particles. NTP particles scatter well, and there are small amount of agglomeration. However, NTP-2 particles exhibit more apparent agglomeration as the introduction of coated carbon can aggravate the agglomeration of particles [12]. As for NTP-2-N, the agglomeration of NTP-2-N nanoparticles is slighter than that of NTP-2. The structure of NTP-2-N becomes looser compared with NTP-2, which is probably due to that urea serves as nitrogen source and pore former. The looser structure can provide sufficient contact area between electrolyte and active materials, which favours enhancement of electrode performance.

TEM and HR-TEM images of NTP-2-N are displayed in Fig. 4. As observed, the particle size in range of 50–100 nm is in good agreement with SEM results. Moreover, d-spacing of 3.046 and 1.874 Å corresponds to (024) and (0210) of rhombohedral NaTi2(PO4)3, further implying that as-synthesized materials is NaTi2(PO4)3. An obvious carbon layer (about 4 nm) is observed in NTP-2-N, which can construct uniform electrical conduction network around NaTi2(PO4)3 particles.

Carbon content for all samples was analyzed through TGA test, and the results are presented in Fig. 5a. As observed, a small mass loss platform is shown up to 200 °C owing to the evaporation of water. Combustion of coated carbon to occurs in range of 300–500 °C. Coated carbon content for NTP-1, NTP-2, and NTP-3 is 2.4%, 4.9%, and 7.7%, respectively. Moreover, NTP-2-N has the same carbon content compared with NTP-2, demonstrating that the adding of urea has no effect on the amount of coated carbon. The coated carbon with proper content could protect NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal and raise electrical conductivity of electrode efficiently.

In order to further understand composition of NTP-2-N and species of doped nitrogen in coated carbon, the XPS measurement of NTP-2-N was carried out, and XPS survey spectrum of NTP-2-N and high-resolution spectrum for N 1s are shown in Fig. 5b and c. XPS full spectrum of NTP-2-N consists of peaks at 56.0, 133.5, 284.7, 400.5, 460.0 and 531.1 eV, corresponding to P 2p, C 1s, N 1s, Ti 2p, and O 1s [[29], [30], [31], [32]]. As obtained from quantitative analysis, nitrogen content on surface of NTP-2-N is 1.23%. N 1s high-resolution spectrum of NTP-2-N can be deconvoluted to four individual peaks including pyridinic N (398.3 eV), pyrrolic N (399.8 eV), graphitic N (400.9 eV), and oxidic N (402.9 eV). The content of four types of N is 8.9% for pyridinic N, 35.4% for pyrrolic N, 50.9% for graphitic N, and 4.8% for oxidic N, respectively. The corresponding illustration of nitrogen doping at different sites based on N 1s fitting results of NTP-2-N is presented in Fig. 5e. The previous literature demonstrates that pyrrolic N can create electrode surface defects, profiting intercalation/deintercalation processes of Li ion [27,28]. Thence, it can be inferred that nitrogen doping improves NaTi2(PO4)3/C performance.

Raman spectroscopy was executed in order to analyze surface carbon structure. Spectra of NTP-2 and NTP-2-N are presented in Fig. 5d. Two distinct peaks are located at about 1350 and 1600 cm−1, corresponding to D and G bond, respectively [33,34]. D bond is connected with sp3 disordered carbon, and G bond corresponds to sp2 ordered graphitic carbon [35]. In general, surface defects can be assessed by intensity ratio of D to G bond (ID/IG). ID/IG value of NTP-2 and NTP-2-N are 0.97 and 1.02, respectively, revealing that there are more defects on NTP-2-N surface. The increased defects come from the nitrogen doping for carbon layer, which has been demonstrated by XPS measurement.

To study wetting performance of NTP-2 and NTP-2-N, water contact angle measurements were conducted, and results are shown in Fig. 5f. Contact angle of NTP-2-N is 46.4° with apparent decreasing of 23.0° compared with NTP-2, which proves the intensified hydrophilicity of NTP-2-N. Li ion transfer could be improved by the good wetting performance of electrode in ALIB, further enhancing electrode performance. The wetting performance improvement comes from the introduction of nitrogen atoms on carbon layer.

Fig. 6 exhibits cyclic voltammetry curves of NTP-2, LiMn2O4, and steel mesh in the proper potential range. As can be seen, NTP-2 electrode shows an obvious pair of redox peaks at −0.56/-0.91 V, and LiMn2O4 electrode demonstrates two pairs of redox peaks at 0.83/0.76 and 0.96/0.89 V. It illustrates that NTP-2 and LiMn2O4 electrodes exhibit insertion/extraction ability of Li ion. Proper potential difference results in that NaTi2(PO4)3 and LiMn2O4 can be utilized directly as anode and cathode for ALIB. In addition, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions occur on steel mesh at −1.1 and 1.1 V, respectively, showing no insertion/extraction ability of Li ion. Therefore, cyclic voltammetry measurement reveals that the electrode for ALIB can be composed of NaTi2(PO4)3 and LiMn2O4 as anode and cathode, respectively.

Discharge capacity for NTP, NTP-1, NTP-2, and NTP-3 at various rate is displayed in Fig. 7a. With increasing rate, all discharge capacity decreases owing to severe electrochemical polarization at high current. Discharge capacity for carbon coated composites is all higher than that of pristine NTP. Discharge capacity is in order of NTP-2 > NTP-3 > NTP-1 > NTP. The electrochemical performance improvement for carbon coated composites mainly comes from the protection of carbon layer, which can prevent the attack of aqueous electrode to NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal. Moreover, coated carbon can improve electrical conductivity of electrode. Among composites, NTP-2 demonstrates the best rate properties. This is attributed to that proper carbon layer leads to proper electron/Li ion transfer and efficient protection for aqueous electrolyte. Large thickness of carbon layer can lengthen the pathway for Li ions, further reducing the rate performance of NTP-3. As reported by Sun et al. [36], 4–8 nm is the proper thickness of coated carbon layer for improve electrochemical performance of the electrode. Therefore, NTP-2 can exhibit excellent electrochemical properties due to the proper thickness of about 4 nm from HR-TEM image. NTP delivers discharge capacity of 33.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and 2.8 mAh g−1 at 20 C, separately. While NTP-2 delivers discharge capacity of 111.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and 61.2 mAh g−1 at 20 C, separately, with apparent increase of 79.5 and 58.4 mAh g−1 at corresponding rate compared with NTP. Fig. 7b and c reveal the charge-discharge curves for NTP and NTP-2 at rate of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 C. As observed, both NTP and NTP-2 have a voltage plateau. NTP-2 shows wider voltage plateau than NTP, and charge-discharge curves for NTP-2 can keep more stable at high rate. Mean discharge voltage for NTP and NTP-2 is displayed in Fig. 7d. Mean discharge voltage for NTP-2 is higher than that of NTP, especially at high rate, which favours the improvement of energy density of the cell.

Fig. 8 exhibits cyclic voltammetry curves of the cells using NTP, NTP-1, NTP-2, and NTP-3 as anode. As observed, there are two obvious peaks for carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 composites, while the peak for NTP is relatively obscure. Carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 demonstrate much higher current density compared with pristine NTP. For instance, oxidation and reduction peak current for large peak for NTP is 0.14 and 0.12 A g−1, respectively. While the relevant peak current for NTP-2 can increase to 0.42 and 0.36 A g−1, respectively. In addition, the current density increases first and then decreases with increasing coated carbon content, illustrating that the electrochemical performance of materials decreases when coated carbon exceeds a certain amount. This is related to the balance between the protection for NaTi2(PO4)3 crystal and the transfer slackening of Li ions.

Rate performances of the cells using NTP-2 and NTP-2-N as anode are exhibited in Fig. 9a. Obviously, with rate increasing, discharge capacity for both cells gradually decreases. The discharge capacity for NTP-2-N shows lower drop than that of NTP-2, and the discharge capacity difference becomes larger as the rate increases. NTP-2-N delivers the discharge capacity of 115.6, 103.4, and 74.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 5, and 20 C, separately, 4.3, 9.4, and 13.4 mAh g−1 larger than those of NTP-2. Clearly, NTP-2-N delivers higher discharge capacity, implying that the introduction of urea in the synthesis process play an important role in performance improvement. This results from nitrogen doping for carbon layer and formation of loose structure.

Fig. 9b shows cyclic voltammetry curves of two cells for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N. As observed, both NTP-2 and NTP-2-N display two obvious redox peaks (1.55/1.45 and 1.70/1.60 V). Peak current density for NTP-2-N is larger than that of NTP-2, which indicates the improved electrochemical activity of NTP-2-N. Moreover, the potential interval for NTP-2-N is smaller than that for NTP-2, implying the enhanced electrochemical reversibility of NTP-2-N. Cyclic voltammetry measurement results also show that NTP-2-N exhibits better electrochemical activity and reversibility compared with NTP-2.

In order to confirm detailed effect of nitrogen doping, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests were conducted to probe interfacial performance for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N. Fig. 9c presents Nyquist plots for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N and the fitting results by the electrical equivalent circuit. As seen, Nyquist plot is composed of an intercept in high frequency corresponding to ohmic resistance (Rs) of electrode and electrolyte, a semicircle in middle frequency on behalf of charge transfer resistance (Rct), and an inclined line in low frequency reflecting Warburg impedance (Zw) for Li ion diffusion. Clearly, NTP-2-N exhibits smaller charge transfer resistance (11.9 Ω) than that of NTP-2 (20.9 Ω), indicating that nitrogen doping could obviously improve the electrochemical kinetics. Moreover, Rs for NTP-2-N is 1.6 Ω, slightly smaller than that for NTP-2 (2.2 Ω), which comes from the ohmic resistance reduction of the anode also owing to the nitrogen doping.

Cycling performance for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N was investigated at 5 C for 1000 cycles, and discharge capacity is shown in Fig. 10a. As can be known, discharge capacity for NTP-2-N can keep 80.7% after 1000 cycles, which is much larger than that of NTP-2 (58.7%). Coulombic efficiency for both composites is shown in Fig. 10b. As observed, both composites maintain high efficiency close to 100%. This indicates that the cell was assembled well, with very low self-discharge degree. Fig. 10c and d displays the charge-discharge curves for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N after different cycles. As shown, there is a voltage plateau (1.5 V) for both NTP-2 and NTP-2-N. NTP-2-N still maintains a relatively wide voltage plateau compared with NTP-2 even after 1000 cycles, indicating NTP-2-N exhibits good electrochemical stability. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results for NTP-2 and NTP-2-N after different cycles are presented in Fig. 10e and f. As can be seen, Rct for NTP-2 increases from 20.1 Ω after 100 cycles to 101.5 Ω after 1000 cycles, with the increase of 405%, while Rct for NTP-2-N increases from 13.7 Ω to 33.8 Ω, with the increase of 147%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate enhanced electrochemical stability of NTP-2-N compared with NTP-2.

Fig. 11a–c shows SEM images of NTP-2-N after different cycles at 5 C. NTP-2-N demonstrates smooth surface after cycles without obvious dissolution. It implies that NTP-2-N has high stability of morphology. XRD patterns of NTP-2-N after various cycles were displayed in Fig. 11d. As seen, XRD patterns of NTP-2-N consist of NaTi2(PO4)3 and Fe&Cr&Ni. NTP-2-N anode slices exhibit similar characteristic peaks after different cycles. The good maintaining of surface morphology and XRD characteristic peaks of NTP-2-N verify the excellent stability of NTP-2-N.

In summary, nano-structured loose NaTi2(PO4)3 coated by nitrogen-doped carbon layer as anode for ALIB was obtained by sol-gel way with urea as nitrogen source and pore former. Nitrogen doping and carbon coating have no evident effect on crystal structure for NaTi2(PO4)3 composite. Among composites, NTP-2-N demonstrates the best electrochemical properties. NTP-2-N delivers the discharge capacity of 115.6, 103.4, and 74.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2, 5, and 20 C, separately, 82.2, 95.9, and 71.8 mAh g−1 larger than those of NTP. Additionally, the capacity retention of NTP-2-N can reach 80.7% after 1000 cycles at 5 C. The superb electrochemical properties of NTP-2-N is mainly due to that usage of urea leads to porous structure and nitrogen doping, further speeding up electron and Li ion transfer.
