Energy storage materials are finding increasing applications in our daily lives, for
devices such as mobile phones and electric vehicles. Current commercial batteries use flammable
liquid electrolytes, which are unsafe, toxic, and environmentally unfriendly with low chemical
stability. Recently, solid electrolytes have been extensively studied as alternative electrolytes to
address these shortcomings. Herein, we report the early history, synthesis and characterization,
mechanical properties, and Li+ ion transport mechanisms of inorganic sulfide and oxide electrolytes.
Furthermore, we highlight the importance of the fabrication technology and experimental conditions,
such as the eects of pressure and operating parameters, on the electrochemical performance of
all-solid-state Li batteries. In particular, we emphasize promising electrolyte systems based on sulfides
and argyrodites, such as LiPS5Cl and -Li3PS4, oxide electrolytes, bare and doped Li7La3Zr2O12
garnet, NASICON-type structures, and perovskite electrolyte materials. Moreover, we discuss the
present and future challenges that all-solid-state batteries face for large-scale industrial applications.
Inorganic oxide and sulfide materials have recently been studied as solid electrolytes for
all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) owing to their high safety profile, wide temperature window, and better
mechanical properties than those of liquid electrolytes. Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) can be widely
used for solid-state Li batteries [1,2], sensors [3,4], fuel cells [1], Li-air [1,5,6], and Li-S [7] batteries.
Although solid-state electrolytes can be used for all these dierent applications, we focused mainly
on electrolytes for all-solid-state Li batteries. Recently, Reddy et al. [8] summarized the early history
of Li batteries. In brief, a Li battery consists of a cathode (positive electrode), an electrolyte (Li
ionic conductor), a separator, and an anode (negative electrode). The cathode material consists of
either LiCoO2 (LCO), Li(NixMnyCoz)O2 (NMC), LiFePO4 (LFP), or LiMn2O4 (LMO), and in some
cases intercalated binary oxides, whereas Li metal, Li-In alloys, graphite, Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), or Si,
Sn-Co-C mixed composites are used as anode materials [2]. In addition, Li batteries use liquid [9],
gel polymer [10–12], or combinations of polymer and solid electrolytes. The electrode preparation
techniques for all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) dier from those of commercial Li batteries.
Furthermore, the fabrication technologies of oxide and sulfide electrolyte-based ASSBs are different.For example, carbon is used as a conductive additive during the fabrication of sulfide electrolytes
but not for the fabrication of oxide electrolytes. Moreover, depending on the mechanical properties
of sulfide electrolytes, a suitable stack pressure is required for the assembly of ASSBs. Oxide solid
electrolytes require high-temperature (>700 °C) sintering to improve the particle-particle contact
between electrode and electrolyte. The general schematic diagram of ASSBs is presented in Figure 1.
The ideal electrolyte materials for ASSBs should feature the following important properties: (i) High
ionic conductivity of 10−3 S cm-1 at room temperature, (ii) low electronic conductivity of <10−8 S cm−1,
which prevents their self-discharge, (iii) wide electrochemical potential window, (iv) good chemical
stability over the operating temperature range and toward the electrodes, (v) transference number of
approximately 1, (vi) matching thermal expansion coefficients with the cathode materials, (vii) good
chemical stability; no crystal structure phase transformation should occur for the electrode active
materials up to/near their sintering temperatures, (viii) their sintering temperature ure should match
that of the electrode active materials, and (xv) low toxicity and cost effective [13].
Many researchers have investigated new solid electrolytes to replace flammable liquid electrolytes
or improve the performance of existing solid electrolytes and elucidate their fundamental properties
and technological developments. Huggins (1977) [14], Weppner (1981) [15], Kulkarni et al. (1984) [16],
Minami (1985) [17], Pardel and Ribes (1989) [18], Adachi et al. (1996) [19], Owens (2000) [20],
Thangadurai andWeppner (2002) [21], Knauth (2009) [22], and Fergus (2010) [23] published reviews on
solid electrolytes. The journal Solid State Ionics devoted to these materials was created in 1980. This has
been considered a hot research topic worldwide and has generated many publications. To highlight
the advances on solid electrolyte fundamentals and electrode/electrolyte interface, analysis and its
applications have been reviewed by many workers. We highlight a few important reviews in the
following section.
The large number of reviews on solid electrolytes published during the last five years was
attributed to the increasing interest in the use of solid electrolytes for electric vehicles (EVs) applications
owing to their safety. Tatsumisago et al. [24] and Sakuda et al. [25] published important reviews
on sulfide electrolytes, while Thangadurai et al. [26,27] reviewed garnet electrolytes. Furthermore,
the fundamentals of ASSBs were reviewed by several authors [28–35]. The number of reviews on
various aspects of electrolytes, cathodes, mechanical properties, and interface engineering has grown
exponentially since 2018 [36–115]. For example, Famprikis et al. [51] and Zhang et al. [116] reported on
the fundamentals of electrolytes and Oudenhoven et al. [117], Julien and Mauger [60], and Rambabu
et al. [118] reviewed the technology of solid-state microbatteries. Moreover, in situ and ex situ
techniques were explored for elucidating the solid electrode/electrolyte interfaces [40,67,80,98,119–123]
and computational methods were reviewed by Xiao et al. [94] for understanding the conduction
mechanisms in both oxide and sulfide electrolytes.
Herein, we report the brief history of each electrolyte system, summarize the recent advances
in solid electrolytes (oxides vs. sulfides) for ASSB applications, highlight the importance of the cell
fabrication technology and process parameters on the electrochemical storage performance, mechanical
properties, and interfacial mechanisms of the cells, and examine the challenges of the large-scale
fabrication of ASSBs. Furthermore, we summarize the important recent reports on electrolyte materials.
Owing to the vast literature on this topic, we were unable to include and highlight all the pertinent
publications in this review; however, some of the older publications are referenced in the most
recent reviews.
In an idealized crystalline structure, there is little space for an ion to diuse. The available space
is only limited for vibration around its equilibrium position. In real systems, the degree of disorder
that generates point defects (Schottky or Frenkel defects) results in vacant sites in the crystal and any
ion in the immediate vicinity can jump from lattice site to lattice site. Ionic conduction is provoked by
the motion of some positively (or negatively) charged ions, which “hop” under the influence of an
electric field F. This ionic conductivity is expressed by:
In practice, for a useful solid electrolyte, the electronic conductivity e is undesirable and the
transference number ti is defined as the ratio of the ionic conductivity to the total conductivity
In the one-dimensional (1D) model, the probability per unit time (P) for a vacancy to move to the
next position in the absence of electric field is given by:
where v0 is the attempt frequency, T is the absolute temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and Ea
is the potential barrier height or activation energy. Under an electric field, the barrier height is changed
The typical Arrhenius plot for an idealized ionic conductor shown in Figure 2b presents two regions.
At low temperature, the conductivity (activation energy Em) is dominated by the mobility of extrinsic
defects. The carrier (ion) concentration is fixed by doping. For example, an improved conductivity of
0.5 mS cm􀀀1 at room temperature was obtained for Li6PS5Cl doped with few mol% of LiCl. At high
temperature, the conductivity is due to thermally formed intrinsic defects. The carrier concentration varies
with temperature and the slope reflects the activation energy Ea, required for the creation of vacancies. Ea
is obtained from the slope of the semi-logarithmic Arrhenius plot (Equation 10):
In many substances, not only in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and ionic conducting glasses
(ICGs) but also in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 perovskite-type FICs [125], for example, the ionic conductivity does
not follow the Arrhenius law due to strong ion–ion interactions. The temperature dependence of the
dc conductivity can be fitted to an empirical Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman (VFT) function of the form:
where A is the pre-exponential factor, B is the activation energy, and T0 is the temperature at which the
free volume to transfer Li+ ions is zero. Usually, T0 is the same as the glass transition temperature (Tg)
in SPEs or glassy electrolytes. The “nonexponentiality” observed in electrical conductivity relaxation
has been examined using several models, such as the coupling model [126], diusion-controlled
model, [127] or the jump relaxation model [128].
Several classes of transport models for the high ionic conduction in FICs have been developed (for
a summary, see [129]). Thus, theories, i.e., discrete and continuous models of conduction, have played
a central role in the field of FICs for optimization of materials. The reader can find a detailed
description in review articles by Mahan [130], Boyce and Huberman [131], Dieterich et al. [132],
and Geisel [133]. Specific and indirect assumptions are involved in most of the models such as
microstructure, distribution, and local environment of ions.
Continuous models are concerned with the motion of ions as Brownian particles in periodic
potential. This approach allows the complete description of the dynamics of superionic conductors
and explains the local motion in vacant sites of the host lattice (i.e., the local motion includes
relaxation and oscillating processes).
Discrete models are hopping or random-walk models, which have long been used to study
diusion processes. There are rather simple, and a complete discussion of their dynamical
properties is possible. The situation is the following: The lattice defines a periodic array of sites
where the mobile ions can sit. An ion placed at one site is licked out of it after a certain time and
hops away. Discrete models are applied to ionic conductors where the diffusing ions are well
localized about given lattice sites over most of the time.
A common feature of these models is the fact that only the sub-system of diffusing ions is treated
explicitly. This simplification can be justified by the fact that usually the characteristic rate 􀀀1 for
particle jump is much smaller than a typical lattice vibrational frequency with  >>1 [132].
Transport models proposed to explain the high ionic conductivity include the weak electrolyte
model [134], the random site model [135], the dynamic structure model [136], the diffusion pathway
model [137], the modified random network (MRN) model [138], the dynamic cluster model [139],
the cluster-bypass model [140], jump relaxation model [141], lattice-gas model [132], and liquid-like
model [132]. These models are briefly presented as follows.
The weak electrolyte model proposed by Ravaine [134] is applied for the ionic transport in
materials with lack of long-range order (glasses). Conversely, i is assumed to be independent
of ion concentration, and only weakly temperature dependent, whereas ni depends strongly on both
concentration and temperature.
The random site model considers the existence of a wide continuous distribution of alkali ion sites
of  free energies. A clear distribution between mobile and immobile species cannot be made;
thus, in this case, the summation of conductivities (Equation (1)) must be performed over the entire
distribution of ions [135].
In the dynamic structure model reported by Maas et al. [136], the ion transport in glass is presented
by postulating the existence of a site memory effect to visualize the formation of conducting pathways.
This quantitative theory explains the general occurrence of the mixed cation (alkali) eect in glassy
material and, in addition, shows that the anomalous dependence of conductivity on the modifier
content in single alkali glasses follows a simple power-law relation.
In the diﬀusion pathway model, the spatial dependence of the conductivity is understood by the possible ion transport in the grains and at the grain boundaries, including intergranular pathways within and between grains. Polycrystalline model can quantify the impact of grain boundaries on conductivity as a function of grain size. Such insights provide valuable fundamental understanding of the role of grain boundaries. The lowest energy of grain boundaries the higher electrochemical performance.
The modified random network (MRN) model is appropriate to describe the ionic transport in glasses [138], which comprise two interlacing sublattices: Domains constructed from network former and inter-network regions made up of modifier. For example, in oxide glasses, the strong correlations associated with the network forming units masked the weak correlations between modifying cations and the oxygen sublattice.
The dynamic cluster model [139] is based on the idea that ion-hopping processes are directly coupled to localized structural relaxations occurring in glass even below Tg, while the cluster-bypass model [140] states that ion diﬀusion occurs within microregions or clusters of material resembling to crystal. In the jump relaxation model described by Funke [141], two competing relaxation processes are considered after each initial forward hop of a charged defect: The backward hop of the defect and the forward motion of the surrounding “defect cloud”. The model yields the power-law of the frequency dependent conductivity.
In the lattice gas model, the role of ion interactions with respect to static properties is most easily investigated by considering the system of conducting ions as a lattice gas. Such a model is characterized by a Hamiltonian, which gives the energy of the various possible configurations. Each configuration is specified by a set of occupation numbers referring to the diﬀerent lattice sites [132].
The liquid-like model is applicable to the best ionic conductors characterized by very low potential barriers WB ≈ kBT, where T ≈ 103 K [132]. Therefore, the probability of finding an ion between preferred lattice sites becomes non-negligible and a discrete lattice gas model is no longer adequate. The mutual repulsion of ions leads to an eﬀective single particle barrier, which diﬀers from the bare potential WB. Such eﬀect is important with respect to transport properties and its discussion requires a continuous many-particle model. The statics of continuous systems to be described is that of a liquid embedded in a periodic medium, for which the total energy is the sum of the periodic single particle potential determined by the forces acting between mobile ions and the cage ions and the pair potential, wich consists of a short-range repulsive part, the Coulomb part, and a phonon mediated part.
The bond-valence method has been used to model both absolute ionic conductivity and activation energy from the “pathway volume” approach. This pathway volume–conductivity relation was found to hold for glassy and crystalline FICs with silver ion conductivities [142] and La2/3−xLi3xTiO3 [143]. Due to the disordered Li sublattice, the Li+ ionic conduction in garnet-type electrolytes is facilitated by a cooperative-type migration instead of a single hopping process with a very small time-scale for fluctuations at intermediate positions [144]. This mechanism was investigated by ab-initio and classical molecular dynamics (MD) studies [145,146]. In the jump diﬀusion model, the dynamics of the hopping motion of the mobile ions was investigated by Bruesch et al. [147] considering the Brownian motion in a periodic lattice that included the eﬀect of polarizability of the lattice and correlated jumps of ions relevant to superionic conductors. In a modified model, Funke [148] has taken into account the repulsive interaction between mobile ions resulting in a “cage eﬀect”. Because of the cage eﬀect, the ions tend to stay at some distance from each other.
Ionic conductivity of the solid-state electrolytes is generally measured by the ac complex impedance method (i.e., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)). All samples are analyzed within wide range of temperature with a small bias amplitude of 5–10 mV in the frequency range of 106 Hz ~10−2 Hz (pulsation ω). Data are analyzed from the Nyquist plot (−Z” vs. Z), the imaginary part −Z”(ω)(capacitive) of the impedance against the real part Z(ω) (resistive) [149,150]. The conductivity σi (in Scm−1) is calculated using the equation:
where d denotes the electrolyte thickness (in cm), S is the cross-sectional area of the electrode (in cm2), and Rb is the bulk electrolyte resistance (in Ω).
For an idealized FIC, the bulk resistance is the quantity obtained from the diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plot as shown in Figure 3a. The vertical line in the low-frequency region reflects the capacity formed by the dielectric FIC sandwiched between two metallic electrodes. The equivalent circuit model (inset) consists of the parallel combination of the bulk resistance Rb and the geometry capacity Cb of the FIC (parallel plate capacitor) expressed by:
where Zb and Z”b are the real and imaginary part of the bulk impedance. The −Im(Zb) vs. Re(Zb) plot exhibits a standard semicircle centered at Rb/2. The real and imaginary parts of the impedance are given by Equations (18) and (19):
The experimental Nyquist plot of a FIC sample placed between two stainless-steel electrodes is shown in Figure 3b. This diagram deviates from the ideal impedance spectrum as the capacitor in EIS experiments often does not behave ideally. The impedance spectrum consists of a depressed semicircle, which can be visualized by the equivalent circuit including the parallel association of the bulk resistance Rb with the capacitance Cb and a constant phase elements (CPE1), which represents the geometry capacity and the eﬀects of dipolar relaxation (i.e., system with a distribution of time
Figure 4a,b show the frequency dependence of the real Z0(!) and imaginary 􀀀Z”(!) part of the
impedance, respectively, of a FIC sample measured at three temperatures. At ! > 103 Hz, the plots of
Figure 4a show a decrease of Z0 vs. frequency, so that (!) increases with frequency (see Figure 4c). At
low frequency (f  1 kHz), (!) increases importantly with temperature. At high frequencies, however,
Z0(!) becomes almost temperature independent so that the Z0(!) curves at dierent temperatures
merge approximately in a single curve. This is due to the release of space charges caused by reduction
in barrier properties of the material [151,152]. This unique curve at high frequency shows a dip,
which is associated with charge carrier hopping in the material. On the other hand, Z” = 􀀀Im(Z(!))
reaches a maximum, which shifts towards higher frequency with temperature. This is attributed to the
active conduction through the grain boundaries of the sample. The peak broadening observed with
increasing temperature is attributed to a temperature-dependent relaxation process in the material.
The asymmetric broadening of the peaks indicates the spread of relaxation time in the sample.
The frequency fm, at which goes through a maximum, corresponds to the single
relaxation time, which fulfills the relation For a thermally activated relaxation process,
the variation of  with T obeys an Arrhenius law given by [153,154]:
(ii) In 2011, Rao and Adams [181] and Rao et al. [182] synthesized Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) and performed neutron diﬀraction, conductivity, and bond valence computational studies on them. They reported the presence of a three-dimensional (3D) pathway network for the long-range ion conduction of all Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) phases, which consisted of interconnected low-energy local pathway cages [180]. The experimentally measured ionic conductivity at 25 ◦C of Li6PS5Cl, Li6PS5Br, and Li6PS5I prepared by ball milling followed by heating at 550 ◦C in inert atmosphere are in the range 1.9 × 10−4–7.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 and calculated activation energies in the range 0.26–0.41 eV (Table 1) [180–186]. Further, Boulineau et al. [183] reported the eﬀect of enhancement of the conductivity of Li6PS5Cl from 2× 10−4 S cm−1 to 1.33 × 10−3 S cm−1 when the ball milling time varies from 1 h to 10 h. Rao and Adams [181] compared the values of Ea determined by both experimental and computational method for Li6PS5X with X= Cl, Br, I in the range 0.25–0.38 eV. Camacho-Forero and Balbuena [184] performed ab initio calculations and determined that conductivity, activation energy, and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of Li+ ions at 27 ◦C were 0.17 × 10−3 S cm−1, 0.37 eV, and 1.2 × 10−9 cm2s−1 for Li6PS5Cl and 6.07 × 10−3 S cm−1, 0.27 eV, and 5.8 × 10−9 cm2s−1 for Li6PS5I, respectively. The reported diﬀusion coeﬃcient value of Li6PS5Cl was reported to be two orders of magnitude lower than that determined using 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (7.7 × 10−8 cm2s−1 at 40 ◦C) [179]. According to Camacho-Forero and Balbuena [184], the ionic conductivity of Li6PS5I was significantly lower than those of Li6PS5Cl and Li6PS5Br.
(iii) Argyrodite electrolytes can be synthesized using diﬀerent methods [169,178–208], such as the conventional sealed tube solid-state reaction [169], ball milling [181,183,187], and solution-based methods [189,208].
(iv) The conductivities of argyrodite electrolytes depend on the preparation method, grain boundary contributions, and conductivity measurement method and fabrication technique of pelletized samples, including sintering cold-pressed pellets that influences the density of the specimens [183]. Based on previous literature studies, conductivity values are also influenced by cooling rate [186], porosity, and pore distribution [190]. Lower Li+ ion conductivities, in the range of 10−5–10−4 mS cm−1, were reported when the electrolytes were synthesized via the solution-based method, which were attributed to the presence of additional impurity phases in the compounds [189].
(v) Deiseroth et al. [185], Yu et al. [191–193], Hanghofer [179], Ganapathy et al. [194], Epp et al. [197], and Adeli et al. [198] used the solid-state NMR method to characterize the structure and dynamics. Results of the chemical shifts from 31P and 6Li MAS NMR spectra [179] are 85 and 1.6 ppm for X = Cl, 93.9 and 1.49 ppm for X = I, and 96.3 and 1.3 ppm for X = Br nanostructured samples synthesized by the solid-state and ball milling methods. The conductivity, Ea, and Li-jump rate values obtained from NMR measurements were 10−3–10−2 S cm−1, 0.2 eV, and 109 s−1, respectively, for Li6PS5Br and Li6PS5I [197].
(vi) The reported electrochemical stability potential window of Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) was determined to be 0–7 V vs. Li+/Li [20,176,177].
(vii) Kong et al. [199] determined that the substitution of S with O in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br) led to the decrease in room-temperature conductivity by several order of magnitudes, to ~10−9 S cm−1; moreover, the Ea of the O-containing compound was 0.66 eV. The observed low conduction mechanism was further confirmed by Rao and Adams [181] using bond valence studies.
(viii) Kasemchainan et al. [200] and Doux et al. [201] reported the critical current density limits for Li plating on Li6PS5Cl and studied the stack pressure limits of Li6PS5Cl, respectively.
ix) Yokokawa [202] examined the thermodynamic stability of the sulfide electrolyte/oxide interface of ASSBs; they proposed a potential diagram approach, in which the phase relationships at the interfaces could be investigated by comparing the proper chemical potentials associated with the target devices. Understanding the aforementioned parameters is crucial for both fundamental and industrial applications.
(x) In 2019, Rao et al. [188] reported the new Li15(PS4)4Cl3 and Li14.8Mg0.1(PS4)4Cl3 phases with the I-43d space group and lattice parameters a of 14.308 and 14.323 Å, respectively, which were isostructural with the Ag15(PS4)4Cl3 phases; in addition, they reported that Mg2+ doping led to the increase in ionic conductivity from 4 × 10−8 S cm−1 for Li15(PS4)4Cl3 to 2 × 10−7 S cm−1 for Li14.8Mg0.1(PS4)4Cl3.
Many reports have been published on Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) sulfide electrolytes for ASSBs. Herein, we highlight one of the recently published reports. Kasemchainan et al. [200] studied the eﬀect of the current density (0.1–4.0 mA cm−2) and pressure (3 and 7 MPa) on Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li. Recently, Doux et al. [201] studied the eﬀect of the stack pressure on the cycling of the Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li cell and performed cycling studies on a mixture of 2 wt.% LiNbO3 (LNO)-coated LiNi0.80Co0.15Al0.05O2, Li6PS5Cl, and carbon black with a weight ratio of 11:16:1 that was obtained using an agate mortar and pestle. For this study, 12 mg of composite electrode was pressed on one side of the electrolyte pellet at a pressure of 370 MPa and Li-In powder or a Li metal disc were subsequently pressed at 120 or 25 MPa, respectively, on the other side of the electrolyte pellet. The eﬀects of diﬀerent stack pressures in the range of 5–25 MPa on the fabricated Li symmetric cells during plating and stripping were reported (Figure 7) [201]. The possible reasons for the good cycling are presented in the schematic diagram in Figure 7(1). It was observed that at the stack pressure of 5 MPa, no short-circuit occurred for up to 1000 h; moreover, the capacity retention of the cell was 81% after 100 cycles (Figure 7(2)). In addition, it was noted that as the pressure increased from 1 to 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 MPa, the impedance decreased from >500 Ω, to 110, 50, 40, 35, and 32 Ω, respectively. In conclusion, at low stack pressure (5 MPa), Li plating occurred on the surface of the pellet because the pressure was not suﬃcient to allow Li to pass into the pores of the electrolyte. Conversely, a pressure of 25 MPa led to the surface modification of the electrolyte pellet, in which Li+ ions passed into the pores of the electrolyte along the interface. At the high stack pressure of 75 MPa the cell underwent mechanical shorting before plating and stripping.
Moreover, Koerver et al. [203] and Kim et al. [204] applied high pressure in the range of 50–70 MPa on β-LPS, which led to distinct diﬀerences in the stack pressures, which aﬀected the mechanical properties of the electrolyte. Furthermore, the structure and morphology of β-LPS were studied using XRD and X-ray tomography on 2 mm diameter with an experimental resolution of 1 µm over the entire volume. The tomography images and XRD patterns before and after the 25 MPa plating and stripping are illustrated in Figure 8(1) [201]. The tomography images after plating and stripping at 25 MPa (Figure 8(2)) illustrate large low-density structures within the electrolyte.
Furthermore, the images revealed that Li dendrites formed and propagated between the electrolyte grains along grain boundaries. Moreover, the XRD patterns revealed the presence of LiCl, Li2S, and other P4 and Li3P7 phosphorous phases in the Li6PS5Cl structure [201]. Zhang et al. [205] reported the inter- and intracycle interfacial evolution of a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC)|Li6PS5Cl|Li cell using impedance measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies.
Furthermore, Zhou et al. [206] studied the Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) and Li6−yPS5−yCl1+y argyrodites, while Feng et al. [207] investigated Li6−xPS5−xCl1+x. Recently, Arnold et al. [208] reported an improved conductivity of 0.53 × 10−3 S cm−1 at RT for Li6PS5Cl doped with LiCl and they showed the enhanced electrochemical properties with cells assembled with Li||LTO (Li4Ti5O12) using bare and doped electrolyte. Although Li6PS5Cl presented good ionic conductivity, further studies on large-scale packs and the improvement in the air stability and surface protection of argyrodites are required to facilitate their large-scale applications. Transport properties of sulphide solid electrolytes, i.e., room temperature ionic conductivity sRT and activation energy Ea are summarized in Table 1.
More studies on the synthesis, crystal structure, stability, and fabrication of ASSBs based on these electrolyte systems have been performed since. LPS presents three polymorphs, viz. α-, β- and γ-LPS, of which the γ and β phases presents the lowest (3 × 10−7 S cm−1) and highest (~10−4 S cm−1) conductivities, respectively. Herein, we highlight the most important observations on the β-LPS electrolyte reported in the literature as follows.
(i) Eckert et al. [213], Tatsumisago et al. [214], Minuzo et al. [215], Hayashi et al. [216,217], and Murayama et al. [218] reported the synthesis of LPS using mechanical and solid-state methods, and that of glass–ceramic LPS using ball milling. The room-temperature conductivity of LPS was reported to be 3.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (see Table 1) [229,301,302]. Subsequently, many research groups explored the composition of LPS, to elucidate the crystal structure, ionic conductivity, and fabrication of LPS-based ASSBs. Garcia-Mendez et al. [219] reported the eﬀect of molding pressure on mechanical and ionic conductivity values of LPS electrolyte, and recently, Ohno et al. [220] summarized various other factors which influence the electrical properties of sulfate electrolytes.
(ii) Homma et al. [221] studied the crystal structure and phase transitions of LPS. High-temperature synchrotron XRD and thermal studies were used to determine that LPS exhibited three phase transitions at diﬀerent temperatures. The γ, β, and α phases were present at low, medium (300−450 ◦C), and high (473 ◦C) temperature. Among all phases, the β-phase has been the most studied owing to its high ionic conductivity. Zhou et al. [222] reported that Li3.25[Si0.25P0.75]S4 is an entropically stabilized fast-ion conductor. The β-LPS phase presents orthorhombic structure with the space group Pnma, and its lattice parameters have been reported to be a = 13.066(3) Å, b = 8.015(2) Å, and c = 6.101(2) Å (Figure 9a–d) [222].
(iii) Haruyama et al. [223] analyzed the LiCoO2/β-Li3PS4 (LCO/β-LPS) and LCO/LNO/LPS (where LNO was the buﬀer layer) oxide/electrolyte interfaces using computational methods, i.e., density functional theory (DFT) and U framework studies, and determined that surface protection was essential for long-term electrochemical cycling. Their research was followed by many experimental studies on surface-coated NMC cathodes such as LNO, LPO, and Li2O–ZrO2, which were aimed at reducing the cathode/electrolyte interfacial reactions during electrochemical cycling. Few other computational studies, such as that of Richards et al. [224], who predicted the formation of the Li3P and Li2S phases at on LPS/Li interface and the formation of Co(PO3)2, CoS2, and S, at the LiCoO2/Li interface during electrochemical cycling, have been published.
Tsukasaki et al. [209,225,226] and Atarashi et al. [211] reported the synthesis, solid-state battery fabrication, electrochemical cycling, and thermal stability study of bare and coated LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) and LPS electrolytes, and indicated that their reversible capacity after 50 cycles was approximately 80 mAh g−1. Ex situ XRD [211] and in situ synchrotron XRD [227] measurements were performed to analyze the thermal stability of LNO-coated–NMC–LPS composites. When heated above 300 ◦C, the NMC cathode decomposed into transition metal sulfides, such as CoNi2S4 and MnS, and led to the formation of O2 gas; conversely, LPS transformed to crystalline LPO owing to the oxidation reaction between the electrolyte and generated O2 [226]. From the aforementioned thermal studies, we concluded that the exchange reaction between S and O in LPS can be avoided by P (Li3PS4), Sn (Li4SnS4) [227], or Sb (Li3SbS4) [228], which gives strong bond strength with S and could decrease the reactivity with O2 and H2O in air. The slow reactions between Sb and Sn and Li metal to form Li4.4Sn or Li3Sb, which occur during electrochemical cycling, are possible drawbacks of these materials. Furthermore, although these electrolytes are stable in air, the Li–Sn–S electrolyte presents low conductivity of 1.5 × 10−6 S cm−1 at room temperature, which hindered the use of Sn and Sb electrolytes for SSB applications.
Dietrich et al. [229] analyzed the crystal structure of LPS electrolytes using synchrotron XRD, Raman spectroscopy, NMR, and conductivity studies and Koerver et al. [203] investigated the fabrication of the Li-In|b-LPS|NMC811|b-LPS ASSB (Figure 10a–e). They highlighted the importance of the interfacial reactivity, cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, and electro-chemo-mechanical processes of the SSB active materials. 
In 2011, Kamaya et al. [266] synthesized the Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) solid electrolyte and reported a conductivity of 9 × 10-3 S cm−1 (Table 1) and electrochemical properties of a LiCoO2-LGPS|LGPS|In cell. Moreover, other researchers have extensively analyzed this system [267–277]. LGPS presented tetragonal crystal structure with the lattice parameters a = 8.708 Å and c = 12.605 Å and consisted of negatively charged PS43− and GeS44− tetrahedra surrounded by (mobile) Li+ ions for charge compensation as shown in Figure 17a, and X-ray powder diﬀraction patterns and Rietveld refinements of Li11Si2PS12 and Li10SnP2S12 are compared with those previously reported for Li10GeP2S12 and Li7GePS8 in Figure 17b [270]. The tetrahedrally coordinated Li1 and Li3 sites generated channels for the facile Li+ ion diﬀusion along the c-axis and the octahedrally coordinated Li2 positions between those channels were assumed to be inactive for diﬀusion [268].
Li et al. [278] fabricated ASSBs and performed interfacial studies on LiNi0.85−xCo0.15AlxO2 (x = 0.05, 0.15, 0.25) and Li10GeP2S12 using in situ and ex situ Raman and impedance spectroscopy. They noted that the capacity and capacity retention of the Al-doped sample (x = 0.15) were higher than those of the undoped sample; moreover, less reactions occurred at the electrode/electrolyte interface of the Al-doped sample than at the interface of the undoped one. Mei et al. [279] measured the ionic conductivity measurements of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)18–LiClO4–x wt.% LGPS. Deng et al. [280] fabricated hierarchical LPO-coated NMC 811 (HLPO@NMC811) using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. A battery was fabricated using a 10 mm diameter commercial LGPS disk subjected to 2 ton (~250 MPa) of pressure as the electrolyte. Then, a mixture of LPO-coated NMC811 and LGPS powders (70:30 w/w) was subjected to 3 ton (~380 MPa) of pressure. In addition, the In/Li foil used as the anode was placed on the opposite side of the LGPS pellets and the ensemble was subjected to 0.5 ton (~65 MPa) of pressure. Stainless-steel rods were used as the current collectors. No additional pressure was applied during the electrochemical cycling of the battery. The battery delivered a specific capacity of 170 mAh g−1 at a current rate of 0.1C, a capacity retention of 77.9%, and retained a capacity of 96 mAh g−1 after 300 cycles (Figure 18(1),(2)), when the LPO-coated NMC cathode was optimized; the charge–discharge experiments were performed in the potential range of 2.7–4.5 V vs. Li+/Li at room temperature. The reported improvement in cycling stability was further confirmed using XPS and X-ray absorption near edge structure studies, which demonstrated that the formation of SOx was suppressed for the LPO-coated NMC811 sample; however, more side reactions that generated SOx were noted for the bare NMC/LGPS electrodes. Zhang et al. [281] studied the chemical stability of LGPS and improved the Li interface by coating Li with a protective LiH2PO4 layer. The ASSB fabricated using LNO-coated LCO presented the reversible capacities of 131 and 114 mAh g−1 for the 1st and 500th cycles, respectively, at a current rate of 0.1C; moreover, the capacity retention of the ASSB was 86.7%. Zheng et al. [282] and Philip et al. [283] studied LGPS/PEO composites and Paulus et al. [284] conducted NMR experiments that demonstrated the relaxation coupling of the 7Li (I = 3/2) longitudinal magnetization order in the LGPS electrolyte. Electrochemical performance of sulfide-based electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries are listed in Table 2.
Zhang et al. [285] prepared LGPS via planetary ball milling followed by heating. In addition, Kim et al. [286] conducted studies on ionic liquids and LGPS composites. Few attempts were made to improve the structural stability of the LGPS lattice via Ba, Al, or Si doping. Sun et al. [287] reported that the ionic conductivity of Ba-doped LGPS (Li9.4Ba0.3GeP2S12) was 7.04 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C. Moreover, they ascribed the improvement in the structural stability of the LGPS lattice to the strong Coulombic interactions between the Ba2+ and Li+ ions. Although LGPS presented reasonably good conductivity, the high cost of Ge and reaction with Li to form LixGe alloys limit the use of LGPS for large-scale applications for SSBs.
Further eﬀorts have been devoted to the search for new inexpensive electrolytes with good electrochemical stability. Whiteley et al. [288] used Li2S–SiS2–P2S5 to prepare the Li10SiP2S12 (LSiPS) electrolyte via cold pressing. The obtained electrolyte was isostructural with LGPS and delivered a room-temperature conductivity of 2.3 × 10−3 S cm−1, and this value was close to those reported by Bron et al. [292] (Table 1). Moreover, LSiPS presented good stability when paired with Li metal and good cycling voltage window when paired with a cathode material. The conductivity of LSiPS could be further improved via hot pressing, and therefore, this could be a promising ASSB electrolyte. Fitzhugh et al. [289] performed computational studies on Li10SiP2S12 paired with a coated cathode. Kim and Martin [290] analyzed the eﬀect of O-doping on the crystal structure of
Li10SiP2S12−xOx (LSiPSO) (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.75) using XRD, Raman, Fourier transform infrared, and solid-state NMR spectroscopies, and ionic conductivity measurements. They noted that at low oxygen doping
levels (x = 0.7 and 0.9), the structure of the LSiPSO phases (Li10.35P1.65Si1.35S12 with lattice parameters a = 8.66 Å and c = 12.52 Å) became more homogeneous with minor amounts of β-LPS impurity, while, at high oxygen doping levels, the structure of the LSiPSO samples resembled to that of LGPS. For x = 0, the compound is a mixture of LSiPSO and β-LPS impurity phase. Conductivity measurements revealed that the Li ionic conductivity increased with the decrease in the amount of β-LPS phase, and the highest Li ionic conductivity of 3.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C was achieved for x = 0.7 and 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 for x = 0. The ionic conductivity decreased when x ≥ 0.9 owing to the degradation of the crystalline LGPS-like phase and generation of the O-rich LPO phase. Harm et al. [291] reported a new Li7SiPS8 electrolyte, which is isostructural with the LGPS electrolyte and presented a tetragonal structure with the P42/nmc (no. 137) space group and the lattice parameters a = 8.690(5)  and c = 12.570(3) Å. The room-temperature conductivity of this electrolyte was up to 2 mS cm Bron et al. [292,293] determined the conductivities of Li10Si0.3Sn0.7P2S12 and other two superionic conductors, viz. Li10SnP2S12 and Li10GeP2S12 (Figure 19a–c).
Li10Si0.3Sn0.7P2S12 and Li10SnP2S12 presented low grain boundary resistance; moreover, the conductivity of Li10Si0.3Sn0.7P2S12 was 8 mS cm−1 at 25 ◦C with Ea of 0.29 eV, which was similar to that of LGPS (Table 1). They complemented the mechanisms using time-resolved impedance studies [293] of solid electrolytes sandwiched between Li foils using two airtight electrode cells. The overall cost of using this electrolyte for large-scale applications was lower than that of using the LGPS electrolyte. Nam et al. [294] performed first-principles density functional theory calculations and ab initio MD simulations on Li10−xSnP2S12−xClx. Sun et al. [295] further studied Li10+δ[SnySi1–y]1+δP2−δS12 solid solutions that were prepared using the solid-state method. Among all analyzed samples, Li10.35[Sn0.27Si1.08]P1.65S12 presented the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10−2 S cm−1, and this value was similar to the previously reported ionic conductivity of LGPS.
In 2016, Katto et al. [296] investigated Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3, a new Li superionic conductor. The excellent conductivity of this material of 2.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 (Table 1) was twice as high as that of the LGPS electrolyte (Figure 20a–c). This excellent ionic conductivity could be ascribed to the 3D conduction pathway for Li+ ions. Later, Bai et al. [297] synthesized Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7X0.3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and eported that the conductivity of Li .54Si1.74P1.44S11.7I0.3 was high as 1.35 mS cm−1. Choi et al. [298]
reported studies on electronic structures of Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7I0.3 by atomic simulation.
In 2012, Ooura et al. [301] prepared the (100−x)Li3PS4·xLiAlS2 (mol%) amorphous glassy electrolyte system via high-energy ball milling. When x = 0–13.1, the obtained samples were amorphous and when x ≥ 18.2, a crystalline Al2S3 phase formed. Among all samples, the one with x = 13.1 presented the best conductivity of 6.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 20 ◦C; in addition, the Ea of the sample was 39 kJ mol−1. The Li4.4Si|a-86.9Li3PS4·13.1LiAlS2|LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 ASSB was fabricated and the NMC cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 100 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 in the potential range of 2.0–4.0 V. The capacity faded during cycling owing to interfacial reactions. At the end of the 35th cycle, the specific capacity was 185 mAh g−1 when TiS2 was used as the cathode at the current rate of 64 µA cm−2 in the potential range of 1.0–2.5 V. Zhou et al. [300] synthesized the Li11AlP2S12 electrolyte, which presented a thio-LISICON analogous structure. The conductivity of this electrolyte was 8.02 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C and its Ea was 25.4 kJ mol−1 (0.254 eV) showing an excellent electrochemical stability up to 5 V against Li metal.
Oxide electrolyte materials present large energy gaps between their valence and conduction bands, which confer them high stability at high voltages; furthermore, the ionic mobility of oxide electrolytes is higher than that of glass or polymer electrolytes [29,305–530]. Table 3 summarized the structural and electrical properties of various oxide solid electrolytes. Oxide electrolytes are relatively stable in air and easier to handle than sulfide electrolytes. In 1976, Goodenough et al. [305] conducted Na+
ion transport studies on Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12, which presented a conductivity of ≤ 5 S cm−1 at 300 ◦C for x ≈ 2; the observed conductivity value was comparable to that of β-alumina [306], which was one of the best solid electrolytes at the time. Furthermore, it was mentioned that the exchange of Na+ ions with Li+, Ag+, and K+ ions was possible. This early concept led to the further development, applications, and search for new Li-analogues, and the promising NASICON-type structure series of materials were explored owing to their structural framework and high Li+ ion conductivities at room and elevated temperatures.
In 1966, Otto [307], following from the work. in 1978 by Levasseur et al. [308,309], conducted more studies on borate-type amorphous oxide-based glassy electrolytes, and their conductivities were >10−4 and 10−6 S cm−1 at 350 and 25 ◦C, respectively. In 1973, West [310] prepared Ge-, Ti-, and Zn-doped Li4SiO4 electrolytes and reported conductivities in the range of 10−3–10−4 S cm−1 at 300 ◦C. In 1977, Shanon et al. [311] described a series of electrolyte systems, viz. Li2+xC1−xBxO3, Li3−xB1−xCxO3, Li4+xSi1−xSi1−xAlxO4, Li4−xSi1−xPxO4, Li4−2xSi1−xSxO4, and Li5−xAl1−xSixO4. Li0.8Zr1.8Ta0.2P3O12. Subsequently, many researchers attempted on the electrolytes as additives or electrolytes.
Diﬀerent types of oxide electrolyte systems based on NASICON-, perovskite-, and garnet-type crystalline materials have been reported in the literature [312–497]. Among all compositions, the garnet-based Ta-, Ga-, Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) oxides have been well studied for ASSBs owing to their good conductivities. Note that most of the ceramic solid electrolytes (LLZO, LATP) are polycrystalline and demonstrate grain/grain-boundary microstructure (see Section 2).
Garnet-based Li+ ion conductors are attractive candidates for ASSBs owing to their high chemical stability when paired with Li metal, and good ionic conductivity. Several seminal articles on the synthesis of Li-stuﬀed garnets [312], Li5La3M2O12 (M = Nb, Ta) [313], Li6ALa3Ta2O12 (A = Sr, Ba) [314], and Li7La3Zr2O12 named as Li5, Li6, and Li7 phases, respectively, have been published between 2003 and 2007. Among all, LLZO presented good room-temperature ionic conductivity in the range of 10−3–10−4 S cm−1. This led to the further search for and optimization of fast ion conducting ASSB oxide electrolytes. Hundreds of papers have been published on the synthesis, doping, and ionic conductivity of ASSB electrolytes, and only a few on their fabrication. Thangadurai et al. [26], Samson et al. [73], Ramakumar et al. [314], and Zhao et al. [315] reviewed garnet-based electrolytes, and their most important findings are summarized below.
(i) The general formula of garnet-based materials is A3B2(XO4)3, where A = Ca, Mg, La, Y, or rare earth metals; B = Al, Fe, Ga, Ge, Mn, Ni, or V; and X = Si, Ge, or Al. In addition, A, B, and X are eight-, six-, and four-O coordinated cation sites, respectively. The typical crystal structure of Li7La3Zr2O12, a Li-based cubic garnet, is illustrated in Figure 22a,b [73]. Li atoms randomly and partially occupy the interstices of the framework structure within two types of sites: The tetrahedral 24d and octahedral 48g or oﬀ-centered 96h and 96h sites are displaced oﬀ the 48g sites, the framework contains eight-fold coordinated LaO8 dodecahedra (24c) and six-fold coordinated ZrO6 octahedra (16a). The 48g to 96h site displacement is ascribed to the Li+–Li+ repulsions across shared site faces. 
(iii) Most Li3-, Li5-, Li6-, and Li7-garnet phases present cubic lattices, and their lattice parameters are in the ranges of 12.15–12.56, 12.66–13.06, 12.69–13.0, and 12.82–13.0 Å, respectively. Li7La3Zr2O12 presents both cubic and tetragonal phases (a = 13.12 Å, c =12.66 Å); Li7La3M2O12 (M= Zr, Sn, Hf) and Li7Nd3M2O12 present only tetragonal lattices (a = 12.94–13.12 Å and c =12.63–12.71 Å) [26].
(iv) The Li+ ion conductivity of the garnet-type electrolytes increases with increasing Li content in the garnet structure, and the maximum Li+ ion conductivity was achieved when the Li content was in the range of 6.4–7.0.
v) Among all Li7−xLa3Zr2−xTaxO12 Ta-doped compounds, materials with the cubic structure (x = 0.25) reported by Allen et al. [317] presented a bulk Li+ ion conductivity of 0.87 × 10−3 S cm−1 and Ea of 0.22 eV (Table 3); in addition, the ionic conductivity and Ea of Li6.15La3Zr1.75Ta0.25Al0.2O12 were 0.37 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 0.30 eV, respectively, and those of Li6.15La3Zr1.75Ta0.25Ga0.2O12 were 0.41 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 0.41 eV, respectively [317]; moreover, the ionic conductivity of Li7−xLa3Zr2−xTaxO12 (x = 0.6) at 25 ◦C was 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 [325]. Owing to the good conductivity and stability of Ta-doped LLZOs, many researchers focused on the optimization of sintering temperature and synthesis techniques.
(vi) The ionic conductivity of the tetragonal polymorph of Li7La3Zr2O12 was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the cubic phase, particularly at low temperatures.
(vii) All Ta-doped garnets presented good chemical stability when paired with Li metal at potentials of up to 6 V vs. Li+/Li at room temperature [26].
(viii) The cubic phase of Li6.25La3Zr2AlxO12 (x = 0.2–0.3) can be stabilized via intrinsic Al-doping at high temperatures from the reaction with the Al crucible used for preparation. The ionic conductivity of the low-temperature synthesized bare LLZO (1 × 10-6 S cm−1) was approximately two orders of magnitude lower that than that of Al-doped LLZO (σ = 2 × 10-4 S cm−1) [496].
(ix) The Li+ ion conduction mechanism was analyzed using solid-state NMR experiments [326] and computational calculations, indicating that the Li conduction occurred mostly between the octahedral sites. Moreover, the Li+ ions that occupied those sites were connected to each other in a 3D network that allowed the Li+ ions to hop from one edge of the shared octahedra to another. Furthermore, the Li+ ion conduction pathways appear to be correlated with the concentration of Li in the garnet structures [26].
(x) Li–garnet-based oxide electrolytes undergo proton exchange reactions in water, aqueous LiCl/LiOH solutions, and dilute acids, and the exchange appears to be favored at the tetrahedral sites. Li5La3M2O12 undergoes proton exchange reactions more readily than other Li-rich phases, such as the Li6- and Li7-garnet phases. More details on the chemical and electrochemical stability in aqueous solution or in the presence of moisture/humidity, CO2, and Li metal are included in the recent review published by Hofstetter et al. [327].
C. Among all cathodes, LCO and NMC111 presented better stability when paired with Ta-LLZO electrolytes. Few reports indicated that the additional reactive phases that formed during sintering were LaCoO3, Co3O4, or La2Zr2O7.
(xii) SSBs were fabricated using diﬀerent forms of electrolytes, i.e., solid, bare, and composite semi-solid/liquid electrolytes, and few eﬀorts were devoted to sintering them with additives like Li3BO3, Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3, Li3PO4, and Li4SiO4. The melting points of Li3BO3 and Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 of 700 and 690 ◦C, respectively, were the lowest of all analyzed solid electrolytes [330–332]. Ohta et al. [333] fabricated an ASSB using Nb-doped LLZO as the solid electrolyte and Li3BO3 as the solid electrolyte mixed with the LiCoO2 cathode. Few case studies on SSBs are discussed in detail in the following. The reactivity of the cathode–electrolyte pairs varies with the reaction temperature, reaction time, and sintering conditions, such as the pressure and atmosphere (air, Ar, or O2).
(xiii) Critical current limits have been studied, and it was revealed that Li plating occurredat current densities above ~0.5–1.0 mA cm−2 during the charging penetration of Li in the solid electrolyte [334,335], which led to short circuiting. This low operating current limits the use of these oxide electrolytes for large-scale electric vehicle battery applications, which require discharge current rates in the range of ~1–10 mA cm−2.
(xiv) Gong et al. [336] performed in situ TEM studies on Ag|Ta-LLZO|LCO and revealed that the Li extraction mechanism in solid electrolytes was diﬀerent than in liquid electrolytes; moreover, hexagonal phase transitions occur when LCO was cycled using commercial liquid electrolytes [337]. Based on TEM observations, LCO single crystal became a polycrystalline material with 5–15 nm grains after delithiation and formed coherent twin boundaries and antiphase domain boundaries along its (010)	axis.
Researchers have determined that the shortcomings at the LLZO/electrode interfaces, for both the Li anode and cathode, must be addressed using advanced techniques to render solid-state Li-ion batteries useful for commercial large-scale applications. The interface drawbacks of SSBs have been highlighted in 1986 by Hagenmuller [338] at the international seminar on solid-state devices in Singapore. He mentioned the need for stable highly conductive electrolytes, the concerns associated with the fabrication technology, and highlighted the importance of the cooperation between scientists and engineers [339]. Thangadurai et al. [26] and Samson et al. [73] reviewed the literature on LLZO electrolytes published until early 2019. Herein, we discuss a few additional, more recent publications on LLZO electrolytes, as follows. Posch et al. [340] studied the ion dynamics of Al-doped Li6.46Al0.15La3Zr1.95O11.86 (Al-LLZO) using solid-state NMR and conductivity measurements. The measured ionic conductivity of Al-LLZO (8.3 × 10−5 S cm−1) was slightly lower than the value 10−4 S cm−1 reported for polycrystalline Al-LLZO [26]. It was noted that when the Al content was optimal (0.2–0.3 mol.% Al3+) the Al-LLZO samples reached conductivities of up to 10−3 S cm−1. Solid-state NMR spin-lattice relaxation measurements revealed that the Ea of the samples was in the range of 0.18–0.38 eV; these values describe both the local barriers of the elementary jump processes and diﬀusion on a wider length scale, and were similar to that obtained via conductivity measurements (Ea = 0.36 eV). Marbella et al. [341] performed solid-state NMR analysis on the Li|Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12|Li solid electrolyte system during Li-stripping and plating and noted that the growth of Li dendrites increased with increasing cycle time; moreover, dense Li microstructures that grew into the electrolyte pellet surface were observed before short-circuits occurred during the electrochemical measurements at low current rates < 0.5 mA cm−2.
Recently, Bock et al. [342] reported that the thermal conductivity of Li7La3Zr2O12 was approximately 0.47 ± 0.009 W K−1 m−1. Moreover, de Klerk and Wagemaker [343] reported the mathematical space charge model of the LLZO electrolyte and electrode materials, such as graphite and LCO. In addition, Binninger et al. [276] determined the electrochemical stability window of the LLZO electrolyte using computational techniques. Few other reports on doping Li7-garnet series have been recently published [344–347]. Farooq et al. [344] reported that the ionic conductivities of the Ba-doped Li6.5La2.5Ba0.5TaZrO12 solid electrolytes sintered at 1100 to 1200 ◦C were 1.07 × 10−6 and 6.62 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively, at 26 ◦C. In addition, Huo et al. [322] used other dopants to substitute the La sites of the Li6.5La2.5A0.5TaZrO12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) compounds via SPS, and among all, the Sr-doped garnets presented the highest Li+ ion conductivity of 3.08 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 20 ◦C and lowest Ea of 0.35 eV. Furthermore, they analyzed the eﬀect of structural stability, ion mobility, and interfacial mechanisms during air exposure.
Kotobuki and Koishi [323] prepared the dense (99.7%) Y-doped LLZO (Li7.06La3Zr1.94Y0.06O12, LLYZ) solid electrolyte using the SPS technique. The samples were sintered in the temperature range of 800–1100 ◦C for 10 min and under the pressure of 40 MPa, and the reported total conductivity of the pellet sintered at 1100 ◦C was 9.8 × 10−4 S cm−1, which was higher than that of the pellet prepared using the conventional synthesis method; moreover, the sample presented good stability in the potential window of 0–9.0 V vs. Li+/Li. Recently, Paolella et al. [345] studied the eﬀect of chemical phase evolution of bare and doped LLZO in relation with the Li loss at high temperature.
Owing to their good electrolyte/cathode interface properties, a series of polymer solid composite electrolyte have been developed for Li batteries. After the introduction of the polymer electrolyte concept for Li batteries by Armand [346], many attempts have been made to use polymers and metal oxides, such as TiO2 and SiO2, as solid electrolytes. Mei et al. [279] measured the ionic conductivity of PEO18–LiClO4–x wt.% Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12. Zhang et al. [347] prepared organic–inorganic composite protective membranes that consisted of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)(PVDF-HEP) and LLZO composites using the tape-casting method. Xu et al. [348] synthesized a LLZO/polyacrylonitrile composite with gel polymer electrolyte used in cell with LiFePO4 cathode. Gao et al. [349] studied the performance of the lithiated Nafion (Li-Nafion)-garnet ceramic Li6.25La3Zr2Al0.25O12 (LLZAO) composite in LiFePO4||Li cell at 30 ◦C and reported that the specific discharge capacity of the cell was 160 mAh g−1, its capacity retention was 97% after 100 cycles at a current rate of 0.2C, and the retained capacity after 500 cycles at 1C was 126 mAh g−1. Liu et al. [350] studied the Ta-LLZO/liquid electrolyte interface. Zhang et al. [351] used a SPE-based composite with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as Li salt and reported that the cell with 10 wt.% PEO-LiTFSI Li6.7La3Zr1.7Ta0.3O12 composite solid electrolyte and LiFePO4 cathode delivered a reversible capacity of 140 mAh g−1 at the current rate of 0.2C at 60 ◦C; moreover, the cell retained a capacity of 139 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles.
Thangadurai et al. [26] and Samson et al. [73] dedicated considerable eﬀorts to the analysis of the fundamental aspects of garnet electrolytes. In addition, Lobe et al. [352,353], who are considered experts in the fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells, explored the fabrication of ASSBs using thin film deposition. Furthermore, Tsai et al. [13,335] evaluated the screen-printing technique and investigated the sol–gel and solid-state preparation methods.
Possible mechanisms of interface evolution were proposed using the energy-dispersive electron spectroscopy mapping of the sintered composite electrode, which revealed the presence of clean edges for La and Co between LCO and Ta-LLZO, and therefore, confirmed that no diﬀusion occurred during cycling. In addition, microcracks were observed on the composite electrode and electrolyte (Figure 26), which were caused by the repetitive expansion and contraction of the electrode and caused the capacity degradation of the ASSB. The pressure applied during electrochemical cycling and its eﬀects on further technology optimization should be studied in more detail. Although LLZO-based solid state batteries are easier to handle than those using sulfide electrolytes, their capacity and cycling stability should be improved for expanding their practical applications. Overall, Ta-LLZO and LCO were sintered at 1050 ◦
C, and it was noted that shortening the sintering time at high temperature could prevent the element inter-diﬀusion and minimize crack formation. In addition to bare cathode and electrolyte composite sintering, the use of coatings and additives has also been experimentally investigated. Ohta et al. [333] used Li3BO3 as an additive for Nb-doped LLZO/LiCoO2–Li3BO3.
Ohta et al. [333] used Li3BO3 as an additive for Nb-doped LLZO/LiCoO2–Li3BO3. Later, Han et al. [357] reported the low cathode/electrolyte interfacial resistance obtained by thermal soldering of the Li2CO3-coated LCO cathode and Ta-LLZO (Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12) solid electrolyte together using Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 as additive, which has an ionic conductivity of 10−5 S cm−1 at 100 ◦C. The advantage of this additive is a reasonably low melting point of approximately 690 ◦C and can be well soldered with the Li2CO3-coated cathode and the LLZO electrolyte. Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 powder was prepared by heating a mixture of Li2CO3 and Li3BO3 in air at 650 ◦C for 10 h. A thin Li2CO3 layer was deposited on LCO as follows. The as-prepared LCO was soaked in a mixed 1 mol L−1 LiOH and 0.25 mol L−1 LiNO3 aqueous solution for 30 min. The obtained solid was then filtered, dried in a vacuum oven, and heated to 250 ◦C in CO2 atmosphere for 5 h. Subsequently, Li2CO3 was coated on the Ta-LLZO SSE by exposing the milled powder for 1 h and then stored in air. The results of the electrochemical studies performed using 1–3 mg of active material revealed the irreversible capacity loss of 32 mAh g−1 during the first cycle and reasonably good stability during cycling (Figure 27a–f) [357]. The low mass of active material used in this study cannot be compared with the higher loadings reported in the literature; moreover, in this study, the high Ta doping (0.6 wt.% Ta) led to the increase in the cost of the raw materials. For practical application, the concentration of Ta should be ≤ 0.25 mole.
ost of the raw materials. For practical application, the concentration of Ta should be ≤ 0.25 mole.
Kato et al. [358] deposited the LNMC + 5 wt.% LATP composite on LLZO pellets and reported that the areal capacity of the ASSB was 0.5 mAh cm−2 (specific capacity of approximately 150 mAh −1 over 90 cycles at a current rate of 50 µA cm−2 (Figure 28a–c). In addition, the authors used stack g )
pressure during cycling and the addition of 5 wt.% LATP to LNMC improve the interfacial contact between the electrode and electrolyte. These results should be of further interest for oxide-based electrolyte systems. Improvement of the interfacial contact between electrodes and polymer-based electrolyte composites has been obtained by mixing 10–20 wt.% LLZO with polymer, ionic liquids,
and inorganic salts, such as 1 mol L−1 LiClO4 and 1 mol L−1 LiPF6. Thus, the optimization of the stack pressure during electrochemical cycling of hot-press–manufactured Ta-LLZO cathode materials is required for large-scale applications. Barai et al. [497] revealed the growth of Li dendrites through local inhomogeneities of polycrystalline LLZO-based ceramics and subsequent short-circuit of the ASSB. They developed atomistic simulations using a mesoscale model to estimate the dendrite growth velocity. Results showed that the average growth velocity increased with the lithium yield strength.
hey reported that the capacity of the cell was 150 mA g−1 at the rate of 0.1C. Moreover, the cell presented good charge–discharge profiles and cycling performances, similarly to that of liquid electrolyte cell showing the main redox couples (4.0/3.85 V) and hexagonal phase transformations of LiCoO2 around ~4.06, ~4.18, ~4.5 V vs. Li [356]. We note that it is not in the experimental part that authors used any liquid or polymer electrolyte to improve the wettability, as they may lead to improved cyclability. Kwatek et al. [380] examined the impact of Li2.9B0.9S0.1O3.1 glass additive on the structure and electrical properties of the LATP-based ceramics. Using high-resolution synchrotron-based X-ray and neutron powder diﬀraction, Monchak et al. [381] characterized the crystal structure of LATP samples prepared by a water-based sol-gel process and evaluated the possible lithium diﬀusion pathways using the diﬀerence bond-valence approach.
Hofmann et al. [382] fabricated LATP and LiCoPO4 thin films using the PLD technique and reported various surface analysis methods. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry studies on the as-deposited (unheated) films revealed well defined interfaces; conversely, the interdiﬀusion of Co and Ti ions was observed between the heat-treated electrolyte and cathode films. Atomic force microscopy analysis revealed that LATP presented well-defined smooth surface and XPS studies indicated that no changes occurred in the oxidation states of the ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Recently, Bock et al. [342] reported that the thermal conductivity of LATP was approximately 0.49 ± 0.2 W K−1 m−1.
Waetzig et al. [378] synthesized LATP using the sol–gel method followed by ball milling and further densification of the powders using the SPS technique. The LATP pellets sintered at 1000 ◦C presented the excellent room-temperature Li+ ion conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1, bulk density of 2.92 g cm−3, and relative density of 99.4%. In contrast, the Li+ ion conductivities of the samples sintered at 800 and 850 ◦C were 1.1 × 10−4 and 4.8 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, and their relative and (bulk) densities were 87.4 % (2.57 g cm−3) and 96.1 % (2.824 g cm−3), respectively. Although the excellent ionic conductivity of the LATP pellets sintered at 100 ◦C was ascribed to the samples being homogeneous and crack-free (Figure 31C), the optimum sintering temperature range for the NMC cathodes for ASSBs is 700–800 ◦C, as in this temperature range, the formation of a reactive phase at the cathode/electrolyte interface is avoided. However, the aforementioned surface morphology is of interest for the fabrication of ASSBs. Pogosova et al. [383] studied the eﬀect of storing the LATP electrolyte in air and Ar atmosphere and reported that the total initial room-temperature conductivity of 4 × 10−4 S cm−1 decreased significantly, by 76% and 28% for the samples stored in air and Ar, respectively, after three months.
Recently, Case et al. [384] performed computational studies of LATP and Binninger et al. [276] analyzed the electrochemical stability window of the LATP electrolyte using computational methods. Furthermore, Siyal et al. [385] analyzed a gel polymer electrolyte with 15 wt.% LATP composite, and few other researchers studied bare and LATP composite electrodes [379,386–388]. Yen et al. [389] characterized LATP powders prepared by hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination (900–1100 ◦C), cold pressing (90 MPa), and post sintering, which exhibit ionic conductivity of grain and grain boundary of 6.57 × 10−4 and 4.59 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. The fabricated NCM523|LATP|artificial graphite pouch cell delivered a high reversible capacity of 16.7 mAh at 0.5C after 360 cycles with 63.2% capacity retention (voltage range, 2.80–4.25 V).
Few attempts have been made to combine polymer electrolytes with LATP to obtain solid electrolyte composites. Ma et al. [390] paired a 10% LATP and polymer electrolyte/ionic liquid composite with a LiFePO4 cathode and reported a capacity of 138 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles with 98% capacity retention at 60 ◦C. In addition, Wang et al. [391] and Jin et al. [392] studied LATP polymer composites. Yu and Manthiram [393] fabricated a slurry cast PEO–LiCF3SO3–LATP composite membrane solid electrolyte and paired it with a LiFePO4 cathode. Moreover, they studied the eﬀect of various LATP solid electrolyte and polymer compositions and reported that the highest ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 60 ◦C was achieved when the amount of LATP electrolyte was 25 wt.%; in addition, when the membrane was paired with a Li metal anode, it was stable for up to 1800 h (Figure 32(1)). The cell formed by combining this composite electrolyte with a LiFePO4 cathode and Li metal anode presented the charge capacities of 150 and 118 mAh g−1 at the rates of C/20 and C/2 (1C = 2.1 mA cm−2), respectively, at 60 ◦C (Figure 32(2)). These electrolyte systems were diﬃcult operate at room temperature owing to their conductivity limitations. Further improvement in cycling temperature is possible via polymer backbone modifications (Table 4).
DeWees and Wang [49] reviewed various synthesis (see Figure 29) and ionic conductivity analysis methods for the LAGP electrolyte. It was concluded that the processing parameters such as heat-treatment and time and precursor compositions have a great importance in solid-state reaction and sol-gel method, respectively. For example, the use of phosphorous source (H3PO4) as precursor provides the best LAGP phase purity and the highest ionic conductivity of ~5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C. In addition, few studies on the synthesis, conductivity (~4 × 10−4 S cm−1, see Table 3 [365]) and interface mechanisms, and physical and electrochemical properties of LAGP have been published since 2019 [49,342,394–437].
In 1984, Latie et al. [447] reported the synthesis and transport properties of two-dimensional LixM1/3Nb1−xTixO3 (M = La, Nd) perovskite (ABO3)-type oxides. In addition, they investigated the ion conduction mechanism of these materials using the NMR technique. Furthermore, in 1984,
Kochergina et al. [448] published a report on Li0.5La0.5TiO3. Subsequently, the Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2xTiO3 phase (with 0 < x < 0.16) (LLTO), where  denotes a structural vacancy, and its related compounds, have been thoroughly studied by numerous workers [451–467]. Afterwards, in 1987, Belous et al. [449] studied the eﬀect of the Li content on the structure of Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2xTiO3 (0.04 ≤ x ≤ 0.17) and performed conductivity measurements. In 1993, Inaguma et al. [450] studied the Li0.34La0.5TiO2.94 electrolyte. Among all Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2xTiO3 structures, x ≈ 0.1 presented a conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C [458] and an Ea of 0.40 eV. In 2003, Stramare et al. [459] reviewed the perovskite-type solid electrolytes in detail.
Herein, we summarize the findings of the previous reports and discuss a few recent additional studies as follows.
(i) Many eﬀorts have been invested to elucidate the crystal structure and conduction mechanism of Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2xTiO3 by (a) analyzing the eﬀect of the preparation method: Solid-state [458], sol–gel [461], precipitation [459], electrospinning [462], and thin film (RF sputtering and PLD) [463], and reaction conditions, such as temperature and time; (b) investigating the concept of doping,  i.	e., substitution of La by other lanthanides (Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Y) [464], using various Li doping contents [451], or substituting other alkali ions, such as Na+ and K+ ions, or alkaline-earth ions, such as Sr2+ and Ba2+ ions, or Ag+ ions at the La sites; (c) in 2000, Mizumoto investigated the conductivity relaxation in various lithium ion conductors with the perovskite-type structure [465], and (d) considering doping the Ti sites with tri- (e.g., Al3+) [466], tetra- (e.g., Zr4+), penta- (e.g., Ta5+, Nb5+) [485], and hexavalent ions (e.g., W6+). It was determined that the conduction mechanism of the LLTO compounds varied with the composition, A-site deficiency, Li+ and La3+ ions concentration, and dopants [466]. For example, the decrease in Ea and increase in ionic conductivity was noted with increasing the rare-earth metal ion size as follows: Sm3+ < Nd3+ < Pr3+ < La3+; furthermore, the microstructure, density, domain size, and composition of the domain boundaries aﬀected the ionic conductivity and Ea values of the LLTO compounds [467–470]. Solid-state NMR studies revealed that the Li+ ions hopped between cages through the bottleneck in the ab plane at low temperature, whereas at high temperature, the Li+ ions hopped in all three directions. The reported conductivity values of Li0.34La0.56TiO3 range from ~7 × 10−4 to ~1 × 10−3 S cm−1 (Table 3).
The Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2x(A)Ti(B)O3 perovskite electrolyte presents three diﬀerent types of polymorphs [459], viz. simple cubic: a = 3.872 Å, for x = 0.97–0.11, tetragonal: a = b= 3.87 Å and c = 7.74 Å, for x = 0.11–0.2, and orthorhombic: a = 3.864 Å, b = 3.875 Å, c = 7.786 Å, for x = 0.03–0.09. Among all polymorphs, the cubic structure presented the highest conductivity followed by the tetragonal and orthorhombic ones, for the same bulk composition. The low ionic conductivity of the well-ordered phases was correlated with the uneven ordering of Li, La, and vacancies along the c-axis. The Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2x(A)Ti(B)O3 LLTO presents perovskite (ABO3)-type structure, where the
A-sites consist of La, alkaline (Li+, Na+, K+), or rare earth ions, which are arranged in the corners of a cube and the B-sites consist of transition metal (Ti) ions, which are located at the center of the cube; the face-center positions are occupied by O atoms. Typically, the A- and B-sites present 12- and 6-	fold coordination (BO6), respectively, that share corners with each other (Figure 34a,b) [469,471]. The A-sites contain a large number of defects, and the composition of Li3xLa(2/3)−x(1/3)−2x(A)Ti(B)O3 can be written as La2/3TiO3, which is intrinsically A-cation deficient, with 1/3 of vacant A-sites. The La vacancies are partitioned into alternating La-rich and La-poor layers along one axis to form a partially ordered super lattice structure at room temperature. Depending on the Li content of the materials, they present diﬀerent symmetries. The Li-poor (0.03 ≤ x < 0.1) compositions present orthorhombic symmetry, with high La-site occupancy (≥90%) in the La-rich layer and antiphase tilting of the TiO6 octahedra. Conversely, the Li-rich (0.1 ≤ x < 0.167) compositions present tetragonal symmetry, and the occupancies of the two types of La layers become less dissimilar as the Li content increases [471].
The experimental observations were further validated by the results of the computational study performed by Jay et al. [472]. They revealed the non-significant significant ordering of the A-site cations in the layers normal to the c-axis and indicated that the Li+ ions could also diﬀuse along c-axis. Computational studies oﬀered further insight into the size of the bottleneck and indicated a possible increased using large rare-earth or alkaline-earth metal ions as A-site ions; moreover, changing the bond strength between the B-site cations and O also aﬀects the conductivity of these electrolytes.
In 1972, West [498] published a report on Li superionic conductor (LISICON)-type structure oxide electrolytes. The conductivities of Li4SiO4 [310,498,499] and Li4Si0.6Ti0.4O4 [310] were reported to be 2 × 10−9 and ~3 ×10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and 300 ◦C, respectively. These materials present the γ-Li3PO4 structure, where Li+ ions that are located in the LiO4 tetrahedra diﬀuse between these tetrahedra and interstitial sites in the PO4 network. Diﬀerent solid solutions could replace the P5+ ions in γ-Li3PO4 with tetravalent atoms, such as Si, Ti, and Ge, to create compositions such as Li3+x(P1−xMx)O4.
In 1978, Hong [500] reported LISCON-type structured compounds, such as Li14Zn(GeO4)4 and doped Lil6.2Ax(BO4)4, in which A2+ = Mg, Zn, B4+ = Si, Ge, and x = 1, 2, or 3. Among the analyzed specimens, Li14ZnGeO4 presented good conductivity (8 S cm−1 at 300 ◦C). Ivanov-Shitz and Kireev [501] reported that the conductivity of single crystal Li3.34P0.66Ge0.34O4 was ~1.8 × 10−6 and 3.7 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 40 and 400 ◦C, respectively.
Deng et al. [502] conducted both experimental and MD computational studies on several LISICON-related compositions, viz. Li4±xSi1−xXxO4 (X = P, Al, or Ge), Li4SiO4, Li3.75Si0.75P0.25O4, Li4.25Si0.75Al0.25O4, Li4Al0.33Si0.33P0.33O4, and Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4. They observed that the conductivities of the P-, Al-, and Ge- doped samples were higher than those of the other samples. In addition, the MD simulation studies revealed that the conductivity of Li4Al1/3Si1/6Ge1/6P1/3O4 was 0.9 mS cm−1; furthermore, its Ea of 0.28 eV was the lowest of all analyzed samples. Recently, Zhao et al. [503] studied the co-doped Li3.75±y(Ge0.75P0.25)1−xMxO4 (M = Mg2+, B3+, Al3+, Ga3+, and V5+) LISICON-type structures and reported that Li3.53(Ge0.75P0.25)0.7V0.3O4 presented the highest ionic conductivity of 5.1 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C of all samples, and also the low Ea of 0.43 eV (Table 3).
The low room-temperature conductivity of bare oxide electrolytes is a drawback, and hence, very few studies have focused on their use for AASBs. However, some bare oxide electrolytes can be used for high-temperature applications, and according to some recent studies, once the interactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface are elucidated, a few compositions could be promising SSB electrolyte materials.
Commercial Li-ion batteries for mobile applications use bulk electrode materials. Conversely, thin-film microbatteries have been explored for miniaturized device applications, such as smart cards, microwave microelectromechanical systems, and other biomedical applications. The electrode and electrolytes of microbatteries are a few microns thick and are deposited layer-by-layer using RF-sputtering, PLD, evaporation, and other techniques. These batteries can only be used for low-power applications owing to their thin film nature; in addition, the deposition technique used for fabricating these devices is expensive compared with the traditional slurry coating method used to manufacture Li batteries. Despite these limitations, after Oudenhoven et al. [117] proposed the concept and design of 3D microbatteries, the use of thin-film electrolytes for microelectronic applications has been explored by many researchers [504–521].
Lithium phosphorous-oxynitride (LiPON) is one of the most studied oxide-based electrolytes owing to its reasonably good ionic conductivity and stability when paired with Li metal anode Bates et al. [522] reported that the conductivity of the thin-film Li3.3PO3.9N0.17 electrolyte prepared via RF sputtering using an LPO target and N2 reactive gas, was 2 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C. Yu et al. [523] further explored LiPON electrolytes and determined that the conductivity, Ea, electrochemical stability window, and bandgaps of Li2.88PO3.73N0.14 were 3.3 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 25 ◦C, 0.54 eV, 0–5.5 V, and 3.45 and 3.75 eV, respectively (Table 3). Hamon et al. [524] and Fleutot et al. [525–527] reported the eﬀect of the RF-sputtering parameters, such as power, flow rate, and total pressure, under pure N2 gas atmosphere on the composition and conductivity properties of LixPOyNz (z = 0.4–1.2) LiPON thin films, and noted that the ionic conductivity increased with the incorporation of N2 into the glassy structure. The correlations between composition, local structure (by XPS), and the electrical properties were reported for lithium borophosphate (Li3PO4Bx, x = 0.08–0.24) thin films and for xLiBO2:(1−x)Li3PO4 (x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25) glasses [527]. The eﬀect of the B/P ratio on the conductivity of the electrolytes was analyzed demonstrating that the electrolyte with the B/P ratio of 0.1 presented the highest ionic conductivity of 1.1 × 10−6 S cm−1 and lowest Ea of 0.52 eV of all analyzed samples.
Among all oxide-based electrolytes, garnet-based oxides, Ta-, Ga-, and Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12, and NASICON-type LATP and LAGP have been studied in depth for ASSBs, owing to their good conductivity. Only few studies have been conducted on ASSBs with Ta-doped LLZO electrolytes, owing to their better stability when paired with Li metal anodes. Most oxide-based electrolytes use 15–25 wt.% inorganic superionic conductors (LATP, LAGP, LLTO) in polymer composites with combination of ionic liquid electrolytes. However, the progress in this field has been rather slow, mainly owing to the high cell resistance, which was attributed to the high-temperature sintering process required for better particle-to-particle contact between composite cathodes and electrolyte layers. Most of the best-reported garnet-based electrolyte used high content of Ta dopant (0.5–0.6 mol%) for large-scale application, which can be further reduced below 0.25 mol%. LATP, LAGP, and LLTO contain Ti and Ge, which undergo electrochemical reactions with Li metal, and thus, further improving the surface protection of the electrolytes is needed for large-scale applications and to reduce the cost associated with the use of Ge.
The most common shortcoming of ASSBs with sulfide and oxide electrolyte is their low electrochemical cycling performance at high charge–discharge rates, which is attributed to the poorly conducting decomposition products and small contact areas or space-charge between electrode and electrolyte layers. In addition, the roles of the microstructure adhesion and mechanical and surface interfacial properties of both Li metal and solid electrolytes should be further elucidated. Furthermore, the reactivities of Li metal, solid electrolytes, and cathodes should be further investigated. Currently, it is diﬃcult to access the electrolyte/electrode interface using conventional post-mortem techniques without creating artifacts, and thus, further advances should be made on developing in situ analysis techniques. Moreover, the search for highly stable conductive electrolytes should continue. Lastly, an important aspect related to the fabrication of ASBB would be the cooperation between scientists and engineers, which could facilitate the fabrication of large-area cells and address the current transportation technology challenges.
