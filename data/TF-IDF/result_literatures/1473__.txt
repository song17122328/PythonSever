LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 ceramics, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP), by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering followed by annealing. The ﬁlms have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy. All-solid-state Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2/Au cells are fabricated using the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 thin ﬁlms and the LATSP electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the cells is investigated by galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Interfacial reactions between LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 and LATSP occur at a temperature as low as 300 ◦C with the formation of Mn3O4, resulting in an increased obstacle for Li-ion diffusion across the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2/LATSP interface. The electrochemical performance of the cells is limited by the interfacial resistance between LATSP and LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 as well as the Li-ion diffusion kinetics in LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 bulk.

Since pioneered by Ohzuku et al. [1,2], LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 with a ␣-NaFeO2 layered structure has been received great interest as a potential alternative cathode to LiCoO2 due to its relatively lower cost and less toxicity compared with that of LiCoO2. The material showed a high speciﬁc capacity of 200 mAh g−1 when cycled between 2.5 and 4.5 V with a good cycling stability [2]. In addition, this material also exhibited a better safety than LiNiO2 and LiMn2O4 [2]. Furthermore, LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 shows little volume change during charge and discharge, guaranteeing close contact with the current collector when fabricating thin-ﬁlm batteries and also close contact with the solid electrolyte when assembling all-solid-state batteries. Previous reports revealed that the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms had a good charge–discharge characteristic in the liquid electrolyte after annealed at high-temperature (over 700 ◦C) [3,4]. However, for the practical application of the ﬁlms in all-solid-state thin-ﬁlm batteries, some other factors should be taken into consideration, such as the Li-ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte and the interfacial stability between the cathode ﬁlm and the solid electrolyte.

For the solid electrolyte, recently, an increasing attention has been paid to NASICON-type materials, because of their high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature [5–9]. The electrochemical cycling of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries based on NASICON-type electrolytes has been realized [10–15]. In addition to the search for suitable solid electrolytes, the chemical stability at the cathode/electrolyte interface is also an important factor, because post-annealing sometimes is necessary to optimize the electrochemical performance of the ﬁlm. This annealing step, however, will generate undesirable side reactions between the cathode and the electrolyte, leading to the blocking of Li-ion diffusion passage [14,15]. Furthermore, the diffusion kinetics of Li-ion in bulk of the cathode ﬁlm is another factor limiting its electrochemical performance. In our present work, LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms were prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on NASICON-type Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP) solid electrolyte. All-solid-state Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/Au cells were fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance of the ﬁlms. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Li-ion chemical diffusion coefﬁcients were measured in order to understand the intrinsic mechanism underlying the electrochemical performance of the all-solid-state batteries.

The glass ceramics plates, LATSP (0.26 mm in thickness, OHARA Inc.), were used as the solid electrolyte for the following experiments. The LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms (8 mm× 8 mm) were deposited on the LATSP substrates (10 mm× 10 mm) by RF magnetron sputtering using an Ulvac SCOTT-C3. The target used for sputtering was prepared by cold pressing LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 powder, prepared according to [16]. LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 sputtering was carried out in an Ar/O2 mixture (30% O2) with a total pressure of 2 Pa for 2 h. The as-deposited ﬁlms were annealed at 300–600 ◦C for 30 min in air. Au was then deposited on the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 by RF magnetron sputtering from an Au target for 30 min in pure Ar as the current collector. The crystalline structure of the as-deposited and the annealed ﬁlms was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RINT2000/PC diffractometer with Cu K␣ radiation and Raman spectra using a LabRamHRUV spectrometer. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the ﬁlms were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4800. The chemical composition of the ﬁlm was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy using a Shimadzu ICPS-1000IV spectrometer.

Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/Au cells were fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance according to our previous report [14]. Galvanostatic cycling of the cells was carried out at various currents (5–100 ␮A) between 2.5 and 4.5 V at 50 ◦C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement was performed between 2.5 and 4.5 V at a scanning rate 0.1 mV s−1. EIS measurement was conducted at 50–80 ◦C by applying an AC signal of 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface combined with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. To investigate the interfacial resistances of Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N and PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP cell, in two symmetric cells Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/Li and Li/PEO18Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/Li were fabricated and characterized by EIS at 50 ◦C. Li-ion chemical diffusion coefﬁcient, ˜DLi, was measured by potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) at 50 ◦C in a voltage range of 3.6–4.3 V.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms sputtered on LATSP annealed at various temperatures. Note that only a bump at around 45◦ (2) can be seen for the as-deposited LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm, indicating that the ﬁlm is amorphous or poorly crystallized. A broad peak appears when the ﬁlm was annealed at 300 ◦C. With increasing the annealing temperature, the broad peak becomes sharp with its position shifted to a high angle, suggesting that LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms on LATSP crystallized with a (1 0 4) preferred orientation. Our previous work showed that the same orientation was also observed for other two layered oxide thin ﬁlms, LiCoO2 [14] and LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 [17], deposited also on LATSP. In contrast, the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms on Au and stainless steel showed a (0 0 3) preferred orientation [4]. This suggests that the ﬁlm orientation is substrate dependent. The ICP analysis shows that the as-deposited ﬁlm is Li-rich with a Li:Mn:Ni molar ratio of 2:0.766:0.766.

Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms on LATSP annealed at different temperatures. Note that no obvious peak can be observed for the as-deposited ﬁlm, indicative of the amorphous nature of the ﬁlm, in agreement with the XRD results. After annealed at 300 ◦C for 30 min, two broad peaks at around and 450 and 600 cm−1 are evolved. The presence of this spectra band is characteristic of the layered LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 with a symmetry of R-3m [4,18]. The spectra band at 200–400 cm−1 can be attributed to Mn3O4 [19]. It is clear that Mn3O4 begins to form at a low temperature of 300 ◦C to form an inert layer. We did not ﬁnd any Ni based compounds after annealing in Raman spectra and XRD patterns, which may due to that they are in an amorphous state and/or at a low amount. the 300 ◦C-annealed LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm on LATSP. As seen in Fig. 3(a), the asdeposited ﬁlm is composed of the irregular particles with a wide size distribution and the boundaries between the particles can be clearly seen. After annealing, the boundaries are not obvious and a leaf-like structure appears as seen in Fig. 3(b). It seems that the leaflike structure comes from the part crystallization of the amorphous ﬁlm. The thickness of the ﬁlm is about be 1 ␮m after 2 h sputtering as shown in Fig. 3(c). Note that the ﬁlm is dense and crack free. For the annealed ﬁlm, however, the inert layer between LATSP and LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 is not clear. This may be due to that the inert layer is rather thin. As seen in Fig. 4, when the annealing is increased to 400 ◦C, the electrode exhibits a signiﬁcant rise of resistance compared with the 300 ◦C-annealed one (see Fig. 7), which may serve as an indirect proof that the inert layer exists. Fig. 5 compares the voltage proﬁles of the as-deposited and 300 ◦C-annealed LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms. As seen in Fig. 5(a), the as-deposited ﬁlm exhibits a low capacity and ill-deﬁned potential plateaus, typical of materials with an amorphous state. In addition, the amorphous ﬁlm shows a large irreversible capacity, which may be related to its Li-rich composition. For the 300 ◦C-annealed ﬁlm, the potential plateaus are well developed with a signiﬁcant reduction of the irreversible capacity as shown in Fig. 5(b), indicating improved crystallization and microstructural rearrangement of the ﬁlm. However, the speciﬁc capacity of the ﬁlm is below 100 mAh g−1, rather lower than that of the well-crystallized materials prepared by high-temperature solid-phase reactions (in the similar cut-off voltage) [2,20]. A low reversible capacity of around 70 mAh g−1 was also observed for the all-solid-state lithium battery based on LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 cathode and superionic oxysulﬁde glass electrolyte [21]. It is suggested that the low speciﬁc capacity of our sample comes mainly from following factors: ﬁrstly, the ﬁlm electrode has low electronic conductivity because it is conductive agent free; secondly, the Li-ion conductivity of presently used LATSP is in the order of 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature [22], which is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the commonly used liquid electrolytes, and the formation of the inert oxide layer after annealing increases the difﬁculty for Li-ion diffusion across the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface; thirdly, the ﬁlm is poorly crystallized and may exhibited a cation disordering between Li and Ni–Mn layer due to the low-temperature preparation process [23]. Further raising the annealing temperature will improve the crystallization of the ﬁlm, but it also intensiﬁes the interfacial reactions between LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 and LATSP. The electrochemical characterization on the high-temperature (over 400 ◦C) annealed samples showed that it gives rather low speciﬁc capacity and large polarization even at low current.

Fig. 6 shows the rate capability of the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm annealed at 300 ◦C. Note the ﬁlm exhibits poor rate capability due to the limiting factors mentioned above. As seen in Fig. 7, the potential difference between cathodic and anodic peak in the CV plot is about 0.5 V, larger than that of the well-crystallized LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm soaked by the liquid electrolyte [24,25], also suggesting a sluggish electrode kinetics of the all-solid-state battery.

EIS measurement was used to investigate the effect the Liion diffusion kinetics at the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface on the electrochemical performance of the all-solid-state batteries. Fig. 8(a) shows typical Nyquist plots at 3.8 V in the temperature range 50–80 ◦C for the 300 ◦C-annealed LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm. The Nyquist plot is composed of a slightly deformed semicircle in the high-frequency region and a sloping straight line in the low-frequency region. To separate each Li-ion diffusion process through the Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/Au cell, two symmetric cells, Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/Li and Li/PEO18Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/Li, were fabricated. Fig. 9 shows Nyquist plots of the two symmetric cells at 50 ◦C. Note that the resistance of the symmetric cell (for a single interface, only half value is considered) is rather smaller compared with that of the full cell. In addition, after the activation of the full cell by cycling, the interfacial resistances of Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N and PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP in the full cell will be further reduced. Therefore, the above interfacial resistances can be ignored in the full cell. Thus, the semicircle in Fig. 8(a) corresponds to the Li-ion diffusion resistance, Rct, through the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface, and the straight line is related to the Li-ion diffusion in the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 bulk. The temperature dependence of the interfacial diffusion resistance Rct was investigated to understand the Li-ion interfacial diffusion kinetics. As shown in Fig. 8(b), a linear relationship between log(1/Rct) and (1/T) can be observed at each voltage, indicating that the reciprocal diffusion resistance (1/Rct) and the absolute temperature obeys the following Arrhenius equation:= A exp 1 Rct where Ea is the activation energy for Li-ion interfacial diffusion, T is the absolute temperature, R is the gas constant, Rct is the Li-ion interfacial diffusion resistance, and A is the pre-exponential factor. The activation energy, Ea, can be calculated using the above equation and its voltage dependence is shown in Fig. 8(c). Note that the Li-ion diffusion resistance at the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface is over 1000  3) at 3.8 V (50 ◦C), signiﬁcantly higher than that at the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/liquid–electrolyte interface at the same voltage (only 50  3) at room temperature for the freshly cycled cell) [26]. The large charge transfer resistance originates mainly from two factors: the one is the intrinsic low Li-ion conductivity of LATSP, and the other is inert oxide layer formed by the interfacial reactions upon annealing. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the all-solid-state batteries is limited by the large interfacial diffusion resistance. It is interesting to note that the activation energy for Li-ion diffusion through the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface is smaller than those through LiCoO2/LiClO4-PC interface [27]. This may be due to the absence of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which is formed in the case of using the liquid electrolyte, and/or due to the different diffusion mechanism.

Besides the diffusion at the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2/LATSP interface, the Li-ion diffusion in the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 bulk also plays an important role in determining the electrochemical performance of the batteries. Therefore, the Li-ion chemical diffusion coefﬁcients, ˜DLi, in the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms were measured using PITT method. Fig. 10 shows voltage dependence of the ˜DLi values of the 300 ◦Cannealed ﬁlm at 50 ◦C. As seen in the ﬁgure, the ˜DLi values exhibit a continuous decrease with the increasing voltage. This means that the Li-ion extraction from the Li1−xMn0.5Ni0.5O2 host becomes more and more difﬁcult at a high x value, namely, a deep Lideintercalation state. The ˜DLi values of the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlms on LATSP are about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those of the LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 composite electrode (with binder and conductive agent) using the liquid electrolyte [26]. This may be due to the fact that Li-ion diffusion is facilitated by using the porous composite electrode soaked by the liquid electrolyte. Besides, LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm prepared at a low temperature may show a cation disordering between Li and Ni–Mn layer that blocks the passages for Li-ion diffusion. As a result, the low ˜DLi values of LiMn0.5Ni0.5O2 thin ﬁlm also contribute to its poor electrochemical performance.

LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 thin ﬁlms, deposited on LATSP by RF magnetron sputtering, exhibited a (1 0 4) preferred orientation upon annealing. Interfacial reactions between LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 and LATSP begin to occur at a temperature as low as 300 ◦C to form Mn3O4. The formation of inert oxide layer increases the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2/LATSP interfacial resistance, blocking the Li-ion diffusion through the interface. This inert oxide layer together with the intrinsic low Liion conductivity leads to a poor electrochemical performance of the all-solid-state batteries. The Li-ion chemical diffusion coefﬁcients in LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 thin ﬁlm using solid electrolyte are rather smaller than those in LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 composite electrode using liquid electrolyte. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2/Au cells are limited by the above factors. The microstructures of both the thin ﬁlm and its interface with the electrolyte should be optimized for the practical application in the all-solid-state thin-ﬁlm batteries.
