Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attention in the pastdecades, because of high overall abundance of precursors, their even geographicaldistribution, and low cost.
Apart from inherent thermodynamic disadvantages, SIBs have to overcome multiple kinetic problems, such as fastcapacity decay, low rate capacities and low Coulombic efficiencies.
A specialcase is sodium super ion conductor (NASICON)-based electrode materialsas they exhibit – besides pronounced structural stability – exceptionally highion conductivity, rendering them most promising for sodium storage.
Owing to the limiting, comparatively low electronic conductivity, nano-structuringis a prerequisite for achieving satisfactory rate-capability.
In this review, weanalyze advantages and disadvantages of NASICON-type electrode materials and highlight electrode structure design principles for obtaining the desired electrochemical performance.
Moreover, we give an overview of recentapproaches to enhance electrical conductivity and structural stability of cathode and anode materials based on NASICON structure.
We believe that this review provides a pertinent insight into relevant design principles andinspires further research in this respect.
