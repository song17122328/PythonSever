Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attention in the past decades, because of high overall abundance of precursors, their even geographical distribution, and low cost. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), a typical sodium super ion conductor (NASICON)-based electrode material, exhibits pronounced structural stability, exceptionally high ion conductivity, rendering it a most promising electrode for sodium storage. However, the comparatively low electronic conductivity makes the theoretical capacity of NVP cannot be fully accessible even at comparatively low rates, presenting a major drawback for further practical applications, especially when high rate capability is especially important. Thus, many endeavors have been conformed to increase the surface and intrinsic electrical conductivity of NVP by coating the active materials with a conductive carbon layer, downsizing the NVP particles, combining the NVP particle with various carbon materials and ion doping strategy. In this review, to get a better understanding on the sodium storage in NVP, we firstly present 4 distinct crystal structures in the temperature range of − 30°C∼225°C namely α-NVP, β-NVP, β′-NVP and γ-NVP. Moreover, we give an overview of recent approaches to enhance the surface electrical conductivity and intrinsic electrical conductivity of NVP. Finally, some potential applications of NVP such as in all-climate environment and PHEV, EV fields have been prospected.

Energy storage has become key issues concerning our welfare in daily life [1]. Among all kinds of energy storage technologies, battery is a very important and promising energy storage technology [2], [3]. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated over other rechargeable batteries for portable and mobile applications due to their high energy density, high voltage, and environmental friendliness [4]. Now, with LIBs entering the fields of large-scale energy storage devices in particular for grid storage, they face severe bottle-necks owing to limited energy densities, low lithium abundance and relatively high cost [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Compared to LIBs, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are received more and more attention due to their attractive features like more abundant sodium resources, high safety and low cost [5], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The application potential of SIB is indeed expected to be competitive with LIB systems, not so much in terms of thermodynamic, but rather in terms of kinetic criteria [14], [15]. In some cases, Na-ion batteries have even been shown better electrochemical performance than Li-ion batteries [16], [17].

Recently, SIBs have been researched extensively including cathode, anode materials and electrolyte [14], [16], [17], [18], [19]. While, there are only a few possible cathode materials can accommodate sodium ions and allow reversible Na ion insertion/extraction reactions due to the lager radius of Na ion compared to Li ion. Layered type NaxCoO2 [20], NaxMnO2 [21], phosphates-based NaMPO4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn) [21], [22], [23], [24] have been investigated widely. While considering the cost, capacity, cyclability, and rate performance, compounds with NASICON structure might be the most suitable materials compared with the aforementioned materials. Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) has recently been investigated as a potential SIBs cathode with an open NASICON framework wherein the sodium ions could diffuse fast through the interstitial sites reversibly without leading a large volume change of the crystal structure [25]. This feature makes NVP a very promising cathode material for high-performance SIBs. However, similar to Li3V2(PO4)3 [26], [27], NVP has pretty low electronic conductivity; thus the theoretical capacity is not fully accessible even at comparatively low rates [28], presenting a major drawback for further practical applications, especially when high rate capability is especially important (e.g., plug-in hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles). Thus, many endeavours have been conformed to increase the charge carrier transport kinetics in NVP by coating the active materials with a conductive carbon layer [29], [30], [31], downsizing the particles and combining the particle with various carbon materials. These methods are beneficial for improving the surface electrical conductivity, while is not effective for enhancing the intrinsic electrical conductivity. In regard to this, ion doping is employed to modulate the composition and structure of NVP, which has been verified to be effective to affect the physic-chemical properties of Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) and NVP [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60] intrinsically. At present, mainly Na site and V site have been substituted by proper ions doping, by which the crystal structure, intrinsic electricity and electrochemical behaviour can be influenced to a degree.

In this review, we firstly present 4 distinct crystal structures in the temperature range of –30 °C∼225 °C namely α-NVP, β-NVP, β′- NVP and γ-NVP to get a better understanding on the sodium storage in NVP. Moreover, we give an overview of recent approaches to enhance the surface electrical conductivity and intrinsic electrical conductivity of NVP. Finally, some potential applications of NVP such as in all-climate fields and PHEV, EV fields have been prospected. We believe that the review provides a pertinent insight into relevant design principles of NVP and inspires further research in this respect.

The basic constituents of the framework structure for NVP are [VO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra interlinked via corner-sharing, shown in Fig. 1 [61]. The NVP structure is generated with the lattice parameters a = b = 8.728 Å and c = 21.804 Å).

This vanadium-based electrode shows two redox potentials at 3.4 V and 1.6 V characterized by V3+/V4+ and V2+/V3+ valence changes (Fig. 2). As a consequence, this phosphate can be applied as both cathode and anode with relative theoretical capacities of 117 mAh/g and 50 mAh/g, respectively (Fig. 2) [62].

Accordingly, it allows using this phase not only as cathode but also as anode in a symmetric cell depending on the voltage window used. The key cell reactions in the considered symmetric cells can be described as follows:

Typical sodium ion batteries (SIBs), like lithium ion batteries (LIBs), employ the rocking chair principle, and are composed of four components, namely positive electrode, negative electrode, separator and non-aqueous salt containing electrolyte. The typical SIB shown in Fig. 3 uses 1 M NaClO4 containing propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate as the electrolyte. During the charging process, Na+ ions leave the cathode NVP, and are incorporated in the anode while the electrons flows via the external circuit from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. During discharging, the process is reversed. One of the most important advantages of SIBs is reflected on the cost control. The commercial aluminum foil can be applied for both cathode and anode in a SIB, while Cu is necessary on the negative side of LIBs (Al alloys with Li but not with Na). The price of Al foil is a third of the price of copper foil [61], which significantly reduces the overall cost of the SIBs.

Given the above merits, NVP is envisaged to be a promising candidate for high-performance SIBs. Following, 4 distinct crystal structures in the temperature range of –30 °C∼225 °C namely α-NVP, β-NVP, β′-NVP and γ-NVP will be discussed to attain a better understanding on the sodium storage in NVP.

The rhombohedral NVP is characterized by space group  and offers an open framework via NASICON structure. Fig. 4 displays the crystal structure at different orientations of rhombohedra NVP.

Each primitive cell contains six Na3V2(PO4)3 formula units. The structure of Na3V2(PO4)3 can be regarded as each VO6 octahedron corner-sharing with three PO4 tetrahedrons, and the Na+ ion occupying in the M1 (octahedral sites) and M2 (tetrahedral sites) sites of the interstitial sites, where M1 sites are situated between two adjacent [V2(PO4)3] units in the same [V2(PO4)3] ribbon while M2 sites are located between adjacent [V2(PO4)3] ribbons in Fig. 5. It is worth noting that Na+ ions occupy M1 and M2 sites with different occupancy. As illustrated in Fig. 5(b), the [V2(PO4)3] units are aligned along c axis forming [V2(PO4)3] ribbons. The ribbons are connected together by PO4 tetrahedral along a axis to create an open 3D framework structure [63], which offers an enormous space for sodium ions transfer [64].

Four cations (one Na(1) site and three Na(2) sites) could be hosted in the voids/channels per formula unit of [V2(PO4)3] if all the Na sites could be occupied. However, the NVP with a stable oxidation state of V3+ would be more favorable to be prepared compared with the Na4V2(PO4)3 (with an unstable state of V2+), while the V2+ state could be easily achieved by an electrochemical reaction within a controllable voltage range [65].

In the beginning, Delmas et al. prepared the rhombohedra NVP with a space group of  by reacting NaPO3 and V2O3 at 500 °C and 800 °C for 15 h based on the solid-state reaction. The cell parameter is: a = 0.867 nm, c = 2.171 nm. Until 1992, more deep research on the NVP was performed by Gopalakrishnan [66]. In their research, NVP was prepared by reacting Na2CO3, (NH4)H2PO4 and V2O5 in stoichimetric proportion at 600–900 °C in a hydrogen atmosphere for 24 h, after a preliminary heating of the mixture at 300 °C for 12 h. The cell parameters and atomic coordinates were summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, which has been recruited in the data base of Springer Materials.

Meanwhile, Gopalakrishnan successfully deintercalated sodium from NVP by employing Br2 in CHCl3 as oxidizing agent as this reagent is known to deintercalate lithium from LiVO2. Based on this method, one sodium was readily removed to form the Na2V2(PO4)3. Prolonged reaction with Br2 in CHCl3 under reflux yielded a material close to the composition NaV2(PO4)3, but the XRD pattern showed indications of decomposition of the solid. The related atomic coordinates of Na2V2(PO4)3 was shown in Table 2.

Further, Gopalakrishnan employed Cl2 in the same medium in the deintercalation experiments. In a typical reaction, about 1 g of Na2V2(PO4)3 was suspended in 100 mL of CHCl3 in an Erlenmeyer flask fitted with gas-passing provision. Chlorine gas was bubbled through the suspensions (∼10 mL/min) for about 12 h at room temperature. The suspension was stirred during the reaction. The solid after the reaction was recovered by filtration, washed with minimum quantity of CH3CN, and vacuum dried. The oxidation state of vanadium in the solid as determined by redox titration was 4.56 ± 0.02, indicating that sodium has indeed been deintercalated completely from Na2V2(PO4)3, yielding V2(PO4)3, and the chemical reaction can be described below:

The XRD pattern shows that V2(PO4)3 possesses the same structure as the parent Na2V2(PO4)3, albeit with minor changes in the lattice parameters. The powder pattern of V2(PO4)3 is indexable on a hexagonal cell with a = 8.52 (3) Å and c = 22.02 (4) Å, showing that the a axis contracts and the c axis expands on the deintercalation process. Since V2(PO4)3 possesses the NASICON structure wherein the interstitial mobile cation sites are empty, the authors thought that it should be possible to insert chemically other electropositive atoms such as lithium and hydrogen.

In 2001, NVP was prepared by a direct reaction of NaPO3 and V2O3 by Goodenough [67], and subsequently Li2NaV2(PO4)3 was prepared via the ion exchange from the above obtained NVP. The XRD results for Li2NaV2(PO4)3 indicate that the synthesized compound retains the rhombohedral NASICON structure of its precursor, and reveals a substantial contraction of the a parameter and expansion of the c parameter of the rhombohedral NASICON unit cell as Na ion is replaced by Li ion. Based on the analysis, the authors demonstrated that the Na ions of Li2NaV2(PO4)3 showed a tendency to remain localized in the Na(1) site of the rhombohedral NASICON structure. This compound may represent the first empirical evidence of a NASICON compound in which a direct Na(2)-Na(2) conduction pathway is favored over the usual Na(1)-Na(2)-Na(1) mechanism.

In 2012, Lim obtained the crystal structure parameter of NVP by DFT calculation [68]. The result showed that this compound contains two kinds of Na sites, Na1 and Na2. Within these two kinds of sites, total four sites are available for Na assignment such that one Na site is assigned to Na1 and three Na sites are assigned to Na2. And the calculation indicates the most stable sodium ordering of the NVP turns out to be identical to that of Na3Ti2(PO4)3, where among three Na atoms, one occupies the Na1 site (1.0 occupancy) and the other two occupy two of the three Na2 sites (0.67 occupancy). For the situation of fully occupied state of NVP, Na4V2(PO4)3, it is likely to be very difficult to directly synthesize the phase due to the mixed valence state of V3+ and unstable V2+. However, this state can be achieved by electrochemical reduction below 2 V vs. Na/Na+. In addition, the authors performed the thermal analyzes by employing TGA-DSC and in situ XRD at various temperatures, which indicates that NVP has decent thermal stability up to 450 °C even in the desodiated state. The decent thermal stability of NVP is ascribed to the stable P–O bonding.

Jian prepared the NaV2(PO4)3 from the parent Na3V2(PO4)3 by employing the excess strong oxidant NO2BF4 [69]. By the Rietveld-refined X-ray diffraction patterns, the crystal parameters of Na3V2(PO4)3 and NaV2(PO4)3 at room temperature was obtained. For Na3V2(PO4)3, thre are two different occupancies of Na sites: 6b sites (Na1, M1) and 18e sites (Na2, M2). The corresponding occupancy rates are 0.8430 (M1 sites) and 0.7190 (M2 sites), respectively. Numerous vacancies offer the channel of Na ion transport, resulting in classical NASICON structure. The authors also found that the occupancy rate is highly dependent on the temperature. For instance, at 100 K, the corresponding occupancy rates are 1 (M1 sites) and 0.667 (M2 sites), respectively. With the decrease of temperature, the lattice of NVP shrinks a little bit; in that case, Na is possibly more thermodynamically favorable occupying the M1 site which has smaller polyhedral volume than that of M2 site. Therefore, part of Na at M2 site will be driven to adjacent M1 site at a lower temperature until the occupancy at M1 site is 1. For NaV2(PO4)3, the XRD pattern indicates that it is a single phase and well crystallized, remaining the rhombohedral structure with the space group of . In NaV2(PO4)3, Na occupies only one site (M1), whose occupancy rate increases to 0.9448, whereas no Na atom occupies any M2 site.

Combined with Rietveld refined-XRD, ABS-STEM and NMR in Fig. 6, it was confirmed that Na+ ion at the M2 sites in NVP is mobile whereas Na+ ion at the M1 site is immobile, relating to a direct M2 to M2 conduction pathway. Only Na at the M2 sites can be extracted at room temperature, corresponding to about two Na extraction from the NVP structure while its skeleton structure still remains well, which is consistent with the experimental observation of a capacity of 107 mAh/g and excellent cycling performance.

Combined laboratory and synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction with single crystal X-ray diffraction [70], Masquelier et al. reported that in the refined crystal structure, two independent Na+ ions (Na(1) and Na(2)) are located on the 6b (0, 0, 0) (6-fold coordination) and 18e (0.6349, 0, 1/4) (8-fold coordination) Wyckoff sites, respectively. Contrary to the recent reports based on DFT calculation, where the optimized occupancy for Na(1) and Na(2) are respectively 1 and 0.67, the authors found in their research the experimental occupancy factors for Na(1) and Na(2), refined from Rietveld refinement to be 0.75 (3) and 0.70 (4), respectively, which gives rise to 6 × 0.75 + 18 × 0.70 = 17.1 Na per unit-cell, in excellent agreement with the expected chemical formula (Z = 6). Because both Na sites are partially occupied, they are able to participate in the 3D ionic conduction process.

Based on the atomic coordinates and anisotropic temperature factors of the Na sites, it indicates a large mobility perpendicular to the [001] direction for Na(1) (discus shape) and slightly tilted from [001] for Na(2) (cigar shape) as already reported for other NASICON composites (e.g., α-Na3Ti2(PO4)3, NaZr2(PO4)3,α-Na3Fe2(PO4)3). It is reminiscent of the well-known M(2)-M(1)-M(2) path. As is known, VO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are connected by corners forming the ‘lantern units’ along the direction (Fig. 7). Along the [001] direction, above the lantern units, sits the Na(1) cation being surrounded by 6 Na(2) positions forming Na(1) [Na(2)6] octahedral. Sodium cations are thus completely disordered over the two sites [70].

NVP in numerous researches can be indexed in a  space group (in a rhombohedral unit cell) in the framework of NASICON structure. While Masquelier et al. [70], [71], [72] insisted that NVP can be changed to the monoclinic crystal structure with a C2c space group at low temperature.

The XRD pattern of NVP, from which LVP was prepared by the ion exchange, was performed by Masquelier and Nazar in 2000 [72]. The result shows that the majority of the diffraction peaks can be indexed in a C2c space group with a = 1.5124 nm, b = 0.8733 nm, c = 0.8847 nm, β = 124.65°. The high-resolution synchrotron XRD studies show that the diffraction peaks of the monoclinic cell are symmetrically presented. Additional low-intensity diffraction lines can be attributed to Na-ion ordering at room temperature that would give rise to a superstructure similar to but somewhat different from Na3Fe2(PO4)3.

Fig. 8 shows the rietveld refinement from lab X-ray diffraction of the α-NVP measured at − 10 °C [71]. The result indicates that the α-NVP can be indexed in a C2c space group, with a = 1.5112 nm, b = 0.8727 nm, c = 0.8824 nm, β = 124.54°. The authors pointed out that the monoclinic system of α-NVP can be changed to the rhombohedral unit cell () when the temperature is higher than 200 °C.

A simple DSC measurement was employed by Masquelier [70] to study the phase transitions in the temperature range of − 30 °C∼225 °C. The result shows that NVP undergoes three distinct reversible phase transitions (Fig. 9): α→β at 25.8 °C (onset at 21.3°C), β→β′ at 118.6 °C (onset at 108.1 °C) and finally β′→γ at 177.2 °C (onset at 174.4 °C). Upon cooling, variable hysteretic thermal shifts can be observed between the three transitions. In addition, while the α→β and β′→γ phase transitions give rise to sharp thermal effects peaks, the β→β′ thermal peaks are weak and much broader and are even split into two overlapped contributions. The authors pointed out that the γ-NVP presents in a  space group with a rhombohedral system, while the α-NVP hasn't been researched for long time.

Meantime, low temperature XRD test (T = − 10 °C) was measured [70]. The high and low temperature patterns look quite similar except for the presence of a new weak peak at Q = 0.088/nm for the low temperature form. Because of the complexity of the crystal structure, we undertook single crystal diffraction experiments at − 10 °C on the exact same crystal as the one used at high temperature. From the single crystal precession images it is clear that the rhombohedral unit cell () cannot explain all the observed reflections in Fig. 10. All the superstructure peaks were thus successfully indexed in a monoclinic cell (space group C2c) with the following lattice parameters: a = 15.1244 (6) Å, b = 8.7287 (3) Å, c = 21.6143 (8) Å, β = 90.163(2)°, and V/Z = 236.786 (2) Å3. Similar unit cells showing such a monoclinic distortion have already been reported in particular for Na3Ti2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The γ and α unit cell parameters are related by the following transformation matrix:

The volume of this new C-centered super lattice (Z = 12) is twice larger than that of the high temperature rhombohedral form (Z = 6). It contains 31 independent atomic positions: 3 vanadium atoms, 5 phosphorus atoms, 5 sodium atoms, and finally 18 oxygen atoms. All the atoms sit on 8f Wyckoff positions expect for one Na and one P atom which are found on 4a and 4e Wyckoff positions. All thermal factors have been refined anisotropically. Finally, the proposed Na distribution is similar to that proposed for α-Na3Ti2(PO4)3 but for the latter further distortion results in a triclinic description.

While the general frame of the NASICON crystal structure is retained (VO6 octahedral and PO4 tetrahedra forming the ‘lantern units’ along the c direction), the lowering of symmetry implies an increasing number of independent Wyckoff sites. As a consequence, the original Na (1) position of the γ phase is thus split into 2 Na positions, namely Na (1a) (4e) and Na (1b) (8f). Similarly, the Na (2) position of the γ phase is in turn split into 3 positions, labeled Na (2a) to Na (2c) (all 8f positions). The occupancy factors of the Na atoms were freely refined and range from 0.97 to 1.05. For the final refinement, all the Na sites were considered completely filled.

The low temperature structure of NVP (C2c) can thus be considered as an ordered form of the Na-disordered high temperature γ-NVP () (Fig. 11). To compensate this ordering, vacancies are created in the coordination sphere of Na (1a, b) cations forming trans and cis Na(1) [Na(1)4□2] (the square represents the vacancy in the Na site)distorted octahedral respectively similarly to previous reports on α-Na3Ti2(PO4)3. The Na(2)/□ ordering is depicted in Fig. 12 (left) and compared to the γ-NVP (Fig. 12, (right)). Within both structures, Na(2) cations form honeycomb layers in the (ab) plane perpendicular to the c axis. But while in the γ-NVP (because of the disorder) hexagons are centered by a Na(2) cation, in the α-NVP, they are centered by a vacancy leading to the loss of the 3-fold screw axis of the rhombohedral symmetry. It is important to notice that those honeycombs do not represent diffusion paths of Na(2) atoms in the (ab) plane. As it can indeed be seen from Fig. 12, Na(2)-Na(2) interatomic distances are very large (ranging from ca. 4.8 Å to 5.5 Å), and the dash lines connecting two Na atoms are drawn only as a guide for the eye. The stacking of six Na(2)/□ layers is necessary to fulfill the periodicity of the c axis. Each layer is shifted from the previous one by a vector approximately equal to 1/6a; ± 1/6b; 1/6c followed by a rotation of ca. 60° along the c axis.

DSC measurements performed by Masquelier [70] not only show the presence of a low temperature α-phase but also suggest the existence of two other forms of NVP between ca. 30 and 110 °C (labeled β-NVP) and between ca. 125 and 170 °C (labeled β′-NVP). The cell parameters of the β-NVP and β′-NVP were listed in Table 3. This observation had already been reported by Lalere et al. and as well as low intense superstructure peaks. Actually a monoclinic cell was even given to try to index all those extra peaks (a = 15.112 Å, b = 8.723 Å, c = 8.824 Å, β = 124.54°). In order to confirm this monoclinic distortion, the authors combined both high resolution synchrotron powder diffraction and single crystal diffraction. The result shows that the monoclinic distortion upon cooling is obvious. The (211) and (116) reflections of the high temperature rhombohedral cell are clearly split into 2 and 3 reflections respectively at 20 °C. It is also interesting to notice that even with a standard diffract meter, this splitting is visible, especially for the (116) reflection. The monoclinic cell can indeed explain this distortion but cannot index all the tiny superstructure peaks.

Based on the above analysis, the vanadium based NASICON composition NVP undergoes three distinct reversible phase transitions: α→β at 25.8 °C (onset at 21.3 °C), β→β′ at 118.6 °C (onset at 108.1 °C) and finally β′→γ at 177.2 °C (onset at 174.4 °C). Using single crystal, synchrotron powder diffraction but also laboratory powder diffraction, they showed that the rhombohedral high temperature form of γ-NVP undergoes a monoclinic incommensurate modulated cell (β-NVP) or a monoclinic super cell (α-NVP). This enables us to envisage that electrochemical and Na-conduction properties at low temperature may behave differently compared to the high temperature one, although NVP in numerous researches can be indexed in a  space group (in a rhombohedral unit cell) in the framework of NASICON structure.

Nasicon-type NVP has 3D open free crystal structure, and there is a large difference between the V3d EHOMO and O2p EHOMO, leading to the poor electric conductivity of NVP. The low electric conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3, including the surface electrical conductivity and bulk phase (intrinsic) electrical conductivity, adversely affects its overall electrochemical performance, especially at high rates. Considering this, various methods have been utilized to overcome this drawback. To improve the surface electrical conductivity, the Na3V2(PO4)3 particles usually require a small particle size and contacting by an electronically conductive medium to improve the overall transport. As to the conductive medium, carbon materials (such as thin carbon layers, hollow carbon nanospheres, carbon nanotubes, graphene, mesoporous ordered carbon frameworks and interconnected carbon frameworks, etc.) have been shown to be favorable not only in improving the grain conductivity but also in preventing particle agglomeration during long-term cycles at high current densities [29], [62], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78]. On the other hand, metallic ion doping is an effective way to improve the bulk phase (intrinsic) electron conductivity [33], [49], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102]. Additionally, ion doping is effective to modulate the composition and structure of NVP, and subsequently affect the physicochemical properties [32], [38], [104], [105], [106], [107]. Following, some examples of size reduction and carbon coating, combining Na3V2(PO4)3 with various carbon materials and ion doping will be described in detail.

The approaches to enhance the overall electrical conductivity mainly include size reduction and carbon coating of NVP. Size and homogeneity of the carbon coating are not easy to control in the preparation process. The typical preparation of NVP involves a high temperature annealing process, during which the crystal growth occurs. Organic polymers and surfactants are frequently used to control the NVP size; they can reduce the surface tension of solvents and simultaneously serve as carbon sources [79].

Chen et al. compared the electrochemical differences of bulk NVP particles, carbon coated NVP particles (NVP@C) and carbon coated NVP nanoparticles (Nano NVP@C) [80]. Owing to the low electrical conductivity of both bulk NVP and large NVP@C composites, sodiation/desodiation processes only occurred in the outer shells of the big particles, leaving a large inactive volume in the cores of the particles as illustrated in Fig. 13.

Fig. 14 displays 3D carbon coated NVP nanofiber (diameters of 20–80 nm) networks (NVP-F) that are well maintained after annealing at 700 °C as demonstrated by TEM and HRTEM images. A thin well-defined carbon layer with a thickness of ≈ 3 nm formed on the surface of NVP nanofiber networks [75]. The rate capacities of such NVP-F nanofiber networks were found to be superior to that of the NVP microflowers and of dense NVP bulk materials.

Following, a general strategy by Yu and co-workers to optimize transport and minimize side reactions, NVP nanoparticles are homogenously embedded in 1D nanofiber via the electro spinning technique, as shown in Scheme 1 [29]. Citric acid (also serving as size-controlling agent) and polyethylene oxide (as carbon sources) serve as carbon source. The tiny NVP particles with an average diameter of 10 nm, homogenously dispersed in the typical 1D nanofiber, illustrated by the TEM image in Fig. 15(a–d). The 1D NVP-F@C nanofiber material exhibits very good rate capacities even in the current rate of 2 C to 20 C (Fig. 15e). A similar behavior is reported by Hosono et al. using 1D carbon sheaths to confine the small NVP particles via electro spinning [81]. The NVP nanoparticles are in situ formed in the carbon sheath and uniformly dispersed in thin mesoporous carbon layers. They deliver a high capacity of 94 mAh/g and a good cycling performance within 50 cycles.

To minimize the particle size, Kim et al. applied a polyol-mediated method for the synthesis of carbon coated NVP nanoparticles [82]. Such carbon layers prevent particles from growing and aggregating at high temperatures (Fig. 16). Similar attempt has been undertaken by Chen et al. [64]. In this work the surface of NVP crystal was coated by a thin carbon shell of a thickness of 3 nm, resulting in a good cycling performance.

Another attempt to achieve high specific surface area is preparing the NVP by a novel high-temperature melting method [83]. In the synthesis process, a crystallized intermediate precursor with low-cost raw materials is prepared by introducing a high temperature molten-state NH3 thermal-reduction process, which acts as a reaction template to control the crystal growth and morphology of the final product-Na3V2(PO4)3 (X-NVP). The as synthesized X-NVP cathode presents the following features and functions: (a) the interconnected layer in the flower-like structure offers continuous Na ion/electron pathways; (b) the nanoscale laminated structure shorten the lengths of solid-state Na ion diffusion; (c) the hierarchically porous network enables rapid ion transport and buffers the strain during repeated Na+ extraction/insertion to maintain the structural integrity; (d) sufficient carbon coating on the electrode facilitates fast electron transfer within the electrode (Fig. 17a–d). The designed X-NVP cathode is shown to achieve excellent rate capability and decent cycling stability (Fig. 17e).

A low cost organic carbon source of sucrose is adopted to construct an electrically conductive coating on the NVP surface, which confines the NVP grains in nano scale at the same time [84]. The preparation process was outlined in Fig. 18. The designed NASICON structured NVP@C nanocomposite cathode exhibits an excellent wide-temperature performance in terms of high-rate ability and steady capacity output, seen in Fig. 19. The NVP@C can deliver a discharge capacity of ca. 115.3 mAh/g and 85.5 mAh/g for 1 C at 55 °C and − 30 °C, respectively. Obviously, size variation and coating are not only promising but also helpful tools in improving the storage kinetics in wide-temperature-range and high-power battery.

Various carbon materials have been reported as conductive substrates to improve the properties of electrodes. They can provide attractive features such as high surface area, high electrical conductivity, good chemical stability and low cost [85], [86]. Here, we will describe mainly five typical carbon materials that have been used to enhance the electrochemical features of NVP: amorphous carbon, CNT, graphene, mesoporous ordered carbon (CMK-3), and interconnected carbon frameworks.

Amorphous carbon can be obtained from many organic polymers, polysaccharides or surfactants by annealing them in inert atmosphere. Amorphous carbon, derived from vanadyl acetylacetonate, was shown to complete coat NVP nanoparticles [76], and to form the double-carbon embedding structure shown in Fig. 20.

The NVP nanoparticles coated by thin carbon layers exhibit exceptional electrochemical performance. Fig. 21 displays the influences of amorphous carbon, carbon nanotube and graphite on the capacity of NVP nanoparticles according to Mai et al [87]. In all the three cases, NVP nanoparticles are well distributed in the carbon materials. The corresponding electrochemical performance is highest for the NVP/amorphous carbon composite (Fig. 22), which is attributed to its uniform coating.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) consist of a carbon allotrope with excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical property and good thermal stability, and thus a good candidate as current-collecting phase. Commercial multi-walled CNTs were mixed with NVP precursor, and then ball-milled to prepare homogeneous composites [77]. Compared to the carbon coated NVP, the MCNT/NVP@C composites (MCNT, 2 wt%) are well connected by MCNTs, showing a higher capacity of 146.5 mAh/g, and maintaining a high capacity retention ratio of 94.3% even after 50 cycles (Fig. 23). This favorable behavior is mainly due to the addition of MCNT serving as charge transfer mediator.

Graphene is one kind of 2D one-atom thick and sp2-bonded carbon sheet, and has applications in many research fields because of its good thermal stability, superior electronic conductivity, and high specific surface area [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95]. Yan et al. developed a 3D meso‑ and macroporous carbon coated NVP-graphene (NVP@C@rGO) architecture via freezing-dry technique (Fig. 24), in which the carbon shell on NVP was derived from carbonization of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) [88]. The NVP@C@rGO composites exhibited exceptional electrochemical performances, including high capacities (115, 112, 103, 91 and 86 mAh/g at the current rates of 1, 20, 50, 80 and 100 C, respectively) and stable cycling performance after 10,000 cycles at 100 C (ultra-slow capacity fading rate, 0.0045% per cycle) (Fig. 25). The excellent electrochemical performance is intimately connected with the nano crystallinity of the NVP particles, and the combination of highly conductive carbon network consisting of inter-connected graphene layers and thin carbon shells. A similar strategy was applied by Wang et al., using citric acid as chelating agent and carbon source to form a thin carbon layer on the surface of NVP [73]. The carbon coated NVP nanoparticles are homogenously distributed between graphene sheets, remaining well-dispersed during high temperature annealing. The NVP@C-G composites delivered a high capacity of 86.5 mAh/g at 40 C with a capacity retention ratio of 82% after 1500 cycles.

Highly ordered mesoporous carbon materials have been developed in many areas due to the high surface area, uniform porosity, well-interconnected framework and excellent electrical conductivity atrix to encapsulate NVP nanoparticles. Yu and coworkers synthesized carbon-coated NVP nanoparticles, which are embedded in CMK-3 chambers (NVP@C@CMK-3) [74]. In this NVP@C@CMK-3 material, CMK-3 and thin carbon shells on NVP provided fast electron/Na+transfer channels to individual NVP nanoparticles during charge/discharge as shown in Scheme 2.

Interconnected carbon frameworks result in free-standing and binder-free features, and can be prepared via various methods such as electrostatic spray deposition, spray-drying, and filtration-freezing-drying techniques. For example, 3D tri-continuous free-standing NVP/rGO/CNT networks could be prepared by the ESD technique without using binders and current collectors [62]. The high porosity and interconnectivity make the homogenously distributed NVP nanoparticles (Fig. 26) show excellent electrochemical performance. The NVP/rGO/CNT electrode delivered excellent rate capabilities (high capacities of 109 mAh/g and 82 mAh/g at 30 C and 100 C, respectively) and exceptional cycling performances. Ultra-fast charge/ionic transport networks are formed when all the pores are filled with electrolyte. Although there are large differences on preparation techniques for different NVP/carbon materials, all these NVP/carbon composites show improved electrochemical performances compared to the bulk NVP.

The success of ultra-high rate capacities of NVP is very promising for the realization of advanced NVP cathode combining super-capacitor-like rate performance (e.g., less than 60 s to full charge/discharge) and battery-like capacity (e.g., keeping > 60% of theoretical capacity) to meet PHEV and EV applications. All relevant parameters and figures of merits for the discussed NVP cathode materials are listed in Table 4.

The approach of carbon coating or combing NVP with various carbon materials is not able to improve the bulk phase (intrinsic) electron conductivity, while which can be enhanced through metallic ion doping methods [33], [49], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102].

To verify the effectiveness of the Ti-doping on Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), the band structure and the density of states (DOS) of pristine NVPF and Ti-doped NVPF (one-eighth V was doped with Ti) were calculated by using the density functional theory (DFT) method in VASP, and the results are presented in Fig. 27 [103]. Fig. 27(a, b) illustrate the crystal structure model of pristine NVPF and Ti-doped NVPF for the calculation. The pristine NVPF correlates to a band gap of 1.167 eV (Fig. 27c), which is, as expected, consistent with its semiconductor character. After doped with Ti4+ in NVPF, the total density of states (TDOS) around 0 eV in Fig. 27(e) of the Ti-doped NVPF is a comprehensive result of the local density of states (LDOS) of V and Ti (the blue area), resulting in a reduced band gap of 1.049 eV for the Ti-doped NVPF(Fig. 27d). It means that the electron in the Ti-doped NVPF is easier to motivate from the valence band to the conduction band than that in the pristine NVPF, and this is a favorable verification that the ion-doping has improved the intrinsic electron conductivity in bulk NVPF effectively. This conclusion is also applicable for other NASICON type materials, such as NVP.

In addition, ion doping is an effective way to modulate the composition and structure of NVP, and subsequently affect the physicochemical properties. At present, mainly Na site and V site have been substituted by proper metal ions doping, by which the crystal structure, intrinsic electricity and electrochemical behavior can be influenced to a degree [32], [38], [104], [105], [106], [107]. Following, some examples of ions doping on Na site and V site in NVP will be briefly introduced.

Lim et al. [32] introduced the K+ with larger ionic radius into the Na site in NVP. As pillar ions, K ions play an important role in enlarging the Na-ion diffusion pathway and increasing the lattice volume by elongating the c-axis, thereby improving the rate performance. Furthermore, since the incorporated K-ions rarely participate in the electrochemical extraction/insertion reaction, they can stabilize the NVP structure by suppressing significant lattice volume changes or structure distortion, even in a wide range of voltage windows accompanying multiple transitions of V ions and phase distortions (Scheme 3). In the research, the K-ions doping amount plays an important role on the battery performance. By comparison, the K0.09-NVP/C exhibited the best electrochemical performance due to its low charge transfer resistance, high Na-ion diffusivity and excellent structural stability; furthermore, it possessed a high capacity of 110.4 mAh/g, excellent rate capability (a capacity value of 74.0% at 5 C compared to the capacity values at 0.2 C), and stable cycle performance at 1 C with a wide range of voltage windows accompanying multiple transitions of V ions and phase distortions (Fig. 28).

Another example is the Li ions doping and rearrangement mechanism in Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3 [38]. In the research, the cohesion energy and substitution energy of Na3V2(PO4)3 and the compound Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3 doped with Li ion on different Na sites were acquired by DFT calculations, as shown in Table 5. It can be seen that the cohesion energy of Na3V2(PO4)3 with Li ion substituting either the 8-coordinated (ΔEc = − 3.354 eV) or the 6-coordinated Na ion (ΔEc = − 3.816 eV) is lower than that of pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 (ΔEc = − 3.207 eV and − 3.792 eV for Na2 site and Na1 site, respectively) and the Li ion doping on the M2 site of Na3V2(PO4)3 has a lower substitution energy, demonstrating that the structure of Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3 is more stable and Li ions will replace prior the Na ions on the M2 site.

Moreover, an extra specific capacity of the Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3/C (x = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5) samples was observed in electrochemical tests and the reason for this phenomenon was illuminated. Based on a variety of NMR tests, it was found that Li ions in the as-prepared Na3-xLixV2(PO4)3 compound are replaced reversibly by Na ions during the idle state, and more than two Na ions were extracted during the charging-discharging process. This rearrangement of Li/Na ions in the Na site through synthesis and during the idle process may activate the Na ions at the M1 sites of the Li ions doped Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode material to participate in the electrochemical cycles, leading to the final extra specific capacity (Fig. 29). This study illustrates the mechanism in the structure information of alkali metal ions doping Na3V2(PO4)3 with its electrochemical performance, providing a guideline for the design/optimization of metal ions doping and further improving the electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 in SIBs.

Na3V2-xFex(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) samples were prepared by a single sol-gel method in Aragon's group [104]. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed high purity and crystalline phosphates indexed in the  space group. On increasing the iron content, the cell volume increases due to the slightly higher radius of Fe3+. Cyclic voltammetry showed two signals at ca. 3.5 V and 4.0 V, which evidence a linear dependence of potential on the level of substitution. The appearance of the short plateau at ca. 4.0 V is closely related to the higher iron substitution levels. The evaluation of XPS (Fig. 30) and 57Fe Mossbauer spectra (Fig. 31) of charged and discharged electrodes allow ascribing the 4.0 V plateau to capacity values as high as 115 mAh/g for samples with x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and exceptional cyclability.

Meantime, Lalere et al investigated the Na3AlyV2-y(PO4)3 (y = 0.1, 0.25, 0.5) compositions by Al-ions doping in V site [105]. Based on the research, the electrochemical insertion of Na+ into NVP leads to Na4V3+V2+(PO4)3 through a biphasic mechanism at 1.65 V vs. Na+/Na for a limited theoretical capacity of 58.8 mAh/g. After Al-ions doping, the capacities slightly increase with the Al content but the most prominent feature is that the energy of the V3+/V2+ redox couple progressively shifts to higher values, i.e. lower operating voltage, when the Al content increases (1.6 V for Na3V1.5Al0.5(PO4)3 and 1.65 V for NVP). This may be correlated with the observed decrease of the V − O bond length when V is substituted by Al (hence with stronger covalence and as a consequence higher position of the V3+/V2+ redox couple).

The electrochemical extraction of two sodium ions from Na3V2(V3+)(PO4)3 leads to NaV2(V4+)(PO4)3 through a biphasic mechanism at 3.37 V vs. Na+/Na for an overall theoretical gravimetric capacity of 117.6 mAh/g. Within the 2.4–3.8 V voltage window, only the V3+/V4+ redox couple is active so that the charge capacity decreases progressively when the overall content of vanadium decreases (from 117.6 mAh/g for NVP down to 90.6 mAh/g for Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3). Interestingly, contrary to NVP, the extraction of Na+ from Na3Al0.25V1.75(PO4)3 and Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3 occurs through 2 distinct redox steps separated by ∼0.04 V while the ‘average’ V3+/V4+ remains at a value of 3.37 V. These two redox steps are the signature of two biphasic reactions that occur upon charge/discharge for a given strating composition. The extraction of Na+ from Na3Al0.25V1.75(PO4)3 towards Na1.25Al0.25V1.75(PO4)3 generates an intermediate single phase mixed valence (V3+ and V4+) composition of ∼Na2.1Al0.25V1.75(PO4)3 whose lattice parameters vary slightly upon the two-phase domains as witnessed in other systems [106], [107]. If the cutoff voltage upon charge is set to an upper value of 4.2 V, the extraction of Na+ from Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3 first occurs at ∼3.37 V through the oxidation of 1.5 vanadium from V3+ to V4+, i.e. towards the composition Na1.5Al0.5(Al3+)V1.5(V4+)(PO4)3, then followed by the additional extraction of Na+ occurs at ∼3.95 V towards Na1.0Al0.5(3 + )V1.0(V4+)V0.5(V5+)(PO4)3 upon oxidation of 0.5 vanadium from V4+ to V5+ (Fig. 32). Hence, concomitant with the slight increase in gravimetric capacity upon substitution of part of the inactive vanadium by aluminum in Na3AlyV2-y(PO4)3, the Al substitution increases significantly the energy density of NVP-type Nasicon electrodes, from 396.3 Wh/kg for NVP to 424.6 Wh/kg for Na3Al0.5V1.5(PO4)3.

The Na3CrxV2-x(PO4)3 composites by Cr doping in V site was studied by Aragon et al. [47]. According to the research, the volume of the crystal structure was compressed after Cr doping, while as the pillar ions, Cr didn't participate in the electrochemical reactions during charging-discharging process. There is a new voltage plateau occurring at ca. 4 V after Cr doping in NVP through the oxidation of vanadium from V4+ to V5+. Among all the Na3CrxV2-x(PO4)3 samples, the Na3Cr0.1V1.9(PO4)3 has the least polarization and thence relates to highest battery performance with an excellent capacity retention ability of 107 mAh/g at 0.5 C even after 40 cycles.

As can be seen from the listed above examples, ion doping is indeed effective to modulate the composition and structure of NVP, and subsequently affect the crystal structure, intrinsic electricity and electrochemical behavior to a degree.

NASICON-type electrode NVP has impressive features of stable structural framework, high ionic conductivity, and good thermal stability, which can be potentially applied in many fields. Based on the above review, NVP undergoes three distinct reversible phase transitions: α→β at 25.8 °C (onset at 21.3 °C), β→β′ at 118.6 °C (onset at 108.1 °C) and finally β′→γ at 177.2 °C (onset at 174.4 °C). This enables us to envisage that electrochemical and Na-conduction properties at low temperature may behave differently compared to the high temperature one, although NVP in numerous researches can be indexed in a  space group (in a rhombohedral unit cell) in the framework of NASICON structure. It is beneficial for us to get a better understanding the sodium storage mechanism and guide the tergeted design of NVP in different application fields. Meanwhile, some meaningful experiences and enlightenments can be obtained from the performance improvement strategies of NVP for preparing other high performance Nasicon materials. Some new strategy to achieve improved electrochemical performance of NVP can be used with other NASICON materials to resolve a major barrier of the insufficient low-temperature behaviors of rechargeable batteries.

The voltage (3.4 V) of NVP, as the cathode material, is a little low, when assembled it for a full battery, it still has challenges of the power density for the large scale electrical energy storage applications, shown in Fig. 33 [108]. Replacing one (PO4)3− anion from NVP by 3 F−, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is formed crystallizing in the rhomoboderal NASICON structure, but exhibiting the space group P42/mnm. As three fluorine atoms replace one phosphate group, additional interstitial spaces for fast diffusion of sodium ions is formed. Owing to the extreme electronegativity of F, the compound shows higher redox potentials for de-/sodiation, namely 3.9 V and 4.28 V, with a theoretical capacity of 128 mAh/g. It accordingly presents a higher energy density and can be a promising substitute for the NVP cathode material.

Even though, with the availability of the high performance and low cost anode materials for SIBs such as hard carbon, all-climate SIB full cell can be expected in the near future. And the success of ultra-high rate capacities of NVP is very promising for the realization of advanced NVP cathode combining super-capacitor-like rate performance (e.g., less than 60 s to full charge/discharge) and battery-like capacity (e.g., keeping > 60% of theoretical capacity) to meet PHEV and EV applications. Therefore, after solving the major issue of low electrical conductivity of NVP, the merits of the SIB based on the NVP cathode or the derivatives (Na3V2(PO4)2F3 or NaVPO4F, et al.) can be extremely potential to satisfy the targeted requirements of low-cost, wide-temperature-range and high-power battery.

Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP), a typical sodium super ion conductor (NASICON)-based electrode material, exhibits pronounced structural stability, exceptionally high ion conductivity, rendering it a most promising electrode for sodium storage. To overcom the comparatively low electronic conductivity of NVP, many endeavours have been conformed to increase the surface and intrinsic electrical conductivity of NVP by coating the active materials with a conductive carbon layer, downsizing the NVP particles, combining the NVP particle with various carbon materials and ion doping strategy. In this review, we firstly present 4 distinct crystal structures in the temperature range of − 30 °C∼225 °C namely α-NVP, β-NVP, β′-NVP and γ-NVP to get a better understanding on the sodium storage in NVP. Moreover, we give an overview of recent approaches to enhance the surface electrical conductivity and intrinsic electrical conductivity of NVP. Finally, some potential applications of NVP such as in all-climate environment and PHEV, EV fields have been prospected. We believe that the review provides a pertinent insight into relevant design principles of NVP and inspires further research in this respect.
