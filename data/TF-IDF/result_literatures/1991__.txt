Precious metals (Pt, Pd and Au) have been prepared on the solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) by chemical plating and vapor deposition. The characteristics of metal/SPE and the electro-oxidation behavior of sulfur dioxide on the prepared electrodes have been studied in this paper. A linear relationship between the limiting oxidation current and the concentration of SO2 was obtained. The sensitivities of the Pt/SPE, Au/SPE and Pd/SPE sensing electrodes were 2.26, 0.917 and 0.176 mA/(cm2 ppm), respectively, for SO2 concentrations in the range of 25–500 ppm. The effects of gaseous ﬂow rate and the interference on the sensor performance were also studied.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas in the global atmosphere is a major source of acid rain. The major sources of SO2 mainly resulting from the exhaust gases of automobiles and aircraft, as well as combustion of coal and petrochemical fuel in power plants. Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas for human health. In the view of these environment and safety concerns, the development of sulfur dioxide sensor is very important.
Several methods and instruments are available to monitor SO2 levels. The continuous methods for the determination of SO2 in process streams are based on expensive conventionally UV or IR spectroscopy instrumentation in which the gases must be conditioned before analysis. The monitors of SO2 using solid electrolytes such as K2SO4 [1–3], b-Al2O3 [4–7], ZrO2 [8–11] and Nasicon [12–16] by solid-state electrochemistry techniques were demonstrated. All the solid-state sensors need to be operated at high temperature and a reference gas is required. The feasibility of applying surface acoustic wave (SAW) or quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for the detection of subnanogram levels of particles and of SO2 in air was analyzed with respect to mass loading, temperature, and the pressure change [17]. Chemiresistors or transducers coated with phthalocyanine derivatives to detect SO2 were proposed by Barger et al. [18]. 
The selectivity of both methods is poor due to the presence of any vapor in gas stream which changes the resistance of the thin ﬁlm.
Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) was used in a fairly wide variety of organic and inorganic electroactive analyses in both electrolyte-free liquid media and gaseous atmospheres. The most common polymer used in gas sensors is Naﬁon due to its high proton conductivity, high H2O diffusivity, high gas permeability, chemical and electrochemical inertness, and compatibility with processes used for electrode preparation. The gas sensors, such as H2 [19], CO [20–22], CO2 [23], ethanol [24], H2S [25], NH3 [23], O2 [23,26–28], O3 [29], SO2 [30], NO2 [31] and NO [32,33], using modiﬁed SPE as sensing electrodes were reported.
Our previous works [34,35] reported the success in using gas-diffusion electrodes for sensing SO2. However, liquid electrolyte was required for this type sensor. It is interesting to explore the characteristics of this SPE SO2 sensor as well as factors that affect its performance. The characteristics of a developed SO2 sensor, such as the metal, gas ﬂow rate, interference, and response time to the step change of SO2 gas concentration was systematically investigated.
The amperometric response of the sensor using the metal/ SPE electrodes at different gas ﬂow rate was measured at a constant potential of 0.7 V (versus Ag/AgCl), as shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Increasing the gas ﬂow rate from 25 to 400 ml/min, increases the limiting current from 339 to 1100 mA and decreases the response time (90%) from 183 to 7 s for Pt/SPE electrode. The sensitivities by using Au/SPE and Pd/SPE are moderate and poor, respectively.
However, the response time of these three sensors were almost similar.
The performance of SO2 sensor at a constant potential of 0.7 V (versus Ag/AgCl) was not affected by the presence of NO and O2 for these sensors. However, CO and NO2 interference the performance of the SO2 sensor signiﬁcant. It was reported that CO could be oxidized [21–23] and NO2 could be reduced [32] at this potential for metal/SPE sensing electrodes.
Precious metals Pt, Pd and Au were deposited on the SPE by chemical and evaporation deposition. The sensitivities of the prepared Pt/SPE, Au/SPE and Pd/SPE sensing electrodes were 2.26, 0.917 and 0.176 mA/(cm2 ppm), respectively, for SO2 concentrations in the range from 25 to 500 ppm. The response time (90%) of the Pt/SPE, Pd/SPE and Au/SPE sensing electrodes were 40, 48 and 27 s, respectively, when a step change of the SO2 concentrations from 0 to 500 ppm in a 100 ml/min gas ﬂow rate was applied. The performance of the sensor was not affected in the presence of NO and O2.
However, CO and NO2 gas have a signiﬁcant interference on these sensors.
