New NZP-type phosphates of the formula PbM 31M41P3O12 (M31 5 Cr, Fe, and In; M 41 5 Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) were synthesized. The evolution of lattice parameters with radii of M 31 and M41 cations indicates the anomalous behavior of tincontaining compounds. The room temperature structure of PbFeZrP3O12 has been re5ned using powder neutron di4raction data. The compounds were characterized by infrared and electronic spectroscopic methods. Pb0.5Mo2P3O12 with molybdenum present in the reduced state (14) was synthesized. It is found that Pb0.5Mo2P3O12 is structurally related to TlMo2P3O12 and crystallizes in an orthorhombic system with parameters a 5 8.621 A

Open framework phosphates of the general formula AM2P3O12, crystallizing in the NZP (NaZr2P3O12) structure, are important in view of their fast-ion conduction and low thermal expansion behaviour (1, 2). The compounds are also studied for redox insertion and extraction reactions (3}6), for ion-exchange reactions (7), and for the immobilization of radioactive nuclides (8). These characteristic properties are attributed to the unique crystal structure of NZP.

An interesting aspect of the crytal chemistry of the NZP structure is its extraordinary #exibility toward cationic substitutions at di!erent lattice sites leading to numerous chemical compositions. There are also compounds with vacant interstitial sites (e.g., M5‘Ti4‘P3O12) (10). The #exibility of the framework is further demonstrated by the existence of compounds with H‘, the smallest ion, and Cs‘, one of the largest ions at the A site (11, 12). By suitable charge compensating substitutions at the Zr site, compounds with divalent and higher valent ions occupying the type I site can also be synthesized (13}16). Thus, the NZP frame work is ideal for developing a suitable composition that can meet the desired requirements for a speci"c application.

The present work reports on the synthesis of a series of the formula Pb2‘M3‘M4‘P3O12 new compounds of (M3‘"Cr, Fe and In; M4‘"Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) and stabilization of elements with lower oxidation states (Ti3‘ and Mo4‘) in the orthophosphate lattice, e.g., Pb‘2Ti‘3Ti‘4P3O12 and Pb2‘ 2 P3O12. The structural features of the compound PbFeZrP3O12 are determined by the Rietveld pro"le re"nement of the powder neutron di!raction pattern. Since the properties such as thermal expansion and ionic conductivity depend on the nature of the ions present in the vacant sites, it is interesting to synthesize and study this NZP family of compounds with bulky Pb2‘ ion.

The compounds were synthesized by high temperature solid state reaction from high pure PbO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, In2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, SnO2, and NH4H2PO4. Stoichiometric mixtures of the metal oxides and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were heated in air at 3003C for 6 h to eliminate H2O and NH3. The resultant mixture was heated in the powder form at 6003C for 12 h and at 9003C for 24 h with intermittent grindings. The powder samples were pelletized and sintered in the range of temperature from 1050

using Stanton Redcroft (UK) simultaneous thermal analyser STA 781 series in N2 atmosphere in the temperature range 30}8003C using alumina as the reference material at a heating rate of 103 C/min.

The infrared spectra were recorded in the range 1700}400 cm~1 (Perkin Elmer 983) using the KBr disk technique. Di!use re#ectance spectra on select samples were recorded using a Varian Cary 2300 spectrophotometer.

The formation process was monitored for the compound PbFeZrP3O12 by recording XRD patterns at RT of the reactant mixture heated at various temperatures as mentioned above. The elimination of water and ammonia at 3003C left behind a mixture of oxides (PbO, Fe2O3, and ZrO2) and other amorphous phases. Heating at 6003C resulted in the formation of phosphates such as PbP2O6, Pb2P2O7, FePO4, Zr(PO3)4, and a-Zr2P2O9. At 9003C all the lower phosphates decomposed and the formation of PbFeZrP3O12 together with ZrP2O7 was noted. Heating at 11003C eliminated the ZrP2O7 phase and resulted in single phase formation of PbFeZrP3O12.

The compounds were characterized by powder X-ray di!raction (Rich Seifert, Germany, CuKa 1) at room temperature. Potassium chloride was used as an internal standard. The di!raction patterns were indexed by using the LAZY PULVERIX program. The lattice parameters were obtained by LSQ "tting of high angle re#ections. A thermal stability study was done on the mixed valent compound

and Pb0.5Mo2P3O12 were synthesized. All the compounds show good crystallinity. In the preparation of mixed valent titaniumand molybdenum-containing compounds no reduction of Pb2‘ either by Ti metal powder or by Mo metal powder was observed. Depending on the nature of the M3‘ and M4‘ ions the color of the compounds varies from white to black (Table 1).

All phases are stable toward exposure to air and moisture at room temperature. The compounds Pb‘2Ti‘3Ti‘4 P3O12 and Pb0.5Mo2P3O12 are stable under normal conditions. Thermal analysis of Pb‘2Ti‘3Ti‘4P3O12 in N2 atmosphere shows that the compound is stable in the temperature range 30}9003C. However, on heating in air above 5003C, the compound decomposes with consequent decoloration. The formation of TiO2, PbO2, and TiP2O7 was observed on heating the sample at 9003C and this has been con"rmed by XRD.

X-ray di!raction patterns of representative members are given in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows the pattern for Pb0.5Mo2P3O12. All Pb2‘M3‘M4‘P3O12 compounds are isostructural with the alkaline earth analogues (13, 19). On the other hand the XRD pattern of Pb0.5Mo2P3O12 shows

The orthorhombic structure of TlMo2P3O12 is built up of cornershared MoO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra which form tunnels running along the b axis and cages, where the Tl‘ ions are located.

The XRD patterns of Pb2‘M3‘M4‘P3O12 compounds are indexed on the basis of a rhombohedral system with the space group (R31 C). The equivalent hexagonal parameters and the unit cell volumes are given in Table 1. It is noted that the presence of Pb2‘ with a lone pair of 6s2 electrons does not cause any modi"cation on the symmetry of the structure. Similarly the variation in the sizes of the M‘3 and M‘4 ions also has no e!ect on the structural symmetry of these phases. The cell volumes, however, are large in comparison to the alkaline earth analogues. This could be due to the stereochemical activity (20) of the 6s2 lone pair of the Pb2‘ ion. Results obtained from the powder XRD study (Pb2‘M3‘M4‘P3O12) con"rm that crystallize in rhombohedral symmetry, adopting the NZP

The observed, calculated, and di!erence patterns obtained from the "nal re"nement are shown in Fig. 3. The atomic coordinates with standard deviations are given in Table 2. Selected bond distances and bond angles are given in Table 3.

The proposed structure for the compound PbFeZrP3O12 consists of a framework of two nonequivalent MO6 octahedra (M"Fe/Zr) and PO4 tetrahedra sharing their corners. The PO4 tetrahedra are made up of P}O bonds varying in length between 1.519(2) and 1.532(2) A . The O}P}O bond angles range from 107.0(1) to 113.6(2). These bond lengths and bond angles are comparable to the reported values of other related phosphate compounds such as KGe2P3O12 (22), NaTiSnP3O12, (23) and MoAlP2O9 (24).

The coordination around Fe/Zr can be described as distorted octahedra. The average Fe/Zr}O1 bond distance is and the Fe/Zr}O2 bond distance is 2.075(2) A 1.993(3) A . Similar bond lengths are found in other compounds of iron with distorted FeO6 octahedra such as a-Fe2O3 where the distances are 1.91 and 2.06 A (25) and in KBaFe2P3O12 (26) where one of the FeO6 octahedra is distorted and has Fe}O . The Zr}O1 and Zr}O2 bond lengths 1.964 and 2.014 A distances are in the range of zirconium}oxygen bond lengths encountered in NaZr2P3O12 (9), KZr2P3O12 (27), Na5ZrP3O12 (28), and BaZrO3 (29) where zirconium has six-fold coordination.

The Pb2‘ ions located in the type I site are surrounded by six nearest oxygen atoms at a distance 2.650(2) A . The absence of monoclinic distortion also con"rms the occupancy of Pb2‘ ion at the type I site. The octahedral environment of Pb2‘ is highly distorted as in the case of NaO6 octahedra in NaZr2P3O12 with the bond angles 61.4 and 118.6. The Pb}O bond distance is in the range of values reported for other oxides of lead (where Pb is in a #2 oxidation state and has six-fold coordination) such as Pb2O3 (30) and PbSb2O6 (31). In red PbO, lead is surrounded by four oxygen atoms with an interatomic distance ) (32), while in PbTiO3 the average Pb}O distance of 2.30 (A is 2.81 (A ) (12-fold coordination) (33).

In the NZP structure, for a series of compounds with a given ion in the type I site the lattice parameter variation is governed by the size of the metal ion of MO6 octahedra. Figures 4 and 5 show the plots of the hexagonal a and c parameters of Pb2‘M3‘M4‘P3O12 compounds as a function of the ionic radius (34) of the octahedral site M3‘ and M4‘ cations, respectively. For the purpose of comparison, the data for the compounds PbCrTiP3O12 and

The study does not show the existence of a super structure. This implies that substituted M3‘ ions should be statistically distributed over the 12c (Zr-site in NaZr2P3 O12) octahedral site. To illustrate this, structural analysis of a select compound PbFeZrP3O12 was carried out.

The room temperature neutron di!raction data were re"ned by the Rietveld method (21) using the FULLPROF pro"le re"nement program and the peak shape was assumed to be pseudo-Voigt function. The re"nement was performed in the space group R31 C. The structure was modeled by assuming that the title compound is isostructural with NaZr2P3O12. It was assumed that Pb2‘ occupies the Na site (6b), and the Fe/Zr atoms are considered to be statistically distributed over the same crystallographic positions (12c). The P atoms are "xed on the 18e site and the O atoms are uniformly distributed over two equivalent 36 f positions. The atom positions of NaZr2P3O12 were used as the starting model.

In the initial stages of the re"nement the scale factor, the instrumental zero point correction, the background parameters, the unit cell parameters, the FWHM parameters, the overall thermal parameters, and the asymmetry factor were re"ned. After reaching the minimum agreement factors, the structural parameters were re"ned. The "nal agreement factors reached are:

This could be due to the presence of Pb2‘ in the type I site and the polarizing nature of M3‘/M4‘ ions. A shift of about 40 to 60 cm~1 toward higher energy is observed in all tin-containing compounds in comparison to the titanium-, zirconium-, and hafniumcontaining compounds. A similar observation was made in the case of CuSn2(PO4)3 and AgSn2(PO4)3 (41). This could be attributed to the weak O}Sn}O bonds due to the "lled shell (d10) con"guration of Sn4‘ as proposed by Rodrigo et al. (37). This could result in an increase in the covalency of the P}O bond, thereby shifting the frequency of the l 3 band to higher values. As seen from Fig. 5, the unit cell dimensions also show di!erences when Sn, the main group element, is introduced into the lattice. The titanium-containing compounds display more resolved spectra. This indicates the presence of highly distorted TiO6 octahedra. The more polarizing Ti4‘ ion makes the TiO6 octahedron more rigid which in turn reduces the symmetry of the PO4 tetrahedron in comparison to the ions viz., Zr4‘, Hf4‘, and Sn4‘. Apart from the region of the l 4 (symmetric stretching and antisymmetric bending) vibrations occur almost in the same region (&950, 630}643, and 550 cm~1, respectively). The symmetric bending vibrations (l 2) show a shift of 10}15 cm~1 toward a higher energy in all chromium-containing compounds. Hence, the changes in the infrared spectra of all these compounds can be viewed as the
