In this study, Li2O-TiO2-P2O5-x(Fe2O3) (x = 0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 weight part) glass and glassceramicswere synthesized through conventional melt-quenching method and subsequentlyheat treatment.
Glass samples were studied by UV-visible spectroscopy and crystallizedsamples were characterized by differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffractometry and fieldemission scanning electron microscopy.
Besides, electrical properties were examinedaccording to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques.
Experimental optical spectra of the Fe2O3-doped glasses revealed strong UV absorption bandin the range of 330-370 nm, which were attributed to the presence of Fe3+ ions.
The majorcrystalline phase of the fabricated glass-ceramics was LiTi2(PO4)3. However, Li3PO4 was alsoidentified as the minor one.
Considering the impedance spectroscopy studies, ionicconductivity of Fe2O3 containing glasses was higher than that of the base glass.
Additionally, the maximum bulk ionic conductivity of 1.38×10-3 S/cm was achieved as well as activationenergy as low as 0.26 eV at room temperature for x=5.The present work was conducted on the structural and ionic conductivity of phosphate-basedglasses and glass-ceramics bearing different amount of Fe2O3. The introduction of Fe2O3 inglasses opens up the structure and forms better glasses in terms of crystallization and ionicconductivity.
Ultraviolet-visible measurements of the Li2O-TiO2-P2O5-x(Fe2O3) glasses showstrong UV absorption in 330-370 nm, which is attributed to the presence of Fe3+ ions in theglass structure.
The crystallization temperature of Li2O-TiO2-P2O5-x(Fe2O3) glasses wasdecreased from 636 °C to 606 °C by increase of Fe2O3. The conventional melting andsecondary heat treatment techniques led to formation of dense microstructures of NASICONphase.
Fe2O3 favored the ionic conductivity of the optimized glass-ceramics by promotingcrystallization behavior as well as partial substitution in the structure of NASICON phase.
The most bulk and total ionic conductivity of 1.38×10-3 and 3.75×10-7 S/cm, were achieved at25 °C for the glass-ceramic GC5. The activation energy for total ionic conductivity for Fe2O3 -free glass-ceramic was slightly higher than one who contains 5 weight parts Fe2O3, i.e.
