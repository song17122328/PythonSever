The Li-ion fast conductor, Li1-XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 (LATP) compound were synthesized by a sol-gel method. Effects due to the addition of Al3+ into Li1-XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 (x=0.0-0.5) glass-ceramics system have been investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray differential analysis (XRD) and permittivity studies. The crystalline phase of the samples obtained confirming that they had a characteristic of glass-ceramics structure.  Introduction Solid state electrolyte has been thoroughly studied as it is the best option to avoid hazard of leaking due to the usage of liquid electrolyte [1-3]. Since the discovery of high ionic conductivity solids having Nasicon-type structure, AxB2(PO4)3 also known as phosphate network system, countless studies have been done to produce solid conducting electrolytes similar to these compounds [4]. Having a three-dimensional framework structure made out of two BO6 octahedra, B is a tri-, tetraor pentavalent ion, and three PO4 tetrahedra, which shares oxygen atoms forming a conducting channels and two types of interstitial spaces forming [Ti2(PO4)3]rigid skeleton that provides a three dimensional network structure allowing the mobile ion, Li+ to migrate through it [5-11].  Previous researcher showed an obvious x-ray diffraction modification of the diffraction patterns whereby the lithium intercalation in LiTi(PO4)3 suggests strong modification of Li+ ion distributions in the structure [7]. Although many reports stated that solids having such structure gives high conductivity at room temperature [1,12], Mariappan et al. [4] reported that it is not necessary for a Nasicon (Na Super Ionic CONductor) material to have a high conductivity at room temperature. The ionic conductivity, as reported by previous studies, can be improved by the addition of a smaller trivalent cation, Al3+ [7-8,10-14] The partial substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+ in the structure of LiTi2(PO4)3 compound contributes to the increment of ionic conductivity[9-10,14]. Starting from that on, a lot of attention has been done to the studies of Li1+XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 for possible use as electrolyte.  In the present work, we prepare Li1+XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 (x=0.0-0.5) solid electrolyte by sol-gel technique. We also report on the ionic conductivity and x-ray diffraction behaviors of the samples with different values of x. Experimental  Stoichiometrically weight of starting material, Al(NO3)3 (Bendosen) and TiO2 (QReC), LiC2H3O2 (Sigma) as well as NH4H2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in ethanol, with constant stirring at about 60ºC for 24h. The obtained sol was heated in oven at temperature 70ºC to release the volatile batch components. White color powder resulted, were then pressed into pellets at a pressure of 300 psi. The pellets were annealed at 900ºC, where the glass was melted for 2h. Impedance spectroscopy test was carried out for ionic measurement, and XRD to identify the structure of the crystalline form of the samples. The impedance spectroscopy is measured by using a HIOKI 3532-50 Hi-tester which has been interfaced to a computer. The frequency was set to range between 100Hz and 1MHz. Samples were sandwiched between two blocking stainless steel electrodes and were tested at room temperature. The conductivity (σ) was calculated by the relationship between thickness of the sample, t, the effective contact area, A, and the bulk resistance of the sample, Rb; σ = t / Rb A                                           (1) 1870

From the data collected from EIS, the permittivity studies of the prepared sample can be determined [15]. Diffraction data provides information on the crystallinity of the glass ceramic. The increase in broadening of peaks is an indication that the samples have become more amorphous, and less crystalline. It is easier for the ions to move in an amorphous phase compared to in crystalline phase [16]. Phase analysis was performed by XRD using CuKα radiation between 2θ=10º and 90º. Results and Discussion The results of conductivity for the Li1-XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 with different x value is shown in Fig. 1. It can be observed that the ionic conductivity, measured at room temperature (27ºC), is at its highest as x=0.4, with 4.13x10-6 Scm-1 and decreases with further increment. The variation of conductivity can be divided into three regions (I, II and III). Initial increase of conductivity in the first region explains the increasing number of mobile ions in the system. In region II, the ionic conductivity kept on increasing as the ceramic fillers added act as a plasticizer dissociating more salt molecules into ions which contributes to higher ionic conductivity. It can also be observed that the ionic conductivity of the glass ceramic system increases up to two orders of magnitude with the addition of Al3+ trivalent cation.  However, addition of a small amount of fillers, at x=0.5, decreases the conductivity, as shown in region III. This is due to the structure of the system which is becoming crystalline. The dielectric constant, εR explains the increasing of ionic conductivity is due to the increasing number of mobile ions [17]. This fact is supported by the results in Fig. 2, whereby sample with the highest εR is Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 has the highest ionic conductivity. The dielectric loss, εI for this system as shown in Fig. 3, decreases with the increase frequency. This is because the ions tend to build up in the bulk rather than at the interface, at high frequency.  Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 represents the real (MR) and imaginary (MI) parts of electrical modulus for the Li1-XAlXTi2-X(PO4), x=0.0-0.5 system. It can be observed that both MR and MI increase at high frequency.  The existence of the peaks in Fig 5 suggests that the samples are ionic conductors [17]. At low frequency, MR and MI decrease near to zero. The long tail at the low frequency region is due to the large capacitance associated with the electrodes. Both real and imaginary electrical modulus is the reversal of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss. Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of the samples treated at room temperature. Diffraction peaks arising from the LiTi2(PO4)3 type phase were observed in all the samples ranging from x=0.0 to x=0.5. The results indicate that LiTi2(PO4)3 is the major crystalline phase in the samples. Second phase peaks of TiP2O7 can also be observed in all samples. TiP2O7 peaks are expected to arise referring to below Eq. 2, as a result of Li2O loss.  2LiTi2(PO4)3→ 3TiP2O7 +TiO2+ ↑Li2O                              (2)  Diffraction peaks due to AlPO4 began to appear as x ≥ 0.3. The presence of AlPO4 may reduce Li+ motion across the grain boundary and the presence of TiP2O7 may counteract any beneficial effect of other phases on conductivity [18]. In Fig. 6, the most presence of these secondary phases in the samples of x = 0.5 resulting the conductivity decreases. This is in agreement with the conductivity result shown in Fig. 1.

The ionic conductivity obtained at Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 gives optimum conductivity of  4.13x10-6 Scm-1 compared to LiTi(PO4)3, which is 1.03x10-8 Scm-1. The addition of Al3+ into the system increases the ionic conductivity by two percolations. Changes in stoichiometry of Li1+XAlXTi2-X(PO4)3 did not reduce or remove the presence of the other phases, namely TiP2O7 and AlPO4. It is believed that these secondary phases have significant resistance which reduces the ionic conductivity of the final materials. Acknowledgement  M.
