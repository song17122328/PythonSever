The NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 solid electrolytes are attractive candidates as the separator for high energy density aqueous lithium-air batteries and all-solid-state batteries because they are stable in aqueous solutions with a high content of lithium ions. To improve the lithium-ion conductivity of 6.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP), the additions of metal oxides of GeO2, TiO2, and Al2O3 were examined. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for LATP-3 wt% GeO2 sintered at 950 °C. This enhancement is explained by enhancements in both bulk and grain boundary conductivity.

In this decade, lithium rechargeable batteries with high theoretical energy and power densities over conventional lithium-ion batteries have drawn significant attention. Many types of the novel lithium rechargeable batteries, such as non-aqueous lithium-air [1,2], aqueous lithium-air [3], lithium‑sulfur [4], and all-solid-state [5] batteries, have been designed and developed to date. The key challenges of aqueous lithium-air and all-solid-state batteries are to develop a high lithium-ion conducting solid electrolyte. In the last half century, many types of lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes, such as NASICON-type Li1+xAxTi2−x(PO4)3 [6], perovskite-type La2/3−xLixO4 [7], garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [8], and thio-LISICON-type Li10GeP2S12 [5] have been developed. The thio-LISICON type electrolytes exhibit high lithium-ion conductivity of more than 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C. However, the sulfide based solid electrolytes are hydroscopic and are therefore difficult to handle in the open atmosphere. In comparison, NASICON-type solid electrolytes are less sensitive to moisture and can be prepared in the open air [9], and are stable in LiCl saturated aqueous solution [10]. However, the lithium-ion conductivity of the NASICON-type solid electrolytes is less than 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C.

Aono et al. [6] reported the electrical conductivities of the Li1+xMxTi1−x(PO4)3 (M = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, In, La, Sc, and Y) electrolytes and found the highest lithium-ion conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (M = Al and Sc). Since the report by Aono et al., the NASICON-type lithium-ion conducting solid electrolytes have been extensively examined by many researchers with an aim to improve the lithium-ion conductivity and clarify the conduction mechanism. The NASICON-type structure consists of [PO4] tetrahedra connected in a corner sharing arrangement with TiO6. This structure provides two sites for lithium ions, which are partially occupied by lithium ions [11]. The substitution of Al3+ for Ti4+ results in extra lithium ions occupying the lithium-ion sites to achieve charge neutrality. The electrical conductivity of Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 was enhanced by the partial substitution of Ge for Ti and the highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 was achieved [12]. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 were reported to be 3 × 10−3 and 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively [6], and those of Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 were 2.5 × 10−3 and 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively [12]. In addition, Breuer et al. [13] calculated the bulk lithium-ion conductivity of Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 to be 3.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C from low temperature conductivity data. Shang et al. reported the use of cheaper Nb2O5 and the solid-state method to fabricate Li1+x−yAlxNbyTi2−x−y(PO4)3 with a conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 [14]. These data suggest that the lithium-ion conductivity of the NASICON-type solid electrolyte could be increased up to 2–3 × 10−3 S cm−1 if the grain boundary resistance could be reduced. In this sense, Fu [15] reported high lithium-ion conductivity for a glass ceramic containing Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3, which was prepared from a mixture of 14Li2O-9Al2O3-38TiO2-39P2O5, where excess Al2O3 was charged. The lithium-ion conductivity of the glass ceramic was 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Lee et al. [16] measured a lithium-ion conductivity of 9.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3–1.0 wt% Bi2O3, which was comparable with that of 6.1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) sintered at 950 °C. The enhancement of the lithium-ion conductivity in these composite systems could be explained by a decrease in the grain boundary resistance. In this study, we have examined the effect of GeO2, TiO2 and Al2O3 additions to LATP on the bulk and grain boundary lithium-ion conductivity.

NASICON-type LATP was prepared by conventional solid-state reaction reported previously [17]. Corresponding amounts of analytical grade Li2CO3, TiO2, Al2O3, and NH4H2PO4 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) were ball-milled with isopropanol and zirconia balls in a zirconia vessel for 2 h at 400 rpm using a planetary micro mill (Fritsch Pulverisette 7). The mixture was dried in an oven to allow evaporation of the isopropanol before calcination at 600 °C for 4 h. The obtained powder was further ball-milled for another 10 h before calcination at 900 °C for 5 h to obtain LATP powders. Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.018Ti1.582(PO4)3 (LAG0.018TP) was prepared by the same method. A mixture of LATP and the corresponding weight of fine GeO2 powder (Sigma Aldrich) was ball-milled for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous mixture that was then dried in an oven at 80 °C and isostatically pressed into pellets at 150 MPa. The LATP-x wt% GeO2 pellets were sintered on Au sheets at 900 and 950 °C for 7 h. LATP-TiO2 (High Purity Chemical; Japan) and LATP-Al2O3 (Alfa Aesar, UK) composites were sintered at 950 °C for 7 h by the same method.

The phase of the composite was measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90°. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern was conducted using Bruker-attached TOPAS 4.2 software. Sample morphology and elemental distribution were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S4800) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The relative densities of the sintered samples were estimated from the ratio of the densities observed from the weight and volume of the sintered body, and theoretical density calculated from the lattice constants, which were modified by the contents of the impurity phases and their densities. The electrical conductivities of sintered pellets (ca. 7 mm diameter and ca. 0.55 mm thick) with gold sputtered electrodes (ca. 1 μm thick) were measured using an impedance phase analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with a bias voltage of 10 mV. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of the sintered pellets were estimated from complex impedance plots using Zview software.

Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns for LATP-xGeO2 (x = 0–5 wt%) sintered at 950 °C for 7 h. Most diffraction peaks were indexed as the NASICON-type structure (rhombohedral space group RC) and impurity phases of AlPO4, LiTiOPO4 and GeO2 were observed. The absolute phase fractions for these impurity phases were calculated by Rietveld refinement, the results of which are summarized in Table 1.

The GeO2 phase contents in LATP-xGeO2 sintered at 950 °C was increased with x. The change in the GeO2 content with x in LATP-xGeO2 suggests that ca. 0.5 wt% Ge4+ (around 1.8 mol%) was substituted for Al3+ and/or Ti4+ in LATP. The excess GeO2 is distributed over the grain boundaries in LATP as shown by the EDX map of Ge in Fig. 2, where high content of Ge was observed at the grain boundaries. The solubility limit of Ge in Li1.4Ai0.4GexTi1.4−x(PO4)3 was reported to be around x = 0.2 [12], where the samples were prepared from a sol-gel precursor sintered at 900 °C. However, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-GeO2 sintered at 950 °C showed a solubility limit of ca. 0.018. The lower solubility limit may be due to the high sintering temperature. The a-axis lattice parameters of LATP-xGeO2 were slightly decreased, while the c-axis lattice parameter was slightly increased with x. The substitution of Ge (0.67 Å) for Ti4+ (0.745 Å) reduces the lattice constant, whereas substitution for Al3+ (0.74 Å) showed no change. The increase of the c-axis cannot be explained by these substitutions, but this abnormal change of the lattice parameters may be due to the formation of impurity phases.

Fig. 3 shows impedance profiles of LATP-xGeO2 (x = 0–5 wt%) sintered at 950 °C. The impedance profiles have a semicircle, which is attributed to the grain boundary resistance [18]. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance (Rb), and the diameter of the semicircle indicates the grain boundary resistance (Rgb). The bulk and grain boundary resistances were estimated from the series connection of the bulk and grain boundary impedances as shown by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 3.

The estimated total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities are summarized along with the relative densities in Table 2, where the grain boundary conductivities were calculated from the grain boundary resistance and the dimension of the samples. The highest grain boundary conductivity of 3.42 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for LATP-3 wt% GeO2, which is higher than that of 2.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.45Al0.45Ge0.2Ti1.35(PO4)3 [17] and that of 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 [6]. The grain boundary conductivity of LATP-xGeO2 corresponded to the relative density of the sintered bodies; LATP-3 wt% GeO2 with the highest relative density showed the highest grain boundary conductivity. It is not clear why LAGTP-3 wt% GeO2 exhibited the highest grain boundary conductivity, but the impurity phase analysis showed in Table 1 suggests that the impurity phase of GeO2 may play an important role, because the contents of the other impurity phases such as LiTiOPO4 and AlPO4 in LATP-xGeO2 (x = 1, 3 and 5) were almost same. The bulk conductivity of 9.06 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for LATP was increased to 1.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C by the addition of 1 wt% GeO2 to LATP, which is slightly higher than that of 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.05Ti1.55(PO4)3 prepared using a sol-gel precursor sintered at 900 °C [12]. The bulk, grain boundary, and total conductivities of Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.018Ti1.582(PO4)3 (LAGe0.018TP), which was prepared by solid-state reaction as with LATP, are shown in Table 2. The Ge content in the sample is the solubility limit of Ge in LATP-GeO2. The bulk conductivity of LAGe0.018TP is slightly higher than that of LATP-3 wt% GeO2 and grain boundary conductivity of LAGe0.018TP was around one third of that for LATP-3 wt% GeO2. The enhancement of the bulk conductivity of LATP by the addition of GeO2 can be explained by the substitution of Ge4+ for Ti4+. The excess GeO2 at the grain boundaries may enhance lithium-ion diffusion through the grain boundaries. The bulk conductivity of LATP-5 wt% GeO2 was comparable to that of LATP-1 wt% GeO2 because the solubility limit of GeO2 is as low as 0.5 wt% for the samples sintered at 950 °C. The highest total conductivity of 1.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for LATP-3 wt% GeO2 sintered at 950 °C, which is around two times higher than that of LATP and higher than that of 9.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for LATP-1 wt% Bi2O3 prepared using a sol-gel precursor [16].

Fig. 4 shows impedance profiles of LATP-3 wt% TiO2 and LATP-3 wt% Al2O3 sintered at 950 °C, along with that for LATP-3 wt% GeO2 at 25 °C. The total, bulk and grain boundary conductivities and the contents of the impurity phases of these samples are summarized in Table 3.The compositions of the NASICON-type phase were estimated to be Li1.38Al0.38Ti1.62(PO4)3 for LATP, Li1.40Al0.34Ge0.018Ti1.63(PO4)3 for LATP-3wt%GeO2, Li1.26Al0.40Ti1.64(PO4)3 for LATP-3wr% TiO2, and Li1.26Al0.54Ti1.53(PO4)3 for LATP-3 wt% Al2O3 by the impurity phase contents. LATP-3 wt% TiO2 had a slightly higher bulk conductivity than that of LATP, while the grain boundary conductivity was approximately half that of LATP. The TiO2 phase at the grain boundaries in LATP may suppress grain boundary lithium-ion diffusion. The total conductivity of LATP was decreased by the addition of TiO2. LATP-3 wt% Al2O3 exhibited a bulk conductivity of 4.24 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a grain boundary conductivity of 5.35 × 10−4 S cm−1. The bulk conductivity is almost half that of LATP. The low bulk conductivity may be due to a high content of Al3+ in the lattice as observed by Aono et al. [6]. The low grain boundary conductivity is attributed to the blocking lithium-ion diffusion across grain boundaries by the large amount of AlPO4 or LiTiOPO4 [19]. The total conductivity was as low as 4.75 × 10−5 S cm−1, which is around one order of magnitude lower than that of LATP. In comparison, LATP-3 wt% GeO2 had approximately two times higher bulk conductivity and three times higher grain boundary conductivity than LATP.

Fig. 5(a) shows the effect of the sintering temperature for LATP-1 wt% GeO2 at 900 °C, 950 °C, and 1000 °C. The total conductivity of 2.04 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for LATP-1 wt% GeO2 sintered at 900 °C is comparable to that of LATP sintered at 900 °C using a co-precipitation precursor [16]. The grain boundary and bulk conductivities of LATP-1 wt% GeO2 sintered at 900 °C were 3.56 × 10−4 and 4.8 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The grain boundary conductivity is considerably lower than that of LATP-1 wt% GeO2 sintered at 950 °C The low grain boundary conductivity is attributed to the low relative density. The bulk conductivity of LATP-1 wt% GeO2 sintered at 900 °C was lower than that reported previously for LATP prepared from a sol-gel precursor [12]. The bulk conductivity of LATP prepared from a sol-gel precursor at 900 °C was comparable to that of LATP prepared by solid-state reaction at 950 °C. The grain boundary conductivity of LATP-1 wt% GeO2 sintered at 1000 °C was slightly lower than that sintered at 950 °C. The effect of the sintering period was also examined and the impedance profiles for LATP-3 wt% GeO2 sintered at 950 °C as a function of the sintering period were shown in Fig. 5(b). The highest bulk and grain boundary conductivity were observed for the sample sintered for 7 h.

Fig. 6 shows Arrhenius plots of the bulk, and grain boundary lithium-ion conductivities of LATP and LATP-3 wt% GeO2 sintered at 950 °C. The activation energy for lithium-ion conduction was estimated from the Arrhenius equation:(1)where A is a pre-exponential factor, T is the absolute temperature, Ea is the activation energy for conduction, and k is the Boltzmann constant. A is proportional to Nc(1 − c), where N is the number of available lattice sites for lithium ions and c is the fractional occupancy of these sites [20]. The observed activation energies of bulk conductivity for LATP and LATP-3 wt% GeO2 were 0.23 and 0.25 eV, respectively; that for LATP sintered at 950 °C is comparable to that of 0.22 eV for LATP sintered at 900 °C reported previously [12] and lower than that of 0.29 eV for LATP sintered at 800 °C [21]. The activation energy for LATP-3 wt% GeO2 is slightly higher than that of LATP. The activation energies of LATP and LATP-3 wt% GeO2 for the grain boundary conductivity were 0.61 and 0.63 eV, respectively. These are comparable to that of 0.63 eV for LATP sintered at 900 °C reported previously [12] and higher than that of 0.38 eV for LATP sintered at 800 °C [21]. The LATP sintered at 800 °C showed a low grain boundary conductivity of 5.2 × 10−5 S cm−1. The low activation energy and grain boundary conductivity for LATP sintered at 800 °C suggest that the grain boundary phase of the low temperature sintered LATP is different from that of high temperature sintered LATP. The activation energy for bulk conduction in LATP and LATP-3 wt% GeO2 is lower than that of 0.35 eV for the total conductivity of the garnet-type lithium ion conductor Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12, which exhibited a lithium-ion conductivity of 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 [22]. The low activation energy for bulk conduction in LATP and LATP-GeO2 confirms that the crystal structure of NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 [20] is suitable for lithium-ion diffusion.

The lithium-ion conductivity of NASICON type L1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 solid electrolyte was successfully improved by the addition of GeO2 and sintering at 950 °C. The lithium-ion conductivity of 4.90 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for LATP was enhanced to 1.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 by the addition of 3 wt% GeO2. The enhancement in conductivity could be explained by an increase of the bulk and grain boundary conductivities. The addition of Al2O3 to LATP reduced both the bulk and grain boundary conductivities, especially the grain boundary conductivity, which was decreased by one order of magnitude. The addition of TiO2 to LATP resulted in bulk conductivity comparable to that of LATP; however, the grain boundary conductivity was decreased to around one third of that for LATP.
