Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na3V2(PO4)3 has been regarded as one of the most attractive cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, its intrinsically low electronic conductivity leads to poor cyclability and rate capability. Carbon coating is an effective way to solve this problem, especially N-doped carbon. In this work, an organophosphonic acid, amino tris(methylene phosphonic acid) (ATMP), is employed as a multifunctional raw material for constructing N-doped carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3.NaV2(PO4)3 particles are well embedded in an interconnected N-doped carbon, which facilitates fast sodium ion and electron transfer. When used as a cathode material for SIBs, the obtained Na3V2(PO4)3/N-doped carbon composite shows promising sodium storage properties. It delivers high reversible charge/discharge capacities of 101.4/101.6 mA h g-1 at 1 C after 100 cycles. Moreover, it ex-hibits excellent rate capability (charge/discharge capacities of 100.5/100.4 at 5 C), and good long-term cycling stability (capacity retention of 90.1% after 600 cycles at 5 C). This work may provide an effec-tive way for the synthesis of carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 with good sodium storage performance.
With the rapid development of renewable energy, distributed generation and smart grid, it is urgent to develop large-scale energy storage equipment. Among all the rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are well-known for their high energy density, long cycle life and no memory effect, etc [1e3]. However, the low reserves and rising price of lithium resource lead to the high cost of LIBs [4,5]. Therefore, traditional LIBs are difﬁcult to be used for large-scale energy storage. Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) is similar to LIBs in charge/discharge processes. Fortunately, the reserves of sodium resource are much higher than lithium resource, and thus the price of sodium is much lower. Therefore, SIBs are considered to be one of the ideal technologies for the next generation of large-scale energy storage [6e10]. However, because the radius of Na ion (1.06 Å) is larger than that of Li ion (0.76 Å), the diffusion of Na ion in electrode materials is more difﬁcult than that of Li ion [11,12].become the focus of the development and application of SIBs in recent years.NASICON-structured materials are one of the most attractive cathode materials for SIB, because of their stable frameworks, high ionic conductivities and good thermal stabilities [13e17]. Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3 has received extensive attention for its advan-tages of high theoretical speciﬁc capacity (118 mA h g-1) and high plateau voltage (~3.4 V) [13,14,18]. However, because VO6 octahe-drons are slightly distorted, the intrinsic electronic conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 is quite low (1.63 􀀁 10-6 Scm-1), which leads to the poor cycling and rate performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 [19]. To solve this problem, one of the effective ways is carbon coating [20e22]. For example, Yong-Sheng Hu et al. [20] reported for the ﬁrst time that carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibited good reversibility of Na ion insertion/extraction and excellent cyclic stability. N-doping can tune the electronic structure of carbon by introducing “topological defects”, which is beneﬁcial to improving the sodium storage ca-pacity of carbon and enhancing the kinetics of Na ion uptake/release and electron transport [23e25]. Therefore, N-doped carbon has a better effect on boosting the sodium storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 than pure carbon [26e29]. For example, Wonchang Choi et al. [29] prepared a N-doped carbon-wrapped Na3V2(PO4)3 from polydopamine, which showed excellent electrochemical properties, such as high charge/discharge capacities, good long-term cycling stability and excellent rate performance. To date, Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composites are usually synthesized by sol-gel methods, in which several raw materials should be employed, including sodium sources, vanadium sources, phosphates, and carbon sources [21,29,30]. From the point of view of commerciali-zation and large-scale production, so many kinds of raw materials will lead to the dreadful controllability of the synthesis procedure and poor consistency of the obtained materials. Therefore, devel-oping novel ways for effectively constructing Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composites is still a challenge task.Organophosphonic acids are a kind of organic compounds, in which every phosphonic acid functional group (-PO3H2) is directly bonded to a carbon atom. They are always low-cost and environment-friendly, and are usually used as industrial water treatment chemicals for their good ability of chelating metal ions [31-35]. There may be several advantages for employing organo-phosphonic acids as raw materials to prepare Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composites. First, abundant -PO3H2 can provide the phosphate (PO4+) for Na3V2(PO4)3. Second, carbon-containing groups can derive amorphous carbon for in-situ coating through carbonization. Third, uniformly distributed organic linking units can effectively prevent the aggregation and growth of central Na3V2(PO4)3 parti-cles during thermal treatment. Finally, heteroatoms such as N in some organophosphonic acids can generate doped carbon by py-rolysis. However, as far as we know, the synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composites from organophosphonic acids has not yet been reported.Herein, we successfully developed a feasible method for pre-paring Na3V2(PO4)3/N-doped carbon composites by applying an organophosphonic acid (nitrilotrimethylene triphosphonic acid, ATMP, as shown in Fig. 1) as a multifunctional raw material. Well-deﬁned Na3V2(PO4)3 particles are encapsulated in a N-doped car-bon matrix, which enables the fast sodium ion and electron transport. Among all the samples, Na3V2(PO4)3/N-doped carbon composite obtained under 850 °C shows the best sodium storage performance. Its reversible charge/discharge capacities after 100 cycles are as high as 101.4/101.6 mA h g-1 at 1 C (1 C = 118 mA g-1), which are maintained at 100.5/100.4 and 71.1/71.1 mA h g-1 at 5 C and 10 C, respectively. Moreover, it shows attractive long-term cycling performance with a capacity retention of 90.1% after 600 cycles at 5 C. This strategy is expected to facilitate the effective construction of Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composites for large-scale production applications.
In a typical process, 10 mmol NH3VO3 (J&K, 99.7%) and 20 mmol H2C2O4 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 99.5%) were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water at 80 °C under stirring, until a blue transparent solution was obtained. Meanwhile, 15 mmol NaOH (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, 96%) and 5 mmol amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP, MERYER CO.,LTD, 95%) were also dissolved in 20 ml deionized water with stirring to form a colorless transparent solution. These two solu-tions were mixed together, and then kept at 80 °C to evaporate the water under vigorous stirring. After that, the resulting sol was dried in an oven at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained dark blue gel was ground in an agate mortar and pre-heated at 400 °C for 4 h in Ar. After cooling, the gray powder was reground and calcined at 700, 750, 800, 850 and 900 °C for 8 h in Ar. A series of NVP/NC samples were ﬁnally gained. For convenience, they were denoted as NVP/NC-700, NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900, respectively.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra were measured by a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer. Each spectrum was recorded at the average rate of 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm-1 collected from 500 to 4000 cm-1 in reﬂection mode. The XRD patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffrac-tometer using a Cu Ka radiation (l = 1.5418 Å). Raman measure-ments were operated on a DXR spectrometer using a 532 nm laser line on a confocal Raman spectrometer (Thermoﬁsher US). Ther-mogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were obtained by using a STA449F3 analyzer in a temperature range of 25e850 °C in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements were per-formed on a NOVA 3000e instrument at 77 K to characterize the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and porous instincts of samples. Morphological characterization was gained by ﬁeld-emission SEM (JEOL, JSM-7800F) and TEM (JEOL, JSM-2100HR). Elements analysis and mapping images were obtained by using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) connected to the SEM, and the substrate to put the sample for EDS mapping test was Cu mesh. Carbon and nitrogen content was determined by a carbon sulfur analyzer (LECO, CS-230) and an oxygen nitrogen hydrogen analyzer (LECO, ONH-836), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a PHI 5000 VersaProbe.
The sodium storage performance of samples was assessed by using coin-type cells (CR2032). The working electrodes were made from mixing the active materials, conductive agent (Super p) and binder (polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) dissolved in N-Methyl pyr-rolidone (NMP)) together with a mass ration of 8:1:1 to form a slurry. The slurry was pasted on Al current collector with a thick-ness of 150 mm, and then vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 2 h and 110 °C for 10 h. The loading amounts of the active materials were about 1.3e1.6 mg cm-2. The test cells were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glovebox. Sodium metal was used as counter and reference elec-trode. The electrolyte contained NaClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbon (EC)-dimethyl carbonate (DEC) (1:1 w/w) with the addition of 5% ﬂuoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Glass ﬁber was employed as separator. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed on a Neware BTS4000 battery tester with the voltage window of 2.5e3.9 V (vs. Na/Na+). Speciﬁc capacities were all calculated based on the weight of whole composites. Cyclic vol-tammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out on a CorrTest CS2350H electrochemical workstation.
The synthesis of NVP/NC is schematically demonstrated in Fig. 2. Firstly, ATMP is reacted with NaOH to gain ATMPNa3. The reaction is 3NaOH + C3H12NO9P3 = C3H9NO9P3Na3 +3H2O. Meanwhile, VO3- is reduced by H2C2O4 to form VO2+. When the above two solution are mixed and heated at 80 °C, VO2+ is coordinated with ATMP3- [35]. After evaporation to dryness, the precursor including ATMP-VO2 complex and Na ion is obtained. The following two-step calcination results in the generation of core-shell structured NVP/NC.Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of ATMP and precur-sor are shown in Fig. 3a. The peak centered at 1627 cm-1 is attributed to the stretching vibration of CeN. The peaks located at 1390, 2916 and 2964 cm-1 are assigned to -CH2-. Those are observed in both samples. The bands ranging from 1000 to 1300 cm-1 is related to phosphonic acid group, which become very weak in precursor. Meanwhile, the peaks at 3266 and 3451 cm-1 are the stretching vibration of eOH, which cannot be observed in precursor. Thus, it is deduced that VO2+ is coordinated with ATMP3- [35]. XRD patterns of NVP/NC obtained at different sintering tem-perature are demonstrated in Fig. 3b. All the samples are well-crystallized, and show a typical NASICON structure with a space group of R-3c [36]. No characteristic diffraction peaks of crystalline carbon (graphite) are observed, indicating the generation of amorphous carbon in all the samples. Moreover, the intensities of diffraction peaks increase with the raising of sintering temperature, suggesting that temperature is the key factor for the crystallization of Na3V2(PO4)3. Calculated crystallite sizes of NVP/NC samples based on the XRD pattern using the Debye-Scherrer formula are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that the crystallite size increases with the increase of sintering temperature. Raman spectra of NVP/NC samples are illustrated in Fig. 3c. Two distinct peaks are observed at 1356 and 1598 cm-1 in all the samples, which are related to the disorderly carbon induced D band and graphite G band, respec-tively [37,38]. The calculated intensity ratio of D to G (ID/IG) de-creases with the raising of temperature, demonstrating the increase of graphitization degree. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm of NVP/NC-850 is illustrated in Fig. 3d. It can be categorized as a type IV curve with a type-H3 hysteresis loop observed at 0.8-1.0 P/P0, implying a mesoporous feature of NVP/NC-850. The calculated BET speciﬁc surface area is 66.4 m2 g-1. In addition, the related Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution is around 20e40 nm (inset of Fig. 3d). These are favorable for the contact between active material and electrolyte. To better understand the inﬂuence of sintering temperature on the composition NVP/NC, carbon and nitrogen contents are shown in Table 1. It can been seen that both of carbon and nitrogen contents decrease with the increase of sin-tering temperature.
Further comparison of NVP/NC samples is evaluated by SEM, as shown in Fig. 4aee. It can be seen that the agglomeration of NVP/NC becomes more and more serious with the increase of sintering temperature. The detailed morphological characteristics of NVP/NC-850 are obtained by EDS and TEM. Homogeneous distribution of N, C, O, Na, P and V elements is observed in the elemental mapping images of NVP/NC-850 (Fig. 4f). In the TEM image of NVP/NC-850 (Fig. 4g), it can be seen that lots of particles are connected by carbon networks. In the HRTEM image of NVP/NC-850, a core-shell structure is observed, as lattice planes of the (211) crystal face of Na3V2(PO4)3 are observed in the center and amorphous carbon with no lattice fringes are detected in the edge (Fig. 4h). In addition, the thickness of the coated carbon is ~3.6 nm. The ob-tained carbon matrix is obviously derived from the decomposition of the organic phosphonic acid, which not only inhibits the growth and agglomeration of Na3V2(PO4)3 particles, but also enhances the conductivity of NVP/NC. These are beneﬁt for the faster Na ion/electron transfer.The electronic states and elemental composition of NVP/NC-850 are determined by XPS. Fig. 5a shows the P 2p spectra of NVP/NC-850. Two ﬁtted peaks are observed. The peak located at 132.9 eV is attributed to the PeO bonds in Na3V2(PO4)3. The other at 133.7 eV is related to the PeC, indicating that Na3V2(PO4)3 is strongly coupled with N-doped carbon. This is beneﬁcial to the structural stability of NVP/NC-850 during repeated charge/discharge processes. Fig. 5b shows the V 2p spectra of NVP/NC-850. Two peaks are observed at 523.8 and 517.1 eV, which are ascribed to the V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 of V3+ in Na3V2(PO4)3, respectively. The C 1s spectra of NVP/NC-850 are shown in Fig. 5c. There are two ﬁtted peaks. The peak located at and 284.7 eV is attributed to CeC bonds [39]. The other peak at 287.8 eV is related to CeO bonds from air contact. The N 1s spectra of NVP/NC-850 are shown in Fig. 5d. There are three ﬁtted peaks observed at 401.3, 400.8 and 398.6 eV, which are assigned to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N, respectively [23,25,40].
To evaluate the sintering temperature on the sodium storage performance of NVP/NC electrodes, their cycling properties at 1 C are compared in Fig. 6a. Very low charge/discharge capacities are detected in NVP/NC-700 electrode, while poor capacity retention is observed in NVP/NC-900 electrode. The other three samples show stable cycling performance, in which NVP/NC-850 electrode ex-hibits the best. Usually, the electrochemical performance of NVP is related to the crystallinity and particle size. The higher the crys-tallinity is, the better the electrochemical reversibility is. The larger the particle size is, the lower the electrochemical activity is. As the temperature rises, higher crystallinity but larger particle size of NVP/NC would be obtained. Moreover, for NVP/NC, the carbon and nitrogen contents determined by sintering temperature can affect the sodium ion and electron transfer. Thus, sintering temperature is the key factor for the composition, structure and electrochemical performance of NVP/NC. In our wok, the optimum sintering tem-perature is 850 °C. The reversible charge/discharge capacities after 100 cycles are 101.4/101.6 mA h g-1 for NVP/NC-850 electrode, while those values are 79.6/79.8 and 93.4/937 mA h g-1 for NVP/NC-750 and NVP/NC-800 electrodes, respectively. Typical charge/discharge proﬁles of NVP/NC electrodes are illustrated in Fig. 6b. For NVP/NC-700 electrode, no voltage plateau is observed. For NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900 electrodes, obvious charge/discharge plateaus are detected around 3.4 V (vs Na+/Na), which are related to the V3+/V4+ redox couple. However, NVP/NC-850 electrode shows the longest charge/discharge pla-teaus, indicating the highest charge/discharge capacities. From Fig. 6a and b, it is deduced that NVP/NC-700 electrode rarely has electrochemical activity. Thus, further comparisons of electro-chemical performance are made among NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900 electrodes. Fig. 6c shows the CV curves of NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900 electrodes after 100 cycles. The related peak currents, and potential difference between oxidation and reduction peaks are listed in Table 2. It can been seen that all the samples show a pair of redox peaks associated with the reversible Na ion extraction and insertion (Fig. 6c). However, NVP/NC-850 electrode exhibits highest current intensities of oxidation and reduction peaks, as well as lowest po-tential difference between oxidation and reduction peaks (Table 2), suggesting the highest charge/discharge capacities and best reversibility of sodium uptake and release. Fig. 6d shows the impedance spectra of NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900 electrodes at the discharge state of 10th cycle, and inset is simpliﬁed equivalent circuit. All the Nyquist plots are composed of an arc in high frequency region and a line in low frequency region. The arc is usually related to the charge transfer resistance (Rct). The ﬁtted Rct values of NVP/NC-750, NVP/NC-800, NVP/NC-850 and NVP/NC-900 electrodes are 381.3, 326.5, 308.3 and 317.1 U, respectively. Thus, NVP/NC-850 electrode exhibits faster charge transfer than others, which indicates the better re-action kinetic during charge/discharge processes.
According to the above results, NVP/NC-850 electrode exhibits superior sodium storage performance to others. To evaluate the potential application of NVP/NC-850 electrode in high-power LIBs, its rate capability at different current densities from 0.1 to 10 C is shown in Fig. 7a. The reversible discharge/charge capacities at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 5 C are 107.1/106.8, 104.8/104.7, 103.5/103.2, 102.5/ 102.3 and 100.5/100.4, respectively. Even at a high current density of 10 C, the reversible discharge/charge capacities are still as high as 71.1/71.1 mA h g-1. In addition, the discharge/charge capacities are 104.1/104.0 mA h g-1 when the current density is back to 0.1 C, demonstrating the good stability of NVP/NC-850 electrode. Long-term cycling performance of NVP/NC-850 electrode is evaluated at 5 C, as shown in Fig. 7b. An attractive long cycling stability is observed for NVP/NC-850 electrode. The initial discharge capacity is 104.3 mA h g-1. After 600 cycles, the discharge capacities capacity is reduced to 94.0 mA h g-1, along with a capacity retention rate of 90.1%. Moreover, almost 100% coulombic efﬁciencies are obtained during cycling, suggesting the high reversible Na ion uptake/release in NVP/NC-850 electrode.From the above results, the obtained NVP/NC-850 electrode shows attractive sodium storage performance, which are compet-itive as compared with the previous reported NVP/C composites, especially those employed conventional sources (Table 3)[21,41e48]. Thus, the synthesis of NVP/NC from multifunctional organophosphonic acid is a feasible way for practical application.
In summary, N-doped carbon decorated Na3V2(PO4)3 is suc-cessfully synthesized from nitrilotrimethylene triphosphonic acid. Na3V2(PO4)3 particles are conﬁned in a N-doped carbon matrix. Na3V2(PO4)3/N-doped carbon composite obtained under 850 °C shows the superior sodium storage performance to other samples, when it is used as a cathode material for SIBs. High reversible charge/discharge capacities (101.4/101.6 mA h g-1 at 1 C after 100 cycles), good rate capability (charge/discharge capacities of 100.5/ 100.4 at 5 C), and excellent long-term cycling stability (capacity retention of 90.1% after 600 cycles at 5 C) are observed. This effective strategy may offer new insight into the large-scale syn-thesis of Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon composite for practical applications.
