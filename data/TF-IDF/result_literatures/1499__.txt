The subsolidus region of the Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 ternary salt system has been stud 2) ied by X 2)ray phase analysis. The formation of new compounds Ag1 – xMg1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) and AgMg3Al(MoO4)5  has  been  determined.  The  Ag1  –  xMg1  –  xAl1  +  x(MoO4)3  variable 2)composition  phase  is related to the NASICON type structure (space group R c). AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 is isostructural to sodium mag 2) nesium indium molybdate of the same formula unit and crystallizes in triclinic system (space group P , Z = 2) with the following unit cell parameters: a = 9.295(7) Å, b = 17.619(2) Å, c = 6.8570(7) Å, α = 87.420(9)°, β = 101.109(9)°, γ = 91.847(9)°. The compounds Ag1 – xMg1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 and AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 are thermally stable up to 790 and 820°C, respectively. 

The demands of new industries and the advances in a number of new scientific and engineering lines stim 2) ulate  investigations  in  the  field  of  multicomponent systems  and  the  development  and  synthesis  of  new solid 2)phase materials with a designed set of properties. Now a highly important place in the search and cre 2) ation of new complex oxide materials offering promise as  ionic  semiconductors  is  held  by  compounds  that demonstrate  crystallochemical  similarity  to  NASI 2) CON 2)type compounds [1–5].

This work studies phase formation in the subsolidus region of the silver magnesium aluminum molybdate system and determines the X 2)ray diffraction and ther 2) mal characteristics of triple molybdates and the condi 2) tions for their synthesis.

Molybdates Ag2MoO4, MgMoO4, and Al2(MoO4)3 that  were  previously  synthesized  by  the  solid 2)phase method,  including  the  staged  annealing  of  AgNO3 (pure  for  analysis  grade),  MgO  (chemically  pure grade), Al(NO3)3 ⋅ 9H2O (pure for analysis grade) and molybdenum  trioxide  (chemically  pure  grade)  in  a stoichiometric  ratio  at  350–450°С  (Ag2MoO4),  400– 750°С  (MgMoO4),  and  300–700°С  (Al2(MoO4)3) served  as  initial  components.  The  X 2)ray  diffraction and  the  compounds obtained agree satisfactorily with data in [6–8].

Phase  formation  in  the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4– Al2(MoO4)3  system  was  studied  by  the  “intersecting sections”  method  in  the  subsolidus  region.  The MgMoO4–AgAl(MoO4)2  section,  where  intermediate phases were formed, was studied over the entire concen 2) tration region in steps of 5–10 mol % and in the vicinity of new compounds, in steps of 2.0–2.5  mol  %.  While equilibrium was attained, the phase composition was studied by X 2)ray diffraction.

To ascertain a possible homogeneity region in the Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 system, Ag1 – xA1 – x Al1 + x(MoO4)3 samples were prepared in Δx = 0.1 steps within the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 and stepwise annealed in air in  steps  of  50°С  starting  at  300°С  with  intermediate grinding every 20–30 h. The duration of annealing was 50–100  h  at  every  temperature.  The  homogeneity region  boundaries  were  determined  by  X 2)ray  phase analysis of air 2)annealed samples.

X 2)ray diffraction investigations were performed on a Brukeraks D8 Advance automatic powder diffracto 2) meter  (CuKα  irradiation,  graphite  monochromator, maximal angle  2θ = 90°,  0.01°–0.02°  scan  steps,  1  s per point) and an FR 2)552 monochromator chamber (CuKα1  irradiation,  Ge  internal  standard).  Unit  cell parameters  were  determined  on  a  Guinier  G670 HUBER automated diffractometer.

Differential thermal analysis was performed on an MOM  OD 2)103  derivatograph  (heating  rate  was 10 K/min, sample size was 0.3–0.4 g).

The  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4 and  Ag2MoO4– Al2(MoO4)3 systems were studied in [9–12], so we did not additionally consider them.

The Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4  and Ag2MoO4– Al2(MoO4)3  sides  of the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4– Al2(MoO4)3  concentration  triangle  are  characterized by the formation of Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3 and AgAl(MoO4)2 double  molybdates.  Silver  magnesium  molybdate Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3  belongs  to  the  Na2Mg5(MoO4)6 structural family, at 500–530°С undergoes a reversible polymorphic transformation, and melts incongruently at  740°С.  The  homogeneity  region  expands  towards MgMoO4 to reach 2.0–2.5 mol % at 500°С [9]. Dou 2) ble molybdate AgAl(MoO4)2 crystallizes in monoclinic system (NaFe(MoO4)2 structural type), does not have an appreciable homogeneity region and melts incon 2) gruently [10–12]. In view of the nonexistence of con 2) gruent  compounds  in  the  Ag2MoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 system  [11],  we  confine  the  ternary  salt  system investigation  to  the  MgMoO4–Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3– AgAl(MoO4)2–Al2(MoO4)3 region.

We have not detected any phases on the MgMoO4– Al2(MoO4)3 edge under our experimental conditions. The  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3  and  AgAl(MoO4)2  double molybdates necessary for studying phase formation in the  Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3  system,  have been synthesized by the solid 2)phase method from the relevant neutral molybdates as described in [9–11].

To  investigate  interactions  in  the  Ag2MoO4– MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4) system, we prepared a mixture of neutral and double molybdates in the stoichiomet 2) ric ratio, including the compositions of the intersec 2) tion points for all sections existing in the system. The results  for  the  phase  composition  of  the  intersection points  and  points  located  inside  the  Ag2MoO4– MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)  triangle  showed  that,  in  the solid  phase  at  500°С,  two 2)phase  sections  are MgMoO4–AgMg3Al(MoO4)5,  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3– AgMg3Al(MoO4)5,  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3–AgAl(MoO4)2, AgMg3Al(MoO4)5–Ag1 – xMg1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4),  Ag2Mg2(MoO4)3–Ag1–xMg1–xAl1+x(MoO4)3, Ag1Ag1  –  xMg1  –  xAl1  +  x(MoO4)3–AgAl(MoO4)2, Ag1 ⎯ x  Mg1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3–Al2(MoO4)3,  and AgMg3Al (MoO4)5–Al2(MoO4)3 (figure).

According to the X 2)ray powder diffraction data, the AgMgAl(MoO4)3 and AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 triple molyb 2) dates synthesized do not have an appreciable homoge 2) neity  region  along  the  AgAl(MoO4)2–MgMoO4  sec 2) tion. An Ag1 – xMg1 – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 variable 2)composi 2) tion  phase  is  formed  along  the  AgMgAl(MoO4)3– Al2(MoO4)3 section and represents an AgMgAl(MoO4)3 2) based  solid  solution,  whose  single 2)phase  extent reaches x = 0.4. Al2(MoO4)3 weak reflections appear in X 2)ray diffraction patterns at a higher concentration of aluminum cations.

X 2)ray  powder  diffraction showed  that the Ag1 ⎯ xMg1  – xAl1 + x(MoO4)3 compounds are isostruc 2) tural to sodium zinc scandium molybdate [13] with a rhombohedral  lattice  (space  group  R c, Z  =  6)  as  to reflection positions and intensity ratios. The homoge 2) neity extent was estimated from the change of lattice parameters  for  the  samples  annealed  at  500°С  and higher temperatures (Tables 1).

AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 is isostructural to NaMg3In(MoO4)5,  which  has  been  synthesized  by  us earlier  [14]  and  indexed  in  triclinic  system  (space group  , Z = 2) with the following unit cell parame 2) ters: a = 9.295(7) Å, b = 17.619(2) Å, c = 6.8570(7) Å,α = 87.420(9)°, β = 101.109(9)°, γ = 91.847(9)°, V =820.42 Å3, ρcalc = 4.078 g/cm3 (Table 2).

AgMgAl(MoO4)3 was found to melt incongruently at 790°С, and AgMg3Al(MoO4)5 is thermally stable up to  820°С;  polymorphous  transformations  do  not occur.

In summary, the phase formation was studied in the Ag2MoO4–MgMoO4–Al2(MoO4)3 system for the first time.  New  triple  molybdates  AgMg3Al(MoO4)5  and AgMgAl(MoO4)3 were synthesized, and the region of AgMgAl(MoO4)3 2)based solid solutions was discovered. Crystallographic  and  thermal  characteristics  were determined for the compounds obtained. It has been established  compounds  Ag1 – xMg1 – x Al1 + x(MoO4)3  are  of  the  NASICON  structural  type (space  group  R c),  which  suggests  a  high  ionic  con 2) ductivity.
