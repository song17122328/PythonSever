The crystal structures of orthorhombic Li2TiFe(PO4)3 and Li2TiCr(PO4)3 were determined from Rietveld reﬁnement of neutron powder diffraction data. Both compounds are isostructural in the P bna space group with a = 8.543(1) Å, b = 8.623(1) Å, c = 11.978(1) Å and a = 8.505(1) Å, b = 8.589(1) Å, c = 11.929(1) Å, respectively. Lithium ions are located in a single four-fold coordinated site Li(1). Electrochemical insertion of lithium proceeds through the reduction of Fe3+ /Li) towards the new compositions Li3TiCr(PO4)3 and Li4TiFe(PO4)3. In situ X-ray diffraction and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique indicate a solid solution mechanism for the reversible lithium insertion/extraction. Chemical reaction of Li2TiFe(PO4)3 with n-BuLi leads to orthorhombic Li4TiFe(PO4)3.
Compositions of general formula ZxMM (XO4)3 (Z = a 3d element, X = P, As, S, Si, . . . ) Li, Na; M & M may adopt two distinct crystallographic forms, denoted “A” (Sc2(WO4)3-type) and “B” (NASICON-type), which differ (XO4)3] “lantern units” are connected. in the way the [MM  3) Depending on both the stable oxidation number of M or  3) , for instance) and on M the chemical nature of X (X = Si, P, S, W, Mo) and Z + , a wide variety of compositions may be prepared for 0  1) x  1) 4: Fe2(SO4)3, NbTi(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, Li2FeTi(PO4)3, Na3Fe2(PO4)3, Na4Zr2(SiO4)3, etc. Electrochemical insertion or extraction of lithium or sodium into/from these compositions lead to an even greater variety of materials, with unusual oxidation states and alkali ion distributions within the interstitial space (0  1) x  1) 5). Recent progresses have been communicated recently on how to make them work efﬁciently at high current densities through “smart” conductive carbon coating at the surface of the particles [11–14].
A comparative electrochemical study for the A and B forms of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was recently communicated [10, 15]. Detailed structural descriptions are given in [16–18].
LiTi2(PO4)3 adopts the B form only, which corresponds to the well-known NASICON structure inside which the Li ions are located in the six-fold coordinated site that is labeled M1 [19]. The lithium insertion in NASICON Li1+xTi2(PO4)3 was ﬁrstly investigated by Delmas et al. in the late 80’s [20–22] and more recently through contributions from the same group [23,24] and from us [25]. In between the well-known LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 compositions, the mixed Ti/Fe phosphate Li2TiFe(PO4)3 (TiIV, FeIII) has been the object of only limited work so far, besides the ﬁrst tentative of structural determination of orthorhombic A-Li2FeTi(PO4)3 by Catti [26] and preliminary electrochemical investigations on NASICON B-Li2+xFeTi(PO4)3 by Goodenough’s group [5,27]. 
There was room then for detailed structural and electrochemical investigations of these systems that offer the possibility of understanding the rel(PO4)3] framework depending ative stabilities of the [MM on the nature of the 3d element and on the value of x in ZxMM (PO4)3 [28]. Our structural and electrochemical investigations of the NASICON forms B-Li2TiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr) were recently published [29]. In this paper, we ﬁrst present the crystal structures of both A-Li2TiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr) solved by Rietveld reﬁnement of neutron diffraction data and then their lithium insertion properties, investigated through slow electrochemical titration (GITT, PITT) and in situ X-ray diffraction. A fully lithiated A-Li4TiFe(PO4)3 composition was prepared by chemical reduction, and is compared with that of the in situ experiment.
A-Li2TiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr) were prepared by high temperature solid state reaction, starting from the respective oxides (TiO2, Fe2O3 and Cr2O3), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and lithium dihydrogen phosphate in stoichiometric proportions. Pure powders were obtained, after several intermediate thermal treatments and grindings, by prolonged ﬁnal treatment at 1203 K. Phase purities and lattice parameter determinations were carefully monitored by X-ray diffraction on either a Philips PW1710 diffractometer (CuKα radiation, θ –2θ geometry, back monochromator) or a D8 Bruker diffractometer (Co-Kα radiation, θ –θ geometry, back monochromator).

Electrochemical lithium insertion was undertaken in standard SwagelokTM cell conﬁgurations with a lithium foil as the negative electrode and the active materials (AM) as the positive electrode. The separator used was a Whatman GF/D borosilicate glass ﬁbre sheet saturated with a 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte solution in EC:DMC (1:1 in weight). For optimal electrochemical activity, A-Li2TiM(PO4)3 powders were initially mixed with Super P carbon (MMM Carbon, Belgium) by ball-milling in a SPEX 8000 mixer that generates energetic shocks between powder particles (250 mg of AM + 50 mg of carbon, stainless steel ball of 5 g, 30 min). A “Mac-Pile” automatic cycling/data recording system (Biologic SA, Claix, France) operating either in galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) or in potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) was used for data collecting. Standard electrode investigation was conducted at a galvanostatic regime of C/10. 
GITT measurements consisted in 30 min charges or discharges at C/20 rate with open circuit periods of 30 min. PITT measurements were conducted using potential steps of 10 mV limited by a minimum current (imin ≈ 3.5 µA) equivalent to a C/300 regime. For in situ X-ray diffraction, GITT charge and discharge were conducted at a C/10 regime, interrupted every hour by relax periods during which each pattern was recorded.
Tural compounds have been reported such as β and β LiZr2(PO4)3 [34], Li2Fe2(MoO4)3 [35], Li2.72Ti2(PO4)3 [36], Li3In2(PO4)3 [37] and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [16,17], etc.). In the “A” form, the [MM (XO4)3] lantern units are oriented along almost perpendicular directions ([012] and [01−2]) within the (b, c) plane of the P bna space group (Fig. 2). A-form unit-cells are indexed either in an orthorhombic (P bna, #60 or P bca, #61) or in a monoclinic (P 21/n, #14) space group, depending on the ordering or not of lithium in the structure. Note that the presence of six different settings for each space group, added to 3 possible cell choices (for space group #14) explains the large diversity of space groups (extended Hermann–Mauguin symbols) and combinations of cell parameters used by the different authors to describe such materials.
The structure of γ -Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [16] was used as a starting model for the Rietveld reﬁnement of A-Li2TiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr). From full pattern matching reﬁnements of A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3 and A-Li2TiCr(PO4)3, we determined that the crystal system is orthorhombic with two possible space groups, as we did not observe any monoclinic distortion at room temperature. To conﬁrm the presence of a single orthorhombic variety, both differential scanning calorimetry and differential thermal analysis were performed but did not reveal any phase transition in the temperature range 300– 700 K.
Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the two compounds. The possible Bragg positions corresponding to the P bna (a = 8.54 Å, b = 8.62 Å and c = 11.98 Å) or P bca (a = 8.54 Å, b = 8.62 Å and c = 23.95 Å) space group descriptions are also indicated. The c cell parameter must be doubled in the case of the P bca description in order to reﬁne satisfactorily all the diffraction peaks. However, contrary to the work of Catti [26] on A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3, we did not observe any superlattice Bragg peak characteristic of ordering between Fe and Ti along c. This might be due to the temperature of our synthesis, 160 degrees lower than that of Catti’s, a few degrees below the melting point. We attempted as well to reﬁne the structure of A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3, either from X-ray or neutron diffraction data, by using the atomic fractional coordinates published by Catti (half of the Li positions non-reﬁned), without any satisfactory result.
The Rietveld reﬁnements (Fig. 3) of the neutron powder diffraction patterns converged rapidly to satisfactory agreement factors and to thermal parameters with reasonable values. The reﬁnements were performed in the P bna space group with a = 8.543(1) Å, b = 8.623(1) Å, c = 11.978(1) Å and a = 8.505(1) Å, b = 8.589(1) Å, c = 11.929(1) Å for A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3 and A-Li2TiCr(PO4)3, respectively (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the cells contains 3 PO4 tetrahedra (2∗ P(1)O4 + 1∗ P(2)O4) and 2 MO6 octahedra (M = Ti, Cr/Fe), into which the atoms of Ti and Fe (similarly for Ti and Cr) are disordered. The atomic coordinates (Z = 4) are reported in Table 2 for A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3 and Table 3 for A-Li2TiCr(PO4)3.
In a ﬁrst attempt, the two lithium ions were reﬁned into the three crystallographic sites (Li(1), Li(2) and Li(3)) described previously for γ -A-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [16]. The occupancy factors obtained for Li(2) and Li(3) were close to 0 and negative, respectively, and their isotropic thermal displacements gave unreasonable values. Moreover, the distances, angles, bond-strengths and polyhedra distortions found in this case were unrealistic. We decided then to reﬁne separately each of these sites and found out that only the Li(1) site (8d) was occupied, fully, as for Li2Fe2(MoO4)3 [35]. The lithium ions occupy then a single four-fold coordinated site, forming Li–O–M–O–Li–O inﬁnite chains along [010] of edge-sharing LiO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra. The reﬁnement thus obtained conducted to very good factors of reliability (Table 1). All the thermal displacement factors are given as isotropic ones, in particular for the Li(1) site, as anisotropic reﬁnements did not lead to any improvement of the structure.
For A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3, the atomic coordinates of Ti and Fe, and their Beq were constrained to be equal. For A-Li2TiCr(PO4)3, we could not reﬁne simultaneously the atomic coordinates of Ti and Cr as their scattering lengths are almost equal, but with opposite signs (bTi = −0.34 and bCr = +0.26). To overpass this problem, we reﬁned the atomic coordinates of Cr and Ti one to one until their values became very close (equal at 3 signiﬁcant numbers), after which they were constrained to be equal. The isotropic thermal displacements were then ﬁxed to usual values for such a kind of structure. Table 4 presents selected bond lengths with the standard deviations in parentheses for both A-Li2TiFe(PO4)3 and A-Li2TiCr(PO4)3. 
As mentioned above, the correctness of the structure was conﬁrmed by bond-valence calculations from the Zachariasen formula (Vi =  1) j exp{(r0 − rij )/0.37}), using the parameters r0, characterizing a cation–anion pair [38]. The distortion parameters ∆ of a coordination polyhedron MON with an average M–O distance  5)r 6), which is deﬁned as ∆ = (1/N ) {(rn− 5)r 6))/ 5)r 6)}2, are also indicated in Table 4.
As chromium is inactive, the GITT data of Li2+xTiCr(PO4)3 locates the reduction of Ti4+ at values comprised in between 2.60 and 2.25 V. Accurate examination of this data reveals the presence of two distinct “S-type shape” curves which are separated by an inﬂection point at x ∼ 0.5. This is more obviously seen in the −∂x/∂V vs. potential plot in the insert of Fig. 4. Two distinct redox values were found at ∼ 2.50 (0  1) x  1) 0.5) and ∼ 2.35 (0.5  1) x  1) 1). The existence of these two distinct potentials might be the consequence of the progressive ﬁlling of two vacant lithium sites Li(2) and Li(3) towards a probable similar distribution as in the γ form of A-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 [16,18]: Li(1) fully occupied, Li(2) and Li(3) occupied at 1/4th in the new composition Li3TiCr(PO4)3. 
In the case of A-Li2+xTiFe(PO4)3, at least two signals, (∼ 2.8 V vs. corresponding to the redox couples Fe3+/2+ /Li, 0  1) x  1) 1) and Ti4+/3+ + /Li, 1  1) Li x  1) 2), were separated in agreement with usual values reported in the literature [40].
The solid solution lithium insertion/extraction mechanism is further supported by the in situ X-ray diffraction data of Fig. 6 collected during lithium insertion all along 0  1) x  1) 2 for Li2+xTiFe(PO4)3. Continuous shifts (with a small slope change around x = 1 though) of the diffraction peaks towards smaller values of 2θ are observed, which, after full pattern reﬁnements in the P bna space group, translates into global unit cell volume variations V /V of +1.81% for Li2+xTiCr(PO4)3 and of +2.76% for Li2+xTiFe(PO4)3 (Fig. 7) when Ti4+ are reduced to Ti3+ . We conﬁrmed the crystallographic features of the fully lithiated phase Li4TiFe(PO4)3 by preparing this composition from a classical chemical lithiation reaction involving n-BuLi as the reducing agent in hexane solution. After immersion for 7 days under magnetic stirring, the powder was washed 4 times, dried under vacuum for several hours and kept in an argon-ﬁlled dry box. 
The resulting powder was placed within the in situ cell for XRD data collection (Fig. 8). The reﬁned lattice parameters agree very satisfactorily with those deduced from the in situ experiment at the following values: a = 8.523(6) Å, b = 8.728(6) Å and c = 12.177(9) Å in the P bna space group.
