The sodium excess strategy was applied to NASICON-type compound to form Na3+xM3+2−xM2+x(PO4)3, towards a new familyof sodium-ion battery cathode materials with increased reversible capacity.

Here we chose M3+ = V3+ and M2+ = Fe2+ andsuccessfully synthesized sodium enriched mixed valence compounds up to x = 0.5, i.e., Na3.5V3+1.5Fe2+0.5(PO4)3.It showsreversible Na+ (de)intercalation centred at 3.4 V vs.

Na/Na+, involving the Fe3+/Fe2+, V4+/V3+ and V5+/V4+ redox couples,demonstrating that the excess sodium contributes to the electrode reaction.

Goodenough’s discovery of the electrochemical properties ofLiCoO2 in 19801 triggered worldwide researches on lithium-ion batteries.

The following commercialization of the first Li-ion battery in1991 put aside researches on Na-ion batteries using similar chemistrybut with heavier and larger sodium ion, because they are supposed tobe unable to compete with the high energy density of Li-ion batteries.

Nowadays, the growing energy production from renewable energysources poses a new challenge as their intermittent nature must befaced, and setting up power grids to regulate the energy production isthe most promising idea.

In these systems, secondary batteries wouldstock the excessively produced energy to deliver it when needed.

However, batteries to equip such systems must fulfil new requirementsincluding a long life cycle, low cost, and environmental friendliness.

While the Li-ion technology is suffering from high manufacturingcosts and limited lithium resources, the Na-ion technology regained alot of interest in the 2000 s as it poses as a promising candidate, nowthat its low energy density is not always a limiting factor.

Among the various systems studied as positive electrode materials, the NASICON (NaxMM(XO4)3) type compounds are extensivelystudied.

Their inherent chemical tunability can accommodate varioustransition metal (M,M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe,. . .) and XO4n− polyanions(X = Si, P, S, Mo, Si,. . . ).

In the NaxMM(XO4)3 system, the star candidate is Na3V2(PO4)32 which exhibits promising electrochemical properties such as high operating voltage and good cyclability.

However,it is quite recently that the substitution in the Na3V3+2−xM3+x(PO4)3system (M3+ = Fe7, Al8,9) was explored, where the partial metal substitution by the isovalent Fe3+ or Al3+ was motivated by the lowercost and environmental friendliness of the substitution elements.

In this work, we applied aliovalent doping to V sites to formsodium rich compounds Na3+xV3+2−xFe2+x(PO4)3, targeting muchhigher reversible capacity by using excess amount of Na+ and e−introduced in the pristine Na3V3+2(PO4)3.New mixed-valent compounds Na3+xV3+2−xFe2+x(PO4)3 (0 ≤x ≤ 0.5) were successfully obtained for the first time by solidstate synthesis, demonstrating that the sodium excess strategy canbe applied to NASICON type systems.

 The material at x = 0.5,Na3.5V3+1.5Fe2+0.5(PO4)3, shows reversible capacity of ≈ 90 mAhg−1with good capacity retention.

The structural and redox behaviors areclosely related each other, where the successive sodium compositional domains (monophasic-biphasic-monophasic) are separated bythe active redox process (Fe3+/Fe2+, V4+/V3+ and V5+/V4+, respectively).

The Na excess strategy demonstrated in this work can beextended to other NASICON compounds with general chemical formula, A3+xM3+2−xM2+x(PO4)3, which may facilitates to design betterfunctional materials.
