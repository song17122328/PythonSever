High lithium ion conductivity solid electrolytes of Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.5) and Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) with the NASICON-type structure were synthesized using a precursor prepared by the sol–gel method. The highest total electrical conductivity of 3.55 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was obtained for x = 0.4 in Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 (LACTP) sintered at 1120 °C for 6 h in air. Higher electrical conductivity was observed by the partial substitution of Cr3+ with Al3+. The highest total electrical conductivity of 1.06 × 10−3 S cm−1 and bulk conductivity of 1.77 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C were obtained for x = 0.3 in Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 sintered at 1070 °C for 6 h in air. The contribution of electronic conductivity to the total conductivity was negligibly small. Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 was unstable in water, but stable in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution.


High lithium ion conductivity solid electrolytes are attractive for nonﬂammable all-solid-state batteries [1,2] and have potential application as a separator for the water-stable lithium electrode of lithium–air rechargeable batteries [3]. Lithium–air batteries are receiving increased attention for use as power sources in electric vehicles, because of their high theoretical energy density. Two types of Li–air battery systems, non-aqueous and aqueous, have been developed to date. The calculated speciﬁc energy densities (including oxygen) of the non-aqueous and aqueous systems are 3460 and 1910 Wh kg−1, respectively, which are several times higher than that of 387 Wh kg−1 for conventional lithium–ion batteries with a carbon anode and LiCoO2 cathode [4]. The water-stable lithium electrode is a key component to protect the lithium electrode from water in aqueous lithium–air batteries, and also to protect the lithium electrode from water in the air for the nonaqueous system. The water-stable lithium electrode was proposed by Vicso et al. in 2004 [5] for a battery that consisted of lithium metal, a water-stable lithium ion conducting solid of NASICON-type doped LiTi2(PO4)3, and a lithium stable interlayer of Li3N. The interlayer was used to prevent direct contact of the solid electrolyte and lithium metal, because the solid electrolyte is unstable in contact with lithium metal.

Various types of solid lithium conducting electrolytes have been reported [6–11]. At present, there are only three types of high lithium–ion conducting solid electrolytes; NASICON-type Li1+ xAxTi1 − x(PO4)3 (A = Al, Fe, Sc, etc.) (LATP) [9], perovoskite-type La2/3 − xLi3xTiO3 (LLTO) [8], and garnet type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ) [10] are known to be stable in water with a high content of lithium ions. The electrical conductivities of the LATP, LLTO and LLZ are comparable and in the range of 10−3 to 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. The garnet-type LLZ is stable in contact with lithium metal, although the Li/LLZ/Li cell showed a short-circuit after a very short period of polarization at 0.5 mA cm−2 and 25 °C [12]. LATP and LLTO are unstable in contact with lithium metal. Therefore, a lithium conducting polymer electrolyte and Li3N has been proposed as the interlayer between LATP and lithium metal by Zhang et al. [13] and Visco et al. [5], respectively.

A water-stable solid lithium ion conductor used as the protective layer in lithium–air batteries should have a high lithium conductivity of more than 10−3 S cm−1 at the operation temperature to achieve acceptable cell performance at higher current densities greater than 1 mA cm−2 to reduce the IR drop due to the electrolyte. High total conductivities of 1.3 × 10−3 and 5.08 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C were reported for a glass ceramic of Li1+ xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3 [14] and Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 [15], respectively. However, the preparation of glass ceramics is somewhat complex and the effect of aging on the conductivities is questionable. A sintered pellet prepared using the glass ceramic powder had a lower conductivity of 1.48 × 10−4 at 25 °C [16]. We have previously reported [17] an enhancement in conductivity by the substitution of Fe3+ for Al3+ in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, from 5.8 × 10−4 to 1.1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C in Li1.4Fe0.25Al0.15Ti1.6(PO4)3. The effective ionic radius of Fe3+ (0.0645 nm) is higher than that of Al3+ (0.0535 nm) [18]; the average ionic radius of Al3+ and Fe3+ in 0.25 Fe and 0.15 Al is 0.0603 nm, which is close to the ionic radius of Ti4+ (0.0605 nm). In this study, the effect of Cr3+ substitution (0.0615 nm) for Al3+ in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 on the electrical conductivity behavior was examined.

The precursor of Li1+ x + yAlxCryTi2 − x − y(PO4)3 was prepared by the sol–gel method using citric acid, as reported previously [17]. A stoichiometric amount of Ti(OC4H9)4 (Aldrich) was dissolved in ethylene glycol and added to 0.2 M aqueous solution of citric acid, and then stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. After preparation of the gel was completed, stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3, Al(NO3)3 · 9H2O, Cr(NO3) · 9H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were added to the gel solution. The molar ratio of citric acid to Li+ + Al3+ + Cr3+ + Ti4+ was 4:1. After a homogeneous solution was formed, the gel was kept at 170 °C for several hours to allow water to evaporate and to promote esteriﬁcation and polymerization. The gel was heated at 500 °C for 4 h to complete the chemical decomposition of nitrates and organic compounds. The black product with residual carbon was ground to a uniformly ﬁne powder using an agate mortar and pestle to increase the surface area of the samples before sintering at 800 °C for chemical reaction and to remove organic residues. The precursor was then wet milled using a Fritsch planetary mill for 15 h to obtain ﬁne powders. The ﬁne powder was isostatically pressed at 150 M Pa into a pellet and then sintered at various temperatures. The pellet was covered with the mother power to prevent lithium volatilization at the high sintering temperature.

The samples were stored in a dry box ﬁlled with air for one month to examine the aging effect. The stability of the sintered pellets was evaluated by immersion in distilled water, saturated LiCl, and saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution at 50 °C for one week. The pellets were then carefully washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum at 220 °C for 20 h before electrical conductivity measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.

XRD data were obtained using a diffractometer (Rigaku Rint 2500) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 10 to 90° at a scanning step rate of 0.02° s−1 using Si powder as an internal standard. The chlorine and carbon contents of these samples were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; Hitachi S-486 SEM). The AC impedance of the sintered pellets with sputtered gold electrodes was measured in air using a frequency response analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the temperature range from 20 to 80 °C and the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The impedance proﬁles were analyzed to estimate the bulk and grain boundary conductivities using a non-linear instant ﬁt program in the Zview software package. The electron conductivity was estimated using the Hebb-Wagner method [19] for LiCoO2/ electrolyte/Au cells, where LiCoO2 and Au were sputtered onto the electrolytes.

Aono et al. [9] reported the compositional dependence of the electrical conductivity for Li1+ xAlxTi1 − x(PO4)3 and Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3, where the highest conductivity was at x = 0.3 in the former system and x = 0.5 in the latter system. The Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 system was re-examined to determine the composition that exhibited the highest conductivity. Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of the Li1+ xCrxTi2 −x(PO4)3 system sintered at 1150 and 1180 °C for 6 h. All diffraction peaks were indexed as the NASICON-type structure and no impurity phases were observed. The impedance proﬁles of Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 sintered at 1150 °C as a function of x and Li1.4Cr0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 sintered at 1180 °C are shown in Fig. 2. The impedance proﬁles show a semicircle that is attributed to the grain boundary resistance, the diameter of which indicates the magnitude [20]. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance. The semicircle due to the bulk resistance was not observed, because this was out of the frequency range of the frequency analyzer. The highest total and bulk conductivities of 3.55 × 10−4 and 4.94 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C were observed for x = 0.4 in Li1+ xCrxTi2 − x(PO4)3 sintered at 1150 °C. The samples sintered at 1180 °C showed a slightly higher grain boundary resistance. The total conductivity of Li1.4Cr0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 is comparable to that of Li1.3Cr0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 reported by Aono et al. [9].

For further studies, the total amount of Cr3+ and Al3+ was ﬁxed as 0.4, and Cr3+ in Li1.4Cr0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was partly substituted by Al3+. The sintering temperature was selected to obtain the highest conductivity, which is dependent on the Al3+ content. Fig. 3(a) shows a typical impedance spectra that show the effect of the Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 sintering temperature, where the sintering period was ﬁxed for 6 h. The highest total conductivity was observed for the sample sintered at 1070 °C for 6 h. The pellet sintered at 1090 °C for 6 h had a slightly higher grain boundary resistance than that sintered at 1070 °C. The higher grain boundary resistance could be explained by the diffusion of Al3+ from the alumina crucible, where the pellet was in direct contact with the alumina crucible. At the lower sintering temperature of 1040 °C, both the bulk and grain boundary resistances were higher than those of the pellet sintered at 1070 °C. The high bulk resistance suggests that the reaction was not completed. The sintering period also has an effect on the impedance proﬁles of the sintered pellets. Fig. 3(b) shows impedance proﬁles for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 sintered at 1070 °C as a function of the sintering period. The lowest bulk and conductivity. The sintering temperature was decreased with increasing x. All of the main diffraction peaks of the samples could be assigned to the NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 structure. The sintering temperature of Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 to obtain a single phase was higher than that of Li1.4AlxFe0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (1040 °C). Fig. 5 shows the change in the lattice parameters (a-axis and c-axis) with x in Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3, where the lattice parameters were calculated using a hexagonal unit cell. The lattice parameters for the a-axis and c-axis decreased linearly with increasing x due to the smaller ionic radii of Al3+ (0.0535 nm) than that of Cr3+ (0.0615 nm). Fig. 6 shows the change in the relative densities of the sintered pellets with x in Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3. The relative density of Li1.4Cr0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was as low as 60%. A low relative density for Li1.3Cr0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 was also reported by Aono et al. [9]. The relative density was increased by the substitution of Cr with Al up to x = 0.3 and then decreased by further substitution. The highest relative density of 92% was observed for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1(PO4)3, which is comparable with Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 [17] and slightly lower than that for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 [9].

Fig. 7 shows impedance proﬁles for the as-sintered samples Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) measured at 25 °C, where the sintering temperatures were determined to give the highest conductivity. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities were increased with x up to 0.3 and then decreased with x. The grain boundary resistance change with x corresponded with the change in the relative density. The total electrical conductivities measured at 25 °C for as-sintered and stored in dry box at room temperature for one month Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) are shown as a function of x in Fig. 8. For sintered pellets of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 − xGex(PO4)3, the electrical conductivity showed a signiﬁcant aging effect, where the samples were stored in open air [21]. However, Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) showed only a slight aging effect on the electrical conductivity. The compositional dependence of the electrical conductivity indicated a maximum at x = 0.3. The highest total, bulk and grain boundary conductivities for the as-sintered Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 pellets were 1.27 × 10−3, 1.77 × 10−3 and 3.34 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, respectively. The total and grain boundary conductivity were decreased to 1.06 × 10−3 and 2.65 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively, after storage for one month, but the bulk conductivity showed no change. The total conductivity decrease by aging is mainly due to a decrease in the grain boundary conductivity. The bulk conductivity for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 was the same as that for Li1.4Al0.1.5Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 [17]. The total conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO3)3 was enhanced 1.8 times by the substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+, although the bulk conductivity was increased by only 10%. The conductivity enhancement is mainly due to the decrease of the grain boundary resistance.

grain boundary resistance were observed for 6 h sintering. Both the bulk and grain boundary resistances were increased for longer sintering periods at 1070 °C. These increases in resistance could be explained by the diffusion of Al3+ from the alumina crucible, as observed for the pellets sintered at 1090 °C.

Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns for Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) sintered at the optimum temperatures for 6 h to obtain the highest a function of the applied voltage. After application of a voltage through the cell, the current will achieve steady-state as the ionic current is stopped with an ion blocking electrode. The electronic conductivity of samples can then be obtained from the Wagner relation.

The activation energies for the grain boundary and bulk conductivities were estimated from the temperature dependence of the conductivity in a temperature range of 25 to 80 °C. The lowest activation energy for grain boundary conductivity was 47 kJ mol−1 for assintered Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 and that for the bulk conductivity was 17 kJ mol−1 for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.35Cr0.05Ti1.6(PO4)3. The bulk activation energy is comparable with that for Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 and lower than that for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (20.2 kJ mol−1) [21]. The activation energy for the grain boundary conduction of 47 kJ mol−1 for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 is lower than that for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 at 60.4 kJ mol−1.The activation energy for the bulk and grain boundary conductivities of the samples stored for one month were slightly higher than those for the as-sintered samples.

A low electron (and/or hole) transport number is an important requirement for solid electrolytes used for batteries. The contribution of the electronic conduction should be generally considered for oxides containing transition metals. The electronic conductivity of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 was estimated by the Hebb-Wagner method [19] using the LiCoO2/Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3/Au cell, where LiCoO2 was used as the cathode to ﬁx the lithium potential, because Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 is unstable in contact with lithium metal. A small direct current was passed through the cell and the steady cell voltage was measured as a function of the current density at 25 °C.

where σh and σe are the hole and electron conductivity, respectively, I is the current density, R is the gas constant, F is the Faraday constant, T is the absolute temperature, and E is the applied voltage. The relation between E and I did not obey the Wagner equation. This deviation from the Wagner equation may be due to the potential change of LiCoO2.. The electronic conductivities at 25 °C were estimated from the steady-state cell voltages at the applied current densities; 2.5 × 10−9 S cm−1 at 0.245 V and 7.2 × 10−9 S cm−1 S cm−1 at 0.33 V for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3, which is comparable with 1.2 × 10−8 S cm−1 at 0.25 V and 1.6 × 10−8 S cm−1 at 0.4 V for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3. The electronic conductivity contribution in Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 is approximately one order of magnitude lower than that in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, and two orders of magnitude lower than that in Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3. Therefore, it was concluded that the contribution of electronic conductivity in Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 to the total conductivity is negligibly low and is reduced in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 by the substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+.

The lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte used as the protective layer for the water-stable lithium electrode of aqueous lithium–air batteries should be stable in aqueous solutions with saturated LiOH, in addition to having high lithium ion conductivity, because the reaction product of the lithium–air batteries is LiOH. The stability of the Li1+ x + yAlx(Ti,Ge)2 − xSiyP3 − yO12 glass ceramic (Ohara LATP plate) in aqueous solutions has been extensively studied by Imanishi and co-workers [22]. The glass ceramic decomposes in strong acid solution and dissolves in strong alkaline solution. However, Shimonishi et al. reported that the glass ceramic is stable in an aqueous solution saturated with LiOH and LiCl, which has a pH of approximately 9, due to the low dissociation of LiOH to ions in the presence of a high Li+ ion content [23]. The stability of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti(PO4)3 in an aqueous solution saturated with LiOH and LiCl was examined. XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti(PO4)3 immersed in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, and saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution at 50 °C for one month revealed no impurity phases and there was no change in the ratio of the diffraction peaks. However, the impedance proﬁles showed a change after immersion in these solutions, as shown in Fig. 10. The grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti(PO4)3 was increased signiﬁcantly from 29.1 to 990.2 Ω·cm2 by immersion in distilled water, while the bulk resistance was increased slightly from 49.3 to 58.3 Ω·cm2. The increases in grain boundary resistance could be explained by the ion exchange of Li+ and H+ observed in Li3xLa2/3TiO3 [24] and Li7La3Sn2O12 [25]. The mechanical strength of the pellet was also reduced by immersion in distilled water at 50 °C for one month. The grain boundary and bulk resistances of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in the aqueous solutions of saturated LiCl and that saturated with LiCl and LiOH were signiﬁcantly decreased. The total conductivities of Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in the saturated LiCl aqueous solution and saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution were increased from 1.28 × 10−3 S cm−1 to 4.44 × 10−3 and 4.22 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. The conductivities of the sample stored in a dry glove box (dew point ca. −96 °C) for several hours were decreased signiﬁcantly and were slightly lower than that of the as-sintered sample, as shown in Fig. 10. A similar enhancement of conductivity by immersion in saturated LiCl aqueous solution was observed for Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 [21] and Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 [26]. The enhancement of conductivity is explained by the formation of LiCl·H2O at the grain boundaries in open air. Approximately 0.16 wt.% Cl was detected by EDX analysis for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in the saturated LiCl solution. These results suggest that Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 is stable in the aqueous solution saturated with LiOH and LiCl.

NASICON-type lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes of Li1.4AlxCr0.4 − xTi1.6(PO4)3 (x = 0–0.4) were prepared using a sol–gel precursor by sintering between 1000 °C and 1120 °C for 6 h. The substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+ enhanced the ionic conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3. The highest total conductivity of 1.06 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3, which is comparable with 0.59 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6 (PO4)3. The enhancement of bulk conductivity by the substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+ was only 10% and is mainly due to a decrease of the grain boundary resistance.

The contribution of electron (or hole) conductivity was negligible with respect to the total conductivity, and electron (or hole) conductivity was reduced by one order of magnitude with the substitution of Cr3+ for Al3+. Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 was stable in the saturated LiCl aqueous solution and the aqueous solution saturated with LiOH and LiCl, while it was unstable in distilled water. It has been concluded that Li1.4Al0.3Cr0.1Ti1.6(PO4)3 is a promising candidate for the protective layer of the lithium electrode in aqueous lithium–air batteries, because its high lithium ion conductivity and stability in an aqueous solution of saturated LiOH and saturated LiCl.
