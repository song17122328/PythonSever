(Li12xEux)1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6 (SiO4)1/6 04x41 have been synthesized via a sol+gel route. The powder X-ray di4raction has been analyzed with the Nasicontype structure. The Rietveld analysis of the structure performed in space group R31 shows a statistical distribution of ions La31, Eu31, and Pb21 over the positions 3a (occupation 10%) and 3b (occupation 90%) of the so-called M1 site. In agreement with these results, the Eu31 luminescence analysis in these phases exhibits two sites for Eu31, both are noncentrosymmetric, revealing a local disorder in the compounds, which is also supported by the inhomogeneous broadening of the emission lines. The luminescence characteristics of this family of silicates have been investigated for various x values. Under excitation at 254 nm, the distinct emissions of Pb21 and of Eu31 are observed. The excitation of Eu31 ions occurs directly via the charge transfer state or after Pb21PEu31 energy transfer. Concentration quenching of the Eu31 emission is also investigated. ( 1999 Academic Press

Several oxides exhibit crystalline structures based on the R2(XO4)3 framework made of corner-sharing RO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra. Four structural types may be described using this unit, di!ering by the relative arrangement of the polyhedra, garnet (1), Nasicon (2, 3), Langbeinite (4), and Sc2(WO4)3 (5).

The hexagonal unit cell for the Nasicon-type compounds (Na3Zr2PSi2O12) is made of units Zr2(PO4/SiO4)3 arranged in chains along the c axis; these ribbons are linked together by PO4/SiO4 tetrahedra in the [100] direction. Large cavities are left, one M1 site and three M2 sites by formula unit, allowing numerous insertions and/or substitutions.

Previous structural investigations of phosphates or phosphosilicates isotypic to NaZr2(PO4)3 [NZP] (2) have shown that the rare earth element may occupy either the zirconium octahedral site (6}10) or the M1 antiprism (11, 12). Recently, a new family of phosphosilicates with the formula ‚n1@6Pb1@3Zr2(PO4)17@6(SiO4)1@6 (‚n"La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Er, and Yb) has been synthesized (13). The structural re"nement by the Rietveld method in the R31 group has shown that both 3a (000) and 3b (001/2) positions of the M1 site are occupied by the La3‘ and Pb2‘ ions.

In order to get more information on the structure of these materials, we have prepared the solid solution (La1~x Eux)1@6Pb1@3Zr2(PO4)17@6(SiO4)1@6 denoted [La1~xEux PbZr] 04x41. The interest in these phases resides in the optical probe properties of the Eu3‘ ion, besides their potential applications as red emitting phosphors. The "rst part of this work is devoted to the structural analysis by the Rietveld method and by optical probe analysis. The second part describes the luminescent properties of the Eu3‘ and Pb2‘ ions in the whole composition domain 04x41.

The di!erent solid solution [La1~xEuxPbZr] 04x41 have been prepared via a sol}gel route following the method detailed in Ref. (13). Europium oxide was chosen as the source for europium ions. The X-ray di!raction data were collected with Seifert XRD 3000TT di!ractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator. The experimental conditions are gathered in Table 1. The data were then analyzed following the Rietveld method (14).

This can be attributed to the fact that site 3a is (4.148(5) A less occupied than the site 3b, so repulsion between oxygen atoms becomes preponderant. For x"0.3, the di!erence between Zr1}O1 and Zr1}O2, 0.17 A , is lower than the di!erence between Zr2}O12 and Zr2}O22 (0.29 A ), the Zr2O6 octahedra close to the 3b positions are then more distorted. Similar observations have been made by Alamo et al. in the Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phase (16). These authors have shown that the Ca2‘ cations are located in 3b, whereas the 3a position is totally empty and the ZrO6 octahedra neighboring the occupied position are more distorted than those neighboring the vacancy. The observed distortion is still more important in the [La1~xEuxPbZr] solid solution; this e!ect could be assigned to the very anisotropic bonding of Pb2‘ due to its lone pair 6s2. The (P, Si)O4 tetrahedra are also very much distorted: the (P, Si)}O distances range from and the O}(P, Si)}O angles from 1063 to 1173. 1.45 to 1.65 A These lengths are within the generally accepted P}O and Si}O distance ranges (17). The (P, Si)O4 groups appear very sensitive to their surroundings, and such distortions were already observed in compounds including lone pair elements (18) or metals in distorted coordination polyhedra (19, 20). Actually, the corner-sharing ZrO6 and (P, Si)O4

a Xenon lamp. Excitation and emission wavelengths are selected by two double monochromators and the detection is ensured by a HAMAMATSU R928 photomultiplier. Emission spectra are corrected for the response curves of the monochromator and of the detector. Excitation spectra are corrected for the Xenon lamp emission curve. A nitrogen cryostat is used for the low temperature measurements.

Structural Analysis by X-Ray Diwraction

The powder X-ray di!raction patterns exhibit a unique [NZP]-type phase over the whole composition range of the solid solution [La1~xEuxPbZr] 04x41. In Fig. 1 are plotted variations of the hexagonal unit cell parameters with x. The substitution of La3‘ (ri ) for Eu3‘ (ri ) (15) is accompanied by a weak increase of the a parameter, and a weak decrease of the c one. The structure re"nements were performed for the compositions x"0, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 of the solid solution [La1~xEuxPbZr] with the Rietveld method starting with the atomic coordinates for the [NZP] phase (space group R 31 c). The process was carried on in the R 31 space group where the atoms (‚n, Pb), Zr, and O are distributed over two series of independent crystallographic positions. The atomic parameters and a list of selected interatomic distances and angles found for the case x"0.3 are gathered in Tables 2 and 3.

The crystallographic investigation reveals for each composition unequal occupancies of the positions 3a (10%) and 3b (90%). These positions pertain to the so-called M1 type site of the Nasicon structure and are statistically occupied by La3‘, Eu3‘, or Pb2‘. The M2 cavities remain empty. The oxygen polyhedron around site 3a appears more

The tions 5D0 P7F0,3,5 determination of the nature of transitions 5D0 could be made only after a complete calculations for Eu3‘ in the considered crystal "eld. One may then wait P7F1 lines for each of the C3i sites in for two 5D0 [La1~xEuxPbZr], and no other emission in particular in P7F2 region where intense lines are most comthe 5D0 monly observed. In Fig. 2 is plotted the Eu3‘ emission spectrum observed for x"0.3 under direct excitation of the 4f levels at 394 nm, with the observation made at 90 K. The line wavelengths and wavenumbers are gathered in Table 5.

The number of observed lines the transitions P7F0,1,2 is higher than that for a Eu3‘ unique site 5D0 (1, 3, 5 for J"0, 1, 2), whatever its point symmetry; this means that europium ions are distributed over two di!erent P7F0 transition exhibits two sites in the structure. The 5D0 lines denoted A (appearing at higher energy) and B; B is

more intense than A. Although several independent reasons my be at the origin of the observed intensity di!erence between A and B, for instance, a more important distortion of the site giving rise to B or energy transfer from ions in the site allocated to A toward the B site, we choose in "rst approximation to assign the more intense emission B to the more populated crystallographic site 3b (and, respectively, A to 3a). In the following, the whole observed emission will be considered as originating essentially from europium ions P7F0 in 3b. In Table 6 are gathered the A and B 5D0 transition energies and linewidths, in comparison with the equivalent data in several phosphates or silicates. The P7F0 energy is close to that observed in di!erent B 5D0 phosphates (23}25). The data relative to the A spectrum are

The fact that one 5D0 closer to those measured in the Nasicon-type phosphates Eu1@3Zr2(PO4)3 (12) and Na1~3xEuxTi2(PO4)3 (26). P7F0 line is observed for each site proves that none of the two possesses an inversion center. In order to compare between di!erent matrices the importance of the distortion of the lanthanide site with respect to an inversion center, the intensities ratio of ED over MD transitions may be considered. The value of R, ratio of the integrated emission intensities (I5D0?7F2/I5D0?7F1), is the most commonly employed for Eu3‘. A well documented example is that of Eu3‘ in the cubic oxide C-Y2O3, in which two sites occur for rare earth, both with six oxygen "rst neighbors; one is C2 and the other one C3i. A rough estimation gives R"5 for the C2 site whereas for the C3i site only P7F1 lines are observed, therefore R"0 (27}30). two 5D0 For (La0.7Eu0.3)1@6 Pb1@3Zr2(PO4)17@6(SiO4)1@6 , R equals about 2.5. In the two related phases, Eu1@3Zr2 (PO4)3 (12) and Na1~3xEuxTi2(PO4)3 (26), the R value is lower and may be estimated to 1.5.

All these observations point to an important lowering of the point symmetry at the rare earth site with respect to the C3i one deduced from the crystallographic analysis. An analogous conclusion that is a distortion relative to the theoretical point symmetry has also been reached in Refs. (12) and (26). In the three Nasicon-type phases, Eu3‘ lies in one (or two) M1 site, described for the "rst neighbors by a triangular-based antiprism of In Eu1@3Zr2 (PO4)3, as in Na1~3xEuxTi2(PO4)3, only the smaller of the M1 sites is occupied, by Eu3‘ or by Eu3‘ and Na‘. In the [La1~xEuxPbZr] phase, both M1 sites are occupied by one of the two Ln3‘ cations or by Pb2‘, yet with very di!erent occupation levels, 90% for the more compact one (dLn}O ) and only 10% for the less compact (dLn}O ). The deviation with respect to the theoretical centrosymmetry is stronger for

six oxygens.

Comparison of the 5D0P7F0 Energies and Linewidths for (La0.7Eu0.3)1/6Pb1/3Zr2(PO4)17/6(SiO4)1/6 and in Related Phases,

In Fig. 4 are plotted the emission spectra recorded at 300 and 90 K under excitation at 254 nm of the x"0.3 phase. Two distinct emissions are observed, the broad band between 300 and 600 nm characteristic of Pb2‘ and narrow lines between 560 and 720 nm due to Eu3‘.

The spectrum of Pb2‘ remains unchanged with addition of europium. Going from 90 to 300 K, the Pb2‘ emission band shifts toward higher energies and its intensity decreases. This shift is analogous to the one observed in SrB6O10 : Pb (31), which has been assigned to the fact that the emission toward the fundamental level 1S0 starts from the "rst excited level 3P0 at low temperature and from the upper 3P1 level at higher temperature. A quantitative analysis of the emission level lifetimes versus temperature is scheduled to investigate this hypothesis in [La1~xEuxPbZr]. P7FJ emission lines remain unchanged at The Eu3‘ 5D0 the two investigation temperatures, although the intensity decreases when „ increases.

In Fig. 5 are plotted the excitation spectra monitored on the Eu3‘ emission recorded at 90 and 300 K. The weak narrow lines correspond to the intra-4f 6 transitions of europium, and two intense bands are observed, pointing at 241 and 253 nm in the 90 K spectrum. At 300 K, additional intra-4f 6 lines appear, due to excitation from the "rst 7F1 sublevel that is partially populated. The two bands broaden and slightly shift toward lower energies (245 and 258 nm). The 300 K Eu3‘ excitation spectrum has been drawn in Fig. 3 in order to compare the absorption bands with those of Pb2‘. The 258-nm band is very distinct from the lead band and may be assigned to excitation toward the oxygenP europium (III) charge transfer state. At smaller wavelengths, the Eu3‘ and the Pb2‘ excitation spectra overlap. On the

ation in the spectra is observed, only di!erences in the P7F0}4 emission intensity, integrated over the whole 5D0 emission range. The intensities (Fig. 6) exhibit a maximum for x"0.2. The decrease observed at higher europium concentrations is due to self-quenching. The emission loss with respect to the maximum value is 35% for the europiumconcentrated compound Eu1@6Pb1@3Zr2(PO4)17@6(SiO4)1@6.

the Pb2‘ emission band almost completely overlaps the Eu3‘ intra-4f n excitation lines (Fig. 3). From these concluded that Pb2‘PEu3‘ energy transfer is highly probable. It comes out that the europium (III) emission observed under excitation at 254 nm occurs simultaneously by direct excitation in the charge transfer state and by transfer of part of the energy absorbed at the lead(II) centers. The competition for absorption at 254 nm by Pb2‘ and Eu3‘ and the Pb2PEu3‘ energy transfer may both play roles in the Eu3‘ emission intensity and its variation with temperature. These processes will be systematically investigated in a next work.

The investigation of the luminescence properties of these materials has contribution of Pb2‘PEu3‘ energy transfers in the emission of europium (III) under excitation at the commercial wavelength (254 nm); is no probability for Pb2‘PPb2‘ interactions. The Eu3‘ concentration quenching is moderate, even for the limiting composition Eu1@6Pb1@3Zr2(PO4)17@6(SiO4)1@6.
