Zirconium  doped  LiTi2(PO4)3  (LTP)  samples  with  the  chemical  composition  of Li[Ti2-xZrx](PO4)3 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5) are prepared by solid state reaction method.  XRD  data revealed the formation of phase pure materials of rhombohedral structure with space group  3R c (#167).  Microstructural studies by scanning electron microscopy indicated that the particle  size is in the range of 0.5 1 ȝm.  Raman spectroscopic study showed that the peaks at high  3 stretching  modes.    Electrochemical  impedance  frequencies  are  due  to  intramolecular  PO4 studies showed high ionic conductivity for small amount of Zirconium (x = 0.1) doping.     

Nasicon (Sodium Super Ionic Conductors) compounds of rhombohedral symmetry with  3R c )  find  potential  applications  as  electrolytes  for  lithium-ion  batteries  [1-2].   These  ionic  conductors  display  a  three  dimensional  conducting  network  where  superionic  conductivity may occur [3-4].  The original NASICON materials are synthesized with general  formula  Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12(0    x    3).  After  the  synthesis  of  NASICON  materials,  a  large  number  of  phosphate  related  materials  are  synthesized  by  partial  substitution  of  tetravalent  cations by trivalent [5], tetravalent [6] and pentavalent cations [7-8].  Since Li has unmatchable  properties  with  high  potential  (E0  =  23.024  V),  the  research  on  Li  based  LISICON  solid  electrolytes has become the prominent subject for all solid lithium batteries. 

In  the  structure  of  LISICON  materials  AxBy(PO4)3,  PO4  tetrahedra  are  linked  by  the  corners  to  MO6  octahedra.  The  infinite  ribbons  resulting  from  this  linkage  are  connected  together, perpendicular to the c direction, by PO4 tetrahedra to form the framework.  The Li+ ions  occupy two positions in the conduction channels: the M1 site (one per formula) is coordinated by  a  trigonal  antiprism  of  oxygens,  and  the  M2  site  (three  per  formula)  has  a  distorted  8-fold  coordination. M1 and M2 sites are located inside and between the ribbons, respectively [9-10].   The effect of Zr substitution in Ti4+ site showed some observable changes in the structure and  phase [1, 11].  

  In the present work, the LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 series (0.1  x  0.5) of samples have been  prepared  and  studied  by  XRD,  SEM,  RAMAN  spectra  and  Electrochemical  Impedance  spectroscopy  techniques.    Structural  changes  and  phase  identification  are  explained  by  XRD.  Morphology of materials is investigated by SEM.  Vibrational spectroscopic study with RAMAN  spectroscopic data confirms the formation and structure of the materials.  EIS techniques have  been used to analyze Li conductivity in LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 materials.

LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 materials  with  x  =  0.0,  0.1,  0.3  and  0.5  are  synthesized  by  solid-state  reaction  method.    Stoichiometric  amounts  of  Li2CO3,  TiO2,  NH4H2PO4  and  ZrO2  for  each  composition are finely ground in an agate mortar in the presence of methanol for 6 h to obtain  homogeneous mixture.  The powder is then calcined at 900 0C for 4 h with a heating rate of 50C per minute.  White coloured calcined powder was pressed into pellets using PVA as binder and  the pellets are sintered at 1050 0C for 2 h on Pt foil. 

Phase identification of calcined and sintered powders are performed on D8 ADVANCE  Diffractometer of BRUKER AXS with Cu KĮ1 radiation (Ȝ=1.5406 A0), in the 2ș range from 100  to 700 in steps of 0.020.  Experimental densities of LTP and Zirconium doped LTP pellets are  measured  at  room  temperature  using  standard  Archimedes  principle.  Morphology  of  fractured  surfaces of pellets is examined by JEOL-JSM 6610LV Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).   Raman spectra are recorded on a RAMAN HORIBA JOBIN YVON-LABRAM-HR 800 Raman  Spectrometer  in  the  frequency  range  50-1200  cm-1.    Ionic  conductivity  studies  are  made  on  pellets of 12 mm diameter and 1.5 2.5 mm thickness and the measurements are carried out on a  HIOKI 3532-50 LCR HITESTER LCR meter in the frequency range 50 Hz 1 MHz and in the  temperature range from 40 0C to 300 0C.   

The patterns shown formed in Fig.1 are in agreement with the XRD pattern for LTP  indicating  the  formation  of  single  phase  compounds.    Unit  cell  parameters  calculated  using  UNITCELL  software  (Unit-Cell  software,  1995)  [12]  are  shown  in  table  1.    The  unit-cell  parameters  for  the  compound  LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  reported  in  previous works [13, 11].  The lattice parameters are found to be increased with increasing x value  in LTP, which is due to the high ionic radius of Zr4+ than Ti4+.  The colour of the Zirconium  doped samples after calcination is white like pure LTP material. 

Raman spectra of LTP and Zirconium doped LTP materials are shown in Fig.2,  from which it  can be seen that three intense symmetric stretching peaks (Ȟ1 and Ȟ3) appear at 967, 986, 1003  cm-1 along with low intense peak at 1092 cm-1.  The peak at 1003 cm-1 is due to the symmetric  4PO   while the peaks at 444 and 430 cm-1 are due to the symmetric bending  stretching mode of  modes. Band at 547 cm-1 is assigned to asymmetric bending mode (Ȟ4). Bands below 350 cm-1  are due to external modes.  Raman spectra obtained for LTP agree with that reported by Burba  et.al [14].  Zirconium substitution into LTP showed some noticeable changes on stretching bands.  With the increasing Zr content in LTP, all high intense peaks are slightly shifted to lower  wavenumber side with a simultaneous decrease in intensity of peak at 1092 cm-1.  

Fig.3 shows SEM images of fractured surfaces of pellets of LTP and Zirconium doped  LTP sintered at 1050 0C for 2 h.  From the SEM micrographs it can be noticed that the grain size  is  considerably  increased  with  the  increase  in Zirconium  content  along  with  certain  degree  of  porosity.  The profiles of dielectric constant in the frequency range from 50 Hz to 1 MHz   for Zr  (x = 0.1) doped LTP materials are shown in the Fig.4 (a-c).  The dielectric constant is decreased  with increasing frequency and temperature in LTP and Zr doped LTP material. The dielectric  constant rise sharply towards low frequencies and the shape of rise is changed as the temperature  increases. The sharp rise of the dielectric constant at low frequency is due to the conducting ion  motion.  The  high  values  of  dielectric  constant  at  low  frequencies  reflect  the  effect  of  space  charge  polarization  and/or  free-charge  motion  within  the  material  and  it  is  connected  to  a.c.  conductivity relaxation. The a.c conductivity is calculated using the following equation.

Fig.5  depicts  variation  of  a.c.  conductivity  as  a  function  of  frequency  at  different  temperatures for LTP and Zr doped LTP materials.  From the Fig.6 (b), it is observed that the  plot  shows  two  regions:  one  is  at  low  frequency  dispersion,  which  can  be  ascribed  to  space  charge polarization of blocking electrodes.  The second region is independent of frequency.  The  conductivity in this region is almost constant [15].  Fig. 5 (c and d) show single regions for Zr  rich materials.  The ionic conductivity is increased with temperature within the sample, but the  conductivity of Ti rich sample is high compared to Zr rich material.  In the high temperature  range, grain boundary conductivity becomes close to that of the bulk, so in all the conductivity  graphs  at  high  temperatures  the  curves  are  either  merged  or  come  closer  to  each  other.    The  calculated  a.c.  conductivities  at  different  temperatures  are  shown  in  table  1.2.    The  ionic  conductivities of 3.02 x10-4, 4.26 x 10-4 and 5.99 x 10-5 S/cm are observed for x = 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5  doped LTP materials respectively at 100 KHz frequency.  The conductivity values of LTP and Zr  doped LTP materials at different temperatures are shown in Table 2.  

From the table we observe all the Zirconium doped materials showed high conductivity compared to LTP.  These results  show that the ionic conductivity is high for low amount of Zirconium doped in LTP.   

Fig.  6  shows  Arrhenius  a.c.  conductivity  plots  drawn  as  functions  of  inverse  of  temperature at different frequencies. At low temperature region, the conductivity does not show  any appreciable change at all the frequencies of measurement and it depends significantly on the  frequency. Further, it can be seen that as temperature increases, the values of conductivity for x =  0.3, 0.5 doped LTP reach magnitudes which are close to each other at all frequencies. Curves  appear  to  be  close  to  each  other  at  high  temperatures  indicting  predominance  of  an  onset  of  intrinsic conductivity mechanism. The conductivity of Ti rich material, x = 0.1 reach magnitude  higher than the magnitudes of x = 0.3, 0.5 doped materials. In all the materials with the increase  in temperature the dielectric relaxation takes place and the dependency of the conductivity on  frequency gets reduced.  Linear curve is observed for x = 0.1 composition, and for other Zr-rich  compositions deviation from linearity at low temperatures is observed, which can be related to a  variable range of hopping mechanism [16]. 

Powders of different compositions corresponding to LiTi2-xZrx(PO4)3 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.3 and  0.5) have been prepared by conventional solid-state method.  XRD patterns of LTP heat treated  at 1050 0C for 2 h showed formation of phase pure LTP of rhombohedral symmetry with space  group  3R c (#167).  Zirconium-substitution in LTP led to observable shift of high intense bands  to low wavenumber side along with the decrease in intensity of peaks at 1092 cm-1 in the Raman  spectra.  SEM  micrographs  have  shown  grain  size  of  samples  increased  with  increase  in  Zirconium  content.    The  ionic  conductivity  at  room  temperature  is  3.02x10-4  S/cm.    a.c.  condctivity  studies  indicated  that  low  amount  of  Zr  is  more  effective  compared  to  Zr  concentration 0.1 <  x.
