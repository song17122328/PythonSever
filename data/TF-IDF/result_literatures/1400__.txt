Lithium-ion batteries the popular and prominent energy storage devices in this era for miniature applications like watches, toys, cameras etc. Lithium is the lightest metal (6.94 g mol21) with a theoretical capacity of 3862 Ah kg21 and a high electronegative potential (23.05 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode) resulting in very high volumetric and gravimetric energy density of the cell which is attractive in portable and miniature applications. In addition, very little amount of self-discharge (,y5% per month) and no memory effect when compared to other rechargeable power packs like lead–acid, Ni–Cd, and Ni–MH keeps LIB as a serious contender for high power applications such as electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).1–5 However, dendrite growth is the main problem for metallic lithium based rechargeable systems for practical applications.6 Hence, the concept of ‘‘host–guest’’ chemistry emerged and was successfully employed in commercial LIBs introduced by Sony Inc., utilizing carbonaceous anodes.7 Nevertheless, carbonaceous anodes endure problems in lithium plating and poor rate performances that led the way to search for new anode alternatives. The decomposition of

conventional carbonate based electrolytes cannot be excluded for said anodes during insertion of Li-ions at lower potentials vs. Li.5 Several prospective insertion hosts such as anatase–TiO2 (y1.75 V vs. Li),8,9 TiO2–B (y1.5 V vs. Li),9,10 Li4Ti5O12 (y1.5 V vs. Li),9,11 LiTi2(PO4)3 (y2.6 V vs. Li),8 TiP2O7 (y2.6 V vs. Li),8,12 VO2 (B) (y2.6 V vs. Li)13 and Li3V2(PO4)3 (y1.7 V vs. Li)14 with compromising insertion potential and capacity when compared to graphitic anodes (y0.1 V vs. Li) are proposed. Using LiTi2(PO4)3 anodes provides several advantages like better thermal stability in both lithiated and de-lithiated states due to the presence of strong P–O covalent bond, three dimensional pathways for Li-ion transportation, flat operating potentials during Li-insertion/extraction, ease of synthesis and eco-friendlithe T4+/3+ redox couple is ness. However, observed at y2.6 V vs. Li, which is too high for anodes and very low for cathodes in LIB. In addition, the separated arrangement of the TiO6 octahedral unit supplies the inferior conducting of NASICON type LiTi2(PO4)3. Therefore, less studies were carried out for NASICON type LiTi2(PO4)3 as insertion host for LIBs. At the same time, LiTi2(PO4)3 materials play a vital role in aqueous lithium-ion batteries as prospective anodes to bring down the working (,y1.23 V), while potential as LiMn2O4, employing such LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4, LiNiO2, LiCoO2 etc..15 Luo et al.16,17 reported the possibility of using LiTi2(PO4)3 as insertion type electrodes in aqueous hybrid electrochemical capacitors. There has been no work reported on the utilization of anodes in full-cell configurations although the operating potential is low. Hence, an to synthesize NASICON type attempt has been made LiTi2(PO4)3 phase by a modified pechini type polymerizable

The carbon coating was conducted by carbonization of glucose under Ar atmosphere. The electrochemical properties were evaluated in both half-cell (Li/ LiTi2(PO4)3) and full-cell (LiMn2O4/LiTi2(PO4)3) configurations at the constant current rate of 150 mA g21 along with powder characterizations and described in detail.

LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cells at scan rate of 0.1 mV s21 using Solartron, 1470E and SI 1255B impedance/gain-phase analyzer coupled with a potentiostat. Galvanostatic cycling profiles of the half-cells and full-cells were recorded using Arbin battery (2000) tester in ambient temperature conditions at constant current of 150 mA g21.

NASICON type LiTi2(PO4)3 was prepared by a modified pechini type polymerizable complex method as described by Mariappan et al.18 stoichiometric amounts of Ti metal (STREM, USA), LiOH?H2O (Fisher, 99.9%) and NH4H2PO4 (Fisher, 99.9%) were used as starting materials. In the first step, Ti metal (0.96 g) was dissolved in H2O2 (30%, Merck, Germany) and ammonia solution (25% Merck, Germany) solution (2 : 1 by volume). To form the polymerizable complex, citric acid to ethylene glycol (EG) was fixed to a 1 : 1 molar ratio and the same molar ratio of Ti metal present in the compound was also maintained. After the complete dissolution of Ti metal, citric acid (3.84 g, Aldrich, 99.5%), NH4H2PO4 (3.45 g) and LiOH?H2O (0.42 g) were added and continuously stirred until the solution becomes homogeneous. Then, EG was added drop-wise to the above solution and hot plate temperature was increased to 80 uC and maintained for 2 h. To complete the polyesterification process, the temperature of the hotplate was further increased to 140 uC to yield gel precursors. The obtained gel precursor was pyrolysed at 325 uC for 2 h in air to obtain black coloured intermediate powder. The powder was fired at 1000 uC for 24 h in air to obtain single phase LiTi2(PO4)3 and subsequently ball milled (1 h) to reduce the aggregation of particles using SPEX 8000D, USA high energy ball miller. Carbon-coating was conducted after the ball-milling procedure by carbonizing the appropriate amount of glucose under Ar atmosphere at 800 uC for 2 h.

Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted using Bruker AXS, D8 Advance with Cu–Ka radiation. Rietveld refinement was conducted for the obtained reflections using Topas V3 software. Surface morphological features and internal structure of the carbon coated LiTi2(PO4)3 (hereafter-called C– LiTi2(PO4)3) were analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7600F) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL 2100F), respectively. All the electrochemical studies were conducted using a standard two electrode coin-cell configuration (CR 2016). The composite electrodes were prepared by weighing the accurately weighed (20 mg) active material (C–LiTi2(PO4)3 or LiMn2O4), 3 mg of super P carbon as conductive additive and 3 mg of teflonized acetylene black (TAB-2) as a binder. The resultant mixture was placed on a stainless steel mesh, which serves as a current collector for both electrodes. The composite electrodes were dried at 60 uC overnight before conducting cell assembly under an Ar filled glove box. Half-cells (Li/LiMn2O4 or Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3) were fabricated with metallic lithium as the anode and composite electrodes as the cathode, which was separated by a microporous glass fiber separator (Whatman, Cat. No. 1825 047, UK). 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1 : 1 wt. %, DAN VEC) was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetric traces were recorded for Li/LiMn2O4, Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 and

Fig. 1a represents the Rietveld refined powder X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) of C-LiTi2(PO4)3 particles. The observed XRD patterns clearly indicate the formation of single phase LiTi2(PO4)3 and absence of impurity phases like TiO2 rutile and Li3PO4. The observed satellite reflections are indexed according to the rhombohedral–hexagonal structure with an R3¯c space group. The crystal structure of NASICON type materials is a three dimensional framework consisting of titanium in octahedral units (TiO6) and phosphorous in tetrahedral position (PO4), sharing oxygen vertices. Nevertheless, each PO4 unit surrounded by four VO6 unit forms a three dimensional chain, in which lithium is located within the three dimensional cavity. Three four-fold crystallographic configurations exist for the lithium atoms, which leads to twelve lithium positions within the unit-cell.8,19 The lattice parameter values are calculated from the Rietveld refinement and found to be a = 8.515(8) A˚ and c = 20.912(7) A˚ which is consistent with literature values. The crystallite size calculated from Scherrer formula during refinement was 80 nm. A highly dispersed particulate morphology was observed for C–LiTi2(PO4)3, as is clearly seen from the scanning electron microscopic image (Fig. 1b). This kind of morphology is due to the high energy ball-milling of LiTi2(PO4)3 particles and subsequent coating with a thin layer of carbon. The presence of a carbon layer prevents the aggregation of particles during the carbonization of glucose, resulting in such dispersed morphology. In order to ensure the presence of uniform carbon coating over the LiTi2(PO4)3 particles, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted and is presented in Fig. 1c and d. The presence of a filament like material is apparently noted in TEM picture, which is none other than amorphous carbon. Further, high resolution-TEM is recorded to estimate the thickness of the carbon layer, which was found to be y3 nm. The inter-planer d-spacing was measured at 5.98 A˚ and agrees well with hkl of (0 1 2) of the C–LiTi2(PO4)3.

The nature of the carbon covered LiTi2(PO4)3 particulates during carbonization is very important for the improvement of electrochemical properties. Hence, Raman spectra were recorded and are presented in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, it is apparent to see the presence of carbon with characteristic bands at 1548 and 1604 cm21. The observed frequencies correspond to the D and G bands of carbon respectively.20 Further, appearance of frequencies at 968, 987, 1006 and 1093 cm21 are ascribed to the characteristic of LiTi2(PO4)3 particles, in particular (PO4)32 anions.21,22 Apart from the evidence of the carbon layer, in which the intensity ratio between D and G bands (ID/IG) are very crucial for the enhancement of conducting profiles. In the present case, the ratio is calculated to be 0.85, which indicates the carbonized layer predominantly contains sp2 type carbon. The presence of such sp2 type carbon enables better conducting profiles and hence, improved electrochemical properties are expected for C–LiTi2(PO4)3 particulates.23

Fig. 3 shows the family of cyclic voltammograms (CV) of Li/ C–LiTi2(PO4)3 half-cells recorded between 2–3.4 V vs. Li at scan rate of 0.1 mV s21. The test cell showed an open circuit potential of y3.16 V vs. Li and was first discharged to a lower cut-off potential (2 V) to insert Li-ions into the NASICON type C– LiTi2(PO4)3 lattice. During the cathodic sweep, the cell exhibits sharp peak potential of y2.29 V, which is an indication of reduction of Ti4+ in to Ti3+. In the anodic scan, the test cell showed an oxidation potential of y2.6 V, which corresponds to the Ti3+ to Ti4+ redox couple. The reduction and oxidation of the transition metal, Ti, reveals the insertion and extraction of Liions. However, the reduction peak potential shifted towards a higher voltage and this shifting of potential is mainly ascribed to the structural rearrangement in the C–LiTi2(PO4)3 lattice during the first Liinsertion.24 The very sharp oxidation/reduction peaks correspond to the two-phase reaction mechanism according to the following equilibrium LiTi2(PO4)3 + 2Li+ + 2e2«Li3Ti2(PO4)3 Galvanostatic charge–discharge studies of Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 half-cells were cycled between 2–3.4 vs. Li at the current density of 15 and 150 mA g21 at room temperature. Fig. 4a shows the typical charge–discharge curves of the Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cell at a current density of 15 mA g21. The cell showed an initial discharge capacity of 117 mAh g21 (1.69 moles of lithium) with flat a potential of y2.43 V against a theoretical capacity of

138 mAh g21 (for the insertion of two moles of lithium). Reversible capacity of 114 mAh g21 is obtained in the first charge, which is equal to 1.65 moles of lithium. In the second discharge, the cell showed a discharge of 113 mAh g21 with a slightly higher insertion potential (y2.45 V) when compared to the first discharge. The obtained charge–discharge curves are consistent with CV studies. A duplicate cell has been made to study the electrochemical Li-insertion behaviour at relatively high current of 150 mA g21 and is presented in Fig. 4b. The Li/ C–LiTi2(PO4)3 half-cell delivered the initial discharge and charge capacities of 114 and 109 mAh g21, respectively. An increasing polarization of the electrodes is also noted when increasing the current density from 15 to 150 mA g21. Cycling profiles of Li/C– LiTi2(PO4)3 cells up to 200 cycles were tested at a current density of 150 mA g21 and are given in Fig. 4c. It is obvious to notice that the cell experienced capacity fading during cycling, for example discharge capacities of 87, 82, 80 and 78 mAh g21 were noted for the 50, 100, 150 and 200 cycles, respectively. However, severe capacity fading is observed only in the initial cycles (up to 10 cycles). The capacity fading is calculated from the 10th cycle to the 200th cycle and was found to be 0.09 mAh g21 per cycle. Nevertheless, capacity fading is obvious in the case of NASICON type LiTi2(PO4)3, which is mainly attributed to the intrinsic nature of the compound and a similar kind of fading is already noted by previous researchers, for example Patoux and Masquelier8 reported a y0.63 mAh g21 capacity fade per cycle between 2–3.4 V vs. Li (y120 and y95 mAh g21 for the 1st and 40th cycle, respectively at a low current rate of 0.1 C). Wessels carbon-coated et LiTi2(PO4)3 and it showed a capacity retention of 70% after 160 cycles at 1 C rate. Though, the oxygen deficient phase showed (LiTi2(PO42d)3) two orders of magnitude increment in electronic conductivity and displayed the discharge capacity of 93 mAh g21 only compared to native phase (81 mAh g21) at 1 C rate.27 The C–LiTi2(PO4)3 prepared by pechni type polymerizable complex method and subsequent carbon coating using glucose yields better performing electrode as compared to previous reports.

The full-cell, LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 was constructed and the electrochemical properties were evaluated between 0.9–1.7 V at current density of 150 mA g21. In the case of full-cell arrangement, there is no Li-reservoir like that in metallic lithium half-cell configurations, the cathode, LiMn2O4, is the only available source. Hence, optimization of mass between two electrodes is necessary to utilize the full capacity of the both active materials. Based on the half-cell performance of both cells (Li/LiMn2O4 and Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3) under the same current rate (150 mA g21), and with the mass ratio fixed anode to cathode 1 : 1.04, the full-cell, LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3, was potentiostatically cycled between 0.9–1.7 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s21 and is presented in Fig. 5. For the comparison purpose, electrochemical reactions in half-cell configuration of the individual components (LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3) are also presented along with full-cell result in Fig. 5. The full-cell, showed an open circuit potential of y100 mV and charged first to extract lithium from the LiMn2O4 lattice, the extracted Li-ions are then simultaneously inserted in to LiTi2(PO4)3 lattice. The sharp anodic peak y1.6 V corresponds to the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+ or reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+. Similarly, during the cathodic scan, the

View Article OnlineThe galvanostatic cycling performance of the LiMn2O4/C– LiTi2(PO4)3 cells was conducted between 0.9–1.7 V at a current density of 150 mA g21 at room temperature. Typical charge– discharge curves of the LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cell are given Fig. 6a and the capacity values are calculated based on the mass loading of the cathode. The cell displayed capacities of 121 and 103 mAh g21 for first charge and discharge, respectively. The discharge curve showed more or less a flat potential at y1.5 V and is consistent with the CV measurements. An irreversible capacity of about 18 mAh g21 is observed and the values are expected, since both half-cell configurations (Li/LiMn2O4 or Li/ C–LiTi2(PO4)3) are experiencing irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle. The cycling profiles of the LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cells are illustrated up to 200 cycles in Fig. 6b. The full-cell experiences capacity fade during the cycles and this is evident from the cycling profile. The cycling behaviour is very similar to the half-cell, Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3. Further, the small capacity fading observed from the Li/LiMn2O4 cell cannot be excluded (given in the supplementary information{). In cycling, the LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cell delivered discharge capacities of 87, 78 and 74 mAh g21 for 50, 100 and 200 cycles, respectively. Except for the first cycle, the cell showed a columbic efficiency of over 99%,which indicates the excellent reversibility during charge–discharge process and good agreement with CV studies. the LiMn2O4/C– The operating potential LiTi2(PO4)3 full-cell is quite low when compared to the halfcell assemblies of either the anode (Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3) or the cathode (Li/LiMn2O4). At the same time, the use of metallic lithium in the practical rechargeable systems is not advisable in aprotic solvents, which may lead to dendritic growth and can result in short-circuiting of the cell. Meanwhile, the observed operating potential is higher than other conventional rechargeable battery systems like, lead–acid, Ni–MH, Ni–Cd and magnesium.4,28 In the case of Ni–MH and Ni–Cd, the operating potential is highly restricted due to water splitting issues (y1.23 V), use of environmentally hazardous materials and memory effect issues. Maintenance and cycleability is the main challenge for lead acid batteries. High temperature operation is also another important concern for those batteries, whereas the LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 system is overcomes the aforementioned setbacks noted in the other rechargeable systems by employing low cost, eco-friendly materials.4 Further, the operating potential of the C–LiTi2(PO4)3 anode based system can be further improved by employing high voltage cathodes like LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, LiCoPO4 depending on the requirements. Thus, the 1.5 V LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 cell can be used effectively for miniature applications like watches, toys, cameras, etc.

NASICON type LiTi2(PO4)3 was synthesized by a modified pechni type polymerizable complex method and subsequently ball milled to reduce the particle size. The resultant phase was carbon coated by the carbonization of glucose (C–LiTi2(PO4)3). The carbon coating was confirmed by HR-TEM and Raman analysis and it was found y2.3 wt.% in the final compound. The Li-insertion properties were evaluated in half-cell configurations (Li/C–LiTi2(PO4)3) and found to be 1.69 moles per formula unit. However, a noticeable amount of capacity fading was observed

sharp peak y1.45 V is attributed to the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ or reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+. In the electrochemical reaction, oxidation process corresponds to the removal of lithium and reduction reveals the insertion of lithium back and forth. The mirror like CV traces clearly indicate the reversibility of the cell during electrochemical cycling. A small variation in area under the curve is noted which indicates the capacity fade during cycling.

The full-cell was constructed with LiMn2O4 cathode and the cell exhibited the initial discharge capacity of 103 mAh g21 at current density of 150 mA g21. The full-cell, LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 renders 72% of initial discharge capacity with over 99% columbic efficiency at a working potential of 1.5 V. The obtained results clearly indicate that the full-cell LiMn2O4/C–LiTi2(PO4)3 can be effectively used for miniature applications and possibly replace lead–acid, Ni–Cd and Ni–MH rechargeable systems.
