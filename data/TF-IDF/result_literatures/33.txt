Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have broad applications in the field of power grid energy storage owing to their signiﬁcant cost advantages. Although the 3D framework structure of NaTi2(PO4)3 with a sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) has recently been regarded as a promising anode material in SIBs, the low inherent electrical conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3 has hindered its practical application to batteries. However, since a number of research studies have shown that the conductivities of composite materials can be improved by carbon doping or coating, the carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3@C (NTP@C) composite is expected to show excellent electrochemical performance in SIBs. In general, the production of NTP@C requires two steps (i.e. sample preparation and carbon coating), and the development of a one-step in situ preparation of NTP@C is desirable. In the present work, NTP@C microspheres with carbon concentrations of 1.4% and 4.95% were prepared in situ by a simple spray method followed by calcination. Of these, the NTP@C with a carbon content of about 4.95% displayed superior properties, delivering a high capacity of 105.26 mAh/g at a current rate of 5 C for the initial cycle, and presenting long-term cycling stability with a slow capacity decay of about 0.018% per cycle over 2000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the NTP@C microspheres can be attributed to the improved conductivity due to carbon coating and the enhanced stability provided by the microsphere structure. Thus, NTP@C is a promising alternative anode material for SIBs. 
Recently, the application of lithium-ion batteries has increased in many fields [1-5]. However, the lack of lithium resources has limited the further development of such batteries [6-9]. Meanwhile, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted more attention due to the rich resource availability and low cost. For the construction of large-scale energy-storage SIB systems, it is very important to select raw materials that can be easily synthesized and have low cost [10-19]. Hence, the three-dimensional structure, low cost, and environmental friendliness of NaTi2(PO4)3 with a sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) make this material a promising candidate for the anode electrode [20-23]. The storage mechanism of sodium ions in an NTP electrode structure was first studied by Delmas [24], who found that the structure could accommodate a reversible intercalation of two sodium ions by chemical or electrochemical means at ambient temperature. The output voltage of the NTP electrode material has been shown to be approximately 2.1 V [25-30], and the high charge–discharge platform of NTP has been shown to reduce the chances of depositing metallic sodium on the surface of the electrode material [31-36]. However, the low inherent electrical conductivity of NTP has been found to hinder its practical application in batteries [37-39]. An investigation and analysis of the relevant literature reveals three known methods for effectively improving the electrical and electrochemical properties of materials such as NTP [40,41]. Firstly, the ion and electron transport paths can be shortened, and the electrolyte permeability enhanced, by the production of NTP as nanoscale particles [42,43]. For example, Huang used a hydrothermal method to generate NTP nanoparticles of a size of 100nm with high reversible capacities of ~121 mAh/g at 0.2 C and 103 mAh/g at 2 C [44]. Secondly, the ion/electron transport capabilities of the material can be improved by heteroatoms doping [45]. For instance, Huang prepared fluorine-doped NTP/C materials with greatly enhanced ion/electron transportation properties, thereby achieving an ultra-high rate performance and a super-long cycle life [46]. An electrochemical analysis of the fabricated material showed that the fluorine doping enhanced the Na+ diffusion kinetics. Thirdly, and most importantly, the conductivity of the NTP is enhanced by coating or doping with materials which themselves have good conductivity [47,48]. For example, Chen prepared carbon-coated NTPs (NTP@C) with excellent rate performance attributable to the high content of graphite in the coating, which increases the conductivity of the material [49]. The production of NTP@C is generally a two-step process of sample preparation followed by carbon coating. For example, Chen obtained the NTP@C first by using a hydrothermal method to prepare the NTPs and then by carbon coating of the particles using PVA as the carbon source [48]. Clearly, a one-step in situ preparation of NTP@C would be simpler than the above-mentioned two-step approach and would save resources. Moreover, a one-step in situ method would avoid the influence of the second carbonization step upon the structure and morphology of the material, thus enabling the original structure and morphology of the material to be maintained. In the present work, a simple method for the in situ synthesis of NTP@C is developed using sodium sources such as sodium citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (disodium EDTA), which contain carbon chains in their molecular structures. In addition, the carbon content of the as-synthesized products is shown to be easily regulated by selecting various sodium sources. Two types of NTP@C microspheres, with carbon contents of 5% (NTP@C-1) and 1.4% (NTP@C-2), are prepared by a simple spray-drying method with post calcination. The electrical and electrochemical properties of the two samples are examined and compared in order to determine the optimum carbon content. 
The NaTi2(PO4)3@C microsphere particles were prepared by spray drying and heat treatment after simple ball milling. First, 18.61 g of disodium EDTA (C10H14N2Na2O8·2H2O), 34.51 g of NH4H2PO4, 45.63 g of tetraethyl titanate (C8H20O4Ti), and 80 mL of water were added to a 500 mL stainless steel ball mill jar and processed in a planetary ball mill (KQM-Z/B) for 5 h at 500 rpm to produce the precursor mixture with a 1:2:3 molar ratio of Na+:Ti4+:PO43-. This mixture was then injected through the peristaltic pump of a spray dryer (HF-6000F) at 25 rpm and atomized by the nozzle to generate tiny spherical droplets which were then injected into a heating chamber at 220 °C to produce the microsphere NTP@C precursor. This was then calcined at 800 °C for 10 h in N2 to obtain the NaTi2(PO4)3@C microsphere composite with 5% carbon content (NTP@C-1). The composite with 1.4% carbon content (NTP@C-2) was obtained via a similar procedure, but replacing the disodium EDTA with 11.21 g trisodium citrate dihydrate (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), NaTi2(PO4)3@C.An X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used to analyze the purity of the synthesized material. The diffractive angles used were in the range of 10–80°. The XRD data were analyzed using MDI jade 6. The microstructures of the samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-3400N). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed using a JEOL JEM-2010 device. Raman spectra were obtained using a 514-nm laser as the excitation source on a PerkinElmer Raman Station 400 spectrometer. The thermal characteristics of the samples were analyzed using a synchronous thermal analyzer (STA25000) in the range of room temperature to 900 °C in air with a constant heating rate of 15 °C/min. The elemental composition of the samples was determined using an elemental analyzer (vario MACRO CN). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution were recorded using a BELSORP-max II instrument. The XPS spectra were recorded using a Thermo Kα XPS apparatus equipped with a monochromatic Al−Kα X–ray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
The working electrode consisting of 70% active material, 20% acetylene black, and 10% sodium carboxymethylcellulose binder was prepared by placing these materials in a 50 ml agate spherule tank with water as the solvent, ball milling for 1 h, then applying the slurry to a copper foil. After vacuum drying at 110 °C for 12 h, the dried electrode material was rolled in a press and cut into a working electrode of area 1.13 cm2, in which the load of the active material was about 2 mg/cm2. A CR2032-type coin cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box (SUPER (1220/750/900)) with water and oxygen concentrations of less than 0.1 ppm, a sodium metal sheet as a counter electrode, and glass fibers (Whatman 2400) as the separator. The electrolyte was a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate at a volume ratio of 1:1 with the addition of 1M NaClO4. A constant current discharge/charge test was performed using a Land-2001A device (Wuhan, China) with a voltage range of 1.5–3.0 V at corresponding rates of 1 C = 155 mAh/g. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed using the CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The CV test voltage range was 1.5–3.0 V, the scan speed was 0.1 mV/s, and the EIS frequency range was 200 kHz to 10 MHz. 
The XRD patterns of the NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 composites are presented in Fig. 1. The high intensity of the diffraction peak indicates that the sample has good crystallinity. The positions of the main diffraction peaks of the two materials are 2θ = 14.54°, 20.28°, 20.96°, 24.25°, 25.60°, 29.27°, 32.46°, 36.71°, 46.61° and 49.80°, corresponding to the (012), (104), (110), (113), (202), (024), (116), (300), (128), and (226) crystal plane indices, respectively. These are related to NaTi2(PO4)3 and are consistent with the standard maps of the phases (PDF#33-1296). No characteristic peaks of carbon were detected in the XRD spectra, indicating that the carbon existed in the amorphous form in both NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 composites.  
The morphology of the NTP@C-1 composite was observed using field-emission SEM (FESEM), as shown in Fig. 2. The spherical structures with diameters of 4–8 m can be observed in the panoramic image in Fig. 2a, while the presence of numerous nanoparticles on the surface of these spheres can be seen in Fig. 2b. A careful examination of the high-magnification FESEM images in Fig. 2c–e confirms that the surfaces of the microspheres were composed of irregular particles of size 300–500 nm, and that the surface of the NTP@C-1 composite microsphere is rough. The rough surfaces and internal pores of the microspheres are favorable for electrolyte infiltration and ion diffusion. 
The TEM and HRTEM images of the NTP@C-1 composite are presented in Fig. 3. The TEM image in Fig. 3a reveals that the NTP@C-1 composite microsphere is a solid structure of diameter 4.5 􀀁m, while Figs. 3b–d show that the surface of microsphere is not smooth. The microspheres are seen to be composed of irregular nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 150–500 nm. The circular segment in Fig. 3d is examined in greater detail in the HRTEM images in Figs. 3e and f. Here, clear lattice streaks and a uniform amorphous carbon layer can be observed, indicating the good crystallinity of the NTP@C-1 microsphere and the successful carbon coating. The lattice fringe spacing was measured as 0.404 nm, which is very close to the distance (d) between the successive (110) faces of the rhombohedral NaTi2(PO4)3. A careful observation of Fig. 3f reveals that the amorphous carbon layer is approximately 3.3 nm thick and is uniformly coated on the surface of the NaTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticle.  The FESEM images of the NTP@C-2 microsphere are presented in Fig. S1 of the electronic supporting information (ESI), and the corresponding TEM and HRTEM images are presented in Fig. S2. There, the NTP@C-2 composite is also seen to have spherical structures of diameter 2–10 µm, but their surfaces are smooth with no internal pores, and the amorphous carbon layer is only about 1.8 nm thick. Because the NTP@C-1 microspheres were prepared using disodium EDTA as the starting material, whereas the NTP@C-2 microspheres were prepared using trisodium citrate dihydrate, the different morphologies of the two products can be attributed to the different sodium sources. Compared with trisodium citrate, disodium EDTA not only has the longer molecular chain but also has two free carboxyl groups. Hence, when preparing the slurry used for spray drying, the carboxyl groups of EDTA allow it to serve as the surfactant while the longer chains serve to disperse the materials more evenly and effectively increase the viscosity of the slurry. This may be more conducive to the acquisition of the secondary structure of the NTP@C-1 product. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) gas sorptometry measurements were conducted to further examine the specific surface area and pores of the as-prepared products. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm and pore-size distributions of the NPT@C-1 and NPT@C-2 are given in Figs. S3 and S4, respectively. The BET surface area of the NPT@C-1 was found to be 25.31 m2/g, which is a clear increase compared to that of the NPT@C-2 (i.e. 19.72 m2/g). This demonstrates that the surface area of the material is influenced by the surface roughness and secondary structure. In addition, the NPT@C-1 possesses a cumulative pore volume of 0.096 cm3/g, which is much larger than that of the NPT@C-2 (0.019 cm3/g). The pore-size distributions of the two samples also differ significantly, with that of the NPT@C-1 falling into the size range of 20-150 nm, while that of the NPT@C-2 is limited to 1-15 nm.  
The carbon in the NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 composites was qualitatively analyzed using Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. The Raman spectrum of the NTP@C-1 composite (Fig. 4a) displays two clear carbon peaks at 1350 and 1600 cm-1. The peak around 1350 cm-1 is also known as the D-band and is attributed to the A1g vibrational mode of the carbon atom, while the peak at 1600 cm-1, or G-band, corresponds to the carbon E2g vibrational mode [50]. The Raman spectrum of the NTP@C-2 microspheres (Fig. 4b) is similar to that of the NTP@C-1 microspheres, confirming the presence of carbon in both composites. In order to calculate the degree of graphitization of the carbon layer quantitatively, the D and G bands were deconvoluted into four peaks (marked as 1-4 in Fig. 4). The splitting peaks at 1200 cm-1 and 1500 cm-1 are related to the SP3 type carbon, while the other splitting peaks at 1350 cm-1 and 1590 cm-1 are related to the SP2 type carbon. [51, 52] The integral area ratio of SP3 and SP2 (Asp3/Asp2) is 1.38 for NTP@C-1 and 1.98 for NTP@C-2, thus indicating that the carbon layer of NTP@C-1 is the more highly graphitized and that the NTP@C-1 would be expected to have better electronic conductivity. In addition, elemental analysis was used to accurately determine the carbon contents of the NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 composites to be 5.01% and 1.43%, respectively. These data are presented in Table S1 in the ESI.  The results of the elemental analysis were further confirmed via thermogravimetric (TG) analysis under a flow of air, as shown in Fig. 4c. The results indicate that the weight of the NTP@C-1 microsphere was reduced by approximately 0.64% in the temperature range of 30–400 °C, which demonstrates that the original moisture content in the sample was 0.64%. The weight of the product was further reduced by about 4.95% in the temperature range of 400 °C to 900 °C, thus indicating that the carbon content of the sample was 4.95%. This is consistent with the value obtained by elemental analysis (Table S1). As indicated in Fig. 4d, the carbon content of the NTP@C-2 microspheres was only 1.4%, which is also consistent with the elemental analysis data. All these results are consistent with the original design expectations. Compared to trisodium citrate, disodium EDTA possesses longer carbon chains and a higher carbon content in its molecular structure, which leads to products with higher carbon contents. Further, this result indicates that it is easy to control the carbon content in the products by changing the sodium source. It is also notable that the N element can be clearly detected by the elemental analysis method (0.89%, Table S1) and by the XPS spectra, thus indicating that nitrogen from the disodium EDTA can be doped into the carbon coating layer. 
The chemical compositions of the NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 materials were analyzed by the XPS method, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. The XPS spectra of NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 in Fig. 5a both clearly reveal the presence of the elements Na, Ti, P, O, and C, whereas the element N is detected only in the spectrum of NTP@C-1. The presence of N in the NTP@C-1 can be attributed to the disodium EDTA, which is known to have two N atoms in its molecular structure. The high-resolution C 1s spectrum in Fig.5b shows the resolved double peaks centered at 284.6 and 286.3 eV, corresponding to the C‒C, and C‒N/O components in the structure [53]. Meanwhile, the components resolved in the N 1s spectrum (Fig.5c) are centered at 398.2 and 400.6 eV, corresponding to the pyridinic N and the pyrrolic/pyridone N, respectively [53]. This N-doping not only provides additional diffusion channels and active sites for Na+ insertion via the generation of defects, but also enhances the electronic conductivity of carbon. In addition, the splitted doublet centered at about 465.9 and 459.9 eV in the Ti 2p spectrum (Fig.5d) is attributed respectively to the Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 of Ti in the NTP. Moreover, the Ti4+ 2p3/2 peak can be further fit to two peaks at 460.3 and 459.2 eV, while Ti4+ 2p1/2 peak can be further fit to two peaks at 466.2 and 465.1 eV. This result indicates that there are very little differences for the six Ti-O bonds in TiO6 octahedra, which forms unique three dimensional open framework structure by connections with PO4 tetrahedra by sharing all their corner oxygen atoms[14].
The electrochemical properties of the NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 composites were evaluated using a button cell and sodium metal as the counter electrode, as shown in Fig. 6. The typical voltage capacity profiles for the obtained NTP@C-1 composite after 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 cycles at a high current rate of 5 C are presented in Fig. 6a, with calculated overpotentials of 370, 470, 440, 423, 459, and 496 mV, respectively. This indicates a gradual decrease in the cycle performance, accompanied by an increase in the degree of polarization, with increased number of charging and discharging cycles, and a tendency to stabilize after 1000 cycles. As indicated in Fig. 6b, the discharge capacity values of the NTP@C-1 electrode material after 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 cycles are, respectively, 105.26, 98.10, 94.94, 91.05, 81.78, and 73.47 mAh/g; the corresponding charge capacity values are 105.26, 98, 95.15, 91.05, 82, and 73.37 mAh/g; and the corresponding coulombic efficiency values are 100%, 99.93%, 100.21%, 100%, 100.21%, and 99.97%. Hence, the charge–discharge capacity of the material exhibits good cycling stability. The rate performance diagram of the NTP@C-1 material in the range of 1–20 C is presented in Fig. 6c. The charge–discharge specific capacity at the low current rate of 1 C reached 113.6 mAh/g, but when the charge–discharge rate was gradually increased to 2, 5, 10, and 20 C, the corresponding specific capacity values were 107.6, 94.4, 82.5, and 72.6 mAh/g. On the same scale, the charge–discharge curves tended to be a straight line, indicating that the material has good cycling ability. Moreover, upon returning to 1 C under a high-rate cycle tests, the charge–discharge specific capacity returned to 113 mAh/g, thus demonstrating good rate reversibility. By contrast, the overpotential values of the NTP@C-2 after 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 cycles (Fig. 6d) were 370, 540, 550, 583, 576, and 576 mV, respectively; the corresponding discharge capacity values (Fig. 6e) were 72.3, 61.2, 52.9, 50.3, 50.2, and 50.3 mAh/g, and the corresponding charge capacity values were 73.1, 61.2, 53, 50.3, 50.2, and 50.3 mAh/g. Hence, the rate capacities of the NTP@C-2 are lower than those of the NTP@C-1, as shown in Fig. 6f. From the above comparison, it can be seen that the NTP@C-1 has a higher battery capacity, smaller polarizability, and better stability than the NTP@C-2. This may be because the micro-nano structure of the NTP@C-1 facilitates and accelerates the insertion and de-insertion of sodium ions. At the same time, the micro-nano structure enhances the charge-discharge stability of the NTP@C-1 material. As a result, the specific capacity of the NTP@C-1 remains relatively stable during the first 1000 cycles and only begins to significantly decrease with additional cycles, whereas the decay of the NTP@C-2 becomes obvious during the first 500 cycles. This may also be attributed to the higher carbon content of the NTP@C-1, which helps to increase the electronic conductivity of the material. 
The data of the present study are compared with those of previous research on the synthesis and electrochemical properties of NaTi2(PO4)3/carbon composites, see Table S2. The NPT@C-1 prepared in the present study is has a higher specific capacity than that of previously-reported NaTi2(PO4)3/carbon composites such as NPT/C and NTP/CMK-3, as well as a similar specific capacity and rate capability to those of NPT/C nanofibers prepared by electrospinning. In addition, while the unique properties of graphene generally provide NPT/graphene (NPT/G) composites with excellent rate performance, the NPT@C-1 material prepared herein displays a similar rate performance along with a better cycle stability and a longer cycle life. Moreover, the NPT@C-1 has a simpler preparation process than those of the NPT/C nanofibers or NPT/G materials, thus making it more suitable for large-scale production e.g. as a potential sodium ion anode material. 
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) obtained by scanning two NTP@C composite electrodes within a potential window of 1.5-3.0 V (vs. Na/Na+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV/s is presented in Fig. 7a. Here, a pair of redox peaks can be observed at 2.22 and 1.98 V for the NTP@C-1 composite, and at 2.29 and 2.0 V for the NTP@C-2 composite. These redox peaks characterize the oxidation and reduction reactions of Ti3+/Ti4+ through a two-phase reaction mechanism, as shown by the following formula:
This gives calculated overpotentials of 246 mV for the NTP@C-1 and 333 mV for NTP@C-2 is. The notably smaller overpotential of NTP@C-1 may be due to the high carbon content in the material along with a small amount of doped N, which effectively improves the electrochemical performance by providing the electrode with lower electrochemical polarization and high reversibility. The CV curves of NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 at first, third and fifth cycle are presented in Fig. S5 and Fig. S6. From the third circle, the curves of NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 both gradually overlap, indicating that the electrodes are stabilizing. To better understand the electrode dynamics of NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2, AC impedance tests were performed on the fresh coin-type cells and the results are presented in Fig. 7b. Here, the EIS data are composed of straight lines in the low frequency range and semicircles in the medium and high frequency ranges. The equivalent circuit used to fit the experimental data and thus obtain the circuit parameters is shown in the inset in Fig. 7b. EIS patterns of the 2000th cycled NTP@C-1 and NTP@C-2 electrodes at 5 C rate were also co1lected, and shown in Fig. S7. The Nyquist plot consists of a straight line in the low frequency region and a semicircle in the mid–high frequency region. The straight line represents the speed of ion diffusion (Zw), and the semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance between the electrolyte and electrode material (Rct). The charge transfer resistance of NTP@C-1 at fresh coin and 2000th cycled coin are about 291 and 503.6  respectively, which is smaller than those of NTP@C-2 (about 447.5 and 863.7 􀀂). This indicates that the increase in carbon content reduces the overpotential of the NTP material during charging and discharging and improves the effective transport of ions/electrons between the anode and cathode materials and the electrolyte.  
The conductivity of the NTP material itself is poor, but when it forms composites with carbon, the conductivity of the material is enhanced. The microstructures assembled by the nanoparticles are stable and will not collapse during the process of charging and discharging. The micro-nano structure can shorten the transmission distances of electrons and ions, and the transmission resistance of the electrolyte in the micro-nano structure is smaller, which is conducive to the penetration of the electrolyte. In this study, NTP@C microspheres with different carbon concentrations (5% and 1.4%) were prepared. The electrochemical performance of the NTP@C-1 composite with a carbon content of 5% was proven to be better than that of the NTP@C-2 composite with a carbon content of 1.4%, which may be attributed to the better conductivity of the NTP@C-1. The discharge capacity values of the NTP@C-1 electrode at 5 C after 1, 1000, and 2000 cycles were 105.26, 91.05, and 73.47 mAh/g, respectively, and the corresponding charge capacity values were 105.26, 91.05, and 73.37 mAh/g, with coulombic efficiencies of 100%, 100%, and 99.97%, respectively. By contrast, the discharge capacity values of the NTP@C-2 electrodes after 1, 1000, and 2000 cycles were only 72.3, 50.3, and 50.3 mAh/g. The overpotential of the NTP@C-1 electrode was lower than that of the NTP@C-2 electrode and was more stable during cycling. The EIS test indicated a charge transfer resistance of about 291 􀀂 for the NTP@C-1, which was smaller than the ~447.5 􀀂 of the NTP@C-2. This indicates that the increase in carbon content may reduce the overpotential of the NTP material during charging and discharging as well as improving the efficient transport of ions/electrons between the anode and cathode materials and electrolyte. The stability of the microsphere structure is also beneficial to ultra-long cycling, indicating that the NTP@C is a promising material for SIBs with many desirable properties.
