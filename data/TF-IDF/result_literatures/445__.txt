Various glass samples with general formula Na3+x[ZrxSc2-x(PO4)3] (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mol%) have been synthesized using the melt quenching technique. The as synthesized glass samples have been heat treated at and above their crystallization temperatures for different heat treating schedules (3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 h). The major crystalline phases such as Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (ICSD-27740) (NASICON), ZrO2 (ICSD-66781) and Zr2O(PO4)2 (ICSD-15084) have been observed in XRD traces of all the glass-ceramic samples. The glass-ceramic sample containing x = 0.5 mol% of ZrO2 (Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3) precipitates as only one major NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) with high intensity which creates large number of vacancies with positive deficiency due to the partial replacement of the Zr4+ ions with Sc3+ ions. The impure crystalline phases (ZrO2 and Zr2O(PO4)2) which are precipitated in the glass-ceramic samples, expected to block the conduction pathways for the migration of Na+ ions between grains of glass network resulting in reduction in the bulk conductivity. The bulk conductivity ((σb = t/(Rb·A)) obtained by using bulk resistance (Rb) is the highest (σ = 9.47 × 10−4 S/cm) for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample (heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h), measured at 303 K and also retained its higher chemical stability when exposed to air even up to 60 days.

Despite successful research efforts in the field of solid-state rechargeable Li-ion battery technology especially for use in large-scale applications (automotive and grid storage), several key components including materials cost and safety are yet to be resolved satisfactorily for their better practical applicability [[1], [2], [3]]. In order to develop cost effective higher capacity cells, ambient temperature sodium ion battery technology appear to be an excellent choice [[4], [5], [6]]. Though, Lisingle bond ion and Nasingle bondion batteries share same operating principle, Na-ions cannot diffuse rapidly into the active centres during the process of fast charging as Na+ ion (1.02 Å) is 70% heavier than Li+ ion (0.76 Å). There is a lack of suitable electrode materials which, subsequently limits the performance of the Na-ion battery. Among three components of a battery, electrolyte plays a significant role to achieve high rate capability, high voltage and long cycle ability. Hence, optimization of suitable electrolyte between two successful electrodes would realize safer and room temperature Na-ion batteries [7,8]. Considerable attention has been devoted so far on the synthesis and characterization of solid electrolytes with crystalline as well as amorphous materials [9,10]. Among these materials for electrolytes, the focus has been more intense on the glass and glass-ceramic electrolytes compared to the polycrystalline ceramic electrolytes. This is due to the fact that the former can be synthesized in a wide range of compositions, and are free from grain boundaries. Also, glass and glass-ceramic electrolytes exhibit better ionic conductivity via single or modifier ion conduction mechanism and even possess more open disordered structures [[11], [12], [13]].

There are reports on the synthesis of glass and glass-ceramic electrolytes/electrodes in different forms by various techniques such as melt quenching, thermal evaporation, high energy mechanical milling and sol–gel method [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Nevertheless, it was perceived that glass materials crystallized with conducting phases such as NASICON type structure exhibit superior ionic conductivity due to the decrease in grain boundary resistance which creates fast diffusion pathways for Na+ ions. Based on these facts, Sodiumsingle bondZirconium-scandium-phosphate glass network is a preferred glass network in this investigation due to its high Na+ ion conductivity. The main reason for the selection of Sc2O3 and ZrO2 as network modifier oxides in the Nasingle bondP glass network is their almost similar ionic radius. However, the inter-replacement of Sc3+ (74.5 p.m.) ion with Zr4+ (72.0 p.m.) in the Nasingle bondP glass network is expected to create positive charge deficient active centres with which Na+ ion can react. Furthermore, variation of Sc2O3 and ZrO2 contents in the Nasingle bondP glass network would alter the number of vacancies. Hayashi and his group has been working successfully on the synthesis, characterization, functional properties of glass and glass-ceramic electrolytes and their applicability in the form of half and full cell [11,[18], [19], [20]]. In addition, our group has been successfully synthesized glass and glass-ceramic based electrodes [13,14,16]. However, current challenge is to investigate, characterize and optimize suitable glass-ceramic electrolyte and also engineer the desired properties to provide stable interfacial contact. In view of this, it is worthy to monitor the variation of structural and EIS studies as a function of inter-replacement of Sc3+ ion with Zr4+ in the Nasingle bondP glass network which is the objective of present investigation.

Analytical reagent-grade chemicals of Na2CO3 (sigma aldrich, 99%), NH4H2PO4 (sigma aldrich, 99%), Sc2O3 (sigma aldrich, 99%) and ZrO2 (sigma aldrich, 99%) were used to prepare precursor glass samples via melt quenching technique in three steps. Firstly, powder mixtures are well grounded in agate mortar and pestle and pre-heated at 250 °C in an electric furnace to remove volatile compounds. Secondly, the mixer was melted at 1350 °C ± 10 °C for about 2 h until a bubble-free liquid was formed. The resultant melt was quenched on the brass plate and rolled by copper roller yield to form a glass. Further, high energy ball milling method was used for 30 h to form the homogeneous nanoscaled glass powders. Differential thermal analysis of all the glass and glass-ceramic samples is obtained by SII EXSTAR 6300 with a heating rate of 10 K/min. As synthesized precursor glasses are heat treated at and above their corresponding Tc for 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 h respectively in a tubular electric furnace. PANanalytical Diffractometer B.V fitted with Cu target (both K(α1+α2) wavelengths) and Ni filter at 40 kV and 30 mA (2 h range) is used to obtain phase details of glass and glass-ceramic samples. High resolution FE-SEM (Model: Gemini Zeiss SupraTM 35 VP, Carl Zeiss, Germany) is used to analyze microstructure of glass-ceramic samples. Green pellets were pressed with 160 Mpa with 10 mm diameter and then stainless steels plates were attached to both sides of the pellets as electrodes. Solatron 1260 Impedance/Gain Phase analyzer is used to evaluate electrical conductivities of all the glass and glass-ceramic samples (10 Hz-106 Hz; 303–423 K). Electrochemical window of best conducting sample is carried out by electrochemical work station (scan rate: 5 mV/s, voltage range: 1 and 5.5 V (vs Na+/Na)) at room temperature. Sodium foil and stain less steel disk were used as the counter and reference electrode and working electrodes.

DTA spectra of Na3+x[ZrxSc2-x(PO4)3] (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mol%) precursor glass samples, are shown by the dotted curves in Fig. 1. Glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallization temperature (Tc) are evaluated from the curves of DTA spectra (Fig. 1). The values of Tg slowly decreases from 868 K to 759 K when the ZrO2 content increases from 0 mol% to 0.5 mol%, resulting in the highest de-polymerisability in Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic network compared to all the other samples under investigation. Beyond 0.5 mol% of ZrO2 content, the value of Tg starts increasing which indicates the presence of strain in the sample. The crystallization of a glass sample normally starts just below its crystallization temperature (Tc) and further the same will be transferred to glass-ceramic by heat treating them at and above ‘Tc’ within given heat treating schedule which we have adopted in this investigation. DTA spectra of all the glass-ceramic samples after the heat treatment for about 3 h is shown in solid curves in Fig. 1. It is again proved in this investigation that the free energy of crystalline phase after heat treating the glass sample (glass-ceramic) is less than the glass phase of glass sample before its heat treatment (Table 1). The value of crystallization temperature for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass sample (x = 0.5 mol%) is observed to be lowest (Tc = 908 K) before and after heat treatment for 3 h which is directly ascribed due to partial substitution of tetravalent Zr4+ ions by trivalent Sc3+ ions (Table 1). This creates positive charge deficient vacancies in the glass network with which Na+ ion reacts, which influences the ion conducting features of the sample. It is also obvious that the DTA parameters (Tg, Tc, Tm and ΔT) of all the glass samples (before heat treatment) are lower than glass-ceramics (after heat treatment) (Fig. 1). In addition, the best glass stability parameter (ΔT) of Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass sample (ΔT = 149 K, glass sample) compared to all the samples under investigation is also retained even after heat treatment (ΔT = 147 K, glass-ceramic sample) (Table 1) [13]. The correlation between stability parameter (ΔT) and conductivity (log (σ)) as a function of ZrO2 content of glass and glass ceramic samples, is depicted in Fig. 2. Here, the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 sample exhibited the highest thermal stability and also achieved the best bulk conductivity before and after heat treatment [21,22].

Fig. 3 shows the XRD traces of all the glass-ceramic samples. The absence of peaks for ZrO2 free glass sample (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) confirms its amorphous nature (Fig. 3). Full pattern of all the traces of XRD which has given more than 90% of precursor compound along with major and minor crystalline phases such as Na3Sc2(PO4)3(ICSD -27740) (NASICON), ZrO2 (ICSD-66781) and Zr2O(PO4)2 (ICSD-1922), is matched with Rietveld refinement. Among these phases, NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) stands for higher stability and ionic conductivity, and this has been identified in our present glass-ceramic samples along with its glassy phase. It is highly significant that the best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample precipitates only as a major NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) with high intensity which creates large number of vacancies with positive deficiency due to the partial replacement of Zr4+ ions by Sc3+ ions. In turn, these positive vacancies are substituted by Na+ ions in the NASICON (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) structure, which paves a way to achieve highest ionic conductivity as reflected in Fig. 2. All the other samples show some new phases indexed with ZrO2 and Zr2O(PO4)2 which are identified as impure phases [23]. Further, the intensity of XRD peaks gradually increases from x = 0–0.5 mol% of ZrO2 due to precipitation of NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3). Beyond 0.5 mol% of ZrO2, the intensity started decreasing which occurs due to the growth of impure crystalline phases such as ZrO2 and Zr2O(PO4)2 during the process of crystallization. These impure crystalline phases are responsible to shrink conducting path ways to fill the positive charge deficient vacancies by Na+ ions, leading to lower ionic conductivity. Williamson-Hall (Wsingle bondH) plots of all the Na3+x[ZnxSc2-x(PO4)3] glass-ceramic samples are presented in Fig. 4 and the average crystallite size of all the samples varied between 57 nm and 115 nm. In order to understand the correlation between conditions of heat treatment with ion conducting features, the XRD investigations are further extended by heat treating best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample at various temperatures at Tc and above Tc (908 K, 973 K, 1023 K and 1073 K) for 5 h (Fig. 5). Herein, the peak intensity related to NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3) increases from 908 K to 1023 K. However, the impure peaks due to the precipitation of Zr2O(PO4)2 and ZrO2 phases started appearing when the heat treating temperature raises beyond 1023 K which clearly specify that crystallizing this sample above 1023 K is not advisable as impure phases resist the diffusion of Na+ ions into the active centres of the glass network due to its blocking effect as explained earlier [22,24,25]. Hence, the analysis on XRD results coupled with impedance data pointed out that best heat treating temperature is 1023 K which is our focus of interest in the following sections. Furthermore, it is motivating to monitor the XRD investigations of best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample as a function of various heat treatment schedules at 1023 K (Fig. 6a). It is obvious that the intensity of NASICON phase is observed to be highest with the absence of impure phases when sample is heat treated for 10 h (Fig. 6a). The average crystallite size is also recorded to be lowest for 10 h of heat treatment as reflected in Williamson-Hall (Wsingle bondH) plots (Fig. 6b) which definitely creates wider active centres with which Na+ ion reacts leading to boosting of the ion conducting features. In order to support this statement, we have calculated unit cell volumes at 1023 K for all the heat treatment schedules. The highest unit cell volume is recorded to be 1040.30 Å for 10 h of heat treatment schedule which justifies that this sample possesses highest de-polymerisability. Table 2 shows calculated and experimental structure parameters of best conducting glass-ceramic sample (Na3.5[Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3]) heat treated at 1023 K for 5, 10, 15 and 20 h.

Fig. 7 is presented on SEM images of Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic sample surfaces, heat treated at 1023 K for 5, 10, 15 and 20 h respectively. Microstructure of all these surfaces are dense in nature along with thin grain boundaries, however, fracture pattern is different for different heat treatment time periods (Fig. 7). When the heat treatment schedule increases from 5 to 10 h, the shape of grains become uniform and their boundaries clearly separated with increase in its aggregate size from 50 nm to 100 nm (Fig. 7 a, b & c) which lowers the lower grain boundary resistance (Rgb) leading to highest bulk conductivity at 1023 K for 10 h. From 10 h to 20 h of heat treating schedule, massive crystallization occurs in the glass-ceramic samples which are responsible for the formation of the impure crystalline phases (ZrO2 and Zr2O(PO4)2). These impurities directly block the conduction pathways for the migration of Na+ ions between grains of glass network resulting in the reduction of bulk conductivity (Fig. 7 c & d) [23,26].

Fig. 8 shows the complex impedance spectra (Z″ vs. Z′) obtained at 303 K for best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample, heat treated at 908 K, 923 K, 1023 K and 1073 K respectively for 10 h. Here, there are two contributions can be seen: (i) the single semicircular arc at high frequency region occurs due to the influence of bulk effects on the sample which stands for its bulk resistance (Rb), corresponding to each experimental temperature (ii) a spike in the low frequency region is observed which is directly related to blocking of Na+ ions by metallic electrode (Ag). The bulk conductivity ((σb = t/(Rb·A)) is obtained by using bulk resistance (Rb) is the highest for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h (σ = 9.47 × 10−4 S/cm, at 303 K) (Fig. 8) (Table 3), which indicates that this sample shows a free void path for migration of Na+ ions due to the partial substitutions of trivalent Sc3+ ions by tetravalent Zr4+ as suggested by microstructural studies. The blocking of Na+ ions in the glass-ceramic network by the electrode polarization due to increase in the grain boundary resistance and the formation of grains and cracks, leading to decrease in the ionic conductivity when the heat treating temperature increased from 1023 K to 1073 K for 10 h. Table 3 summarizes the bulk conductivity (σb) and activation energy (Eaσ) of highest conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample heat treated at various temperatures above Tc for different holding time schedules.

Furthermore, the analyzed impedance data is used to evaluate the bulk conductivities of Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 sample, measured between 303 and 423 K for different holding times (5 h, 10 h, 15 h and 20 h) at 1023 K and presented in Fig. 9 (log σT vs 1000/T plots). Here, the ionic conductivity is observed to increase with increase in temperature which is ascribed to the ion hopping conduction mechanism. Only one region can be seen in Arrhenius conductivity plot (Fig. 9) which shows the single activation energy of the sample at each and every experimental temperature. Inset of Fig. 9 shows the activation energy (Eaσ) as a function of heat treatment schedule, measured at 303 K which exhibits non-linear behavior of conductivity versus the activation energy. The formation of lowest grains and grain boundary resistance for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h, is expected to create wider channels in Nasingle bondZrsingle bondP network, which might be the reason for the lowest activation energy (0.423 eV) and highest ionic conductivity ((σ = 9.47 × 10−4 S/cm) (Inset of Fig. 9). However, the massive crystallization of the sample, heat treated above 10 h which hinders conduction pathways for the migration of Na+ ions, leads to increase in the total resistance (grain and grain boundary) and decrease in conductivity as suggested in SEM studies. Table 3 summarizes the electrical conductivity and activation energy of the best conducting sample (Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3) at each experimental temperature.

It is speculated that electrochemical window is appreciable especially in case of glass and glass-ceramic materials compared to its crystalline counter parts [11,27]. The electrochemical stability of best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic electrolyte sample heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h is monitored by electro-chemical window test. Where, as synthesized glass-ceramic electrolyte is sandwiched with sodium metal foil as a counter electrode and aluminum disk as a working electrode respectively (Fig. 10). Two oxidation peaks observed at 0.034 V and 0.55 V is due to intercalation and de-intercalation of Na+ ions in the glass network. However, reduction currents measured at 0.25 V, occurred obviously due to the formation of NASICON-type crystalline phases with high intensity as suggested in xrd analysis. Eventually, highest Nasingle bondion conductivity and chemical stability are the key factors in order to realize highly efficient solid electrolyte especially for use in Na-ion batteries. As a matter of fact, it is worth to correlate ion conductivity against stability of best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass sample and also glass-ceramic sample heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h of heat treating schedule, exposed to air for 15, 30, 45 and 60 days respectively (Fig. 11). Here, the glass-ceramic electrolyte sample seems to exhibit higher chemical stability than the corresponding glass sample as it retains its ionic conductivity when exposed to air even up to 60 days (Fig. 11). When summing up the results together, the wider electrochemical stability along with the best bulk conductivity of the Na3+x[ZrxSc2-x(PO4)3] glass-ceramic electrolyte network reflected its better applicability as a potential candidate between the electrodes to realize safer Na-ion battery.

The thermal stability parameter (ΔT = 149 K) against crystallization is found to be the highest for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 composition, both before and after heat treatment at different temperatures. XRD spectra of Na3+x[ZrxSc2-x(PO4)3] glass-ceramic samples confirms that major and minor crystalline phases such as Na3Sc2(PO4)3(ICSD -27740) (NASICON), ZrO2 (ICSD-66781) and Zr2O(PO4)2 (ICSD-15084) are precipitated during the transfer of glass into glass-ceramic. Among these phases, NASICON type phase (Na3Sc2(PO4)3), which stands for higher stability and ionic conductivity, could be identified in our present glass-ceramic samples along with glass phase. The volume of unit cell is largest for the Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 sample heat treated at 1023 K for 10 h of holding time (1040.30 Å), which supports that the present glass-ceramic sample is highly de-polymerized at this particular point of temperature. This is ascribed to the partial substitution of tetravalent Zr4+ by trivalent Sc3+ ions within the Na3Sc2(PO4)3 (NASICON) structure. The SEM microstructure of Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic sample reveals that the grain boundaries clearly separated with slight increase in its aggregate size from 50 nm to 100 nm which lowers grain boundary resistance (Rgb) leading to achieve highest bulk conductivity (9.47 × 10−4 S/cm, at 303 K) and lowest activation energy (0.423 eV, at 303 K) at 1023 K for 10 h. CV studies of the best conducting Na3.5Zr0.5Sc1.5(PO4)3 glass-ceramic electrolyte possesses a wide electrochemical window up to 5.5 V. The Na3+x[ZrxSc2-x(PO4)3 (x = 0.5 mol%)] composition exhibits best bulk conductivity and higher chemical stability when exposed to air for long time which could be more compatible as an efficient electrolyte for use in ambient conditions leading to safer Nasingle bondion batteries.
