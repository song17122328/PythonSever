In an attempt to improve the CO2 sensing properties of NASICON (Na conductor)-based potentiometric device attached with In2O3 at room temperature, Na3PO4, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 were introduced as single-components or combinations in the CO2 sensing layer of the device. Although, the original device suffered disturbance by humidity seriously, the disturbance could be reduced effectively, in some case almost completely, in the resulting modi®ed devices, while the sensitivity to CO2 could be even promoted. The best device obtained, for which both of Na3PO4 and NaHCO3 were introduced, showed fairly excellent sensing characteristics, i.e. high sensitivity to CO2 and high resistance to disturbance by humidity at 308C. The emf of the device was linear to the logarithm of CO2 concentration in the range 300± 3000 ppm following well the Nernst equation for a 1.2 electron-reduction of CO2. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Carbon dioxide sensing has become important for green house conditioning, room-air monitoring and various measurements of breath and bio-related activities. Among the compact solid-state CO2 sensors so far reported [1±9], those potentiometric sensors for which a solid electrolyte-based electrochemical cell is attached with an auxiliary layer of metal carbonate are quite attractive with their excellent CO2 sensing performances. However, the devices of this type need to be operated at elevated temperature (4008C or above), which gives rise to limitations in their applications. If CO2 sensing at room temperature becomes available, a heater can be eliminated from the sensor device so that the device can be simpler and operated more easily by batteries. This possibility has been increased by the recent reports of the potentiometric CO2 sensors for which a NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12)-based cell is attached with a metal oxide such as SnO2 and In2O3 [10±15]. The key of the sensors of this type seems to be held by the metal oxides attached.

However, the role of the oxides is not understood well, beyond the speculation that they work as an oxide sensing electrode. These sensor devices can be operated at room temperature and detects CO2 in the concentration range of 300±3000 ppm under wet conditions. Unfortunately, however, the devices are apt to suffer disturbance by humidity. In this situation, we tried to ®nd a way to eliminate or reduce the disturbance by humidity from the new type sensor devices. As a result, it was found that introduction of Na3PO4 and NaHCO3 in the sensing layer followed by water dripping is quite effective for this purpose, while the addition of NaHCO3 is effective in increasing the sensitivity to CO2. The device modi®ed with Na3PO4 and NaHCO3,thus, showed fairly good CO2 sensing properties almost free of the disturbance by humidity. This paper describes how the sensing characteristics of the devices change with the introduction of modi®ers.

with dry synthetic air and the wet synthetic air which had been humidi®ed by bubbling through water. The concentration of CO2 and relative humidity were varied in the ranges of 300±3000 ppm and 0±70%, respectively. With the counter electrode always exposed to static atmospheric air, the sample gases were let to ¯ow over the sensing electrode at a rate of 0.1 dm3 min 1. The electromotive force (emf) of the sensing device was measured with a digital electrometer (Advantest, TR-8652).

3.1. CO2 sensing properties of basic device

The basic device, attached with a layer of In2O3 only beside the Au electrode (Fig. 1 (a)), was examined for CO2 sensing properties under various relative humidities (RHs) at 308C. Fig. 2 shows the emf values as a function of CO2 concentration (300±3000 ppm). Under a constant RH, the emf was linear to the logarithm of CO2 concentration. However, the linear correlation shifted up markedly with increasing RH. The slopes of the linear correlations at various RHs were almost the same to each other. If the Nernst equation is assumed to be applicable, the slopes indicated n  1:8, where n is the number of reaction electrons associated with the electrochemical reduction of CO2. It is known that n falls at 2.0 when the NASICON-based device attached with a carbonate auxiliary phase is operated at elevated temperature (400±5008C). In view of the value of n, the present device seems to work fairly well as a CO2 sensor even at room temperature (308C). It is obvious that a serious problem of this device is the heavy disturbance by humidity.

3.2. Modified with foreign substances

At a glance, the basic device has no apparent auxiliary phase, which acts the decisive role to mediate between

NASICON, 9 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick, were prepared as described, elsewhere [15]. For the basic device (a), an Au mesh was attached on one side of NASICON disk by applying gold paste over it (layer thickness 100 mm), followed by calcining at 8008C for 2 h. On top of it, a small amount of In2O3 paste was applied about 1 mm thick and calcined at 7508C for 2 h. The disk was ®xed on the end of a quartz glass tube (9 mm in diameter) with an inorganic adhesive. As a reference electrode, platinum paste was applied on the reverse side of the disk and contacted to a Pt-wire.

For the modi®ed devices (b), small quantities of Na3PO4, Na2CO3 and/or NaHCO3 were intentionally introduced in the region around the Au mesh and the porous layer of gold. To introduce Na3PO4 or Na2CO3, the powder of each compound was mixed with a-terpineol containing 5 wt.% ethyl cellulose and the resulting paste was applied on the surface of the NASICON disk. Then gold paste was applied further on top together with an Au mesh, followed by application of the In2O3 paste and calcination at 8008C for 2 h. NaHCO3 was introduced into the basic device after it was fabricated. The powder of NaHCO3 was mixed with water and a small quantity of the resulting suspension was allowed to drip over the layer of In2O3 of the basic device. Gas sensing characteristics were measured in a gas-¯ow apparatus equipped with a heating facility. Sample gases consisting of air, CO2 and water vapor were prepared by mixing a parent gas of CO2 (1% CO2 in dry synthetic air)

and DemfH2O stand for the increments of emf on increasing the CO2 concentration

NASICON and gaseous CO2. It is impossible to explain the CO2 sensing properties of the basic device without postulating the presence of any kind of auxiliary phase. As such, NaHCO3 was postulated to be present at the interface by the group of Weppner [10]. NaHCO3 is not stable enough thermodynamically under the usual partial pressure of CO2, tending to decompose into Na2CO3. This suggests that Na2CO3 can also be a candidate of the auxiliary phase. In addition, NASICON may contain Na3PO4 as impurities because Na3PO4 is used as a starting material of NASICON synthesis. It is possible that Na3PO4 reacts with CO2 in humid conditions, resulting in the formation of carbonates i.e. Na3PO4  H2O  CO2 ! (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), Na2HPO4  NaHCO3 (or NaH2PO4  Na2CO3). If these compounds play the role of auxiliary phase, intentional introduction of them into the device may lead to improvements in CO2 sensing characteristics. The devices modi®ed with Na3PO4, Na2CO3 and/or NaHCO3 were, thus, fabricated.

3.4. CO2 sensing mechanism

As an attempt to increase DemfCO2 further, an aqueous suspension of NaHCO3 was dripped on the above device. The resulting device, NaHCO3  Na3PO4xH2O-modi®ed, could prove itself to have almost the highest DemfCO2 and the smallest DemfH2O among the devices tested (Fig. 3). Fig. 5 shows the emf to CO2 under 50%RH at 308C as a function of CO2. The emf was linear to the logarithm of CO2 concentration in the tested range of 300±3000 ppm. The Nernst's slope in this case gave n  1:2, a value considerably different from n  1:8 of the unmodi®ed device (Fig. 2). This means that the present device has higher sensitivity to a variation in CO2 concentration than the other. The response transients were fairly stable as shown in Fig. 6. The 90% response time to switching from 300 to 500 ppm CO2 was about 3 min, while the 90% recovery time to switching back from 3000 to 300 ppm CO2 was about 7 min. The emf values to various concentrations of CO2 were almost insensitive to a variation in RH in the range of 30±70% tested, as shown in Fig. 7. The variations of O2 concentration for sensing electrode gave no in¯uence on the emf to a ®xed CO2 concentration (1000 ppm) at 40%RH, as shown in Fig. 8.

As described so far, the NASICON-based devices fabricated here have fairly good capability of sensing CO2 at room temperature. However, the sensing properties are subjected to change rather markedly, depending on the materials introduced in the gas sensing layer. Such variability seems to originate from a lack of well-established interface to sense CO2. As stated previously, no auxiliary materials, i.e. carbonates or bicarbonates, are included explicitly in the basic (unmodi®ed) device. Its CO2 sensing properties should then be assumed to result from the action of hidden auxiliary materials present as impurities. In the case of NASICON surface, the presence of Na2CO3 or NaHCO3 as impurities is not unlikely as already pointed out. In this respect, the modi®cation of device carried out here can be considered as an effort to establish the CO2 sensing interface.

Let us assume that the auxiliary phase be NaHCO3 or Na2CO3. The CO2 sensing reactions can then be written as follows, respectively. Na  1 2Na  1

Here (ad) means adsorbed species derived from H2O or O2. It is apparent that the number of reaction electrons (n) would be 1 or 2 depending whether Eq. (1) or (2) prevails, respectively. As shown in the present study, the unmodi®ed device gave n  1:8, while the NaHCO3  Na3PO4xH2Omodi®ed one gave n  1:2. These results suggest that both of Eqs. (1) and (2) take place at various proportions depending on the kind and composition of auxiliary phases in each device. Usually emf in these devices is independent of the variation of O2 concentration. In contrast, water vapor often exerts serious in¯uences on emf, but the in¯uences are far from Nernst behavior, appearing just as the disturbance. These phenomena suggest that the O2 and H2O involved in the sensing reactions are not supplied directly from gas phase, but through some form of absorption in the sensing layer.

1. The basic device using NASICON and In2O3 suffers

serious disturbance by humidity.

2. Introduction of Na3PO4, Na2CO3 or NaHCO3 in the device is effective for reducing the humidity disturbance. The disturbance is eliminated almost completely by the introduction of Na3PO4, followed by dripping water.

3. NaHCO3 and/or Na2CO3 seem to work as an auxiliary phase which mediates between NASICON and gaseous CO2.
