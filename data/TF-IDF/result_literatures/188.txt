Identifying positive electrode materials capable of reversible multivalent electrochemistry in electrolytes containing divalent ions like Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ at high operating potentials remains an ongoing challenge in “beyond lithium-ion” research. Herein, we explore the Zn2+ chargestorage mechanism of a vanadium-based Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON), Na3V2(PO4)3. By using X-ray synchrotron techniques to unravel potential-dependent structure-property relationships, we ascribe the reversible electrochemical behavior of Na3V2(PO4)3 to a quasi-twostage intercalation process that involves both Na+ and Zn2+. Initial charging of Na3V2(PO4)3 leads to a Na+-extracted phase corresponding to NaV2(PO4)3, while subsequent discharge results predominantly in Na+ intercalation, followed by Zn2+ intercalation. Operando X-ray diffraction of Na3V2(PO4)3 was used to study the phase changes associated with the first charge/discharge process, while ex situ measurements were used to precisely link the changes in the crystal structure to a quasi-two-stage intercalation of Na+ and Zn2+. The corresponding changes in V oxidation state, V-O coordination, and the presence of Zn2+ were confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The results of this work present a comprehensive understanding of the charge-storage properties for a well-established NASICON structure that confers both high capacity (~100 mAh g-1) and high potential (1.35 and 1.1 V vs. Zn/Zn2+).
Widespread applications for electrochemical energy storage based on lithium-ion batteries now demand higher performance in terms of energy and power density, coupled with robust cycle life. Despite major advancements in lithium-ion batteries (LIB), a shortage of precious metals, such as cobalt, which is typically used in the positive electrode in LIBs and is sourced from only a few countries globally, is predicted. This shortage has driven the energy storage community to develop “beyond lithium-ion” technology based on earth-abundant metals, such as monovalent sodium (Na) and potassium (K) or divalent calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and zinc (Zn). Divalent metals, if used directly as a negative electrode material, can provide high capacity density compared to lithium (Li: 2061 mAh cm-3 vs. Ca: 2072 mAh cm-3, Mg: 3834 mAh cm-3, Zn: 5855 mAh cm-3), and are relatively cost-effective.However, challenges remain in identifying a positive electrode material capable of high capacity, stable cycling, and balancing the capacity of multivalent metal anodes. Moreover, a critical challenge in developing cathode materials for multivalent charge storage lies in addressing sufficient multivalent cation mobility required for reversible intercalation.
For nearly a century, zinc has been regarded as an anode-of-choice when operated in an alkaline electrolyte, owing to its versatility in pairing with various cathode materials.Yet, recent studies have shown that zinc electrochemical reactions exhibit higher reversibility in aqueous, mild-pH electrolytes. In particular, zinc acetate-based electrolytes have demonstrated high cyclability, and can also be extended to prepare acetate-based “water-in-salt” electrolytes, as previously described by Lukatskaya et al .When paired with a positive electrode material, Zn2+-intercalation becomes a necessary condition to configure what is referred to as a rechargeable zinc battery. Of note, if both anode and cathode materials support reversible Zn2+ intercalation, this type of energy-storage system should be regarded as a“zinc-ion battery”, analogous to the history of the lithium-ion battery. Therefore, it is important to understand Zn2+ intercalation into prospective positive electrode materials. 
Several materials have been studied with regards to reversible intercalation of Zn2+, with the most attention given to metal oxides (e.g. vanadium oxides and manganese oxides), metal sulfides (e.g. vanadium sulfides and molybdenum sulfides), and Prussian-blue analogues, owing to their high capacities and long-term cycling stability. In particular, layered vanadium oxides, in their hydrated form, have demonstrated phenomenal Zn2+-storage capabilities. When utilizing the inductive effect of a phosphate anion, the operating voltage can be further increased, thus potentially elevating the overall battery cell voltage. Therefore, we chose to use a vanadium phosphate-based positive electrode for this study to explore the intercalation of Zn2+ at higher voltage.
The Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON) structure (Fig. 1a), in which Na+ occupies the Wyckoff 6b (Na1) and 18e sites (Na2), has been used earlier as a positive electrode for sodiumion batteries. The intercalation of Na+ into the 18e sites has demonstrated impressive reversibility, high specific capacity, low volume expansion (~8%) and high cation mobility. Recent studies have proposed that the extraction of Na+ in the 18e sites can subsequently accommodate Zn2+ when cycled with a mild-pH Zn2+-containing electrolyte.Yet, questions regarding the position and exact mechanism of insertion of Zn2+ within the NASICON structure remain largely unclear. Herein, we investigate the potential-dependent structure–property relationships, along with chemical changes, of Na3V2(PO4)3 using X-ray synchrotron-based methods to correlate crystal structure changes with the charge/discharge operation.
For the synthesis of Na3V2(PO4)3, 5 mmol vanadium pentoxide (Alfa Aesar, 99.9%) and 35 mmol anhydrous oxalic acid (Sigma Aldrich, anhydrous >99%) were dissolved into 40 mL deionized water at 80°C until the solution turned blue. Then, 15 mmol NaOH (Sigma Aldrich, pellets >97%), 15 mmol NH4H2PO4 (Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%), and 5 mmol D(+) glucose (Alfa Aesar, 99%) were added sequentially into the solution, which was subsequently stirred for 3 h. The solution was then dried at 120°C for several hours to remove all water. The resulting powder was ground with mortar and pestle and placed into an alumina crucible for heat treatment. A two-step heat treatment was conducted under an argon atmosphere: 350°C for 2 h followed by 750°C for 8 h with a ramp rate of 5°C min–1. The microstructure and morphology of the derived Na3V2(PO4)3 powder was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which was performed on an FEI Nova 230 Nano SEM with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The residual carbon coating content was assessed to be 8 wt% using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the powder under air flow at a ramp rate of 10°C min–1 from room temperature up to 700°C (Fig. S1).
Electrochemical measurements (galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and AC impedance) were performed using a Biologic SP-150 potentiostat using a two-electrode PFA Swagelok cell with titanium rods serving as the current collectors. Working electrodes of Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) were prepared as a carbon-composite electrode comprising 70 wt.% active material, 20 wt.% conductive carbon (Super P; TIMCAL, MTI Corporation), and 10 wt.% polymeric binder (poly(vinylidene fluoride); Sigma Aldrich, average Mw ~275,000 by GPC, average Mn ~107,000, pellets), which were ground for 15 min. using an agate mortar and pestle, then doctor blading onto a 32-μm thick titanium foil (Alfa-Aesar, 99.7%) or a 15-μm thick aluminum foil (MTI Corporation) for operando X-ray diffraction. The electrodes (8 mm dia.) were dried under vacuum at 120℃ overnight before assembly. Zinc foil (Alfa-Aesar, 0.25 mm, 99.98%) served as the counter electrode and 0.5 M Zn(CH3CO2)2 (zinc acetate; Zn(OAc)2, 99.99%), prepared with 18 MΩ cm de-ionized water, was used as the supporting electrolyte. Galvanostatic cycling was performed with cut-off voltages of 0.6 and 1.8 V vs. Zn/Zn2+ while the C-rate was normalized to a nominal specific capacity of 100 mAh g-1 (1C = 100 mA g-1).
 Operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at beamline 11-3 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) using monochromatic X-rays with an incident wavelength of 0.974 Å (12.7 keV). For operando measurements, polymer pouch cells were prepared for cycling NVP electrodes, with beryllium plates used for applying pressure on both sides of the pouch cell during cycling.Cycling was carried out at C/2 while collecting X-ray diffraction patterns every 3 min with a 10 s exposure time. A Rayonics 225 area detector was used to record the XRD patterns. The X-ray data were subsequently calibrated using a LaB6 standard and processed using the GSAS-II software package.For higher resolution ex situ X-ray diffraction, measurements were carried out at beamline 2-1 at SSRL with an incident wavelength of 0.729 Å (17.0 keV). The ex situ samples were prepared by cycling the NVP electrode to the desired potential and holding at potential for 30 min, followed by disassembling the cells and rinsing the electrodes thoroughly with de-ionized water. After this rinsing procedure, the electrodes were left to dry overnight under ambient temperature and pressure. The ex situ samples were then scraped off the current collector, then loaded into glass capillaries and continuously rotated during data collection to avoid possible preferred orientation of the particles contained in the ex situ powder-composite electrodes. The TOPAS software package (Academic v6, Bruker) was used for Rietveld refinement of the ex situ electrodes to determine lattice parameters while the VESTA software package was used for crystal structure visualization.
Finally, to tie the structural changes observed in XRD to the chemical state of the species in the NVP electrode, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Zn and V K-edges was conducted. The XAS scans at the Zn K-edge were conducted at beamline 4-1 at SSRL in a fluorescence geometry using a 30-element solid-state germanium detector and a Si (220) double crystal monochromator detuned to 50–60% of its original intensity to eliminate high order harmonics. Simultaneous energy calibration was done by using a Zn foil. XAS measurements at the V K-edge were performed at beamline 4-3 at SSRL using a Hitachi HTA 4-element solid-state Si drift detector and a Si (111) double crystal monochromator. A V foil was used for simultaneous energy calibration. Data processing and analyses for both these measurements were conducted using Athena and Artemis software packages.
The NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 structure is an open framework comprising VO6 octahedra that are corner-linked to PO4 tetrahedra with Na+ occupying 6b (Na1) and 18e (Na2) Wyckoff sites (Fig. 1a). The arrangement of two VO6 octahedra corner-sharing with two PO4 tetrahedra units, typical of NASICON structures, yields “lantern units”, which have profound effects on cation mobility. The rhombohedral symmetry, which supports an open 3D network, possesses 3c the highest monovalent ionic mobilities for NASICON-type structures. For this study, Na3V2(PO4)3 was synthesized using a modified sol-gel process that provides a phase-pure product (Fig. 1b). X-ray diffraction of the pure phase confirmed the crystal structure of the NASICON phase (the goodness-of-fit (Rwp) factor for Rietveld refinement was determined to be ~1.18). Scanning electron microscopy was also used to study its morphology, revealing a porous network (Fig. 1c,d).
The Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes were first electrochemically evaluated by galvanostatic cycling from C/10-10C between 0.6-1.6 V vs. Zn/Zn2+ (Fig. 2a) with an electrolyte comprising 0.5 M zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)2), using a two-electrode configuration where zinc metal foil was used as the negative electrode. In our study, 0.5 M Zn(OAc)2 was chosen because of prior success in cycling this type of configuration by Li et al, and with future plans to extend this salt to a “water-insalt” electrolyte.The characteristic charge/discharge profile boasts a near-theoretical specific capacity of ~110 mAh gNVP-1 at C/10 (based on the active mass loading of Na3V2(PO4)3); the theoretical specific capacity of Na3V2(PO4)3 cycled in a Na+-only containing electrolyte is 117 mAh g–1. The capacity at 1C is ~90 mAh gNVP-1, demonstrating significant high-rate capability (Fig. 2b). These capacities are comparable to that delivered when cycled in a Na-ion configuration.At even higher rates, the specific capacity decreases to ~35 mAh gNVP-1 with an overall increase in polarization of the cell, where the voltage separation of the electrodes is higher than that at slower C-rates. At C/10, a coulombic efficiency of ~90% is observed (Fig. 2b), which may be associated with decomposition of the electrolyte or side reactions occurring at the zinc metal interface. The Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode also shows moderate capacity retention of ~80% after 100 charge/discharge cycles during long-term cycling experiments, which were conducted at 1C (Fig. S2). We note that a symmetric Zn//Zn cell using 0.5 M Zn(OAc)2 cannot achieve a coulombic efficiency > 99.9% over ~50 cycles (Fig. S3), so it is likely that inefficiencies arising from the zinc metal also influence the charge-storage characteristics of the cathode.
While the charge storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 is comparable to those reported in prior studies,we find the first several cycles of cycling to be the most intriguing. Initial galvanostatic charging of Na3V2(PO4)3 to 1.6 V exhibits a single plateau at ~1.4 V; however, upon subsequent discharging, two plateaus are observed at ~1.35 V and ~1.1 V (Fig. 3). Upon continuous charge/discharge up to five cycles at the same C-rate (C/10), two coupled pairs of voltage plateaus are subsequently observed at 1.2 V and 1.4 V during charge, and 1.1 V and 1.35 V during discharge. This distinct transition from a single voltage plateau to two voltage plateaus during discharge has only been observed previously in one study,where it was claimed that Na+ and Zn2+ were inserting simultaneously into the NASICON framework. We used X-ray diffraction as a means to further understand the mechanism of this behavior. 
Because the extraction of Na+ is expected to facilitate Zn2+-insertion, manifesting as a single plateau at ~1.1 V vs. Zn/Zn2+, we first performed operando X-ray diffraction to understand the phase transitions associated with the first charge/discharge process (Fig. 4). The two presented Q ranges were chosen to highlight select X-ray reflections associated with the charge/discharge process of Na3V2(PO4)3 while avoiding peaks from other battery components, such as the polymer pouch cell, the aluminum current collector, and the beryllium plates. The full Q range (Fig. S4) can be found in the Supporting Information. At open circuit voltage, the Na3V2(PO4)3 phase dominates the diffraction pattern with a strong (204) reflection at 1.98 Å–1 and the (116) reflections at 2.18 Å–1, respectively (Fig. 4). The first charge process to 1.8 V leads to the Na+-extracted phase, NaV2(PO4)3, where the (204) reflection shifts to 2.03 Å–1, and the (211) reflection is observed at 2.22 Å–1. An overlay of these two phases from ex situ XRD measurements is shown in Fig. S5. Upon discharging to 0.6 V, the X-ray reflections associated with Na3V2(PO4)3 are observed again, as evidenced by the recovery of the (204) and (116) reflections. Interestingly, the charge process depicts a single phase whereas during discharge, coexistence of two phases is evident initially, until a single phase is exhibited at the end of discharge. It is also noted that the intensity of the Na3V2(PO4)3 phase, as evidenced by both the (204) and (116) peaks is weaker at full discharge, compared to the initial state. Due to the weakening intensities of the X-ray reflections in the discharged state, which indicates a decrease in long range order, we then performed ex situ X-ray diffraction on electrodes harvested at key potential states to gather diffraction patterns with higher resolution and lower background to quantify the changes in lattice parameters and phase fraction.For ex situ XRD measurements, we collected electrodes that were cycled to a desired potential at C/20 and subsequently held the potential for 30 min to ensure near steady-state conditions. We characterized the following electrodes: (i) pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 as the control measurement, electrodes that were (ii) charged to 1.8 V, (iii) discharged to 1.2 V, and (iv) discharged to 0.6 V, as shown in Fig. S6. A high potential plateau was observed at ~1.8 V, which may be attributed to electrolyte decomposition, but was nonetheless used as the cutoff potential to ensure full extraction of Na+ from Na3V2(PO4)3. The two discharge voltages at 1.2 and 0.6 V were selected due to the existence of two distinguishable plateaus, which suggests the presence of distinct electrochemical reactions. With these four diffraction patterns, we performed Rietveld refinement to correlate structural changes with the electrochemical state of the cycled Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes.
The Rietveld-refined X-ray diffraction patterns of these ex situ electrodes (Fig. 5) allows for a more descriptive analysis of the structural changes associated with the charge/discharge process illustrated in Fig. 4. Unsurprisingly, the control measurement of Na3V2(PO4)3 results in the same lattice parameters and occupancy values as that of the pristine Na3V2(PO4)3 powder (Fig. 1b). The lattice parameters and unit cell volume are a = b = 8.72 Å, c = 21.85 Å, and V = 1440 Å3 (Table S1). Upon charging to 1.8 V, the lattice parameter values change to a = b = 8.45 Å, c = 21.85 Å (Table S2), resulting in a decrease in the unit cell volume to 1333 Å3. This corresponds to a contraction of the crystal structure with the unit cell volume reducing by ~7.4%, which is consistent with prior reports relevant to sodium-ion battery research. In the pristine state, the Na occupancy within the 6b (for Na1) and 18e (Na2) sites are 0.866 and 0.718, respectively (Table S1). After charging, the 6b site for Na1 is fully occupied with Na2 unoccupied (Na occ. = 1.04; Table S2).
During the first discharge to 1.2 V, three independent phases coexist in the diffraction pattern (Fig. 5). Phases corresponding to Na3V2(PO4)3, NaV2(PO4)3, and a third phase, which was revealed by simulating Zn2+ occupying the empty 18e sites (Fig. S7). Because a maximum of 2 mol of Zn2+ (or Na+) can be present in the 18e site, the Zn mol fraction based on the Zn occupancy of 0.125 was calculated to be 0.25 (i.e. Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3). With this simulated Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase, the Rietveld-refined goodness-of-fit value (Rwp) was calculated to be 2.34, thus providing confidence in this simulation. Without the Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase present in the refinement, a Rwp of 5.00 (Fig. S8) was yielded, indicating that the inclusion of the third phase leads to a more accurate model. Moreover, from our simulated structure where Na is still present in the 6b site at full occupancy, we can conclude that the previously hypothesized occupation of Zn2+ in ½ 6b and ½ 18e sites does not provide an accurate model. An independent refinement with this proposed occupation led to a Rwp of 3.91 (Fig. S9).
With the simulated Zn2+-inserted phase (i.e. Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3,), an increase in the lattice parameters from NaV2(PO4)3 is observed with a = b = 8.60 Å, and c = 21.8 Å (Table S3). The unit cell volume correspondingly increases to 1396 Å3, suggesting that the lattice accommodates Zn2+ into the empty 18e sites with an occupancy of 0.125 and Na remains in the 6b site at full occupancy. The low occupancy value for Zn2+ may be due to proton insertion into the 18e sites at these potentials, which have been observed for hydrated vanadium oxides and manganese oxides. 27,28,42 The Na+-inserted Na3V2(PO4)3 phase yields the highest phase fraction of 42.27%, while unreacted NaV2(PO4)3 remains at 34.92%, and the Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase shows the lowest fraction of 22.81% (Fig. 6). When fully discharged to 0.6 V, only two phases corresponding to Na3V2(PO4)3 and Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 are observed (Fig. 5). The highest phase fraction is still exhibited by Na3V2(PO4)3 of 57.38%; however, there is significant contribution Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 that amounts to a phase fraction of 42.64%. A schematic of this process is illustrated in Scheme 1.
To confirm our conclusions from the ex situ XRD, we attempted to electrochemically isolate the Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase. Since the discharge process of charge NaV2(PO4)3 occurs as a twostage process, as evidenced by the voltage plateaus at 1.35 and 1.1 V vs. Zn/Zn2+, if a single plateau at 1.1 V can be obtained, this would indicate the insertion of solely Zn2+ (e.g., single phase). To isolate the Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase, we harvested a charged electrode (NaV2(PO4)3), rinsed with de-ionized water to rid excess Na+ in the electrolyte, then electrochemically cycled in a new cell with fresh 0.5 M Zn(OAc)2. The galvanostatic discharge curve of this process now shows only a single plateau at ~1.1 V (Fig. S10), which is expected for a phase transition to just the Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 phase.
With the structural properties of charged/discharged Na3V2(PO4)3 electrodes now established, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out to understand the evolution of chemical changes during the first cycle charge/discharge process. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the same voltage series of ex situ electrode materials recorded at the V K-edge reveals a shift of the V absorption edge to higher energies during charging (oxidation) and a gradual shift of the edge to lower energies during discharging (reduction), indicating a reduction of V. (Fig. 7a). The V species in the pristine state is 3+ for Na3V2(PO4)3, and the sodiumextracted induces oxidation of V in NaV2(PO4)3 to be 4+, based on the assumption that the V redox couple utilized is the +3/+4 electron transfer process. When the electrode is discharged to 1.2 V (3.18+ state) and 0.6 V (3.08+ state), the reduction of V is evidenced by the shift of the absorption edge to lower energy, which is related to Na+ and Zn2+ insertion. The oxidation states were determined from assuming a linear relationship between the energy position at half the edge intensity of V0 reference, V 3+ (Na3V2(PO4)3, and V 4+ (NaV2(PO4)3. Upon discharging to 0.6 V, there is an incomplete reduction of V as compared with the pristine state, indicating that a breakin period is required for full participation of the V redox, as illustrated in the first several formation cycles during galvanostatic cycling where the capacity stabilizes after around five cycles (Fig. 3). Another possibility is that NaV2(PO4)3 may have to be discharged even further down to 0.2 V, as was conducted for a related LiV2(PO4)3 material. 
The coordination environment of the V species in different charged and discharged states was further studied by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The EXAFS of the pristine sample (Fig. 7b) confirmed the structure of V-O distorted octahedral coordination in Na3V2(PO4)3 (Fig. S11; fitting parameters shown in Table S4). Moreover, charged NaV2(PO4)3 in the 4+ state showed a decrease in coordination number to 4 (Fig. S12; fitting parameters shown in Table S5), suggesting the generation of oxygen vacancies upon Na+ extraction. However, such oxygen vacancies are difficult to quantify in powder X-ray diffraction patterns.
The presence of Zn2+ species in the electrode materials was also confirmed by Zn K-edge XAS on the discharged electrodes at 1.2 and 0.6 V (Fig. 7c). Both electrodes showed similar XANES edge energy position, yet different XANES features, compared to Zn(OAc)2 indicating the presence of Zn in the 2+ oxidation state. This provides key evidence on the existence of Zn2+ inside the electrode structure rather than from the residual salts or Zn metal. Moreover, the Fourier transformed EXAFS (Fig. 7d) shows that the radial distance of zinc metal is higher (~2.2 Å) relative to both 1.2 and 0.6 V discharged Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 (~1.4 Å) and Zn(OAc)2 salt (~1.5 Å). Of note, we detected a small amount of Zn2+ in the charged 1.8 V electrode, which may be a byproduct of electrolyte decomposition or the presence of ion-exchanged Zn2+ at the surface of NaV2(PO4)3 (Fig. S13). However, because no secondary phases were identified with X-ray diffraction, this suggest that this may be an amorphous byproduct.
Multivalent charge storage based on Zn2+ continues to attract immense attraction for prospective “beyond lithium-ion” technology. In the present study, we investigated the chargestorage process associated with NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 cycled in a Zn2+-containing electrolyte (0.5 M (ZnOAc)2). When paired with a zinc metal anode, Na3V2(PO4)3 offers high specific capacity (up to ~110 mAh g1) coupled with high-rate capability. By means of XRD using a synchrotron source, we identified a quasi-two-stage Na+ and Zn2+-insertion mechanism is responsible for this material’s electrochemical response. Based on Rietveld refinement, we propose a Zn0.25NaV2(PO4)3 structure where Zn2+ sits in 18e sites of the NASICON framework and the electrochemical reversibility of this structure was evidenced by stable cycling across multiple charge/discharge cycles. The oxidation-reduction reactions associated with this quasitwo-stage electrochemical process and the presence of ionic Zn2+ was verified by XAS. The results presented herein provide an exciting direction for utilizing a polyanionic framework for multivalent ion insertion and may be applicable to other divalent ions such as Mg2+ and Ca2+.
