Development of solid electrolytes with good lithium ion conductivity is one of the key pre-requisites of high performing rechargeable all-solid-state lithium batteries. In this work, NA-Super-Ionic-CONductor (NASICON)-type LiSnZr(PO4)3 ceramics fabricated via a sol-gel route were characterized using Synchrotron x-ray diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and complex impedance spectroscopy. Stabilization of high Li+ conducting rhombohedral () phase at room temperature was confirmed by the Rietveld refinement of synchrotron x-ray diffraction data. LiSnZr(PO4)3 sample sintered at 1000 °C exhibited an excellent room temperature bulk and total conductivity ∼ 0.1 mScm−1 and 1.45 × 10−5 Scm−1 with associated activation energies of ∼0.36 eV and ∼0.38 eV, respectively. Direct current polarization study confirmed the conductivity of LiSnZr(PO4)3 as predominantly ionic in nature. The role of inductive effect in improving the room temperature ionic conductivity by utilizing the electronegativity of counter-cations in NASICON framework is also discussed.

The envisaged usage of commercial lithium batteries in newer applications has led to significant attention towards solid electrolytes due to the safety issue with flammable and volatile organic electrolytes [[1], [2], [3]]. Apart from being safer, ceramics-based solid electrolytes also allow the use of high voltage cathodes and high capacity lithium metal as the anode which promises the realization of batteries with significantly improved energy density [1,[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Because of such considerations, a renewed focus has been on designing fast lithium-ion conducting materials in recent years. Thiophosphates (Li2S-P2S5), NA-Super-Ionic-CONductor (NASICON) -framework, and Garnets are prominent among the various groups that are being explored as the potential solid electrolytes for the next-generation rechargeable lithium battery applications [[4], [5], [6],[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. Thiophosphates show excellent bulk conductivity (above 10−3 Scm−1 at room temperature) but have poor electrochemical stability with cathode and anode materials and are unstable in ambient conditions. NASICONs have lower ionic conductivity but are comparatively stable in ambient conditions as well as against commonly used cathode materials [18,19,[24], [25], [26], [27]]. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries with Y-doped LiZr(PO4)3 solid electrolyte with ionic conductivity ∼ 3 × 10−5 Scm−1 utilized as separator have shown superior long-term stability and reasonable rate capabilities [25]. Similarly, Li metal battery with Y-doped LiZr(PO4)3 solid electrolyte and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4/LiFePO4 as the cathode exhibited good cycling stability [26]. Li-S cell using Garnet structured Li6.45Ca0.05La2.95Ta0.6Zr1.4O12 as the Li-ion conducting separator were reported to exhibit extremely high Columbic efficiency and better cycling performance especially at low C-rate due than the cell without solid electrolyte to the suppression of 'shuttle effect' [22]. As the maximum discharge current in the lithium cells for a given cathode is limited by the lithium ionic conduction in the electrolyte, improvement in ionic conductivity is a pre-requisite for all-solid-state batteries with better rate capabilities [28]. Accordingly, there have been many reports on NASICON-type compounds (LixM2(PO4)3 phases) in a bid to achieve room temperature lithium superionic conductivity > 10−4 Scm−1 [[29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]].

Among various LixM2(PO4)3 phases (where M = Ti, Ge, Zr, etc.), rhombohedral ones show higher conductivity as compared to the monoclinic, triclinic, and orthorhombic phases [[35], [36], [37], [38]]. The basic framework consists of LiO6 units in trigonal antiprismatic coordination and corner-sharing MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The rhombohedral structure provides 3D connected tunnels for the easy movement of Li+. Lithium-ion conduction in these materials is known to be further facilitated by the substitution of aliovalent cations through the formation of interstitials and a change in the size of the tunnel bottleneck. For example, a phenomenal increase of 3 orders of magnitude in room temperature ionic conductivity is observed in LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiGe2(PO4)3 on optimum Al3+ doping for Ti4+ and Ge4+ [36,37]. Liu et al. have reported room temperature lithium-ion conductivity ∼1.33 × 10−3 Scm−1 and activation energy ∼0.25 eV in Al3+ and Si4+ co-doped rhombohedral Li1.7Al0.3Ti1.7Si0.4P2.6O12 pellet sintered at 1000 °C for 6 h [34].

LiSn2(PO4)3 is another compound with NASICON framework which exhibits the typical rhombohedral  phase at higher temperatures but undergoes a first-order phase transition to monoclinic (triclinic) Cc (C) structure around 130 °C on cooling [39,40]. LiZr2(PO4)3, an iso-structural compound, shows similar behavior and recently there have been many attempts to stabilize the rhombohedral phase at room temperature in a bid to improve its ionic conductivity [29,31,32,41,42]. There have been only a few reports on the electrical behavior of LiSn2(PO4)3 probably due to difficulty in preparing the robust pellets. Martinez-Juarez et al. have reported a decrease in grain-interior activation energy from 0.68 eV for the monoclinic structure to 0.34 eV (in 130–200 °C) for the high-temperature rhombohedral phase using a Teflon-LiZr2(PO4)3 composite pellet [43]. Winand et al. have studied the various compositions in the LM2-xNx(PO4)3 system (where L = Li, Na; M,N = Ge, Ti, Sn, Zr, Hf) and reported peculiar conductivity behavior for the composition with x = 1 in LiSn2(PO4)3-LiZr2(PO4)3 system [44]. During our investigations on the LiSn2(PO4)3-LiZr2(PO4)3 solid-solution, in an effort to design new NASICON-type compounds with improved room temperature Li+ conductivity, we observed that the addition of Zr4+ could stabilize the rhombohedral phase at synthesis temperatures as low as 900 °C. It should be noted that even for LiZr2(PO4)3 sintering temperature in excess of 1250 °C is required to achieve the pure rhombohedral phase [[29], [30], [31],42].

Herein, we report on the structure and electrical behavior of the selected composition LiSnZr(PO4)3 (LSZP, hereinafter) in LiSn2(PO4)3-LiZr2(PO4)3 solid-solution. An excellent bulk Li+ conductivity of 1 × 10−4 Scm−1 and a total conductivity of 1.45 × 10−5 Scm−1 is observed at room temperature. Detailed structural studies on the other compositions in this solid-solution will be communicated separately.

For the synthesis of LSZP, starting precursors (LiNO3, SnCl4·8H2O, ZrOCl2·8H2O, and NH4H2PO4 (purity >99%)) taken in stoichiometric ratio were dissolved in doubly deionized water and were mixed in an aqueous solution of 1:1 (molar ratio) citric acid and ethylene glycol under continuous stirring. After overnight stirring, the solution was heated at 150 °C to obtain a dried gel which was further calcined at 500 °C for 12 h to obtain a white powder. This powder was then pressed uniaxially into cylindrical pellets, and these pellets were sintered at 900–1300 °C for 12 h in air. During sintering, pellets were buried in the sacrificial powder of the same composition to minimize volatilization of lithium and to avoid the contamination from the alumina boat.

A Bruker-D2 Phaser diffractometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (CuKα1 = 1.540596 Å and CuKα2 = 1.544410 Å) and a nickel filter was used to confirm the phase purity of sintered samples. Synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on the crushed powder at Extreme Conditions Angle Dispersive/Energy Dispersive X-Ray Diffraction (EC-AD/ED-XRD) Beam Line-11 (BL-11) at Indus-2 synchrotron source, RRCAT, Indore (India) using a desired wavelength λ = 0.44897 Å in a rotating capillary mode at ∼150 rpm to reduce orientation effects. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was performed by Al-Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The ambient condition Raman scattering measurements were performed in backscattering geometry via Labram HR-Evolution Raman spectrometer. The spectral excitation was probed using four different laser sources: 325 nm (3.81 eV), 532 nm (2.33 eV), 633 nm (1.96 eV) and 785 nm (1.58 eV). The laser beam was focused on the sample surface through a 50× LWD objective. The scattered signal was dispersed via 1800 grooves/mm grating and collected with a Peltier cooled charged coupled device (CCD) detector. The laser power was kept very low (∼2 mW) to avoid local heating.

Compositional and microstructural analysis of the sintered pellet was carried out using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SUPRA 55) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy detector. Temperature-dependent impedance measurements were performed using an LCR meter (ZM2376, NF Corporation) by applying a 100 mV signal over 1 Hz - 1 MHz frequency range. Conducting silver painted on either side of the polished pellet was used as the ion-blocking electrode. Ion transference number was determined by the DC polarization method under an applied field of 1 V using a Keithley Source Meter (SMU-2401).

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of LSZP samples calcined at three representative temperatures. All major peaks seen in the XRD pattern of LSZP sample calcined at 900 °C can be indexed by space group  suggesting the formation of rhombohedral structure. A few low-intensity peaks identified as belonging to impurity ZrP2O7 (Pa) and SnO2 (P42/mnm) are also seen in this spectrum. The fraction of these impurity phases estimated from Rietveld refinement is less than 1 wt %. With the increase in the calcination temperature, peaks belonging to ZrP2O7 disappear but there is an increase in the intensity of XRD belonging to SnO2 phase. At high sintering temperatures, volatilization of lithium is known to cause non-stoichiometry and resulting in a higher fraction of impurity phases [45]. The LSZP pellet sintered at 1000 °C showed the highest room temperature conductivity despite having a comparatively larger amount of SnO2 phase than the pellets sintered at lower temperatures which might be due to better densification achieved in this sample. With further increase in sintering temperature (above 1000 °C) the amount of impurity SnO2 phase increased drastically (Fig. S1). Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron powder XRD data for the sample calcined at 1000 °C is shown in Fig. 2. Bruker Topas 3 software was used for the Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern [46]. During the initial refinement, occupancies of Li, Sn, Zr, and P were fixed according to the nominal composition and Sn/Zr atoms were considered to be randomly distributed over the 12c Wyckoff position. The peak profile was described by Thompson-Cox-Hastings pseudo-Voigt function, and the background was modeled using a 6-coefficient polynomial function. The structural parameters obtained from the refinement are provided in Table 1. The weight fraction of impurity phase SnO2 [S.G. P42/mnm, a = 4.73355(19) Å and c = 3.18355(20) Å, cell volume = 71.3321(72) Å3, and Z = 2] was estimated to be about 4.2%. A reasonably good fit observed between the fitted and experimental x-ray diffraction patterns, and low values of the goodness of fitting factor (REXP, RWP, RP, and GoF were 2.04, 2.28, 1.47, and 1.12, respectively) confirms the suitability of the proposed crystal structure. Accordingly, the presence of 1:1 mixed cation at M-site seems to be an effective way of stabilizing fast Li+ conducting rhombohedral phase at synthesis temperature significantly lower than those reported for LiSn2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3. The positional coordinates of various sites and thermal parameters resulted from the Rietveld refinement of room temperature powder Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data for LSZP are provided in Table 2.

Li+ conduction in NASICON (rhombohedral) structured compounds is believed to be through the Li+ hopping from Li1 (6b position) to Li2 (18e position) and then on to next Li1 or Li3 (36f) position with three oxygen atoms acting as the bottleneck and determining the activation energy for ionic conduction (see Fig. 3) [5,35]. Extra lithium atoms introduced by substituting the M4+ with a divalent or trivalent cation are suggested to occupy the Li2 position and thus facilitating faster lithium ion conduction [35]. While LSZP has the same number of lithium atoms as in parent LiSn2(PO4)3, volume of the trigonal antiprismatic coordinated Li-O6 unit is considerably higher (15.712 Å3, Li1‒O2 bond length: 2.402 Å) than reported for LiSn2(PO4)3 (14.479 Å3, Li1‒O2 bond length: 2.340 Å). Further, bond valence sum calculated from the structural data using the software VESTA for Li1 in LSZP is also lower (0.478) as compared to 0.565 in LiSn2(PO4)3 [47]. These observations suggest a facile ionic transport in LSZP. Another important factor that affects the cationic conduction is the inductive effect which implies that for a mobile cation (Li+ here), conductivity increases with increase in electronegativity (1.33 for Zr and 1.96 for Sn on Pauling scale) of the countercations (Zr4+/Sn4+) in the host lattice [48,49]. Competing influences of change in Li1-O2 bond length and change in electronegativity of M-site seem to be responsible for ensuring that composition LiSnZr(PO4)3 has higher conductivity than either of the end members LiSn2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3.

The scanning electron micrograph of the fractured surface of LSZP pellet shows the presence of grains with a wide size distribution in the ∼0.7–10 μm range (Fig. 4). A few inter-grain microcracks (indicated by arrows) are also seen in the image. The presence of microcracks in NASICON compounds is attributed to the anisotropic thermal expansion of rhombohedral unit cell [50,51]. Such microcracks result in poor densification and hence increased grain boundary resistance. The relative density of the sample estimated through the Archimedes’ method is around 84% of the theoretical x-ray density.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded in the binding energy range of 0–1000 eV to examine the valence states of constituent ions in LSZP. The core level photoelectron spectra of Li 1s, P 2p, Zr 3d & P 2s, Sn 3d, and O 1s along with the fitting profiles are shown in Fig. 5a–(e), respectively. The calculated binding energies for Sn 3d3/2 & Sn 3d5/2 are 495.6 & 487.2 eV (with spin-orbit slitting ∼ 8.4 eV), for Zr 3d3/2 & Zr 3d5/2 are 187.4 & 185.1 eV, and for Li 1s is 56.5 eV suggesting that Li, Zr, and Sn are present in +1, +4, and +4 oxidation states, respectively. Similarly, calculated binding energies for P 2p1/2 & P 2d3/2 are 134.2 & 133.4 eV which is typical for +5 oxidation state of P. It should be noted that the difference between the 3d5/2 binding energy for Sn+4 and Sn+2 is reported to be only ∼0.7 eV making the distinction between +4 and + 2 oxidation states rather difficult [52,53]. However, various groups have reported the asymmetry in the peak as evidence of the existence of partial +2 oxidation state of Sn [52,54,55]. We did not observe any significant asymmetry in 3d5/2 XPS peak for our sample which suggests the absence of Sn+2 in LSZP. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of LSZP for the O 1s is shown in Fig. 5e. The fitted peak at 531.3 eV is typical of metal–oxygen bonds in LSZP, and the peak at 533.1 eV can be attributed to the contamination of the sample surface due to adsorbed moisture.

As confirmed by the Rietveld analysis of x-ray diffraction pattern, LiSnZr(PO4)3 crystallizes in the rhombohedral structure (D3d point group, and  space group) under ambient conditions. This framework of corner-sharing octahedral Zr/SnO6 and PO4 tetrahedral units gives rise to a total of 108° of freedom with six formula units per crystallographic unit cell. Out of these 108° of freedom, the factor group analysis gives rise to only 25 Raman active modes (i.e., ΓRaman = 8A1g + 17E1g) in irreducible representation at the center of the Brillouin zone (q = 0) as shown in Table 3 along with the decomposition of normal modes in LSZP. Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of LSZP recorded with different incident photon energy in the spectral range from 75 to 1250 cm−1. The recorded Raman spectra, under similar conditions for different lasers, show that the maximum number of distinguishable phonon modes is observed with 532 nm laser (i.e., S1 to S18). The observation of only 18 distinguishable modes (maximum, with 532 nm laser) out of 25 theoretically predicted Raman active modes might be because of the degeneracy factor or weak modes, which are not detectable. Various phonon modes for different incident photon energy along with their tentative assignment are listed in Table 4 [56].

Compounds having a NASICON-type structure, the vibrational modes are divided into internal and external modes. In general, the internal modes of vibrations predominantly arise in the spectral range from 350 to 1200 cm−1, and the vibrational modes below 350 cm−1 are considered as external modes [[56], [57], [58], [59], [60]]. The assignment of the external modes of vibrations is difficult because this range consists of a mixture of different types of atomic motion (i.e., translational and librational motion of Li+, Zr4+/Sn4+ and (PO4)3-). On the other hand, internal modes of vibrations are associated with the vibration of PO43− anions. The internal modes of vibrations are further divided into intramolecular bending (ν2 and ν4) and stretching (ν1 and ν3) (see Table 4). Vibrational modes in the spectral range of ∼350–800 cm−1 corresponds to the intermolecular bending modes (ν2 and ν4, i.e. symmetric and anti-symmetric bending modes, respectively) and those in the frequency range of ∼900–1200 cm−1 are associated with the intramolecular stretching vibration (ν1 and ν3, i.e. symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching modes, respectively) of PO4 tetrahedra. Our observation reveals that the intensity of intramolecular symmetric modes (ν2) around 425 cm−1 and 450 cm−1 is significantly higher as compared to that of anti-symmetric bending modes (ν4) in the spectral range of ∼550–700 cm−1. Symmetric modes usually have large Raman cross-section, consistent with our observation of intense symmetric bending modes. However, in the case of disordered structures, one may expect equal Raman cross-section for symmetric and anti-symmetric modes.

Intramolecular stretching modes (ν1 and ν3) in LSZP system are observed in a broad range extending from 900 to 1200 cm−1 with the most intense peak around 1042 cm−1. It is evident from the Raman spectra (see Fig. 6b) that the symmetric and anti-symmetric stretching vibrations appeared as a very broad band with comparable intensity in the spectrum. The broad band with comparable intensity of ν1 and ν3 modes suggests that the tetrahedra are distorted (which results in merging of symmetric and anti-symmetric bands) and are of comparable Raman cross-section.

To understand the effect of different incident photon energies as well as to rule out any photoluminescence origin of phonon modes, we did our Raman measurement at different incident photon energies. Raman spectra recorded with different incident photon energy (Fig. 6) suggests that modes intensity decreases significantly with increasing wavelength/or decreasing energy. Inset a(1) and b(1) of Fig. 6 shows the normalized integrated intensity of the symmetric bending (IS8+S9) and stretching modes (Iν1+ν3) as a function of different incident photon energies. Our observation advocates a strong resonance phenomenon in the energy above ∼2.5 eV, clearly suggesting the existing of a band gap is in this range of energy. Inset a(2) of Fig. 6 shows the intensity ratio of stretching modes concerning the symmetric bending modes (Iν1+ν3/IS8+S9). Interestingly, the stretching vibrations show stronger resonance effect as compared to the bending vibrations with increasing incident energy.

To study the ionic transport in LSZP sample sintered at 1000 °C, temperature dependent impedance spectroscopy was employed and the results from impedance response are shown in Fig. 7. Variation of room temperature capacitance and tan δ with frequency is provided in the supplementary information (Fig. S2) and it suggests the existence of two distinct dielectric relaxations in low- and high frequency-regimes. Fig. 7a shows the Nyquist plots of the impedance data recorded at 30 °C fitted according to the equivalent circuit given as the inset. R and Q here represent the resistance and constant phase element (with impedance ZQ∗ = [Q0(jω)n]−1) component associated with the bulk (subscript 1), grain-boundaries (subscript 2) and electrode-sample interface (subscript 3). The semi-circular arc on the higher frequency-side is the response from the bulk and grain-boundary whereas spike in low-frequency region is due to ion-blocking nature of silver electrodes. Bode plot of the impedance data at 30 °C along with the fitting is shown in Fig. 7b and the quality of fit supports the employed equivalent circuit. The room temperature bulk, grain-boundary, and total conductivity values calculated from R1 and R2 obtained from equivalent circuit modeling are 1.00 × 10−4 Scm−1, 1.79 × 10−5 Scm−1, and 1.45 × 10−5 Scm−1, respectively. These values of conductivities are normalized with respect to the pellet dimensions and are within an error of ±4%. The value of total conductivity obtained for LiSnZr(PO4)3 is higher than those reported for rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 (∼2 × 10−6 Scm−1) and LiZr2(PO4)3 (∼1.63 × 10−6 Scm−1) and comparable to those reported for Ca-, Sr-, and Y- doped LiZr2(PO4)3 (∼4.9 × 10−5 Scm−1, 3.44 × 10−5 Scm−1, and 3 × 10−5 Scm−1, respectively) [26,29,31,42,61]. In earlier work by Winand et al., the value of total conductivity reported for LiSnZr(PO4)3 is ∼3 × 10−6 Scm−1 at room temperature (extrapolated using the reported conductivity value at 400 K and activation energy of 43 kJ/mol) [44]. The difference in the observed values of room temperature conductivity and activation energy between our work and earlier work by Winand et al. could be due to the processing and microstructural effects. It must be noted that the room temperature conductivity of LSZP sample sintered at temperatures above 1000 °C decreased drastically (see Table S1) which can be attributed to the increases in SnO2 phase fraction in samples as evidenced by the increased intensity of peaks in XRD patterns corresponding to the SnO2 phase (space group: P42/mnm).

Fig. 7c shows the Nyquist plots at various temperatures for LSZP pellet. With the increase in temperature, the intercept of the semi-circular arc on the Zʹ-axis in the low-frequency regime decreases signifying an increase in the overall DC conductivity. Temperature dependence of the bulk and total conductivity of LSZP pellet sintered at 1000 °C is shown in Fig. 8. The Arrhenius equation (1)[where σ0, EA, kB, and T are the pre-exponential factor, activation energy per charge carrier, the Boltzmann's constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively] has been used to fit the ln (σ) versus 1000/T data. Both bulk and total conductivity data follow equation (1) reasonably well in the studied temperature range. The activation energy calculated from the linear fitting of the Arrhenius plot for the bulk conductivity is ∼0.36 eV whereas that for total conductivity is slightly larger at 0.384 eV. The value of total activation energy is considerably lower than those reported for pure LiZr2(PO4)3 (0.43–0.56 eV) and LiSn2(PO4)3 (0.68 eV) suggesting a more facile Li+ transport in LSZP [29,30,43].

The macroscopic lithium diffusion coefficient (D) for LSZP was estimated using the Nernst–Einstein relation  [62]. Here, q is the electronic charge, and N is the number density of the charge carriers which was taken as the number of Li+ per unit volume V of the unit cell. The value of D for LiSnZr(PO4)3 was found to be around 5.70 × 10−10 cm2s−1 at 30 °C and increased to 7.96 × 10−9 cm2s−1 at 90 °C.

The result of chronoamperometry study carried out on LSZP with an applied voltage of 1 V to estimate the contribution of electronic conductivity to the total ionic conductivity at room temperature is shown in Fig. 9. The current shows a typical exponential decay from an initial value of 3.7 μA (=I0) to 70 nA (=ISS) in steady-state suggesting an electronic conductivity only around 10−8 Scm−1 and the ionic transference number, defined as tionic = 1 - (ISS/I0), close to 0.99.

The overall room temperature ionic conductivity of LSZP is still lower than expected of a ceramic electrolyte for the practical lithium battery applications. Nevertheless, it is still 3–4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LiSn2(PO4)3 sample sintered at the same temperature (not shown here). This improvement in lithium-ion conduction and lowering of activation energy is achieved without any change in Li+ concentration in the unit cell which is unlike the case of aliovalent-doped (typically Al3+, Ca2+, etc.) LiM2(PO4)3 (where M = Ti, Ge, Zr, etc.) compounds [29,31,36,63]. Advancing the development of these technologically important materials requires a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the improvement in lithium-ion conduction. Thus, the role of Li-site(s) occupancy in the unit cell and chemistry of counter-cations in such materials needs further exploration. The stabilization of the rhombohedral phase at a temperature as low as 900 °C and achieving a bulk conductivity of ∼1 × 10−4 Scm−1 is a step forward in the development of new solid electrolyte materials for lithium-ion batteries. It should be noted that the grain-boundary resistance contribution to the total resistance of LSZP pellet sintered at 1000 °C is around 84% which is partly due to the microcracks and considerable porosity in the pellet. Further improvement in grain boundary conduction could be realized by employing the alternate sintering techniques such as hot-pressing, spark-plasma sintering, etc. for better densification.

In summary, fast Li+ conducting rhombohedral NASICON-type LSZP ceramic electrolytes were successfully prepared via sol-gel method followed by the conventional sintering. LSZP sample sintered at 1000 °C for 12 h showed excellent bulk conductivity ∼1 × 10−4 Scm−1 and the total activation energy of ∼0.38 eV near room temperature. Transference number close to 1 confirmed the ionic nature of the conductivity for LSZP. The results presented here signify the importance of inductive effect in improving the room temperature ionic conductivity by utilizing the electronegativity of counter-cations in NASICON framework.
