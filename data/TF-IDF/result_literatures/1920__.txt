The  crystal  structure  and  composition  of  the  ternary  (K,  Mn,  Zr)  molybdate  were  refined  using  X-ray diffraction  data  (KM-4  KUMA-Diffraction  automatic  diffractometer,  MoK 68) radiation,  graphite monochromator,   90) scan  mode,  548  F(hkl),  R = 0.0427).  The  unit  cell  dimensions  are  a = b = 9.474(1), c = 24.371(4) Å, V = 1894.4 Å3, Z = 6,  85)calc = 3.337 g/cm3, space  group  R3c. The  crystal  structure  is  a  3D framework  of  oxygen  vertex-sharing  (Mn,  Zr)O6 octahedra  and  MoO4 tetrahedra,  with  potassium  atoms located in the large channels; it belongs to the Nasicon structural type. Key words: ternary molybdates, structure, composition refinement, ionic conduction.
Previously  [1],  new  phases  were  found  to  be  formed  in  the  K2MoO4—MnMoO4—Zr(MoO4)2  system,  namely, ternary molybdates at 5:1:3, 1:1:1, and 2:1:6 molar ratios of components. Syntheses and single crystal X-ray studies for the first two compositions are given in [2-4]. In the third case (2:1:6), spontaneous crystallization from a solution in a potassium dimolybdate melt yielded single crystals with a different composition along with the major fraction.
Preliminary  photo  investigation  in  X-ray  chambers  showed  that  the  single  crystals  belong  to  the  trigonal  crystal system.  For  structure  determination  of  (K,  Mn,  Zr)  molybdate,  the  diffraction  reflections  were  collected  for  a  crystal 0.20 117)0.15 117)0.15 mm in size. The total number of reflections collected was 994. The intensity data were collected on a KM-4 KUMA-Diffraction automatic diffractometer (MoK 68) radiation, graphite monochromator,  90) scan mode). Of the total number of  reflections  in  the  range   84) < 32.5 113),  548  unique  reflections  with  I(hkl) > 3 86)(I)  were  used  for  structure  solution  and refinement. No absorption correction was applied ( 80)(MoK 68)) = 47.6 cm–1).
Based on the diffraction data, the trigonal unit cell dimensions were determined to be a = b = 9.474(1), c = 24.371(4) Å, V = 1894.4 Å3, Z = 6,  85)calc = 3.337 g/cm3. The space group (R3c) was established by analyzing extinctions in the set of F(hkl); subsequent calculations (in the absence of spectral data and with nearly identical R indices for the two possible space groups, R3c and  R3c) confirmed that the centrosymmetric group is preferable.  All calculations  were  performed  using  SHELXL-97 software [5].
The atomic distribution found for the structure and inclusion of electroneutrality permit us to represent the chemical composition  of  the  ternary  molybdate  by  the  formula  K0.52(Mn0.47Zr0.45)2(MoO4)3.  It  follows  from  the  formula  that  the  two cation sites (except the Mo site) contain vacancies.
The potassium atoms lie on the 3 axis inside the distorted oxygen octahedra extending along the  axis  and  formed from the trigonal faces of the two MO6 octahedra lying at K–O(2) = 2.794(7) 117)6 Å distances. The side edges of the octahedron (4.774 Å) are longer than the base edges (2.904 Å).
According  to  the  data  of  [7-9],  the  potassium  atoms  can  also  occupy  another  position  on  the  2  axis.  Calculations carried out in the assumption that the K atoms lie in this position gave exaggerated values of the thermal parameter, and at the final stage of the  39) 85)(xyz) synthesis, the additional peaks were not higher than the background peaks.
The crystal structure of potassium–manganese–zirconium molybdate is a 3D mixed framework consisting of oxygen vertex-sharing (Mn,Zr)O6 octahedra and MoO4 tetrahedra. Figure 1 presents a projection of one of the layers perpendicular to the  c  axis.  The  large  voids  of  the  framework  form  continuous  intersecting  channels  accommodating  potassium  atoms. Frameworks  of  this  type  are  quite  stable  and  exist  in  the  absence  of  incorporated  alkali  cations,  as  it  takes  place  in  the structure of Nb2(PO4)3 [10]. In Fig. 2 presenting a projection of the structure on the (110) plane, one can distinguish channels extending  along  the  c  axis.  The  column  has  a  large  fragment  of  three  face-sharing  octahedra  in  the  (Mn,Zr)–K–(Mn,Zr) sequence of the central atoms. These structural units are interconnected with MoO4 tetrahedra along the c axis in such a way that between them are empty trigonal prisms of oxygen atoms. 
The columns are also linked with their neighbors via MoO4 tetrahedra along the a and b axes.
As mentioned above, the structure of the molybdate is of Nasicon type,  which is of  great interest because of high ionic  conduction.  In  the  class  of  molybdates,  this  type  of  structure  was  previously  considered  [11]  for  phases  of  variable composition Na2xM2Sc2(1–x)(MoO4)3, where M = Zn, Cd, Mg. KMgIn(MoO4)3 has a similar structure [12]. Its monoclinic unit cell dimensions (a = 16.353,  b = 9.444,  c = 9.825 Å,  69) = 123,68 113)) are reduced to the trigonal cell dimensions  via the  matrix 0  –1  0/0.5  0.5  0/1  0  3.  The  calculated  unit  cell  parameters,  a = b = 9.443,  c = 24,528  Å,  are  comparable  to  our  data  and characteristic for Nasicon type structures. Ionic conduction of this compound was studied [12] using a ceramic disc sample. As would be expected, the results indicated that the compound is a good ionic conductor.
Based on the cation structure and composition of the ternary molybdate under study, one can also expect high ionic conduction in this compound and in similar molybdates crystallizing as Nasicon type structures.
