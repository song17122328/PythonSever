Na super ionic conductor (NASICON)-type LiTi2(PO4)3 as a promising solid electrolyte has been widely used in all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, it still suffers from a low ionic conductivity. Herein, a hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction has been developed to synthesize rhombus-like Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) powder. Rhombus-like intermediate species of aluminum-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 are obtained by hydrothermal process, and subsequently the intermediate species are further preheated at 600 °C to become LATP phase without changing the rhombus-like morphology. The as-prepared LATP powder with high crystallinity, rhombus-like morphology and uniform size distribution is beneficial to improving the sintering density of LATP ceramic solid electrolyte. Furthermore, influences of preheating treatment temperature and final sintering temperature on the ionic conductivity of LATP solid electrolyte are also discussed. The ionic conductivity of LATP solid electrolyte measured at 303 K with 97.3% relative density is as high as 0.48 mS cm−1. Additionally, low active energy (0.30 eV) and low electronic conductivity (∼10−6 mS cm−1) are obtained. The synthesized method in the present work provides a new thought of design for other solid electrolytes with outstanding electrochemical performance.

Lithium-ion batteries have been widely investigated in order to meet the ever-growing demands of portable devices, electric vehicles, large-scale energy storage and so on. However, the present lithium-ion batteries using organic liquid electrolytes have many limitations, such as low stability (narrow voltage and thermal window) and safety hazards (leakage or flammability). Recently, all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are currently being of great interest as the alternatives to overcome the above barriers [1], [2], [3], [4]. Instead of presently used porous polymeric separator and liquid electrolyte, solid electrolyte acting as both electrolyte and separator in ASSLBs could entirely restrain the diffusion of soluble species in electrode material, and suppress the growth of lithium dendrites in Li metal or Li6C anodes due to its high modulus. This offers advantages for safety packaging of cell, enables minimized cell dimension and simultaneously reduces the batteries weight [5]. Furthermore, ASSLBs with solid electrolytes have a large thermal operation window in comparison with that of lithium-ion batteries based on liquid electrolytes.

As the key part of ASSLBs, solid electrolytes have been extensively studied in the past few years. Lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) has drawn lots of attention as a solid electrolyte for thin-film lithium batteries with high-voltage cathodes [6], [7]. However, it is difficult to employ the LiPON in bulk-type ASSLBs. In addition, semi-solid electrolytes have been studied due to their excellent performance [8], [9]. However, they still have some crucial difficulties at elevated temperature. To date, many investigations have been employed in the development of competitive inorganic lithium-ion conductors based on oxides, nitride, phosphates, sulphides and halides. Although the sulfide-based solid electrolytes possess high ionic conductivity, for example, Li10GeP2S12 shows high ionic conductivity as high as 12 mS cm−1 [10], it is difficult to fabricate all-solid-state cells for practical application due to that the sulfide-based solid electrolytes are water-sensitive (producing poisonous H2S), less stability in air (forming SO2 by oxidation of the sulfide-base solid electrolytes [11]) and high volatility of sulfur compounds. Other inorganic solid electrolytes, such as garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [12], perovskite-type Li3xLa2/3−xTiO3 [13], and NASICON-type phosphates [14], [15] have been investigated. Among the oxide-based solid electrolytes, NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 has attracted much attention ascribed to its high ionic conductivity, stability at high potential, as well as great stability in atmosphere [16] and water [17]. In addition, NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte has also been applied in ASSLBs, lithium-sulfide batteries and lithium-air batteries [18], [19], [20]. Inda et al. reported a Li4Ti5O12/LATP/LiCoO2 all-solid-state cell with a high capacity of 150 mA h g−1 [21]. As is known, LATP that contains Ti4+ is unstable with Li metal, a buffer layer is introduced to avoid the direct contact between LATP solid electrolyte and Li metal in an all-solid-state lithium (metal) battery. Xie et al. reported a Li/PEO/LATP/LiCoO2 all-solid-state cell with a high operation voltage of 3.8 V and a high capacity above 150 mA h g−1 at 50 °C [22]. Recently, Yoon et al. reported an all-solid-state lithium (metal) battery based on LATP solid electrolyte with 1 μm LiPON film to prevent direct contact of LATP with Li metal [23].

The NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 exhibits a rhombohedral structure. In LiTi2(PO4)3 crystal structure, the rigid Ti2(PO4)3− framework unit is constituted of TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The TiO6 octahedra links with PO4 tetrahedra by sharing their corner O atom, and forming a three-dimensional framework which contains interconnected channels along c-axis for Li+ migration. In general, Li ions are occupied at two kinds of sites (M I and M II). The M I site is surrounded by six O atoms and fully occupied in pure LiTi2(PO4)3. While the M II site is located between two M I sites and surrounded by 10-fold O atoms. M I and M II sites are in an alternating way along the interconnected channels along c-axis, as shown in Fig. 1a.

Researches have shown that trivalent cation, like Al3+, Fe3+ and Sc3+, partially substitution for tetravalent Ti4+ can effectively enhance the ionic conductivity for many reasons. Firstly, the trivalent cation doping introduces an increasing Li+ concentration by charge balance [24], and the additional Li ions occupy the MⅡ sites. Secondly, the substitution of Ti4+ by smaller Al3+ cation reduces unit cell dimensions of LiTi2(PO4)3 framework and obviously improves ionic conductivity by about 3 orders of magnitude [25]. In LiTi2(PO4)3 polycrystalline, contribution of grain boundary to the total resistance is much larger than that of bulk. That is, the grain boundary resistance is a dominant factor on the total conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3. It appears that a dense LiTi2(PO4)3 electrolyte is important to connect the ion paths at grain boundaries.

Currently, there are various methods to synthesize LATP powder, such as solid-state reaction, sol-gel method, co-precipitation method, evaporation-induced self-assembly reaction and melt-quenching method. The ionic conductivities and activation energies of the prepared LATP solid electrolyte by these methods are listed in Table 1. However, the LATP powders synthesized by these methods are apt to form agglomerated particles with irregular morphology and nonuniform size distribution, which are believed to limit their electrochemical performance [26], [27], [28]. Taking into account the above facts, the authors have chosen hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction to synthesize LATP powder, as this method has advantages such as controlled the particle morphology and particle size distribution. In this study, we report a rhombus-like LATP solid electrolyte material. Rhombus-like intermediate species of aluminum-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 are obtained by hydrothermal process, and subsequently the intermediate species are further preheated at 600 °C to become LATP phase without changing the rhombus-like morphology. Effect of preheating temperature on the structure and morphology of LATP powder is investigated. Furthermore, influences of preheating treatment temperature and final sintering temperature on ionic conductivity of LATP solid electrolyte are also discussed. Finally, a high ionic conductivity of 0.48 mS cm−1 at 303 K is achieved for LATP solid electrolyte on optimum condition.

The formation process of rhombus-like LATP powder is illustrated in Fig. 1b. The molar ratio between Li, Al, Ti and P was controlled as 1.3:0.3:1.7:3. Initially, 2.49 mL (CH3CH3CHO)4Ti was added to a 50 mL mixture solution containing LiOHradical dot·H2O (0.2727 g) and NH4H2PO4 (1.7253 g) with stirring, and then Al(NO3)3·9H2O (0.5627 g) was added to the above mixed solution. Subsequently, NH3·H2O was introduced into the above white slurry at room temperature with continuous stirring for 3 h. Then the final white slurry was transferred into a 100 mL stainless-steel Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 190 °C for 24 h, then cooled down to room temperature. The resultant white powder was collected and dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the LATP powders were obtained with preheating treatment on the above white powder at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 °C for 6 h in air, respectively.

Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC, METTLERTGA/DSC-1(HT)) were conducted to determine the weight loss and phase transformation of the material obtained by hydrothermal process. The experiment was carried out under simulated air atmosphere from 50 °C to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The relative density values were obtained by the Archimedes method using water for measurement. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X’Pert PRO X) measurements were employed using a Cu Kα radiation source in the 2ɵ range from 10° to 70° with a step size of 0.02° to monitor the phase compositions. In order to obtain the information about morphology and microstructure of all samples, field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI Quanta 250) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL) were performed, respectively. Elemental distribution was detected by energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX) equipped on FE-SEM. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected on a spectrometer (Nicolet iS10, Thermo Scientific) at room temperature for powder samples diluted with KBr powder and pressed the mixture to a pellet. The spectra were recorded from 4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 with 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1.

LATP powders obtained with different preheating treatment temperatures from 500 °C to 900 °C were pelletized by cold pressing at 20 MPa to a pellet with diameter and thickness about 10 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The pellets were sintered at 900 °C for 12 h in air, and the corresponding pellets were marked as P-500-900, P-600-900, P-700-900, P-800-900 and P-900-900, respectively. In addition, the pellets which were fabricated by pressing LATP powder obtained with preheating treatment at 600 °C were sintered at different final temperatures from 850 °C to 1050 °C for 12 h, and the corresponding pellets were marked as P-600-850, P-600-900, P-600-950, P-600-1000 and P-600-1050, respectively. Two sides of the pellets were polished and sputtered with Au as blocking electrodes for traditional alternating current (AC) impedance and direct current (DC) polarization method. The total conductivities of the LATP solid electrolyte samples were measured with the traditional AC impedance method. Prior to the AC impedance measurement, the pellets were heated up to 200 °C in order to eliminate adsorbed water. The impedance data were collected on a Versatile Multichannel Galvanostat 2/Z (VMP2, Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstation with an AC amplitude of 20 mV in the frequency range from 0.2 MHz to 10 Hz in air. The measurements were performed at the temperature from 30 °C to 100 °C, and at each selected temperature tested at last one hour. DC polarization was performed to evaluate the electronic conductivity. A constant voltage of 0.2 V was applied.

To investigate the morphology of the powder obtained by hydrothermal process, FE-SEM was applied. As shown in Fig. 2a and b, the sample shows a regular rhombus-like morphology with nanoparticles absorbed on them. The rhombus-like microstructure is mainly composed of small slice primary particles assembled together. The grain size of rhombus-like particle is about 5 μm in length. Distribution of the elements was characterized with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in an area of the material obtained by hydrothermal process, as provided in Fig. 2c. Ti, O, P, and Al are homogeneously distributed. It is worth noting that Al is successfully incorporated and uniformly distributed throughout the whole area. Since Li is not detectable with the EDS, and the mapping of Li is not provided.

XRD pattern of the powder obtained by hydrothermal process is shown in Fig. 3a. It can be clearly seen that the sample is composed of well-crystallized KTiOPO4-type Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 species. Moreover, no detectable reflections correspond to NASICON-type phase, suggesting that LATP is not obtained by hydrothermal process. TG-DSC curves further confirmed the XRD results. As shown in Fig. S1b, an apparent weight loss of 11.02 wt% is found in the TG curve during 50–600 °C, which may correspond to the reaction of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 species to final LATP products. That is, intermediate species are formed during the hydrothermal process. According to the TG-DSC curves, there is an obvious exothermic peak at 452.8 °C, which is lower than that in literature [35]. This phenomenon can be attributed to the molecular level mixing resulting in homogeneous reaction in this method. Moreover, This exothermic peak suggests a crystallization process of forming LATP gradually [35], [36], and the preheating treatment temperature can be probably predicted by the DSC curve analysis.

TEM and HRTEM further identified the morphology and phase composition of intermediate species obtained by hydrothermal process. As shown in Fig. 3b–d, the rhombus-like grain is composed of small rhombus-like slice primary particles, being in good agreement with the FE-SEM results. The lattice fringes reveal that the distance between adjacent planes is about 0.548 nm for the small slice primary particle in Fig. 3c, corresponding to the (2 1 0) crystalline plane of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4. Fig. 3d clearly displays lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.355 nm for the particle absorbed on the rhombus-like particle, corresponding to (0 1 1) crystalline plane of Li3PO4. Based on the above analyses, The rhombus-like grain with length of about 5 μm, which is composed of small slice primary particles, is Al-doped NH4TiOPO4. The nanoparticles (5–150 nm) absorbed on the rhombus-like particle are supposedly as Li3PO4.

To obtain LATP powder, preheating treatment on intermediate species of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 were conducted. XRD patterns of LATP powders obtained with preheating treatment at various temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. The standard diffraction peaks of LiTi2(PO4)3 are also displayed in Fig. 4. All samples match with the standard pattern of LiTi2(PO4)3 (PDF#: 00-035-0754), and any peaks of Al-containing compounds are not observed, implying that Al3+ is successfully substituted for Ti4+ in LiTi2(PO4)3. That is, LATP powder is obtained by a reaction between Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4. The XRD pattern of the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 500 °C has slight LiTi2(PO4)3 crystalline phase, but shows large amounts of amorphous feature. Moreover, small amounts of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 residual phases still present in the powder, even being existed in the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 550 °C (Fig. S2). This phenomenon can be attributed to the incomplete reaction between Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 when preheating treatment below 600 °C. It is clear that all diffraction peaks become more intensive and sharper with the increase of preheating treatment temperature, indicating that the crystallinity degree of LATP is enhanced. Besides, small amount of Li4P2O7 is formed incorporating with the main LATP phase at relative low temperature (600 °C and 700 °C), and the secondary phase of LiTiPO5 is found in the powders obtained with preheating treatment at 800 °C and 900 °C. The generation of these impurities are directly attributed to side reactions. Previous works [37], [38] reported that the secondary phase, such as Li4P2O7 and LiTiPO5, acting as binder can effectively improve the density of sintered solid electrolyte pellet and the Li+ concentration at the grain boundaries, thus increase the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte.

In order to further confirm the structure of powders obtained by hydrothermal process and with preheating treatment at different temperatures, FTIR spectra were measured (Fig. 5). Obvious structural changes are observed for the powders before and after preheating treatment. Clear transmission peaks at 683, 963, 1034, 1405, 1634 and 3205 cm−1 appear in the sample obtained by hydrothermal process. The peaks at 3205 cm−1 and 1405 cm−1 correspond to the stretching and bending vibrations of the Nsingle bondH bands in NH4+[39]. The signals at 1034 cm−1 and 963 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of P-O bands in PO4 tetrahedra while the band at 683 cm−1 corresponds to the bending vibrations [40]. For the powders obtained with preheating treatment at different temperatures from 500 °C to 900 °C, peaks at 578, 650, 1034, 1383 and 1634 cm−1 are displayed. Peaks in the range of 900–1200 cm−1 are in good agreement with the stretch vibrations of P-O bands in PO4 tetrahedra. The low intensity peaks located in 500–660 cm−1 can be assigned to Ti-O stretching vibrations for TiO6 octahedron [41], which is overlapped with bending vibrations of PO4 tetrahedra. A weak band at 1383 cm−1 is represented of the Al-O vibration [35], further confirmed that Al3+ substituted Ti4+. In addition, the weak peak at 1634 cm−1 can be attributed to the Hsingle bondOsingle bondH bound vibration of water which is absorbed on the surface of sample [42]. It further substantiates that LATP is synthesized through a simple solid-state reaction of the intermediate species obtained by hydrothermal process. At lower crystallinity, such as the powders obtained with preheating treatment at 500, 600 and 700 °C, the FTIR spectra show relatively broad peaks, implying less structured signal peaks. When the preheating treatment temperature increased to 800 °C and 900 °C, the samples with high crystallinity show more structured peaks. That is, the FTIR spectra also enable a screening of sample’s crystallinity, such as low crystallinity and high crystallinity.

Fig. 6a–j shows the SEM images of LATP powders obtained with preheating treatment at 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 °C, respectively. It is clear that all samples obtained with different preheating treatment temperature still preserve the rhombus-like morphology. However, with the increase of preheating treatment temperature, the LATP particles begin to aggregate together and form an irregular-shaped structure. Agglomeration can be obvious observed for the powder with preheating treatment at 900 °C, as shown in Fig. 6i, which is unfavorable to obtain dense LATP pellet and finally leads to decrease of ionic conductivity for LATP solid electrolyte [34] [43]. Under high magnification (Fig. 6b, d, f, h, j and Fig. S3), the small rhombus-like slices which are constructed of the rhombus-like microstructure gradually disappear from 500 °C to 700 °C. This phenomenon can be explained by the complete reaction from 500 °C to 600 °C. Nanoparticles are observed for the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 800 °C, and their sizes grow obviously when preheating treatment temperature increased to 900 °C (Fig. 6j).

Ionic conductivity is the first primary property of an electrolyte. Fig. 7a depicts impedance spectra for LATP solid electrolyte pellets sintered at 900 °C for 12 h, which are fabricated by pressing powders obtained with preheating treatment at different temperatures. All samples show only one semicircle at high to medium frequencies and a tail at low frequencies. According to the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7e, the semicircle is attributed to the impedance of grain boundaries (Rgb), and the inclined line corresponds to the Li+ transfer resistance between electrolyte and Au blocking electrodes. In addition, the first semicircle for the bulk impedance (Rb) of solid electrolyte is not displayed because it is out of the frequency of the electrochemical workstation. However, Rb can be estimated as the origin of the grain boundary semicircle at high frequency. The values of Rb and Rgb were obtained from Zview software by fitting the impedance spectra with the equivalent circuit (Fig. 7e). The sum of Rb and Rgb is considered as the total resistance (Rt). That is, Rt = Rb + Rgb. The intercept of the second semicircle on the real axis is ascribed to Rt.

It can be seen from Fig. 7a that the P-600-900 sample exhibits the smallest semicircle among all samples. We further investigate the AC impedance spectroscopy of P-550-900, P-575-900 and P-650-900 samples. Impedance spectra of them are shown in Fig. S4. The P-600-900 sample still exhibits the smallest semicircle compared to that of P-550-900, P-575-900 and P-650-900 samples. Therefore, the P-600-900 sample shows the lowest total resistance. The conductivities were calculated by the Eq. (1):

Here, σ, L, R and S are conductivity, thickness, total resistance and effective area of solid electrolyte pellet, respectively. The bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities of all samples sintered at 900 °C for 12 h are listed in Table 2, and the total conductivities of all samples measured at 303 K are also given in Fig. 7b. As can be seen in Table 2, the bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities of these samples first increase then decrease as the preheat treatment temperature of the LATP powder increase. The P-600-900 sample exhibits the highest bulk, grain boundary and total conductivity among all samples. Moreover, it should be pointed out that the grain boundary conductivity plays an important role on total conductivity, which is further confirmed that the grain boundary resistance is a dominant factor on the total conductivity in polycrystalline NASICON-type solid electrolytes. The highest total conductivity (0.15 mS cm−1) of the P-600-900 sample can be explained by the following reasons: (i) the LATP powder obtained with preheating treatment at 600 °C is uniform rhombus-like morphology and little agglomerate particle is found, which is beneficial to obtain a pellet with high densification. (ii) the P-600-900 sample exhibits highest relative density (in Fig. 7c). It has been reported that high density is a prerequisite for high ionic conductivity [44], and (iii) the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 600 °C exhibits high crystallinity, which will not be easy to generate voids in solid electrolyte pellet during sintering process, due to that there is no incomplete reaction or amorphous to crystalline transformation process. Additionally, the total conductivity of P-600-900 sample is 45 times higher than that of the P-500-900 sample. Though the LATP powder obtained with preheating treatment at 500 °C displays rhombus-like morphology with uniform size distribution, it shows large amounts of amorphous phase and small amounts of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 residual phases (Fig. 4). The lowest total conductivity for P-500-900 sample mainly results from the terrible crystalline and the incomplete reaction between Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 phases in the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 500 °C, which leads to the formation of voids during ceramic solid electrolyte pellet sintering.

DC polarization was employed to check the contribution of electronic conductivity to total conductivity (Figs. S6 and S7). The electronic conductivities of all samples sintered at 900 °C for 12 h are also given in Table 2. The electronic conductivities are about 10−6 mS cm−1, which are at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than their total conductivities. The lithium transference number (tLi+) can be calculated from the follow equation:

The tLi+ is close to 1, indicating that LATP solid electrolyte is a pure ionic conductor.

The temperature dependence of the total conductivity for LATP solid electrolyte sintered at 900 °C for 12 h is displayed in Fig. 7d. The total conductivities of all samples increase with the measure temperature increases. Among them, P-600-900 sample exhibits the highest total conductivity at all measured temperatures. The logarithm of total conductivities for all LATP electrolyte samples has an excellent linear relationship with the absolute temperature, indicating that the total conductivity fits well with the Arrhenius equation as follows:(3)where σt is the total conductivity, A is the pre-exponential constant related to charge carrier concentration, kB is the Boltzmann constant, Ea is the activation energy for ionic conduction and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin. The activation energy is calculated by the slope of Arrhenius plots. The activation energies for LATP solid electrolyte samples of P-500-900, P-600-900, P-700-900, P-800-900 and P-900-900 are 0.3715, 0.3136, 0.3536, 0.3689 and 0.4019 eV, respectively. Compared to other solid electrolyte samples, the P-600-900 sample exhibits the lowest activation energy (0.3136 eV), indicating that Li+ move more easily in the lattice and grain boundaries in this sample. In addition, it has been reported [45] that a low activation energy of solid electrolyte has a large influence on the high performance ASSLB in a wide temperature range. The preheating treatment temperature for LATP powder is optimized at 600 °C. As shown in Fig. S5, the impedance spectra reveal that the P-600-900 pellets made by LATP powder obtained with preheating time of 6 h has a higher total conductivity than these of P-600-900 pellets made by LATP powders obtained with preheating time of 3 h and 9 h. As a result, the optimized preheating treatment condition for LATP powder is 600 °C for 6 h.

In order to investigate the effect of the sintering temperature for LATP pellets on the ionic conductivity, green bodies of the pellets, which are made from the powder obtained with preheating treatment at 600 °C for 6 h, were sintered at different temperatures in the range from 850 °C to 1050 °C for 12 h. Fig. 8a shows impedance spectra for LATP pellets with different sintering temperature measured at 303 K in air. With the increase of sintering temperature from 850 °C to 1000 °C, the semicircle becomes smaller gradually. However, when the sintering temperature comes to 1050 °C, the semicircle becomes larger. The bulk, grain boundary and total conductivities of these samples measured at 303 K are listed in Table 3. The total conductivities of all samples are also given in Fig. 8b. It can be seen that the P-600-1000 exhibits highest bulk, grain boundary and total conductivity within all samples, which is 1.85 mS cm−1, 0.65 mS cm−1, and 0.48 mS cm−1, respectively. It is worth to point that the total conductivity of P-600-1000 sample prepared in this study are higher than that of LATP electrolytes prepared by other methods reported in literatures [29], [30], [33], [46]. This is mainly ascribed to the rhombus-like morphology with uniform size distribution of LATP powder obtained with preheating treatment at 600 °C, which is beneficial to form dense ceramic pellets. Moreover, the highest total conductivity in this study can be explained based on the microstructure in Fig. 8e and f. It can be seen from Fig. 8e that grain size grow obviously as the pellet sintering temperature increases from 850 °C to 1050 °C. High temperature sintering promotes grain growth and decreases the number of grain boundaries at the same time. Besides, the contact between grains becomes closer and the pellet becomes more dense as the pellet sintering temperature increase from 850 °C to 1000 °C, which is facilitated to Li+ migration. However, when the sintering temperature comes to 1050 °C, large amounts of voids are observed obviously. This may be caused by high temperature sintering where Li2O loss can be an issue, and it may introduce pores in solid electrolyte pellet and deteriorate its ionic conductivity. The relative densities for all samples are shown in Fig. 8c, which are in good agreement with the SEM analysis of Fig. 8e. The highest relative density about 97.3% is obtained for P-600-1000 sample. Fig. 8f shows the phase compositions of pellet sintered from 850 °C to 1050 °C. High crystallinity LATP is the major component and small amount of TiO2 and AlPO4 secondary phases are present in P-600-1000 sample. Based on the above analysis, there are three reasons for high total conductivity of P-600-1000 sample. Firstly, high densification of the solid electrolyte pellet is obtained, which is beneficial to Li+ migration. Secondly, the number of grain boundaries decrease because of grains growth introduced by high temperature sintering, which is close related to the increase of grain boundary conductivity. Finally, the high crystallinity of LATP grains is another potential factor for the ionic conductivity enhancement. The temperature dependence of the total conductivity for P-600-850, P-600-900, P-600-950, P-600-1000 and P-600-1050 solid electrolyte samples is displayed in Fig. 8d. All curves are linear and well fitted the Arrhenius Eq. (2). The activation energies of P-600-850, P-600-900, P-600-950, P-600-1000 and P-600-1050 samples are 0.3399, 0.3136, 0.3128, 0.2982 eV and 0.3323 eV, respectively. In addition, electronic conductivities of all samples sintered from 850 °C to 1050 °C are also given in Table 3. The electronic conductivities are about 10−6 mS cm−1, which is considered to be very small and can be ignored compared to total conductivity. As a result, high lithium-ion conductivity of 0.48 mS cm−1, low activation energy (0.30 eV) and low electronic conductivity (∼10−6 mS cm−1) are obtained for LATP solid electrolyte in this study.

In summary, rhombus-like NASICON-type LATP powder is successfully synthesized by hydrothermal-assisted solid-state reaction. Results show that rhombus-like intermediate species of Al-doped NH4TiOPO4 and Li3PO4 are obtained during the hydrothermal process. This intermediate species are further preheated at 600 °C to become LATP phase without changing the rhombus-like morphology. Furthermore, influences of preheating temperature and final sintering temperature on ionic conductivity of LATP solid electrolyte pellet are discussed. LATP solid electrolyte pellet with high relative density (97.3%), less grain boundaries and high crystallinity is obtained at optimized preheating temperature and final sintering temperature. Finally, the maximum ionic conductivity of 0.48 mS cm−1, relatively low Ea (0.30 eV), as well as low electronic conductivity (∼10−6 mS cm−1) are obtained for the LATP solid electrolyte in this study. These properties of LATP are promising as a solid electrolyte for ASSLBs.
