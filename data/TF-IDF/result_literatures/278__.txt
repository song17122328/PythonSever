Sodium superionic conductor (NASICON) cathodes are attractive  for Na-ion battery applications as they exhibit both high structural  stability and high sodium ion mobility. Herein, a comprehensive study  is presented on the structural and electrochemical properties of the  NASICON-Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) series. A phase miscibility  gap is observed at y = 0.5, defining two solid solution domains with low  and high Mn contents. Although, members of each of these domains  Na3.25V1.75Mn0.25(PO4)3 and Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 reversibly exchange  sodium ions with high structural integrity, the activity of the Mn3+/Mn2+  redox couple is found to be absent and present in the former and latter  candidate, respectively. Galvanostatic cycling and rate studies reveal higher  capacity and rate capability for the Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 cathode (100 and  89 mA h g−1 at 1C and 5C rate, respectively) in the Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 series.  Such a remarkable performance is attributed to optimum bottleneck size   (≈5 Å2) and modulated Vand Mn-redox centers as deduced from Rietveld  analysis and DFT calculations, respectively. This study shows how important it is to manipulate electronic and crystal structures to achieve highperformance NASICON cathodes.

The  successful  realization  of  Na-ion  batteries  relies  on  the  exploration  of  high-performance  electrode  materials  which  have  high  energy  and  power  densities,  low  cost  and  safety.[1,2]  Different  classes  of  layered  oxides  (P2,  P3,  and  O3)  have 

In  the  second  approach,  a  variety  of  cations  are  doped/ substituted  in  the  NVP  lattice  to  improve  its  electrochemical  performances.  Among  them  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  developed  by  Goodenough’s  group  is  highly  attractive  because  of  its  reduced  cost,  toxicity  and  enhanced  average  intercalation  voltage  with  respect  to  the  unsubstituted  NVP  cathode  (i.e.,  ≈3.5  V  for  Na4VMn(PO4)3  vs  3.35  V  for  Na3V2(PO4)3).[31]  It  exhibits two-step voltage profiles (≈3.4 V (V4+/V3+) and 3.6 V  (Mn3+/Mn2+))  with  a  reversible  exchange  of  two  moles  of  sodium  ions.  More  importantly,  it  demonstrated  higher  rate  performances  and  long-term  cyclability  (90  mA  h  g−1  at  1C  rate  for  1000  cycles).  In  the  following  study,  Jiao  et  al.  highlighted  the  importance  of  particle  nanosizing  and  carbon  coating  of  the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  to  achieve  superior  rate  performances  and  long  cycle  life.[32]  The  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode synthesized by solid state method has exhibited limited reversible capacity (58 mA h g−1) which is attributed to its  poor electronic conductivity and larger particle size (>5 µm).  When the same cathode is made of small particles (<200 nm)  with  conductive  carbon  network  (8.6  wt%),  it  shows  stellar  electrochemical performances (109 mA h g-1 at 0.5C and 87%  of capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 20C rate). Further, the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  delivers  higher  first  charge  capacity  (≈150 mA  h  g−1  for  an  extraction  of  3 mol  of  Na)  upon  high  voltage  oxidation,  thanks  to  the  activation  of  V5+/V4+  couple  at ≈4.0 V versus Na+/Na0.[33,34] However, it irreversibly transforms into another NASICON phase at higher voltages which  leads  to  its  rapid  capacity  decay  on  the  subsequent  cycles.  Overall,  these  reports  have  outlined  the  benefits  of  Mn  substitution  into  the  NVP  lattice  in  terms  of  improving  the  cell  voltage,  storage  capacities  and  cycling  performances.  However,  they  lack  fundamental  understanding  on  the  effect  of  Mn substitution, i.e., how the structural and electrochemical  properties  of  the  NVP  cathode  can  be  varied  upon  different  levels  of  substitution.  Besides  most  of  them  utilize  carboncoated nanoparticles, thus the significance of substitution has  been overlooked.

In  the  present  work,  we  elucidate  the  role  of  Mn2+  on  the  structural  and  electrochemical  sodium  (de)intercalation  properties  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  (0  ≤  y  ≤  1)  cathodes.  The  systematic  introduction  of  Mn2+  into  the  NVP  lattice  can  alter  the  electronic  structures  of  the  cathodes  which  is  expected  to  improve  the  cell  voltages  through  the  participation of different Vand Mn-redox couples.[31,33] Further it also  increases  the  Na-ion  concentration  in  the  framework  which  can  affect  its  mobility.[35,36]  Through  these  modulations,  we  demonstrate that high capacity and rate performances can be  achieved  for  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode,  which  has  optimum  bottleneck  size  and  highly  active  V and  Mn-redox  centers.

The  crystal  structure  of  NVP  can  be  described  as  a  3D  framework made of so-called “lantern units,” consisting of two VO6  octahedra  corner  shared  with  three  PO4  tetrahedra,  stacked  along  [001]-direction.[37]  In  this  network,  sodium  ions  occupy  two independent sites, namely Na(1) and Na(2). Na(1) ions sit  in  six-coordinate  sites  in  between  two  VO6  octahedra  to  make  infinite  columns  of  [O3NaO3VO3NaO3]  along  c-axis  which  are  connected by PO4 units. Na(2) ions are located in between these  columns  in  eight-fold  coordination  sites.  The  substitution  of  aliovalent Mn2+ cation in the place of V3+ of the NVP structure  is accompanied by the insertion of additional sodium ions with  the final composition of Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 (0 ≤ y ≤ 1).

The  effect  of  Mn2+  substitution  into  the  NVP  structure  was  investigated  based  on  the  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  collected  on  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  (0  ≤  y  ≤  1)  samples  (Figure  1a).  The  observed  diffraction  peaks  of  all  the  samples  can be fully indexed with  R3c space group and no extra reflections are noticed. The progressive shift of the diffraction peaks  towards  lower  2θ  angles  indicates  the  formation  of  solid  solution  and  statistical  distribution  of  Mn2+  and  V3+  cations  in  the  NVP structure. To grasp more insights on the structural changes  upon  Mn2+  substitution  into  the  NVP  structure,  Rietveld  analysis  on  the  powder  XRD  patterns  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  samples were carried out (Figure S1, Supporting Information).  The  crystallographic  details  obtained  from  the  refinements  are  displayed  in  Tables  S1  and  S2,  Supporting  Information.  The  XRD pattern of the y = 0.5 sample presents broader peaks and it  could only be fitted with two NASICON phases with R3c space  group (Figure S1c, Supporting Information). From the Rietveld  refinement (Table S1, Supporting Information), we could deduce  an  approximation  of  the  compositions  for  these  two  phases:  Na3.3V1.7Mn0.3(PO4)3 (23%) and Na3.6V1.4Mn0.6(PO4)3 (77%). Further, to grasp more understanding on the phase immiscibility of  the Na3.5V1.5Mn0.5(PO4)3 sample, temperature dependent in situ  XRD  measurement  were  conducted  (Figure  S2,  Supporting  Information). As the temperature is raised from the room temperature  to  700  °C,  the  presence  of  the  two  NASCION  phases  are still observed which clearly signifies the existence of phase  immiscibility even at higher temperatures.

To  follow  the  structural  evolution  of  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  phases,  their  corresponding  cell  parameters  and  unit  cell  volumes  along  with  sodium  occupancies  are  plotted  against  the  amount  of  Mn2+  substituted  (y)  (Figure  1b,c).  As  the  amount  of  Mn2+  substitution  increases,  Na(1)  and  Na(2)  sites  are  progressively  filled.  Accordingly,  an  increase  in  a-axis,  a  decrease  in caxis and an overall increase in unit cell volume are noticed.  The decrease in c-parameter could be ascribed to the increase of  Na(1) population which is expected to decrease the electrostatic  repulsion  between  two  (V/Mn)O6  octahedra.[38]  On  the  other  hand, the increase of a-parameter could be correlated to the relative increase of [O3NaO3(V/Mn)O3NaO3] column size (which is  due to the replacement of smaller V3+ cations  rrVV[ 33++ = 0.64 Å][39]  with  larger  Mn2+  cations  rrMMnn 22++ =  0.83  Å][39])  as  well  as  to  the  increase of Na(2) occupancy. Further, to track down the changes  in  bottleneck  sizes  which  affect  the  Na-ion  mobility  in  the 

NASICON framework, the Na(1)–Na(2) distances and triangular  bottleneck areas (T1 and T2 as shown in Figure S1f, Supporting  Information) are plotted against y (Figure 1d).[35,36] The increase  of  Na(1)–Na(2)  distances  upon  the  increase  of  Mn2+  substitution  could  be  related  to  the  enhanced  electrostatic  repulsion  between  the  adjacent  sodium  ions.  Despite  there  is  no  direct  correlation  between  T2  area  and  y,  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode  is  found  to  have  the  maximum  T2  area  of  5.55  Å2   in  these  series  of  compounds.  Interestingly,  the  T1  areas  decrease as y increases from 0 to 1 which indicates an increase  of activation energy for Na-ion mobility in the NVP framework.  It  is  also  worth  mentioning  that  the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  structure  contains the smallest T1 and T2 areas (4.84 and 5.2 Å2, respectively) in these series of compounds.

Further,  to  get  more  insights  about  the  oxidation  states  and  changes  in  the  local  structure,  X-ray  absorption  spectroscopy  (XAS)  experiments  were  performed  on  the  as-synthesized   Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) samples. No significant changes  are noticed in the energy positions at the Vand Mn-K edges for all  the samples (Figure 2a,b), thus confirming the oxidation states of  vanadium and manganese as +3 and +2, respectively. Figure S3,  Supporting Information, shows the magnitude plots of Fouriertransformed extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS)  for Vand Mn-K edges. The first prominent peak at ≈1.5 Å can  be assigned to the first (V/Mn)–O coordination shell and the next  1–2 peaks extending to ≈3.2 Å belong to (V/Mn)–P and (V/Mn)–Na   outer shells. Note that FT-EXAFS spectra are not phase corrected,  thus the observed values are lower than the actual bond lengths.  As  amount  of  the  Mn2+  substitution  is  increased,  the  peak  positions  of  (V/Mn)–O  shell  remain  same  for  all  the  samples. 

Interestingly,  the  distances  of  V–P  and  V–Na  outer  shells  are  found  to  be  slightly  increased  for  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3   cathode compared to the other samples which might influence  the sodium ion mobility in the NASICON framework.

The  morphology  of  the  as-synthesized  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  (0  ≤  y  ≤  1)  samples  were  studied  using  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  technique  (Figure  S4,  Supporting  Information).  In  contrast  to  the  Na3V2(PO4)3  sample  which  consists  of  nanoscale  (≈500  nm)  primary  particles,  the  y  =  0.25  substituted  sample  shows  the  presence  of  micron-sized  particles  (≈>2.0  µm).  On  the  other  hand,  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  and  Na4VMn(PO4)3  samples  contain  large  chunks,  consisting  of  micron (≈>1.0  µm)  and  submicron (≈>500  nm)  sized  primary  particles,  respectively.  Interestingly,  the  y  =  0.5  sample  presents  inhomogeneous  particles,  ranging  from  nano  size  (≈<500 nm) to micron-sized large chunks (≈<2 µm), thus confirming decomposition of the NASICON phases as observed in  our XRD experiments.

The  electrochemical  behaviors  of  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  cathodes  were  studied  by  galvanostatic  cycling  at  C/10  rate  in  between  3.8–2.75  V  versus  Na+/Na0  and  the  corresponding  voltage profiles are shown in Figure 3a. During the first cycle,  the Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode shows an intercalation plateau at an  average voltage of ≈3.37 V versus Na+/Na0 due to the operation  of  V4+/V3+  redox  couple.  The  corresponding  electrochemical process in the above-mentioned cathodes, their corresponding  dQ/dV  plots  from  the  first  cycle  are  shown  in  Figure  3c.  While  the  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  shows  sharp  voltage  features  at  ≈3.35  V,  the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  exhibits  two  distinct  voltage  features  at  ≈3.4  and  3.6  V  versus  Na+/Na0,  in  accordance with the earlier reports.[9,31] Further the derivative curves  of the y = 0.25 and 0.5 samples show broader voltage features  and their average intercalation voltages have slightly increased  (≈10 mV) which could be attributed to the operation of V4+/V3+  redox  couple.  More  interestingly,  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode shows two superimposed yet discernible redox features  at ≈3.44 and 3.52 V versus Na+/Na0, and 3.3 and 3.48 V versus  Na+/Na0 on oxidation and reduction, respectively. These voltage  features could be tentatively ascribed to the activities of V4+/V3+  and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples which will be confirmed by XAS  analysis in the following section.

Further to see the possibility of exchanging more number of  Na-ions,  we  have  increased  the  upper  cut-off  voltage  to  4.2  V  versus  Na+/Na0  (Figure  3b,d).  Despite  the  voltage  and  length  of  the  (de)intercalation  plateau  (at  3.37  V  vs  Na+/Na0)  has  remained same for the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, additional charge  and  irreversible  capacities  are  noticed  which  could  be  due  to  the electrolyte degradation. Further, the y = 0.25 and 0.5 substituted cathodes exhibit an additional voltage feature at ≈3.85 V  versus Na+/Na0 along with the voltage plateau at 3.37 V versus  Na+/Na0, which could be better observed from the zoomed view  of  their  corresponding  dQ/dV  curves  as  shown  in  Figure  3e.  The corresponding high voltage redox activity could be ascribed  to the operation of V5+/V4+ couple, as reported earlier for other  cation  doped  NVP  structures.[24,25,27]  Correspondingly,  the  reversible  electrochemical  exchange  has  also  increased  from   1.2 moles of sodium ions pfu as in the case of the lower cut-off  voltage  cycling,  to ≈1.35  moles  of  sodium  ions  pfu.  Moreover,  when  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode  is  charged  to  4.2  V  versus Na+/Na0, the voltage profile presents an additional sloppier curve above 3.6 V versus Na+/Na0 along with the previously  mentioned  voltage  feature  at  3.46  V  versus  Na+/Na0.  Accordingly, the electrochemical sodium (de)intercalation is increased  to  ≈2.5  moles  pfu.  On  the  subsequent  discharge,  the  voltage  profile has become sloppier with an average voltage of ≈3.38 V  versus Na+/Na0 and an intercalation capacity of ≈1.85 moles of  sodium ions pfu. An amount of 0.65 moles of sodium ion pfu is  lost during the first cycle. Similar trends in the voltage profiles  are observed for the Na4VMn(PO4)3 cathode when it is charged  to 4.2 V versus Na+/Na0 with the electrochemical exchanges of  ≈2.29 and 1.6 moles of sodium ions pfu during the first charge  and  discharge,  respectively.[33,34]  The  pronounced  changes  in  the voltage profile of the last two cathodes can be better viewed  in their corresponding dQ/dV curves (Figure 3d,e). Altogether,  it is observed that the introduction of Mn2+ into the NVP cathodes increases their average intercalation voltages compared to  the unsubstituted cathode through the activation of V5+/V4+ and  Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples at higher voltages.

To shed more insights on the structural evolution and the corresponding  redox  processes  of  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  cathodes, the  as-synthesized  exchange  is  found  to  be ≈1.73  and  1.5  moles  of  sodium  ions  per  formula  unit  (pfu)  of  the  cathode  on  the  charge  and  discharge,  respectively.  The  limited  amount  of  sodium  exchange  of  the  NVP  cathode  in  comparison  with  the  earlier  reports  could  be  due  to  the  presence  of  micron-sized  particles  and  its  limited  electronic  conductivity.[9,13]  As  the  amount  of  Mn2+  substitution  is  increased  from  y  =  0  to  0.5  in  the  NVP  structure,  the  voltage  profiles  of  the  corresponding  cathodes  have  become  slightly  sloppier,  while  the  amount  reversible  sodium  (de)intercalation  is  decreased  to ≈1.2  moles  pfu.  Surprisingly,  when  the  substitution  of  Mn2+  has  reached  to  y  =  0.75  in  the  NVP structure, the amount of reversible sodium ion exchange  is  increased  to  ≈1.9  moles  pfu  with  an  average  intercalation  voltage  of  3.46  V  versus  Na+/Na0.  Finally  the  end  member  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  shows  two  step  voltage  profiles  with  the  intercalation  voltages  of  ≈3.4  and  3.55  V  versus  Na+/Na0  and the corresponding redox activities could be ascribed to the  operation of V4+/V3+ and Mn3+/Mn2+ redox couples, in accordance  with  the  previous  reports.[31]  The  corresponding  reversible  electrochemical  exchange  is  found  to  be  ≈1.8  moles  of  sodium  ions  pfu.  To  better  understand  the  underlying  redox 

Based  on  the  aforementioned  discussions,  it  is  clear  that  the  Mn2+ is completely soluble in the NVP structure except in the  case of  y = 0.5, where the miscibility gap appears. The substituted  Mn2+  is  electrochemical  inactive  in  the  cathodes  with  lower  concentration  (y  ≤  0.5).  Besides,  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  not  only  shows  high  discharge  capacities  but  also  high  rate  capabilities and low polarization among other phases. To grasp  more  insights  into  these  experimental  findings,  DFT  calculations were performed to look at the relative stabilities and the  corresponding  electronic  structures  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  phases  (Figure  5).  The  relative  stabilization  energies  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  systems  have  been  ascertained  from  their  formation energies with respect to varying Mn content (y) and  V content (2−y)[42]:

It  is  important  to  mention  here  that  all  energies  are  calculated  per  formula  unit  of  the  species.  The  trend  in  the  values  of  formation  energies  does  not  follow  a  typical  convex  hull  in  the  compositional  phase  diagram;  a  break  appears at  y  =  0.50,  as  indicated  by  a  sharp  shoot-up  in  the  formation  energy  value  (Figure  5a).  This  suggests  the  possibility  of  a  phase  segregation,  at  y  =  0.50  which  was  earlier  confirmed  from  our  experimental  observations.  We  observe  the  irregular   (V/Mn)–O bond lengths in the highly distorted octahedra which  makes it relatively unstable from the other compositions. Surprisingly, the minima in the formation energy versus composition plot appears at y = 0.75 configuration, which indicates that  Na3.75V1.75  Mn0.75(PO4)3  has  a  lower  energy  ground  state  compared to the rest and confirms its structural stability (Figure S8,  Supporting Information).

To better understand the participation of the redox couples of  vanadium  and  manganese  cations  during  the  electrochemical  sodium  (de)intercalation,  we  have  analyzed  the  projected  density  of  states  (pDOS)  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  cathodes  at  various  compositions  (Figure  5b;  Figure  S9,  Supporting  Information). The activity of the TM cations can be ascribed to the  electronic  distribution  of  the  3d  orbitals  of  the  TM  atom  near  the  Fermi  level  and  the  crystal  field  environment  of  the  TM  atoms. The 3d orbitals of V have a generous distribution near  the Fermi level in the Na3V2(PO4)3 system, thereby confirming  that the redox activity of V is totally contributed by its valence  3d electrons. It is naturally expected that for the Mn-substituted  systems the electrons of Mn 3d orbitals would participate in the 

A  detailed  study  of  the  pDOS  of  the  3d  orbitals  of  V  and  Mn  reveals  quite  a  few  interesting  observations  in  terms  of  the  d-orbital  behavior  in  the  TMs  (Figure  S9,  Supporting  Information).  The  electronic  density  of  states  describes  the  orbital  occupancy  in  the  valence  states  Fermi  level  and  conduction  states.  We  have  also  carried  out  Ab  initio  molecular  dynamics (AIMD) simulations to obtain optimized geometry of   Na3+yV2−yMnyPO4)3  systems  at  room  temperature.  Optimized  geometries  obtained  from  DFT  calculations  have  corroborated  with  those  obtained  from  AIMD  simulations.  From  these  optimized  geometries  and  different  energies,  we  infer  the  3d  orbital distribution, hence the crystal field splitting. For all the  compositions,  vanadium  coordination  does  not  undergo  any  conspicuous change and the 3d orbital splitting commensurate  with  an  octahedral  crystal  field.  The  scenario  is  much  more  complex in case of Mn. In case of y = 0.25, Mn has highly distorted  octahedra,  which  is  manifested  in  the  reduction  of  the  MnO bond lengths along the z-direction through the Mn 3 2dz   orbitals. For y = 0.75 and 1, the MnO bonds form nearly octahedral  symmetry  and  in  both  cases  Mn  centers  contribute  to  the  redox  activity  of  the  systems.  From  these  observations,  it  may  be  concluded  that  the  geometry  drives  the  d-orbital  splitting and thereby the redox activity.

The  cycling  performances  of  the  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  cathodes  were assessed at C/10 rate in two voltage windows (Figure S6,  Supporting  Information).  To  better  understand  the  influence  of  Mn-substitution  on  their  cycle  life,  the  plots  of  normalized  capacity versus cycle number are also shown. In the window of  4.2–2.75 V versus Na+/Na0, all the Mn-substituted samples display slightly improved initial capacities when compared to their  low voltage window cycling. We recall our previous observations  that  the  redox  activities  of  V5+/V4+  and  Mn4+/Mn3+  couples  in  y = 0.75 and 1 contribute to their additional capacities, whereas  the V5+/V4+ couple is solely responsible for such enhancements  in  the  y =  0.25  and  0.5  cathodes.  Further  the  y ≤  0.5  cathodes  show  similar  trends  on  the  capacity  retentions  (≈80%  of  their  initial capacities is retained at the end of 50th cycle). However, y = 0.75 and 1 cathodes undergo rapid capacity fade (i.e., only  61%  and  30%  of  their  initial  values  are  retained  at  the  end  of  50th cycle). Although, such rapid decay could be ascribed to the  structural  changes  occurring  at  higher  voltages  as  previously  discussed,[33,34] it seems that the y = 0.75 cathode exhibit slower  degradation in comparison with y = 1 sample. 

When  the  cycling  window  is  restricted  to  3.8–2.75  V  versus  Na+/Na0, the end member cathodes (y = 0 and 1) display similar  first  cycle  capacities  (≈90  mA  h  g−1).  While  the  former  candidate  maintains  ≈86%  of  it,  significant  capacity  loss  (≈26%)  is  observed for the latter during the first 50 cycles. The y = 0.25 and  0.5 cathodes show slightly lower initial capacities (≈70 mA h g−1)   in  comparison  with  the  unsubstituted  NVP  cathode,  which  could  be  due  to  the  presence  of  electrochemically  inactive  Mn2+.  Besides,  all  three  cathodes  have  retained  ≈90%  of  their  initial  capacities  at  the  end  of  50th  cycle.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  y  =  0.75  cathode  delivers  higher  capacity  (≈104  mA  h  g−1)  in  this  cathode  series  and  maintains  ≈85%  of  it  at  the  end  of  50th  cycle.  Further,  the  cycling  stabilities  of  these  NASICON  cathodes are also evaluated at 1C rate for 100 cycles in the same  voltage window (Figure S6e,f, Supporting Information). All the  cathodes display similar capacity retention trends in comparison  with  C/10  rate  tests  with  slightly  lower  capacities.  Thus,  it  is  clear that the y ≤ 0.5 cathodes show better capacity retention in  comparison  with  the  other  two  Mn-rich  candidates.  While  the  reason for such decay is still unclear, we presume that it could  be  due  to  the  repeated  phase  transformations  associated  with  the  formation  of  Jahn–Teller  Mn3+  cations  during  cycling,  as  observed  in  the  other  Mn  containing  NASICON  cathode.[43,44]  More  importantly,  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)  cathode  delivers  initial capacities of 98 and 88 mA h g−1 at 1C and 5C with the  capacity retentions of 87% and 96%, respectively, after 100 cycles  (Figure  6a).  The  corresponding  initial  Coulombic  efficiencies  are  found  to  be  82%  and  91%  at  1C  and  5C,  respectively  and  they are maintained closer to 100% for the remaining cycles.

Finally another figure of merit, that is, rate capability of the   Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode  is  compared  with  that  of  the  end  members  (Figure  6b).  The  Na3V2(PO4)3  cathode  delivers  discharge  capacities  of  90  and  84  mA  h  g−1  at  C/10  and  5C,  respectively.  However,  the  discharge  capacities  of  the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode  have  severely  decreased  at  higher  C-rates (69 and 44 mA h g−1 at 2C and 5C rates, respectively).  Interestingly,  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  exhibits  capacities  as  high  as  100  and  95  mA  h  g−1  at  1C  and  2C,  respectively  and  even  86%  of  its  initial  capacity  (i.e.,  104  mA  h  g−1)  can  be  obtained  during  a  discharge  time  of  ≈20  min  (i.e.,  5C  rate).  Such stellar rate performance is found to be better than layered  oxides and could be compared to Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode.[45]

To  better  understand  about  the  outstanding  performance  of  the Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 cathode in comparison with the end  members,  their  potential  versus  capacity  plots  are  compared  at  different  C-rates  (Figure  S7  and  Table  S3,  Supporting  Information).  We  also  recall  our  earlier  findings  on  bottleneck  sizes   (T1  and  T2)  and  V and  Mn-redox  activities  from  the  Rietveld  and DFT analyses, respectively (Figure 1d; Figure S9, Supporting  Information).  Despite  the  fact  that  fair  redox  activities  for  both  V and  Mn-redox  centers  are  observed  in  the  Na4VMn(PO4)3  cathode, it shows the largest polarizations and limited capacities  at all C-rates in this series of cathodes. This could be ascribed to its  smaller  bottleneck  size  (≈4.7  Å2)  which  needs  higher  activation  energies.[36]  The  other  end  member  cathode  (Na3V2(PO4)3)  presents  the  larger  bottleneck  size  (≈5.15  Å2)  which  requires  lower  activation  energies  for  Na-ion  mobility.  Thus,  it  shows  minimum  increase  of  polarization  and  decrease  of  capacity  (93%)  when  the  C-rate  is  increased  from  C/10  to  5C.  Turning  back to the performances of the Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 cathode,  it exhibits similar polarization value compared to Na3V2(PO4)3 at  C/10. As the C-rate increases to 5C, its capacities decline by 86%  along  with  moderate  increase  of  polarizations.  These  observations clearly indicate that the kinetics of sodium (de)intercalation  is  relatively  slower  in  the  Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3  cathode  compared to the Na3V2(PO4)3 at higher C-rates. It could be attributed  to  its  relatively  smaller  bottleneck  size  (i.e.,  ≈0.1  Å2  lesser  than  that of Na3V2(PO4)3). Nevertheless, the highly active Vand Mnredox centers enable it to deliver higher capacities at high C-rates.

To sum up, we have performed a comprehensive study to understand the role of Mn2+ cation in the NVP structure with respect  to their structural and electrochemical sodium (de)intercalation  properties.  The  Mn2+  is  completely  soluble  in  the  NVP  structure, except at y = 0.5 where the product is decomposed into two  NASICON  phases.  Further  the  DFT  calculations  have  verified 

Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  compounds  were  synthesized  by  solid  state  method.  Stoichiometric  amount  of  V2O5  (99.6%,  Sigma),  NaH2PO4 (99%, Sigma), Na2CO3 (99.5%, Sigma) and Mn-acetate (99%,  Sigma) were mixed through high-energy ball milling (SPEX) for 30 min.  The  ball-milled  product  was  subsequently  annealed  at  350 °C  for  10  h  and 700 °C for 12 h in Ar/H2 (5 mol%) atmosphere with an intermittent  grinding.

XRD patterns of the powder samples were recorded  at  Bruker  D8  diffractometer  using  Cu-Kα  source  in  the  2θ  range  of  10–100°.  Temperature  dependent  in  situ  XRD  measurements  on  Na3.5V1.5Mn0.5(PO4)3  were  performed  under  vacuum.  The  sample  was  heated  from  room  temperature  to  700  °C  followed  by  cooling  back  to  room  temperature  at  the  rate  of  5  °C  min−1.  The  XRD  patterns  were  collected at the interval of 100 °C for one h. All the powder patterns were  refined using Rietveld refinement method with the FullProf program.[46]  The  microstructures  of  the  as-synthesized  phosphate  cathodes  were  examined  by  SEM  (Jeiss  Ultra-55).  All  the  electrochemical  tests  of  the  as-synthesized cathodes were performed in Swagelok cells. The working  electrodes  were  prepared  by  ball  milling  (SPEX)  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  cathodes with carbon (C45 TIMCAL) in a weight ratio of 7:3 for 10 min.  Subsequently,  the  ball-milled  samples  were  mixed  with  polyvinylidene  fluoride  (PVDF)  binder  in  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone  solvent  with  the  final  electrode  weight  ratio  of  70:22:8.  The  slurry  was  coated  on  aluminum  foil  and  dried  under  vacuum  at  100  °C  for  overnight.  Thereafter,  the  electrodes  were  punched  into  discs  of  10  mm  diameter  and  the  active  mass  loading  was  found  to  be  ≈3.0  mg  cm−2.  Sodium  (Sigma,  >99%)  metal was used as the counter electrode and 1 m NaClO4 in EC/PC/DMC  (weight ratio as 4.5:4.5:1) with 3 wt% FEC was used as the electrolyte.  The cells were assembled in Ar-filled glove box (O2 <0.1 ppm and H2O  <0.1  ppm)  and  tested  in  Battery  tester  (BT-lab)  in  the  voltage  region  3.8–2.75 V and 4.2–2.75 V versus Na+/Na0 at different C-rates.

XAS  studies  of  the  as-synthesized  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  compounds  and  the  electrodes  with  different  state-of-charge  were  measured  at  the  PETRA-III (P65 beamline, operating at 100 mA and 7.0 GeV) of Deutsches  Elektronen-Synchrotron  (DESY).  The  as-synthesized  Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3  samples  were  thoroughly  mixed  with  cellulose  and  pressed  into  the  pellets  of  13  mm  diameter  and  0.5–0.9  mm  thickness.  The  electrodes  were sealed in the Kapton tape inside the glove box and used directly for  data  collection.  The  double-crystal  monochromator  consisted  of  parallel  Si (1 1 1) crystals with energy resolution of 1 eV at edge energy of 5349 eV  for V and 6448 eV for Mn (chosen at the inflection point, i.e., the second  derivative equals zero). V or Mn metal foil references were used for each  measurement to calibrate the absorption edge energy. Both the standards  and  the  samples  were  measured  in  transmission  mode  using  three  consecutive  ionization  detectors  with  a  path  length  of  30  cm.  The  XAS  ionization chambers were filled with gas mixtures of (first) 1250 mbar N2,  750 mbar He; (second) 250 mbar Ar, 1000 mbar N2, 750 mbar He; (third)  1000  mbar  N2,  300  mbar  He,  700  mbar  Ar.  The  sample  pellets  were  mounted on the sample holder placed after the first ionization detector.  Background  removal  was  performed  using  the  AutoBK  algorithm[47]  as  implemented  in  Athena,  a  graphical  front-end  for  the  IFFEFIT  software  package.[48] The data were normalized to an edge step height of one.

DFT  Calculations:  First-principles  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations  were  performed  using  PAW  (Projector  Augmented  Plane  Wave)  implementation  in  VASP[49–52]  (Vienna  Ab  initio  Simulation  Package) 5.3.3. PBE[53] (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhorf) functional to treat the  exchange and correlation effects. Hubbard U (Mn = 3.59 eV, V = 3.25 eV)  and  effective  on-site  exchange  interaction  parameter  J  is  fixed  to  1  eV.  Kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was maintained for PW expansion. Brillouin  zone integration was performed with Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack grids.  The  geometry  was  optimized  by  conjugate-gradient  algorithm  with  an  energy threshold of 10−3 eV. AIMD simulations were performed on each  phase of Na3+yV2−yMny(PO4)3 using VASPmethod. The atomic trajectories  were calculated using Newtonian dynamics with Verlet integration in an  NVT  ensemble.  A  Nose–Hoover  thermostat  was  employed  for  a  total  time period of 20 ps for all simulations, with a time step of 1 fs at room  temperature for each phase, to allow the states to equilibrate.
