Nanoparticle Na3V2(PO4)3/C materials with different polyacrylonitrile contents can be successfully synthesized using precipitation method. As an energy storage material used in the production of lithium batteries which is also compared with pure of that, the Na3V2(PO4)3/C not only has a larger capacity, but also has a very high cycle stability. In particular, the initial discharge −1 capacities of the Na3V2(PO4)3/C sample annealed at 750°C containing 10 wt% of polyacrylonitrile are 130.9 and 122.2 mAh g at current densities of 0.5 and 1 C, respectively; the corresponding coulomb efficiencies are 97.3 and 99.5%. It is also worth noting that the capacity retention can reach as high as 92.7% for 500 cycles at 1 C.

In 1991, commercial lithium-ion batteries attracted the attention of researchers [1]. However, the limited lithium resources increased their cost. To deal with this problem, sodium-ion batteries became a research focus owing to abundant sodium resources and high electrode potential, and people turned their attention to sodium-ion batteries, which appeared almost simultaneously [2, 3]. Among the sodium resources, the transition metal oxides, NaXMO2 [4] with a layered structure and phosphate materials (NaFePO4 [5, 6] and Na3M2(PO4)3 [7, 8]) with a stable structure have become current hotspot materials. This is largely because layered metal oxides generally have higher capacity and larger interlayer spacing (e.g., NaCoO2, NaMnO2, and NaFeO2), and phosphate materials with a sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON) structure have high voltage and excellent structural thermal stability (e.g., NaFePO4 and Na3V2(PO4)3).

Because Na3V2(PO4)3 materials not only have ideal capacity, but also have high energy density and very stable NASICON structure [9], they are widely used in people’s production and life. At the same time, they have caused researcher’s attention too. In 1978, Delmas was the first to prepare a diamond-shaped Na3V2(PO4)3 using a hightemperature solid-phase method. Since then, more and more experts began to study Na3V2(PO4)3 [10–13] from various perspectives. They pointed out that Na3V2(PO4)3 not only played a very significant role in the production of sodium ion batteries, but also could be widely used in the production of hybrid-ion batteries. Some Na3V2(PO4)3 materials have also been successfully applied to hybrid-ion batteries. In 2013, Du, a research scholar, conducted an in-depth research and reflection on Na3V2(PO4)3, and proposed for the first time that it could be used as a cathode material in the manufacture of hybrid-ion batteries [14]. Subsequently, in 2015, Mai et al. reported that nanoflake-assembled Na3V2(PO4)3 could be prepared using a precipitation method, with remarkable rate performance [15]. In 2019, Zhang et al. comprehensively reviewed the main factors affecting sodium storage capabilities and proposed corresponding strategies to meliorate their sodium storage properties [16]. In addition, compounding and carbon coating with suitable carbon species is an efficacious way to ameliorate the energy storage capabilities of species based on the published articles [16–19].

Herein, we synthesized polyacrylonitrile-modified Na3V2(PO4)3, in which polyacrylonitrile is used as a carbon source to ameliorate the lithium storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 when lithium sheets were used as the negative electrodes and LiPF6/EC DMC EMC was used as electrolyte.

At the same time, the effects of different calcination conditions and different polyacrylonitrile contents on the lithium storage performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 materials were also investigated.

The specific synthesis process is to first put 2 mmol of V2O5 and 6.07 mmol of H2C2O4  129) 2H2O into 20 ml of deionized water. Then set the temperature to 70 °C and stir them with magnetic stirring for an hour until V2O5 dissolves completely, resulting in a blue solution. Thereafter, 6 mmol of NaH2PO4 were put to the blue solution and stirred for 5 min. After that, 50 ml of n-propanol was quickly put to the above solution and stirred for 10–20 min. After that, the polyacrylonitrile with different mass ratios were dissolved into the same concentration and the same milliliter of dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, respectively, and the obtained solution was put to the previously obtained solution again, and stirred for 20 min. The final step is to set the temperature of the blast furnace to 70 °C, put the solution into it for drying process, and finally get the precursor of Na3V2(PO4)3/C. The temperature of the tube furnace (argon atmosphere) is set to 400 °C, and the precursors obtained are put into it for pre-decomposition. Four hours later, the calcination process was carried out at 700, 750, and 800 °C, respectively. After 8 h, Na3V2(PO4)3/C materials were obtained. The reactions involved in the experiment are as follows: V2O5 þ 3H2C2O4 129)2H2O→2VOC2O4 þ 3H2O þ 2CO2 ð1Þ 2VOC2O4 þ 3NaH2PO4→Na3V2 PO4 ð2Þ

The structure and morphology were characterized using an Xray powder diffractometer (XRD, a Bruker D2 diffractometer with Cu Ka (λ = 1.5408 Å)) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEN-2010FEE), respectively.
