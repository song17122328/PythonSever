Inorganic ceramic as one of the most promising candidate for solid state electrolytes (SSEs) have received extensive attention due to their excellent thermal stability, good electrochemical stability and wide electrochemical window. The sodium super ionic conductor (NASICON, Na3Zr2Si2PO12) structure possesses a threedimensional network, which helps the migration of Na+. However, because of its low Na+ ion conductivity and poor sintering performance, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 is difficult to achieve application. Therefore, it is quite urgent to solve these questions. In this study, we have reported the effects of additive antimony-tin oxide (ATO) on the phase, microstructure and ionic conductivity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic electrolytes. With the ATO sintering additive added, the Na+ ion conductivity and density of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic electrolytes were improved. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic with 5 wt% ATO additive sintered at 1100 °C shows a relatively high ionic conductivity of ×1.43 10 3 S cm-1 at room-temperature, most densest microstructure and wide electrochemical window up to 4.6 V (vs. Na/Na+). In addition, Na/NASICON/Na symmetrical cells were assembled and exhibited good cycling stability which implied good compatibility between sodium (Na) metal and NASICON electrolyte.
The storage and conversion of clean energy are desired urgently, because the traditional fossil fuels are non-renewable and environmental pollution Lithium–ion batteries [1], Super-capacitors [2–4] and Fuel cells [5] are researched more as electrochemical batteries, especially applying in electric vehicles. Rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries have emerged in the development of numerous portable devices, including mobile phone, tablet computers, electronic watches, as well as electric vehicles and smart grids because of their high energy density, high output voltage and long cycle life [6,7]. However, the cost of lithium-ion batteries is set to increase dramatically due to their limited reserves and over-exploitation of lithium resources, which make us to look for new some alternative elements [8]. Sodium resources have similar physicochemical and electrochemical properties, as well as the abundant reserves in ocean and are cost-effective, especially for the future development of electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage system applications [6,9–11]. However, the organic solvents are generally used as the liquid electrolytes in the commercial batteries, which are prone to liquid leakage, flammability and explosion, leading to the short circuit of battery, even burst into flames when the battery take place thermal runaway. Therefore, the development of solvent-free SSEs are particularly important [9,11–14], they also exhibit wide electrochemical window, which can further increase the energy density of the battery matched with the high voltage cathode material and simultaneously replace the separators to reduce the volume of batteries [15,16]. Recently, the research and application of SSEs have attracted more and more attention.
Inorganic ceramic electrolyte is one of the best alternative for organic liquid electrolyte because of its high electrical conductivity, high sodium ion transfer number, good thermal stability and wide electrochemical window [17,18]. Hong and Goodenough et al. firstly proposed NASICON materials in 1976, which has a super-ionic conductor with a skeleton structure and a three-dimensional channel suitable for the migration of sodium ion [19,20]. The phase transition of NASCION depends on temperature and elements ratio. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 have 2 different space groups at different temperature and they are reversible, one is rhombohedral R3c space group at 160–167 °C and the other is monoclinic C2/c space group below this temperature [21]. The phase of Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) depends on the value of x and they are irreversible. When x = 1.8–2.2, the conductivity reaches the optimum value and the space group is monoclinic, the other is rhombohedral [8,18,22]. The conductivity of un-doped Na3Zr2Si2PO12 sample can reach 0.2 S cm-1 at 300 °C, and it is generally in the order of 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature [17,18]. At present, most researchers have developed the ionic conductivity of NASICON materials by doping or adding additive [12,23–32]. Yanlin et al. found that the microstructure and ionic conductivity of SSEs can be affected by doping with rare earth elements in the Na3Si2Zr2PO12, such as La3+, Nb3+ and Y3+ ion, and the ionic conductivity of Na3+xZr1.9La0.1Si2PO12 is 1.10 × 10-3 S cm-1, which is the optimum at room temperature [30]. The conventional method for preparing a NASICON type solid electrolyte generally requires high temperature (≥1000 °C), while Na and P components volatilized easily at high temperature process, resulting in the formation of secondary impurities zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). The presence of ZrO2 at the grain boundaries could increase grain boundary resistance and decrease grain boundary conductivity [29,33]. Heetaek et al. found that total conductivity of the NASICON mainly determined by grain boundary resistance at low temperature (< 100 °C) [34] and the use of excess of 10 wt% Na source in the raw powder can inhibit the formation of ZrO2 [35]. The powders can be sintered at low temperature by sol-gel method and the impurity phase at the grain boundaries will be reduced due to its uniform mixing at the molecular level [10,14]. Ma et al. proposed a solution-assissted solid state reaction method, which obtained high ionic conductivity 4.0 × 10-3 S cm-1 through Sc3+ dopant, and the formula is Na3.4Zr1.6Sc0.4Si2PO12. Kousuke et al. found that adding 4.8 wt% Na3BO3 additive to NASICON and sintering by liquid phase would reduce the sintering temperature to 900 °C, and the ionic conductivity reached 1 × 10-3 S cm -1 at room temperature [29]. In this paper, we report the synthesis of Na3Si2Zr2PO12 containing antimony-tin oxide (ATO) by conventional solid state reaction. ATO, a kind of ceramic powder, possess high conductivity, good chemical stability and Sb3+ (0.76 Å) with the similar ion radius to Zr4+ (0.72 Å). It is the first time to investigate ATO as an additive to increase the conductivity and reduce the sintering temperature of NASICON. In addition, the regular of different amounts of ATO and different sintering temperature on the phase, microstructure and resistance of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramic electrolyte were studied.
NASICON samples with nominal chemical formula Na3Zr2Si2PO12 were prepared via conventional solid state reaction from a mixture of Na2CO3, ZrO2, SiO2 and NH4H2PO4 (Purity of 99.8%,99.0%,99.9% and 99.0%, respectively). The powders were mixed with ethanol solvent by using planetary mill at 300 rpm for 12 h. The slurries were dried at 80 °C, and then calcined at 1100 °C for 9 h in air. The calcined powders were ground using agate mortar and ball-milled again with ATO (from 1 wt% to 7 wt% ATO). The obtained powders were pressed uniaxial into pellets sheet with a diameter of 16 mm and a thickness of about 0.8 mm at the pressure of 150 MPa, and then sintered at different temperature between 1000 °C and 1200 °C for 6 h. Heating and cooling rates were fixed at 5 °C·min-1.
The crystal structure of the sintered sheets were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/MAX-UItima IV, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 10°–60° at a scanning step rate of 8° min-1. The morphology of the surface and cross-section of sintered pellets was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU8010, Hitachi, Japan).
The ionic conductivities of the electrolytes were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 1 MHz ~ 1 Hz at room temperature using electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI660E). Both sides of the electrolyte were coated with silver paste blocking electrodes and both sides were dried in an oven at 150 °C for 30 min, respectively. The electrochemical window was measured by Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). Na3Zr2Si2PO12 samples with 5 wt% ATO with a Na/Na3Zr2Si2PO12-5 wt% ATO/SS (stainless steel) cell at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The cycling stability of NASICON was evaluated by galvanostatic charge-discharge (LANDCT2001A) testing system (Wuhan LAND Corporation, China). Symmetric cells Na/NASICON/Na were assembled in and conducted at the current density of 10 μA cm-2.
Fig. 1a presents the XRD patterns of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with different amounts of ATO samples calcined at 1100 °C for 6 h. XRD measurements were applied to identify crystal structure of the powder of samples. The obtained samples show high purity and all the diffraction peaks of samples can be indexed to a monoclinic structure (PDF #84–1199) with a space group of C2/c. The diffraction peaks of NASICON with ATO are much sharper than that without ATO, which indicates that the crystallinity of NASICON with ATO samples were increased [30]. It should be noted that SnO2 appeared as impurity phase and the diffraction peaks of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 structure is weakened when the content of ATO is more than 5 wt%. As seen from Fig. 1b, the peak positions are affected by the ATO additive. The diffraction peaks shifted towards lower value with the increase of the dosage of ATO, indicating that the element of the ATO additive occupied the position of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 lattice. The ionic radius of Sb3+ (0.76 Å) is larger than Zr4+ (0.72 Å), resulting in the structure distortion of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12, which is in agreement with other reports [36].
The SEM images of the surface and cross-section microstructure of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with different amounts of ATO are showed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. Dense microstructure and consistent grains are critical for the transport of Na+ ions. As shown in Fig. 2, the microstructure of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 pellet is obviously porous, and the size of grains is in the range of 1~4 μm. However, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellet shows much denser structure with significantly reduced porosity, and smaller microstructure of grains (0.5~2 μm). The intimate contact of the grains may suppress the growth of grain boundary, thus it is beneficial to the transportation of Na+ ions through grain boundary [37]. As shown in Fig. 3, the porosity of samples obviously decreased with the increase of the dosage of ATO.
The Nyquist impedance plots of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with different amounts of ATO pellets sintered at 1100 °C and the equivalent electrical circuit model for fitting the impedance spectra are shown in Fig. 4 (a). The total resistance (Rtotal) is the sum of grain resistance (Rg) distributed in the intercept of the high frequency at the Z′ axis and grain boundary resistance (Rgb) distributed in the semicircular between high frequency and the intermediate frequency [38]. The oblique line distributed in the low frequency region is the blocking effect of the electrode, indicating that the solid electrolyte is typical ionic conductor. The grain, grain boundary and total electrical conductivities were obtained from Rg, Rgb and Rtotal by using the formula of = L R A , where L represents the thickness of electrolyte pellets, R is the value of resistance and A is the surface area of electrolyte pellets. The detailed data is shown in Table 1. The values of σg; σgb; σtotal are shown in Fig. 4b, the total resistances of the NASICON samples firstly decrease and then increase with the increase of the dosage of ATO from 0 to 7 wt%. And the total conductivity (σtotal) changed with grain boundary conductivity which is consistent with Heetaek's works [34] (see Table 2).
The increase in the Rtotal of NASICON solid electrolytes has the following reasons. Firstly, the Sb3+ ions is introduced from the addition of ATO occupy the positions of the skeleton structure, which can broaden the bottleneck size of the migration ions and facilitate the movement of Na+ ions. Simultaneously, the low-valence Sb3+ replaces the high-valence Zr4+, which reduces the Coulomb repulsion of the skeleton ions with the mobile ions and decreases the transition barrier of Na+ ion. Secondly, ATO additive can inhibit the growth of grains during the sintering process, and the grain sizes are uniform. Uniform size grains are favorable for grain conductance. Thirdly, ATO additive densify the microstructure of electrolyte and the connected grains are favorable for the transportation of sodium ions at the grain boundaries. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellet displays the optimum total conductivity, which is 1.43×10-3 S cm-1. The electrical conductivity of grain boundaries is related to the density of SSEs and denser SSEs acquire higher grain boundary conductivity, as exhibited by SEM observations and EIS measurements.
Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellets sintered at a temperatures range of 1000–1200 °C. All main diffraction peaks match well with the NASICON-type structure (PDF#47–0515). The intensity of the diffraction peaks increase with the increase of the sintered temperature. However, when the sintering temperature is up to 1200 °C, the ZrO2 secondary phases appear, indicating that the elements of Na and P volatilized at high temperatures which would make Na3Zr2Si2PO12 decompose.
Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the cross-section of Na3Zr2Si2PO125 wt% ATO pellets sintered at different temperatures. The results show that the porosity of Na3Zr2Si2PO12-5 wt% ATO samples obviously decreases with the increase of sintering temperature. However, the grain size of the samples increases with the increase of sintering temperature. These indicate that the densification process of NASICON depends strongly on the sintering temperature.
Fig. 7 (a) shows the impedance spectra and Fig. 7 (b) shows the change of σg; σgb; σtotal with different sintered temperature of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellets sintered at temperature range of 1000–1200 °C. As shown in Fig. 7 (b), the conductivity of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 samples were affected by sintering temperature obviously. The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellet displays the optimum σtotal when the sintering temperature is up to 1100 °C, which is 1.43×10-3 s cm-1. However, the σtotal decrease when the temperature is higher than 1100 °C, which may be caused by decomposition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 structure at high sintering temperature and the impurity of ZrO2, (as shown in Fig. 4).
Fig. 8 shows the Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) measurement (at room temperature) of the 5 wt% ATO-Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolyte assembled with a stainless steel (SS) as the working electrode and a sodium foil as the counter electrode at a scan rate of 1 mV/s. It reflected the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. Obviously, it is observed that the oxidative current increases up to 4.6 V (vs. Na/Na+), which suggests the electrolyte exhibit a good electrochemical stability. It can be coupled with high voltage cathode material. Therefore, the electrolyte of wide electrochemical window applying in practical will provide high energy density using in battery.
The symmetric cell Na/NASICON/Na was assembled in a glove box filled with Argon. The galvanostatic cycling of symmetric cell was carried out with a current density of 10 μA cm-2 for 350 h at room temperature, in order to investigate the interfacial stability between NASCION electrolyte and Na foil. Fig. 9 (a) exhibits the cycling voltage profile in both directions under 10 μA cm-2. The symmetrical cell delivers asymmetric and unstable Na plating-stripping cycles for the beginning of 210 h, which may due to the insufficient contact between the Na metal and the NASICON electrolyte. All the dissolution and deposition curves tend to be mirrored relationship after 210 h cycles, indicating the stability of NASICON electrolyte and the Na interface becomes more stable as the cycle progresses. Fig. 9 (b) shows the EIS of the symmetric battery after 0 and 200 cycles, respectively. By comparison, it can be clearly found that the interface impedance of the pristine cell is higher than after 200 cycles. Therefore, it can be confirmed that, as the cycle prolongs, the interface compatible between the Na metal and the electrolyte becomes much better.
In this study, Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with different amounts of ATO electrolytes were successfully prepared by a conventional solid-phase method. The results show that the addition of ATO significantly enhances the sintering and densification process, and the conductivities of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolytes. The grain, grain boundary and total conductivities of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolytes firstly increase and then decrease with the increase of the amounts of ATO from 0 to 7 wt%. And the conductivities of the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO electrolytes firstly increase and then decrease with the increase of the sintered temperature from 1000 to 1200 °C.The Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with 5 wt% ATO pellet sintered at 1100 °C displays the best total conductivity, which is 1.43×10-3 S·cm-1. And the electrochemical window is up to 4.6 V. It can be coupled with many high voltage positives which will provide high energy density using in battery. The result suggests that 5 wt% ATONa3Zr2Si2PO12 electrolyte deserve to apply in solid-state batteries.
