SO2-sensing characteristics of the Nasicon cells with Na2SO4–xBaSO4 (x ¼ 0–40 mol%) auxiliary electrolytes have been investigated in 5–95 ppm SO2 concentration range at 400–550 8C. The cell Na2SO4 alone and Na2SO4–xBaSO4 auxiliary electrolytes exhibit stable behaviors above 450 8C in dry SO2 atmosphere. Long-term stabilities for the cell with Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte are obtained at 550 8C for 30 days. Response time is the shortest for the cell with Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte, which is due to the porous, needle-like surface. Increase of BaSO4 content in Na2SO4 leads to decrease in moisture effect of these cells under SO2 atmosphere containing 4.242 kPa water vapor. Slight decrease in emf is inevitable because the inlet SO2 gas and water vapor react to form H2SO4 and then the gas composition is reduced by the degree of dissociation.
Electrochemical SO2 sensors have such advantages as cheap, portable, continuous monitoring. Nasicon [1–4] is a promising material for SO2 and CO2 sensors because of its high Na conductivity even at low temperatures, no crack formation upon heating and cooling, and negligible elec 5. Instead, an auxiliary tronic transference number of 10 electrolyte is needed for Nasicon gas sensors to prevent chemical reaction of Nasicon with the SO2. The common auxiliary electrolyte is alkaline and alkaline earth metallic sulfates. However, sodium sulfate as a commonly used auxiliary electrolyte signiﬁcantly absorbs moisture in SO2 atmosphere. A Nasicon-based CO2 sensor [5] was considerably improved the moisture effect by using Na2CO3–BaCO3 auxiliary electrode. Therefore, such a moisture effect on Nasicon sensors with a NaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte might be improved by adding BaSO4, as expected from its solubility of 0.000115 in 100 parts cold water.
Present work includes sensing stability, response time, and moisture effect of the Nasicon sensors with Na2SO4– xBaSO4 (x ¼ 0–40 mol%) auxiliary electrolytes.
Nasicon was prepared from ZrSiO4 and Na3PO4 of the mole ratio of 2–1. The raw materials were ball-milled for 168 h, dried at 100 8C for 48 h, and subsequently heated at 110 8C for 5 h, at 850 8C for 1 h and at 1100 8C for 10 h. The synthesized Nasicon powders were ground for 48 h and then pressed at 5 ton/cm2 in double-punch die for 10 min. The green discs were then sintered in air at 110 8C for 5 h, at 850 8C at 5 h and 1150 8C for 50 h. X-ray patterns are in good agreement with the results obtained by Lloyd et al. [6] and Maruyama et al. [7]. A noticeable Nasicon phase, possibly with a trace of ZrO2 was observed. According to Gordon et al. [8], the presence of ZrO2 is of little effect on the ionic conductivity of Nasicon. Bulk densities of the Nasicon electrolytes were more than 97% of the theoretical density.
The auxiliary electrolyte and the reference electrode are attached to either side of the Nasicon disc, ﬁxed to the end of a quartz glass tube with an organic adhesive. Na2SO4 was ﬁrst melted and then 10–40 mol% of BaSO4 were added on outside surface of Nasicon disc because of the high melting temperature of BaSO4. A platinum net was put on the surface of the auxiliary electrolyte. The counter platinum black electrode was applied on the inside surface of the disc and mechanically contacted to a platinum mesh attached with a Pt lead.
All the emf measurements were performed in such a cell as shown in Fig. 1. Five to ninety-ﬁve parts per million SO2 in air was introduced into the cells in the horizontal furnace at a ﬂow rate of 200 ml/min.
The moisture effects were measured with wet gas mixtures prepared by bubbling the gas through the water reservoir at a given temperature. The emf values are at equilibrium even if most sensor case measures a given percentage of the equilibrium value. The attainment of equilibrium was veriﬁed by observing the course of the emf over a period of time. Thus, the equilibrium was considered when no more than 0.5 mV of emf was changed within 1 min.
The cell with Na2SO4 alone as an auxiliary electrolyte exhibits very unstable sensing behaviors at low temperatures. Three samples of the cell as in Fig. 2 show different responses by 50 mV for the SO2 concentration of 5–90 ppm at 400 8C.
The cells with Na2SO4 alone and Na2SO4–xBaSO4 auxiliary electrolytes, as shown in Fig. 3, exhibit stable behaviors above 550 8C in dry SO2 atmosphere, arising from dry atmosphere and complete conversion of SO2 to SO3 at the high temperatures.
Long-term sensing stabilities were measured for the cells with Na2SO4 alone and Na2SO4 containing 10 mol% BaSO4 as auxiliary electrolytes at 550 8C for 10–30 days. The cells with Na2SO4 alone show unstable behaviors only for 10 days even in dry atmosphere, as in Fig. 4.
On the other hand, Fig. 5 indicates long-term stabilities for the cell with Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte in SO2 concentration range of 5–95 ppm at 550 8C for 30 days.
Response times are within 5, 3 and 4 min at 550 8C, respectively, for Na2SO4 alone and Na2SO4 containing 10 and 20–40 mol% BaSO4 as auxiliary electrolytes in 90 ppm SO2. The shortest response time for the cell with Na2SO4– 10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte is due to the porous, needle-like surface in SEM photographs of Fig. 6(b). Additionally, the sodium ion is found to be more present in the vicinity of needle-like surface by EDX. Need-like surface for Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte might be due to addition of BaSO4 in Na2SO4 phase giving low surface energy. However, the appearance of second phase in Na2SO4–40 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte results in nodular shape. The cell with Na2SO4 alone has ﬂat and smooth surface, resulting in less possibility of the auxiliary electrolyte being contact with SO2 atmosphere. In Fig. 6(d), two phases are shown.
The effects of water vapor on the SO2 detection were examined by measuring the outputs under humid condition of 4.242 kPa, as in Fig. 8.
SO2-sensing characteristics of the Nasicon cells with Na2SO4–xBaSO4 (x ¼ 0–40 mol%) auxiliary electrolytes have been investigated. Long-term stabilities for the cell with Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte in SO2 concentration range of 5–95 ppm are obtained at 550 8C for 30 days. Response time is the shortest for the cell with Na2SO4–10 mol% BaSO4 auxiliary electrolyte of the porous, needle-like surface. Increase of BaSO4 content in Na2SO4 leads to decrease in moisture effect of these cells under SO2 atmosphere containing 4.242 kPa water vapor.
