Complex phosphates Ca0.5 + xZnxE2 – x(PO4)3 (E = Ti, Zr) having NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) structure have been prepared and characterized by X 2)ray diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, IR spectroscopy, and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Their phase formation has been studied by X 2)ray powder diffraction and DTA. The concentration and temperature fields of existence of these NZP phases have been determined: substitution solid solutions exist in the range of compositions where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5. The Ca0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 crystal structure has been refined by the Rietveld method (space group R  a = 8.3636(4) Å, c = 21.9831(8) Å, V = 1331.7(1) Å3, Z = 6). The framework in the NZP structure is built of octahedra, which are populated by titanium and zinc atoms, and PO4 tetrahedra. Calcium atoms occupy extraframework positions. Extensive solid  solution  formation  due  to  the  accommodation  of  cations(2+)  in  the  interstices  within  the  NZP framework (M) and in the framework 2)forming octahedra (M') makes it possible to design a plurality of new M0.5 + x DOI: 10.1134/S003602361410012X E2 – x(PO4)3 phosphates with tailored structures.

Compounds  having  NaZr2(PO4)3  (NZP,  or NASICON)  type  structure  can  comprise  cations  in oxidation  degrees  ranging  from  1+  to  6+  and  having diverse ionic radii, electronic structures, and electrone 2) gativities  [1].  These  compounds  have  three 2)dimen 2) sional  structures  that  can  be  described  by  the  crystal 2) chemical  formula  (M1)0→1(M2)0→3{[L2(TO4)3]p–}3∞, where {[L2(TO4)3]p–}3∞ denotes the framework (р is the framework charge) and (M1)0→1, and (M2)0→3 denote different types of extraframework cation positions with the  indicated  numbers  of  populated  sites.  The  NZP framework  is  built  of  corner 2)sharing  octahedra  LO6 and  tetrahedra  TO4;  interstices  M1  and  M2,  which have different sizes, are suitable for accommodating a great  variety  of  cations  to  balance  the  framework charge. In most of the compounds having NZP struc 2) ture,  the  anion 2)forming  element  T  is  phosphorus. These  phosphates  are  resistant  to  heating  (up  to 1700°С) and to radiation (external radiation of 5 × 108 Gy and internal radiation of up to 1018 α particles/g); they are not degradable by water (200°С, 600 atm, 2 2)year tests);  their  thermal  expansion  behavior  is  similar  to that of the best of the hitherto known low 2)expansion solid materials; they have ionic conductivity and cata 2) lytic activity and are regarded as promising high 2)tech ceramics [2–4]. The maintenance of stable structural fragments of the crystal assembly in NZP phosphates, together  with  their  extensive  cationic  isomorphism, makes it possible to purposefully predict and modify some of their properties, namely thermal expansion, superionic conductivity, and generation activity [1, 5]. The  NZP  phosphates  having  important  applied properties  comprise  titanium  or  zirconium  and  ele 2) ments(2+);  the  latter  can  populate  both  framework and  extraframework  positions  (Table  1).  There  remain some, yet unused, potentialities for preparing new com 2) pounds and solid solutions that are predictable in terms E2 – x(PO4)3, of crystal chemistry, for example M0.5+x where M stands for a cation(2+) larger than M' and E stands for a cation(4+), in particular Ti or Zr. 

Complex phosphates of titanium  and  ele 2) ments(2+)  where  the  elements(2+)  populate  both interstices and framework positions, have not yet been studied.  An  inspection  of  the  literature  concerning complex  phosphates  of  zirconium  and  elements(2+) shows  that  their  structures  depend  on  the  sizes  and coordinative  abilities  of  cations(2+),  the  amounts  of elements(2+)  per  phosphate  formula  unit,  and  the preparation conditions (Table 1). Sukhanov et al. [30] demonstrated  that  a  zinc  oxide  sintering  additive, reacting  with  phosphates  to  form  solid  solutions, makes  it  possible  to  decrease  synthesis  temperatures for zirconium 2)containing samples. 

For the reason that Ti4+ and Zr4+ tend to acquire octahedral  coordination  and  have  medium 2)value radii, Zn2+ can appear among their crystal 2)chemical relatives. However, in spite of the d10 configuration of zinc, Zn–O chemical bonds in crystals structures have a distinct covalent character, and Zn2+ tends to acquire tetrahedral coordination. Therefore, it was of interest to  study  how  zinc,  in  combination  with  other  cat 2) ions(2+), would influence the structure stability of tita 2) nium 2) and zirconium 2)containing NZP phosphates.

Here we report on the  preparation  of Ca0.5 + xZnxE2 – x(PO4)3  (E  =  Ti,  Zr)  phosphates  and the  study  of  phase  formation,  structure  refinement, and  identification  of  concentration  and  temperature stability fields for the prepared NZP phosphates.

Ca0.5 + xZnxE2 – x(PO4)3  samples  with  x  ranging from 0 to 2 were prepared by sol–gel technology fol 2) lowed  by  heat  treatment,  as  follows.  Stoichiometric amounts of 1 M aqueous solutions of calcium carbon 2) ate,  zinc  oxide  (dissolved  in  aqueous  hydrochloric acid),  and  titanium  or  zirconium  oxychloride  were combined. Then, aqueous orthophosphoric acid, also taken in the stoichiometric proportion, was added to the mixed solution under stirring. The reaction mix 2) tures were dried at 90°C and heat treated in air at 600– 900°C  for  24  h  at  each  step.  Stepwise  heating  was alternated with dispersion to provide homogenization. Thus 2)prepared  samples  were  white  polycrystalline powders. 

The  chemical  composition  and  homogeneity  of samples  were  monitored  with  a  CamScan  MV 2)2300 (VEGA TS 5130MM) scanning electron microscope equipped with YAG secondary and scattered electron detectors and a LINK INCA ENERGY 200C energy 2) dispersive X 2)ray microanalyzer with a Si(Li) semicon 2) ductor  detector.  Compositions  were  calculated  with PAP  corrections  applied.  The  error  in  compositions did  not  exceed  2  at  %.  Microprobe  data  for  single 2) phase samples showed the compositional homogene 2) ity of grains and correspondence to theoretical x values within the error bar of the method. 

X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Shi 2) madzu  XRD 2)6000  diffractometer  (CuKα  radiation, λ = 1.54178 Å, angle range: 2θ = 10°–50°). The X 2)ray diffraction  in Ca0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3  structure  refinement  was  mea 2) sured in the angle range 2θ = 10°–110° with scan steps of 0.02° and an exposure time per point of 2.5 s. The X 2)ray  diffraction  patterns  were  processed  and  the structure  was  refined  by  the  Rietveld  method  [31] using  the  RIETAN 2)97  program  [32].  Peak  profiles were  fitted  by  a  modified  pseudo 2)Voigt  function (Mod 2)TCH pV [33]). The basic model for phosphate structure refinement was comprised of the coordinates of atoms in Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [11]. 

The  functional  composition  of  samples  was  con 2) firmed by spectroscopic studies. IR absorption spectra were recorded on an FSM 2)1201 FT 2)IR spectrometer in the wavenumber range 400–1400 cm–1.

Samples with x ranging from 0 to 2 were subjected to isothermal anneals at 600, 700, 750–780, 850, and 900°C  during  preparation  in  order  to  elucidate  the details  of  phase  formation  in  Сa0.5 + хZnхE2 – xP3O12 (E =  Ti,  Zr)  systems.  The  exposure  time  at  each  of those  temperatures  was  24  h.  At  the  end  of  each annealing  step,  a  portion  of  the  sample  was  rapidly quenched  in  air  and  then  analyzed.  The  remaining portion was heated further and so on during the entire stepwise  annealing.  The  phase  compositions  of  the prepared samples as probed by X 2)ray powder diffrac 2)

Figure 1 exemplifies the reflection peak intensities of phases contained in samples of various compositions of the Сa0.5 + хZnхTi2 – xP3O12 system at 900°C. When x ranges  from  0  to  0.5,  there  are  conditions  for  NZP solid  solutions  Сa0.5 + хZnхTi2 – x(PO4)3  to  be  formed. When х > 0.5, the samples are mixtures of phases as shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  products  obtained  during  the stepwise isothermal heating of samples in the CaO– ZrO2–P2O5 system at temperatures in the range 800– 1150°С  are  described  in Сa0.5 + хZnхZr2 – xP3O12 is from 0 to 0.5, NZP solid solu 2) tions are formed; when х > 0.5 samples are mixtures of phases:  СaZn0.5Zr1.5(PO4)3,  Ca3(PO4)2,  CaZr(PO4)2, ZnP2O7, and Ca2P2O7.

The heat 2)treatment protocol in the preparation of solid  solutions  was  chosen  in  the  following  manner: after heating at 90°С, the reaction mixture of compo 2) sition  Сa0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8P3O12  (x  =  0.2)  was  subjected  to differential thermal analysis (DTA) (Fig. 2). Proceed 2) ing from the results of DTA in combination with X 2)ray powder diffraction, endotherms were assigned to water evaporation from the reaction mixture (at 80–160°C) and  to  the  degradation  of  the  initial  reagents  that formed a homogeneous system (at 295–330°C), and the exotherm (at 640–665°C) was assigned to phos 2) phate formation.

The  effect  of  temperature  on  the  formation  of expected solid solution is demonstrated in Fig. 3 for a phase of composition Сa0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8P3O12 (the expo 2) sure time at the set temperatures was 24 h). At 600°С the  target  phase  crystallized  in  a  small  amount.  At 600–850°С, X 2)ray powder diffraction detected a mix 2) ture of phases that comprised the target product; phos 2) phates:  Ca(PO3)2,  Ca3(PO4)2,  and  Zn2(PO3)4;  and oxides: TiO2 and CaO. The fraction of the target phase Сa0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3  increased  as  the  temperature increased; at 900°С the target product was constituted the  single  phase,  which  was  stable  up  to  1100°C.  In Сa0.5 + хZnхZr2 – xP3O12 samples, solid solution crystal 2) lized starting at 600°С; as the temperature increased, the crystallinity of the sample increased so that single 2) phase  products  were  formed  at  740–760°С;  triple phosphates were stable up to ~800°C.

Calculated  unit  cell  parameters  change  smoothly  in response to increasing cation(2+) amount in the lim 2) ited solid solutions. This trend arises from the expan 2) sion  of  octahedral–tetrahedral  columns  along  axis  a and axis c in the NZP in response to increasing con 2) tents of Ca2+ cations (which are relatively large com 2) pared  to  titanium  and  zirconium)  and  Zn2+  cations and  due  to  an  insignificant  contraction  of  columns along axis c as a result of weakened Coulombic repul 2) sion  of  neighboring  polyhedra:  E4+–E4+,  E4+–Zn2+, and Ca2+–(Zn2+/E4+). The unit cell parameters а and с  of  Ca0.5  +  xZnxTi2  –  x(PO4)3  solid  solutions  are described as a function of composition as follows: a = 0.0064x + 8.3597 (±0.004) Å, and c = 0.7972x2 – 0.373x + 22.025  (±0.007)  Å.  The  unit  cell  parameters  of Сa0.5 + хZnхZr2 – x(PO4)3  phosphates  in  the  range where their crystal structure has rhombohedral sym 2) metry (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5) change linearly with increasing х: a = –0.0277x + 8.7834 (±0.004) Å, and c = 0.0335x + 22.747 (±0.010) Å. 

Figure  5  displays  IR  spectra  for  phases  in  the Ca0.5 + xZnxTi2 – x(PO4)3 system. For each of the phos 2) phates  whose  structure  was  solved  by  the  Rietveld method in terms of space group R  the selection rules for  IR  spectra  allow  six  bands  of  the  antisymmetric stretching vibrations ν3 and six bands of the antisym 2) metric  bending  vibrations  ν4  of    ion  and  two bands of the symmetric stretching vibrations ν1 of this ion. Bands appearing in the range 1230–1000 cm–1 are assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations ν3 of  PO4.  The  rather  large  values  of  wave  numbers  of these  bands  (1229–1206  cm–1)  are  explained  by  the fact  that,  when  a  POTi  angle  has  a  large  value,  the electron density of the polarized Ti4+ ion (which has a small size and a great charge) is partially located on the P–O  bond,  and  this  leads  to  higher  values  of  force constants  of  this  bond.  The  band  at  ~955  cm–1  was assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration mode ν1. Bands in the range 670–540 cm–1 correspond to the bending mode ν4, and bands at 490 and ~450 cm–1 to the bending vibration mode ν2 of PO4. When the cal 2) cium  content  in  the  system  is  higher  than  х  =  0.5, shoulders appear in the IR spectra in the ranges 1160– 1100  and  830–730  cm–1,  indicating  the  existence  of condensed phosphates in the samples. 

In order to verify the structures of the solid solu 2) tions studied, we carried out Rietveld refinement for Сa0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3  structure  at  room  temperature. The initial models used were comprised of the coordi 2) nates of atoms in NaZr2(PO4)3 (space group R c) and Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (space group R ). The specifics of cat 2) ion distribution over crystallographic positions in NZP phosphates are such that they can bring about lowering of symmetry and give rise to extra reflections in X 2)ray dif 2) fraction patterns [1]. The results of refinement show that some reflections in the Сa0.7Zn0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 diffraction pattern  cannot  be  indexed  in  terms  of  space  group R c, but can be completely described in terms of space group R  (hkl 003, 101, and others). For this reason, the  data  set  for  the  analogue  Ca0.5Zr2(PO4)3  (space group  R )  was  used  in  further  structure  refinement. Details  of  the  experiment,  unit  cell  parameters,  and selected  results  of  structure  refinement  are  listed  in Table 2. 

In the refinement, we assumed that Zn2+ and Ti4+ in  the  phosphate  structure  can  populate  two  frame 2) work positions that are both octahedrally coordinated by  oxygen  atoms  but  are  crystallographically  non 2) equivalent to each other (2  × 6с). The refinement of site occupancy values showed that one position is fully occupied  by  Ti4+,  while  Zn2+  and  Ti4+  are  randomly distributed in the other. Phosphorus atoms occupy the only type of tetrahedrally coordinated cationic frame 2) work position (18f). Comparatively large Ca2+ cations are in interstices M1, which are split, in space group R , into two types of positions that are surrounded by different  types  of  framework 2)forming  octahedra, namely 3a and 3b, where position 3a is fully occupied by calcium cations and the occupancy of position 3b is 40%.  The  refined  occupancies  of  interstices  M2  for Ca2+ show that these positions remain vacant.

The calculated bond lengths and bond angles have values typical for NZP phosphates and for Ca2+, Zn2+, Ti4+,  and  P5+  in  octahedral  and  tetrahedral  oxygen environments, respectively (Table 4). The mixed octa 2) hedra have a greater scatter of Zn(Ti)–O interatomic distances (3 × 1.790 Å and 3 × 1.990 Å) compared to tita 2) nium–oxygen octahedra (3 × 1.905 Å and 3 × 2.016 Å). The РО4 tetrahedra are also appreciably distorted: P– O distances fall in the range 1.517–1.628 Å. Each cal 2) cium ion is surrounded by six equally distant oxygen atoms; Ca–O distances in the two types of positions are slightly nonequivalent (2.508 and 2.714 Å).

In  summary,  we  have  designed  and  prepared  phos 2) phates of titanium (zirconium) and elements(2+), namely Ca0.5 + xZnxTi2 – x(PO4)3  and  Ca0.5 + xZnxZr2 – x(PO4)3, using  crystal 2)chemical  data.  Phase 2)formation  trends have been studied, and the concentration and temper 2) ature stability fields of the NZP structure in the sys 2) tems studied have been determined. The results of our study  contribute  to  the  literature  concerning  NZP complex  phosphates  where  elements(2+)  populate both interstices and framework positions. The systems studied serve as an example to prove the possibility of formation  of  M0.5 + x E2 – x(PO4)3  substitutional solid solutions, where M denotes a cation(2+) larger than  M'  and  E  denotes  a  cation(4+).  Varying  solid 2) solution  composition  while  retaining  the  structure 2) building structural fragments offers a tool to smoothly change  unit  cell  sizes  and  symmetries  and  to  finely correct some properties.
