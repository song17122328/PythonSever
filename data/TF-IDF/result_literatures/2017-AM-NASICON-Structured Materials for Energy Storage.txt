The demand for electrical energy storage (EES) is ever increasing, which calls  for better batteries. NASICON-structured materials represent a family of  important electrodes due to its superior ionic conductivity and stable structures. A wide range of materials have been considered, where both vanadiumbased and titanium-based materials are recommended as being of great  interest. NASICON-structured materials are suitable for both the cathode and  the anode, where the operation potential can be easily tuned by the choice of  transition metal and/or polyanion group in the structure. NASICON-structured materials also represent a class of solid electrolytes, which are widely  employed in all-solid-state ion batteries, all-solid-state air batteries, and  hybrid batteries. NASICON-structured materials are reviewed with a focus on  both electrode materials and solid-state electrolytes.

NASICON-structured materials are particularly attractive because they exhibit great  structural stability, as well as fast ionic conductivity.  The  first  known  NASICON  was  Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12  (0  ≤  x ≤  3),  which  is  a  typical  solid  electrolyte.[6]  The  NASICON  structure has the formula of AxMM’(XO4)3,  where  MO6  and  M’O6  octahedra  share  all  their  corners  with  XO4  tetrahedra.  Octahedral MO6 and M’O6 connect with three  tetrahedral XO4 units, which constitutes a  basic  unit,  and  is  named  a  lantern.  Each  lantern joins six other lanterns, generating  a  large  interstitial  space  that  can  accommodate 0 to 5 alkali cations per structural  formula.  The  number  of  alkali  cations  depends on the oxidation states of M and  M’  and  the  X  element.  In  NASICON-structured  materials,  some possible elements are as follows: 

NASICON compounds of the same composition may exhibit  different  crystal  structures,  i.e.,  rhombohedral  (r-)  and  monoclinic  (m-)  structures,  as  shown  in  Figure  1a,b.  For  the  rhombohedral  structure,  the  M–M′  dimers  ([MO6]2[XO4]3)  are  well  aligned along the c-axis (Figure 1c), whereas the M–M’ dimers of  the monoclinic structure display a zigzag alignment (Figure 1d).  Therefore, the same composition may present different electrochemical behaviors because of the different structures.

Before  NASICON  was  considered  as  an  insertion  host  for  alkali  ions,  there  was  a  long  research  history  of  over  10  years  on  the  study  of  these  materials  as  solid  electrolytes.[7]  In  the  NASICON-type  structure,  lithium  ions  or  sodium  ions  can  be  facilely inserted and extracted. Considering the rapidly growing  demand for large-scale energy-storage applications, the development  of  new  batteries  based  on  earth-abundant  elements  provides  more-sustainable  solutions.  Therefore,  due  to  the  abundant resources of sodium and its low cost, increasing attention  has  been  focused  on  sodium-ion  batteries  (NIBs).  Here,  we  review  NASICON  materials  for  NIBs,  as  well  as  lithium-ion  batteries (LIBs).

Although  several  reviews  have  been  published  on  electrode  materials  or  solid-state  electrolytes,  which  includes  progress  of  the  NASICON-structured  materials  to  some  extent,[5a,8]  no  review  to  date  has  been  dedicated  to  systematically  describing  the development of NASICON-structured materials for energy  storage.  This  review  fills  this  gap  by  covering  electrode  materials  and  solid  electrolytes  for  LIBs,  NIBs,  metal–air  batteries,  and new battery systems.


Renewable  energy  is  pivotal  for  the  sustainable  prosperity  of  our  society.  Advanced  energy-storage  technologies  will  be  the  enabler  for  intermittent  energy  sources,  such  as  wind  and  solar  power.[1]  Rechargeable  metal-ion  batteries  represent  the  state  of  the  art  of  energy-storage  devices.[2]  To  build  powerful  batteries,  a  great  number  of  electrode  materials  have  been  investigated. With respect to cathodes, most cathode materials  can be classified into two categories: close-packed metal oxide  structures,  such  as  layered  oxides,[3]  and  more-open  threedimensional  (3D)  framework  structures,  such  as  polyanionic  compounds.[4]  One  well-known  example  of  the  latter  group  is  NASICON  (NAtrium  Super  Ionic  CONductor)-structured  materials.[5]

Although  the  NASICON  structure  was  first  identified  from  Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12,  this  structure  can  accommodate  other  ions, such as Li+ and Mg2+, thus being promising as electrode  materials  for  LIBs  or  magnesium-ion  batteries  (MIBs).[9]  Ironbased electrode materials are very attractive due to their abundant  resources  and  low  cost.  Iron-based  NASICON-structured  materials  for  lithium  insertion  were  reported  in  pioneering  works  by  Nadiri,[10]  Reiff,[11]  Torardi,[12]  and  Manthiram[13]  on  LixFe2(MO4)3 (M = Mo, W). The chemical method (by reaction  with  a  calculated  amount  of  n-butyllithium  diluted  with  dry  petroleum spirit) was employed to achieve the lithium insertion  into  the  NASICON  framework,  where  they  determined  the  lithium-storage  mechanism  as  being  a  two-phase  reaction  between  the monoclinic structure (Fe2(MO4)3) and the orthorhombic structure  (Li2Fe2(MO4)3).  The  operation  voltage  is  ≈3.0  V  vs  Li+/Li,  which corresponds to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple.

Manthiram  et  al.  demonstrated  excellent  reversibility  of  lithium  storage  in  m-Fe2(SO4)3,[14]  which  shows  a  flat  plateau  at 3.6 V vs Li+/Li, corresponding to the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple,  which  is  0.6  V  higher  than  that  of  the  same  redox  couple  in  Fe2(MoO4)3  or  Fe2(WO4)3.  This  is  clear  evidence  of  the  inductive  effect  of  the  element  “X”  in  the  XO4  groups.  The  operation  voltage  depends  on  the  electronegativity  of  X,  where  S  (VI) exhibits stronger electron-withdrawing capability than Mo  (VI) or W (VI), thus weakening the M–O bands and raising the  operation  voltage  of  the  same  redox  couple.  Manthiram  et  al.  also  investigated  the  lithium-storage  properties  of  r-Fe2(SO4)3,  which  shows  a  slope  instead  of  a  plateau  in  the  potential  profiles.[14]  Okada  et  al.  studied  the  lithium-storage  behavior  of  m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3.[15]  Masquelier  et  al.[16]  and  Morcrette  et  al.[17]  further  reported  the  electrochemical  performance  of  Li3Fe2(PO4)3  with  different  structures,  where  r-Li3Fe2(PO4)3  presents a slope, whereas m-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 exhibits two plateaus  (Figure  2).  Padhi  et  al.  tuned  the  potentials  of  the  redox  couples in NASICON materials by anionic substitution of XO4.[18]  r-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 displays a slope with an average potential of 2.8 V  vs  Li+/Li,  in  which  the  position  of  the  Fe3+/Fe2+  redox  couple  was  substantially  shifted  by  0.8  V  when  switching  from  S  to   P.  r-LiFe2(SO4)2(PO4)  displays  a  slope  with  an  average  voltage  of  ≈3.3  V  vs  Li+/Li,  which  is  between  those  of  Li3Fe2(PO4)3  and  Fe2(SO4)3  for  lithium  storage  (Figure  3).  Masquelier   et  al.  also  investigated  the  lithium  storage  in  r-Li3Fe2(AsO4)3  and  m-Li3Fe2(AsO4)3.[16]  Both  materials  exhibit  two  sequential plateaus with different potentials. The plateaus are located  at  2.9,  2.6,  and  3.1,  2.4  V  vs  Li+/Li  in  the  discharge  curves  of  r-Li3Fe2(AsO4)3 and m-Li3Fe2(AsO4)3, respectively.

The  sodium-storage  behaviors  in  iron-based  NASICON  materials  have  been  investigated  as  well.  Bruce  et  al.  studied  reversible  sodium  intercalation  into  Fe2(MoO4)3  or  Fe2(WO4)3,  yielding two new compounds, Na2Fe2(MoO4)3 or Na2Fe2(WO4)3,  which  retain  the  monoclinic  symmetry.[19]  Both  electrodes  show the voltage of 2.7 V vs Na+/Na, which is 0.3 V lower than  their lithium counterparts. The Liand Na-storage behavior in  Fe2(MoO4)3  is  shown  in  Figure  4.[13,19]  This  disparity  comes  from  the  difference  between  the  potentials  of  Li+/Li  and

area mainly covers the structure of functional materials  and physical effects.

Na+/Na redox couples as they are counter/reference electrodes,  indicating that the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple operates in the same  manner. Sun et al. fabricated m-Fe2(MoO4)3 film by magnetron  sputtering  as  a  cathode  in  NIBs,  which  shows  much  better  cycling life than a bulk material.[20] Recently, Nguyen et al. synthesized  composites  of  Fe2(MoO4)3  and  conductive  materials, of V3+/V2+ is low, and this couple can be used as anode materials.[24]  Recently,  vanadium-based  NASICON  materials  have  been becoming a hot topic for energy storage.

V2(SO4)3  occurs  in  either  rhombohedral  or  monoclinic  form,  in  which  a  pure  monoclinic  phase  cannot  be  formed  and is always mixed with the rhombohedral phase.[25] The electrochemical  behavior  of  V2(SO4)3  shows  two  steps  located  at  2.63  and  2.59  V  vs  Li+/Li,  corresponding  to  the  V3+/V2+  redox  couple. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results reveal the complex lithium-storage mechanism.

Attention to vanadium-based NASICON materials for energy  storage  is  mainly  focused  on  their  phosphates.  The  thermodynamically  stable  Li3V2(PO4)3  (LVP)  is  of  the  monoclinic  form.[26] Three Li+ ions occupy different lattice sites, where Li1  is  located  at  the  tetrahedral  site,  and  Li2  and  Li3  occupy  different pseudotetrahedral sites (Figure 5). All three Li+ ions are  mobile, leading to a high theoretical capacity of 197 mA h g−1.[27] With  different  cut-off  potential  ranges,  m-LVP  displays  different  potential  profiles  (Figure  6).[8a]  In  the  range  of  3.0–4.8  V  vs  Li+/Li,  four  plateaus  are  located  at  3.6,  3.7,  4.1,  and  4.6  V  vs  Li+/Li  during  the  charge  process,  corresponding  to extraction of the first 0.5 Li+ ion, another 0.5 Li+ ion, and a  second, and a third Li+ ion from m-LVP, respectively. In the discharge process, one long slope and two short plateaus are displayed, which can be assigned to the reversible process with the  two  Li+  ions,  0.5  Li+  ions,  and  0.5  Li+  ions  re-inserted,  respectively.[28] In the charge process, four plateaus correspond to four  two-phase  reactions;  while  in  the  discharge  process,  the  slope  represents  a  single-phase  reaction,  and  the  two  small  plateaus  are  for  two  two-phase  reactions.[29]  When  the  cut-off  voltage  range is narrowed to 3.0–4.3 V vs Li+/Li, m-LVP shows a series  of three obvious two-phase transitions in both the charging and  the  discharge  processes,  where  there  is  no  slope.  The  volume  shrinks  by  ≈6.8%[30]  from  Li3V2(PO4)3  to  LiV2(PO4)3,  and  then  slightly decreases by 7.8%[27] upon further oxidation to V2(PO4)3. Although  different  diffusion  coefficient  values  of  Li+  ions  in m-LVP have been reported, they were mostly at the order of  10−9  cm2  s−1,  which  is  higher  than  that  of  LiFePO4  or  Li-rich  layered  oxides.  It  is  still  relatively  low,  due  to  the  long  diffusion  distance  of  lithium  for  micrometer-sized  materials.  The  low  intrinsic  diffusion  coefficient  can  be  enhanced  by  element  doping,[31]  whereas  the  Li+  ion  diffusion  length  can  be  shortened  by  decreasing  the  particle  size.[29b,32]  The  intrinsic

such as silver, carbon nanotubes, and reduced graphene oxide,  which exhibit greatly improved cycling stability as cathodes for  NIBs.[21]

Iron-based  NASICON  cathodes  have  been  developed  for  LIBs  or  NIBs  with  storage  capacity  of  ≈120  mA  h  g−1,  corresponding to two-electron transfer (i.e., 2Li or 2Na insertion per  formula (where Fe2(MoO4)3 is one formula)).[13,14,18] The operation voltage of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple depends on the Li+/ Li or Na+/Na redox couple and the Fe–O bond strengths, which  can be adjusted by X elements.

Vanadium can give a series of redox couples: V5+/V4+, V4+/V3+,  and  V3+/V2+,  which  can  result  in  multi-electron  transfer.[22]  Therefore,  vanadium-based  NASICON  materials  can  supply  a  high capacity. For example, Li3V2(PO4)3 as a cathode exhibits a  capacity  of  197  mA  h  g−1.[8a,23]  Furthermore,  both  V5+/V4+  and  V4+/V3+  couples  show  high  operation  potentials.  The  potential

electronic conductivity in m-LVP is ≈10−8 S cm−1,[27,33] which is  [34] due to the insufairly low and comparable to that of LiFePO4 lating  nature  of  phosphates.[35]  Doping  with  transition  metals  can  increase  the  intrinsic  electronic  conductivity  as  well,  and  carbon coating can increase the surface conductivity.[13,33]

The  particle  size  of  materials  prepared  by  solid-state  reactions  is  relatively  large  (ca.  5  µm),  resulting  in  poor  electrochemical  performance,  especially  low  rate  capability.[36]  The  sol–gel  method  was  carried  out  to  synthesize  carboncoated  and  nanostructured  m-LVP,  which  greatly  improves  the  performance.[23,29b,37]  Many  other  methods  have  been  employed  to  prepare  m-LVP.[38]  Duan  et  al.  obtained  carboncoated  LVP  with  a  small  particle  size  of  ≈30  nm  by  a  hydrothermal  method,[39]  which  delivered  a  reversible  capacity  of  138 mA h g−1 with capacity retention of 86% after 1000 cycles  at 5C in a cut-off range of 3–4.8 V vs Li+/Li. Chen et al. synthesized  nanofibers  with  a  diameter  of  200  nm,  which  exhibited  a  capacity  of  190  and  132  mA  h  g−1  at  0.1C  and  20C,  respectively,  between  3.0  and  4.8  V  vs  Li+/Li.[40]  Rui  et  al.  obtained

LVP  nanocrystals  (5–8  nm)  embedded  in  a  nanoporous  carbon  matrix  attached  onto  reduced  graphene  oxide  (rGO)  nanosheets.[41]  The  composite  presents  high  capacities,  stable  cycling life and excellent rate capability, where the capacity can  reach 90 mA h g−1 at 50C between 3.0 and 4.3 V, and remains at  88 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. Wei et al. designed hierarchicalcarbon-coated  m-LVP  mesoporous  nanowires  that  showed  a  high capacity of 117 mA h g−1 at 10C and excellent cycling stability of 80% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 5C between  3.0  and  4.3  V  vs  Li+/Li.[42]  Proposed  by  Chung  et  al.,  doping  can  improve  the  intrinsic  electronic  conductivity  and  Li+-ion  diffusivity of phosphates.[35] Along this line, Na+,[43] Mg2+,[31,44]  Ni2+,[45]  Al3+,[46]  Cr3+,[47]  Ti4+,[48]  Zr4+,[49]  and  Mo6+[50]  have  been  used as dopants to improve the electrochemical performance in  m-LVP  system.  For  example,  Cho  et  al.  reported  that  carbonsupported  and  Al-doped  m-LVP  presents  excellent  rate  performance at 20C between 3.0 and 4.8 V vs Li+/Li with a capacity of  ≈120 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles.[46b]

The  redox  couples  of  V5+/V4+  and  V4+/V3+  facilitate  LVP  as  a  cathode,  while  the  redox  couple  of  V3+/V2+  enables  LVP  to  operate  as  an  anode  as  well.  Rui  et  al.  demonstrated  that  in  m-LVP,  two  Li+  ions  can  be  inserted  with  four  plateaus  at  1.9, 1.8, 1.7, and 1.6 V in the voltage range of 3.0–1.0 V vs Li+/ Li (Figure 7), and two more Li+ can be further inserted, where  Li7V2(PO4)3  is  formed  with  the  cut-off  voltage  going  down  to  0 V Li+/Li.[24a] Kobayashi et al. fabricated a symmetric solid-state  battery with m-LVP as both cathode and anode, which delivered  capacities of 92 mA h g−1 at 80 °C and 38 mA h g−1 at 25 °C at  22 µA cm−2.[51] Mao et al. assembled symmetric LVP cells that  presented  a  2.2  V  operation  potential  and  a  high  capacity  of  162 mA h g−1 (based on cathode mass).[52]

As another type of LVP, rhombohedral LVP cannot be directly  obtained  in  a  direct  synthetic  way,  but  can  be  formed  by  ion  exchange on the more thermodynamically stable sodium counterpart—Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP).[53]  Therefore,  r-LVP  has  the  same  structure  as  r-NVP  (we  will  introduce  the  structural  details  below in Section 2.2 discussing NVP). Gaubicher et al. demonstrated  that  two  lithium  ions  can  be  extracted  from  the  r-LVP 
Figure  6.  The  electrochemical  voltage–composition  curves  of  m-Li3V2(PO4)3  in  the  voltage  ranges  of  3.0–4.8  V  (A)  and  3.0–4.3  V  (B)  vs  Li+/Li.  Reproduced with permission.[8a] Copyright 2014, Elsevier.

unit at ≈3.7 V vs Li+/Li.[53a] Morcrette et al. studied the structural  evolution of r-LVP and m-LVP.[30] Lithium extraction from r-LVP  leads to r-LiV2(PO4)3, indicating a two-phase reaction. Cushing  et  al.  obtained  Li2NaV2(PO4)3  via  ion  exchange,  which  also  shows  a  3.7  V  vs  Li+/Li  plateau.  The  Na+  ions  tend  to  remain  immobilized,  suggesting  a  Li-ion  transport  mechanism.[54]  Lu  et  al.  presented  that  the  r-Li3V1.9Al0.1(PO4)3  has  a  more  stable  structure  and  much  better  rate  performance,  compared  to  r-LVP.[55]  Jian  et  al.  prepared  carbon-coated  r-LVP,  where  two  Li+ ions can be extracted and two more Li+ ions can be inserted  into  the  structure,  corresponding  to  V3+/V4+  with  a  plateau  at  3.75 V and V3+/V2+ with an average potential of 1.75 V vs Li+/ Li,  respectively.  A  symmetric  full-cell  battery  was  fabricated,  showing a high capacity with an operation voltage of 2.0 V.[56]

NVP  has  also  attracted  great  attention  for  NIBs.  As  the  cathode  for  NIBs,  NVP  shows  a  high  operation  potential  of 

3.4 V vs Na+/Na and a high capacity of 117 mA h g−1.[57] In addition, the V3+/V2+ redox couple makes NVP a good anode.

The thermodynamically stable  phase  of  NVP is  rhombohedral,[57a,58]  which  is  different  to  its  lithium  counterpart.[26]  The  crystal  structure  of  NVP  was  first  specified  as  the  rhombohedral  (R3c)  phase  by  Delmas  et  al.  in  1978.[59]  Three  Na+  ions  have  two  different  sites  (Figure  8),  where  one  Na+  ion  (Na1)  is  in  the  6b  sites  (six-coordinate  Na–O  sites),  and  the other two Na+ ions reside in the 18e sites (eight-coordinate  Na–O  sites).[60]  However,  Masquelier  and  co-workers  recently  argued  that  NVP  adopts  the  monoclinic  form  at  low  temperatures  (i.e.,  <25.8  °C);  a  complex  forms  at  a  middle-range  temperature  and  then  transforms  to  rhombohedral  at  high  temperatures  (>177.2 °C).[61]  Others  reported  that  NVP  adopts  rhombohedral  symmetry.[53a,54,58b,59,62]  The  difference  may  lie  in  the  different  synthetic  processes  or  particle  size  or  carboncoating  effect.  Here,  we  will  focus  on  the  electrochemical  performance  of  rhombohedral  NVP  since  the  electrochemical  performance of monoclinic NVP has not been reported.

Plashnitsa et al. introduced NVP as the electrodes for NIBs,  where  two  plateaus  (V4+/V3+  and  V3+/V2+  redox  couples)  and  poor  cycling  performance  were  reported  in  a  symmetric  fullcell.[57a]  Jian  et  al.  first  reported  carbon-coated  NVP,  which  shows  a  plateau  anodic  behavior  at  3.4  V  and  a  cathodic  profile  at  1.6  V  vs  Na+/Na,  corresponding  to  V4+/V3+  and  V3+/V2+  redox couples, respectively.[57b] As the cathode and anode, NVP  delivers capacities of 98.6 and 66 mA h g−1, respectively, which  indicates  that  about  two  Na+  ions  can  be  extracted  from  NVP  (forming NaV2(PO4)3), or that one more Na+ ion can be inserted  into  the  NVP  structure  (forming  Na4V2(PO4)3).  Jian  et  al.  further observed the insertion of a fifth Na+ ion into NVP, which  presents  a  plateau  at  0.3  V  vs  Na+/Na.[63]  The  typical  charge/ discharge curves are shown in Figure 9a. Three plateaus can be  observed, which corresponds to the extraction of two Na+ ions  at 3.4 V vs Na+/Na, one Na+-ion insertion at 1.6 V Na+/Na, and  one  more  Na+-ion  insertion  at  0.5  V  vs  Na+/Na,  respectively.  The corresponding cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve is shown in  Figure 9b, revealing three reversible redox couples.

Carbon  coating  greatly  enhances  the  capacity,  cycling  performance,  and  high-rate  performance  of  NVP.[68]  Saravanan  et  al.  prepared  porous  carbon-coated  NVP,  which  presented  a  capacity  of  116  mA  h  g−1  and  50%  capacity  retention  after  30  000  cycles  at  40C.  It  also  exhibited  excellent  rate  performance,  where  the  capacity  could  reach  91  and  62  mA  h  g−1  at  20C  and  40C,  respectively.[69]  Li  et  al.  synthesized  NVP  nanograins  dispersed  in  different  carbon  matrices.[70]  NVP  in  activated  carbon  delivers  a  high  capacity  of  117.5  mA  h  g−1  at  0.5C. Fang et al. synthesized a hierarchical and highly conductive carbon framework to coat and interconnect NVP particles,  which demonstrated a close-to-theory reversible capacity at 0.2C  (115  mA  h  g−1).[71]  The  composite  presented  a  superior  highrate capability (38 mA h g−1 at 500C), and an ultralong cycling  stability  (54%  capacity  retention  after  20  000  cycles  at  30C).  Zhu et al. reported that 3D NVP:rGO–CNT (reduced graphene  oxide–carbon  nanotube)  framework  was  directly  deposited  on  the  current  collector.[72]  The  composite  exhibits  a  capacity  of  109 mA h g−1 at 30C and could reach 82 mA h g−1 at 100C (in  only 36 s). After 2000 cycles at 10C, 96% of the original capacity  could be retained (Figure 12a,b).

NVP  has  also  been  widely  studied  as  the  anode  for  NIBs,  particularly  in  symmetric  batteries,  where  both  the  anode  and  the  cathode  are  NVP.[57a]  Zhu  et  al.  demonstrated  that  NVP  as  the  anode  shows  a  high  capacity  and  stable  cycling  as  3D  NVP:rGO–CNT  (Figure  12c,d).[72]  A  symmetric  battery  was  assembled,  which  delivered  a  high  capacity  of  90  mA  h  g−1  (based on the cathode mass) with an operation voltage at 1.7 V  at 10C (Figure 12e,f). Duan et al. demonstrated that an NVP@C  (carbon) core–shell nanocomposite exhibited a higher capacity  as the cathode than pure NVP and bulk NVP@C.[73] The symmetric  full-cell  showed  a  capacity  of  90.9  mA  h  g−1  and  an  energy density of ≈154.5 Wh kg−1 (based on the cathode mass).  Jian  et  al.  investigated  a  symmetric  Na-ion  pseudocapacitor 

Figure 8.  Schematic diagrams of NVP.

To understand the sodium-storage mechanism in NVP as the  cathode, in situ XRD (Figure 10), spherical-aberration-corrected  transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 11), and solidstate  NMR  have  been  employed.[60,64]  The  results  indicate  that  it is a typical two-phase reaction. There are three Na+ ions per  NVP  unit,  and  only  two  of  them  can  be  extracted.[60,64,65]  Two  removable Na+ ions are located at the 18e site, where 2/3 of the  vacancy is orderly occupied. The third Na+ ion occupies the 6b  site, which cannot be extracted from the NVP structure.[60] The  two-phase reaction between NVP and NaV2(PO4)3 corresponds  to  a  volume  change  of  8.26%,[64]  close  to  that  of  LiFePO4.[66]  By  the  chemical  method,  only  two  Na+  ions  were  pulled  out,  forming  NaV2(PO4)3,  which  confirms  the  electrochemical

with  both  electrodes  having  NVP  encapsulated  in  a  nanoporous  carbon,  which  exhibited  a  power  density  exceeding  5.4 kW kg−1 at 11.7 A g−1, a cycling life retention of 64.5% after  10 000 cycles at 1.17 A g−1, and an energy density of 26 Wh kg−1  at 0.585 A g−1 (calculated based on the mass of both the cathode  and the anode composites).[74] Noguchi et al. developed an allsolid-state  symmetric  NIB  based  on  NASICON-related  compounds,  where  both  electrodes  were  NVP,  and  the  solid  electrolyte was NASICON-structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12.[75] The battery  could deliver a capacity of 58 mA h g−1. Lalère et al. prepared an 

all-solid-state symmetric NIB, which operates at 1.8 V with 85%  of the theoretical capacity attained at 200 °C.[76]

NVP  has  also  been  introduced  to  aqueous  systems  as  well.  The  capacity  of  the  NVP  electrode  reached  209  F  g−1  at  8.5  C  (1  A  g−1)  and  the  ion-diffusion  coefficient  was  in  the  order  of  ≈10−10  cm2  s−1.[77]  NVP  is  an  important  cathode  material  for  NIBs, which shows a high operation potential, excellent cycling  life,  and  ultrahigh  rate  performance.  As  an  important  class  of  NASICON  electrode  material,  vanadium-based  NASICONtype electrodes can be used as both the cathode and the anode  because  of  their  multiple  redox  couples.  Their  operation  voltages  are  different  in  different  materials  (including  different  structures),  where  the  relationship  of  operation  voltage  vs  redox couples and alkyl ion number in AxV2(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na,  0 ≤ x ≤ 5) is summarized in Table 1.

To  our  knowledge,  there  have  been  no  reports  on  sulfates,  molybdates, and tungstates of titanium-based NASICON-structured materials, which can be ascribed to the fact that Ti4+ is the  thermodynamically stable valence state. Therefore, we focus on  the phosphates.

Delmas  and  co-workers  first  reported  the  possible  Li+ or  Na+-ion-storage  properties  in  LiTi2(PO4)3  (LTP)  and  NaTi2(PO4)3  (NTP),  respectively,  with  both  being  rhombohedral.[7b,78]  LTP  exhibits a high ionic conductivity of ≈10−6 S cm−1, which can be  further  enhanced  by  doping.[79]  The  expected  insertion  product  is  A3Ti2(PO4)3  (A  =  Li,  Na),  corresponding to two-ion insertion. The insertion  plateaus  of  Li+  or  Na+  ions  are  located  at  2.48 V vs Li+/Li and 2.15 V vs Na+/Na, respectively,  corresponding  to  the  same  operation  redox  couple  of  Ti4+/Ti3+.[7b,78]  The  difference  of operation voltages reflects the potential gap  between the Li+/Li and Na+/Na couples. Actually, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 is also the host for Mg insertion. Makino et al. demonstrated Mg-ion insertion in Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, which shows 1.6 Mg-ion  insertion with two plateaus located at −1.6 and  −2.3 V vs Ag+/Ag.[9c]

The  in  situ  XRD  data  reveal  that  Li-ion  storage  follows  a  typical  two-phase  reaction  between LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3.[80] With  two  Li+  insertion,  the  R3c  symmetry  is  no  longer  retained,  where  the  stronger  electrostatic  repulsion  between  [Ti2(PO4)3]  lanterns  significantly increases the c/a ratio of the hexagonal unit cell. Aatiq et al. reported that three  Li+ ions reside on two similar tetrahedral sites,  18f,  named  M3’  and  M3”,  in  Li3Ti2(PO4)3,  occupying  2/3  and  1/3  of  the  sites,  respectively,  while  one  Li+  is  located  at  6b,  named  M1,  in  LiTi2(PO4)3.[81]  In  Na3Ti2(PO4)3  with  R3c  symmetry,  one  Na+  fully  occupies  the  6b  (M1)  site,  which  is  also  occupied  in  NTP;  another  two  Na+  ions  occupy  the  18e  (M2)  sites with a 2/3 occupancy ratio.[82]

Aravindan  et  al.  synthesized  carbon-coated  nano-LTP  with  a  particle  size  of  ≈80  nm,  which  showed  a  high  capacity  of  121  mA  h  g−1  with  83%  capacity  retention  over  70  cycles.[83]  Huang  et  al.  reported  carbon-coated  LTP  nanoporous  microplates that delivered a reversible capacity of 121 mA h g−1 and a  capacity retention of 94.2% over 100 cycles in LIBs.[84] Yang et al.  obtained porous NTP nanocubes via a solvothermal method.[85]  The product presented a high capacity of 101 mA h g−1 and an  excellent  cycling  stability  with  75.5%  capacity  retention  over  10 000 cycles at 10C.

In  general,  the  operation  voltages  of  the  Ti4+/Ti3+  redox  couple in LTP or NTP are considered to be too high to be used  as  anodes  and  too  low  to  be  employed  as  cathodes  in  nonaqueous LIBs or NIBs. Therefore, few studies have been carried  out for NASICON-type LTP as an insertion host in non-aqueous  electrolytes.  In  non-aqueous  half-cells  with  a  Li-metal  counter  electrode,  LTP  exhibits  excellent  rate  performance,  where  its  capacity  reaches  103  mA  h  g−1  at  10C.[86]  Nevertheless,  the

Ti4+/Ti3+  redox  voltage  in  LTP  or  NTP  is  stable  with  respect  to  the  lowest  unoccupied  molecular  orbital  (LUMO)  of  water  as  the  anode  in  aqueous  LIBs  or  NIBs.[87]  These  aqueous  metal-ion  batteries  can  employ  high-voltage  cathodes,[88]  [89]  and  LiCoO2,[90]  or  other  cathodes,  e.g.,  e.g.,  LiMn2O4 Na0.44MnO2,[91]  Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2,[92]  Na2CuFe(CN)6,[93]  and  Na2NiFe(CN)6.[94] Luo et al. demonstrated carbon-coated LTP via  the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.[86] With LiMn2O4  as  the  cathode,  LTP  as  the  anode,  and  an  aqueous  electrolyte  of  1  m  Li2SO4,  a  full-cell  delivered  a  capacity  of  40  mA  h  g−1  and an energy density of 60 Wh kg−1 based on the total mass of  both the cathode and the anode materials. Furthermore, the cell  exhibited  a  good  cycling  performance,  maintaining  ≈82%  of  its initial reversible capacity after 200 cycles. Luo et al. further  assembled  LTP/Li2SO4/LiFePO4  aqueous  LIBs,  which  showed  superior cycling capability after eliminating O2.[95] The capacity  retention  was  over  90%  after  1000  cycles  at  6C  and  85%  after  50 cycles even at a very low current rate of C/8. Sun et al. synthesized LTP@nitrogen-rich doped carbon composites, and LTP  composite/Li2SO4/LiMn2O4 aqueous LIBs were assembled. The  full-cell demonstrated a superior rate capability of 103 mA h g−1  at 10C and an outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention  of  90.4%  over  400  cycles  at  a  current  rate  of  150  mA  g−1  (based on the LTP mass).[96]

Park et al. first reported an NTP electrode for aqueous NIBs  and assembled NTP/Zn aqueous NIBs, which delivered a high  capacity  of  123  mA  h  g−1,  good  cycling  stability,  and  superior  rate  performance.[97]  Li  et  al.  demonstrated  NTP/Na0.44MnO2  aqueous  NIBs  that  exhibited  ultrafast  rate  capability  (>100C)  and  superior  cycling  stability  (>1500  cycles).[98]  Wu  et  al.  synthesized graphite-coated NTP, and assembled NTP/Na0.44MnO2 aqueous  cells,  which  showed  a  high  capacity  of  130  mA  g−1   at  0.1C  and  relatively  good  cyclability  at  1C  with  86%  capacity  retention  over  100  cycles.[99]  Wang  et  al.  investigated  the  electrochemical  performance  of  NTP/Na0.44[Mn0.44Ti0.56]O2  and  (Figure  13),  NTP/Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2  aqueous  batteries  which  showed  similar  operation  voltages,  but  a  higher  capacity  in  an  NTP/Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2  aqueous  battery.  An  NTP/Na0.66[Mn0.66Ti0.34]O2  cell  also  exhibited  excellent  rate  and  cycling  performance.[92]  Wu  et  al.  assembled  NTP/ Na2CuFe(CN)6 cells that could deliver a high average voltage of  1.4 V, an energy density of 48 Wh kg−1, and an excellent highrate cycling stability with approximately 90% capacity retention  over  1000  cycles  at  10C  (Figure  14a,b).[93]  Wu  et  al.  also  demonstrated  that  the  NTP/Na2NiFe(CN)6  aqueous  cell  provided  an  average  output  voltage  of  1.7  V  and  an  energy  density  of  42.5 Wh kg−1, and could retain 88% of its initial capacity over  250 cycles at 5C (Figure 14c,d).[94]

Besides  aqueous  batteries,  ATi2(PO4)3  (A  =  Li,  Na)  has  also  been  introduced  into  solid-state  batteries.  NTP/Na  cells  with  NaTFSI/PEO  [sodium  bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide/poly(ethylene  oxide)]  as  an  electrolyte  showed  a  stable  capacity of ≈80 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at 0.5C and 65 °C.[100]  Most  titanium-based  NASICON-type  materials  operate  on   Ti4+/Ti3+.[101] However, Senguttuvan et al. introduced Na3Ti2(PO4)3  symmetric full-cell NIBs, which delivered an operation voltage  of 1.7 V.[102] Na3Ti2(PO4)3 with a triclinic structure not only can  be  oxidized  to  NaTi2(PO4)3  (rhombohedral  structure),  but  also 

can be reduced to Na4Ti2(PO4)3 (rhombohedral structure), corresponding to 2.1 and 0.4 V vs Na+/Na, respectively.

ATi2(PO4)3  represents  a  very  promising  group  of  anodes  in  aqueous batteries due to its stable structure, high capacity, and  suitable  voltage.  Furthermore,  ATi2(PO4)3  exhibits  high  ionic  conductivity, especially after doping; we will review these materials as electrolytes in Section 3.

2.4. Multi-Transition-Metal-Based Materials

Nanjundaswamy  et  al.  synthesized  monoclinic  FeTi(SO4)3  and  Li3FeV(PO4)3,  where  the  redox  couples  include  Fe3+/Fe2+(I)  at  3.6 V, Fe3+/Fe2+(II) at 3.2 V, Ti3+/Ti2+ at 1.7 V, and Fe3+/Fe2+ at  2.8 V, V4+/V3+ at 3.8 V, V3+/V2+ at 1.75 V vs Li+/Li, respectively.[9a]  Padhi et al. also demonstrated a series of multi-transition-metal  NASICON materials, such as Li2NaFeV(PO4)3, LiNa2FeV(PO4)3,  Li2FeTi(PO4)3,  TiNb(PO4)3,  and  LiFeNb(PO4)3.[103]  The  positions  of  the  redox  couples  were  determined  with  respect  to  the  Fermi  energy  of  lithium,  as  shown  in  Figure  15:  V4+/V3+  at  3.8  V,  Fe3+/Fe2+  at  2.8  V,  Ti4+/Ti3+  at  2.5  V,  Nb5+/Nb4+  at  2.2 V, Nb4+/Nb3+ at 1.8 V, and V3+/V2+ at 1.7 V vs Li+/Li. Patoux  et  al.  reported  the  structure  and  electrochemical  performance  of  Li1.6Na0.4TiM(PO4)3  (M  =  Fe,  Cr),  which  is  of  a  rhombohedral  NASICON  structure  and  shows  stable  cyclability.[104]  Two  Li+  ions  can  be  inserted  into  Li1.6Na0.4TiFe(PO4)3,  while  only  one  Li+  ion  can  be  inserted  into  Li1.6Na0.4TiCr(PO4)3  due  to

Li-storage  mechanism  with  solid-solution  reaction  was  also  confirmed  by  potentiostatic  intermittent  titration  technique  (PITT) results.[104]

In  the  early  1990s,  Quarton’s  group  investigated  a  series  of  mixed  NASICON-type  materials:  NaxMM’(PO4)3  (M  =  Fe,  Ti,  Nb,  Sc),  such  as  NaxTiNb(PO4)3,  Na1+xFeNb(PO4)3,  and  Na2+xFeTi(PO4)3.[105]  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  positions  of  the  redox  couples  are  mostly  independent,  due  to  the  absence  of  direct  connectivity  between  the  two  (MM’)O6  octahedra. For example, the potential of the Ti4+/Ti3+ redox couple  in  NaxTiNb(PO4)3  and  Na2+xFeTi(PO4)3  is  similar  to  that  in  NaTi2(PO4)3.[106]  It  was  also  confirmed  by  Patoux  et  al.,  who  synthesized Na2+xTiM(PO4)3 (M = Fe, Cr)[104] and demonstrated  that  Na+-ion  insertion  into  Na2TiFe(PO4)3  and  Na2TiCr(PO4)3  proceeds as single-phase reactions.[104] However, Tillement et al.  showed  a  nearly  flat  plateau  on  discharge  of  Na2TiFe(PO4)3,  which  indicates  a  two-phase  reaction  between  Na2TiFe(PO4)3  and Na2.5TiFe(PO4)3.[105b]

A large number of NASICON-type electrode materials have  been  investigated,  where  the  operation  voltage  can  be  tuned  by  different  transition-metal  redox  couples  and/or  polyanion  groups.  Meanwhile,  the  structures  determine  the  electrochemical performance, despite the same composition, such as  r-LVP and m-LVP in Section 2.2. The previous section shows  a plateau corresponding to the extraction of two Li+ ions from  r-LVP, whereas the m-LVP shows four plateaus in the charge  curve  corresponding  to  the  extraction  of  3  Li+  ions.  All  three  Li+  ions  that  occupy  the  different  sites  are  mobile,  resulting  in a high capacity and several plateaus. The r-LVP is obtained  from NVP by ion exchange, which shows the same structure 
and the same charge/discharge curves for the cathode (except  for  the  voltage  difference  between  Li+/Li  and  Na+/Na).  In  NVP,  three  Na+  ions  occupy  two  different  sites  (one  in  the  6b  sites  and  two  in  the  18e  sites),  where  only  the  two  Na+  ions occupying the 18e sites are mobile, leading to moderate  capacity  and  a  single  plateau.  Furthermore,  the  electrochemical  performance  can  also  be  greatly  improved  by  doping,  shortening the ion-diffusion pathway, and by carbon coating.  NASICON-type materials are an important class of electrodes  for LIBs and NIBs.

Since  the  pioneer  work  by  Hong,  Goodenough,  and  Kafalas  in  1976,[6]  the  family  of  NASICON  compounds  has  gained  much  attention  as  solid  electrolytes.  The  solid  solution  Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12  (0  ≤  x  ≤  3)  was  prepared,  and  their  structure  and  ionic  conductivity  were  investigated.[6b]  The  structure  maintains  a  space  group  of  R3c  (rhombohedra)  for  all  compositions  except  for  those  in  the  range  of  1.8  ≤  x  ≤  2.2,  which  show  a  monoclinic  structure  (C2/c  group).  The  monoclinic  Na1+xZr2P3≤xSixO12  (1.8  ≤  x  ≤  2.2),  particularly  when  x = 2, presents the highest ionic conductivity, which can reach  2.0 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 300 °C and 6.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature.  The  rhombohedral  Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12  shows  lower  ionic  conductivity,  especially  in  NaZr2P3O12.  The  conduction  pathways  of  sodium  ions  (Na(1)  →  Na(2)  →  Na(1)  sites)  are  of  a  zigzag  geometry  (see  Figure  16[107]).[108]  Zhang  et  al.  synthesized  NaZr2P3O12  by  a  sol–gel  method,  which  showed  a  high  ionic  conductivity  (5.4  ×  10−4  S  cm−1  at  room  temperature).[109]  A  noble  metal  was  also  introduced  to  the  NASICON  solid  electrolyte.  Na1+xHf2SixP3−xO12  exhibits  very  high  ionic  conductivities,  where  the  values  of  Na3.2Hf2Si2.2P0.8O12  are  2.3  ×  10−3  S  cm−1  at  room  temperature  and  0.224  S  cm−1  at 

300  °C.[110]  However,  the  cost  is  much  higher  compared  with  Na3Zr2Si2PO12, due to the use of hafnium. Tillement et al. synthesized Na2+x+yZr1−yFexFe1−x+y(PO4)3 (y = 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1;  x + y =  1,  0  ≤  y  ≤  0.5),  where  Fe  is  of  different  oxidation  states.  The  highest ionic conductivity in these materials is 4 × 10−3 S cm−1  at 300 °C.[105a] Asai et al. investigated Na1+4xMxFe2xZr2−3x(PO4)3  (M = Fe, Co, and Ni), where the ionic conductivities were close  to  7  ×  10−3  S  cm−1  at  300  °C.[111]  Bohnke  et  al.  measured  the  ionic  conductivities  of  Na3Zr2−x/4Si2−xP1+xO12  (0  <  x  <  2).[108a]  The bulk ionic conductivity decreased slightly from 6 × 10−4 S cm−1   for the Zr non-deficient NASICON (x = 0) to 6 × 10−5 S cm−1 for  the most-Zr-deficient material (x = 1.667).

Na3Zr2Si2PO12  has  a  very  high  conductivity  and  low  cost,  and  has  been  commercialized  in  CO2  sensors.[108a]  Gordon  et  al.  fabricated  a  room-temperature  Na–S  battery  with  this  material as a solid-state electrolyte, which delivered a capacity  of  350  mA  h  g−1  (based  on  the  sulfur  mass).[67]  Hashimoto  et  al.  assembled  aqueous  and  non-aqueous  Na–O2  batteries  with  Na3Zr2Si2PO12  as  the  electrolyte  and  separator  at  room  temperature.[112]  The  aqueous  battery  showed  low  polarization  (≈0.6  V)  and  a  high  round-trip  efficiency.  Hayashi  et  al.  also  fabricated  aqueous  Na–O2  batteries,  which  exhibited  a  high  capacity  of  600  mA  h  g−1  and  a  high  energy  density.[113]  Kim  et  al.  designed  a  pouch-type  flexible  solid-state  full-cell  with  hard  carbon  as  the  anode,  NaFePO4  as  the  cathode,  and  a  Na3Zr2Si2PO12-based  composite  as  the  hybrid  solid  electrolyte (HSE).[110] The HSE exhibited a high ionic conductivity of  3.6 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. The battery delivered a  high capacity of 120 mA h g−1 and an average voltage of 2.6 V  (Figure 17a). It showed very stable cycling capability and high  Coulombic  efficiency  (Figure  17b).  However,  the  NASICON  materials  are  not  stable  in  contact  with  molten  sodium.[114]  Schmid et al. confirmed that Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 with x = 2 or  2.2 is chemically attacked, rendering it unstable for high-temperature Na–S batteries.[114]

With  rapid  development  of  LIBs,  NASICON-type  Li-ion  conductors  have  been  of  great  interest.  Li1+xM2−xM’x(PO4)3  where  M = Ti, Ge, and Hf; M’ = In,3+[115] Sc3+,[79a,116]  Ga3+,[116a,117]  Cr3+,[118]  Al3+,[115c,118b,119]  and  Fe3+[120]  have  been  investigated,  where  the  Al-doped  ceramics  show  excellent  ionic  conductivities.  The  nominal  composition  Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3  was  reported  by  Arbi  et  al.,  which  had  high  Li+  ionic  conductivities:  7  ×  10−4  S  cm−1  at  room  temperature  and  0.1  S  cm−1  at  300  °C.  In  the  Li1+xTi2−xAlx(PO4)3  system,  which  has  been  commercialized by OHARA Inc., smaller Al3+  substitutes  the  Ti4+  cations,  which  reduces  the  unit-cell  dimensions  of  the  NASICON  frameworks  and  enhances  the  ionic  conductivity  by  3  orders  of  magnitude.[119b]  Kotobuki  et  al.  synthesized  Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3  by  co-precipitation  method,  where

Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3  exhibited  a  high  room-temperature  ionic  conductivity  of  1.4  ×  10−3  S  cm−1.[121]  Recently  Arbi  et  al.  compared  Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3  and  Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3,  where  Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3  showed  a  higher  ionic  conductivity  of  3.4  ×  10−3  S  cm−1  at  room  temperature  when  x  was  0.2  or  0.4.[122]  Solid  electrolytes  are  essential  to  fabricate  practical  solid-state  devices,  including  LIBs[123]  and  Li–air  batteries,  which can be safer. al. 

Li4Ti5O12/ Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/LiMn2O4 cell, which exhibited a charge/discharge plateau at ≈2.5 V.[124] Inda et al. also reported a solid-state  Li4Ti5O12/Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12/LiCoO2  cell  that  showed  a  plateau at ≈2.4 V with a high capacity of 150 mA h g−1.[125] There  is  a  high  interfacial  resistance  between  a  solid  electrolyte  and  the electrodes. In order to overcome this problem, a buffer layer  of a polymer electrolyte, e.g., poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO):lithium  electrolyte  salts,  e.g.,  Li(CF3SO2)2N,  or  PEO:Li2O,  (named  a  poly mer electrolyte (PE)), is often incorporated between the electrodes  and  a  solid  electrolyte,  which  can  effectively  reduce  the  charge-transfer resistance.[126] As is known, Ti4+ is not cathodically  stable  in  NASICON-type  materials.  The  buffer  layer  is  also used to avoid the direct contact of Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12  (LATP) with a Li-metal anode to avoid the reduction of Ti4+.[126]  Xie  et  al.  reported  a  Li/PE/LATP/LiCoO2  cell  with  a  high 

operation  voltage  of  3.8  V.[126a]  They  also  investigated  the  lithium-storage  properties  of  a  series  of  cathodes  in  solid-state  Li/PE/LATP/cathode cells.[127]

Kumar  et  al.  assembled  a  Li–O2  battery  with  a  PE/ Li1+xAlxGe2−x(PO4)3  (LAGP)  solid-state  electrolyte,  where  the  capacity  was  found  to  be  dependent  on  the  operation  temperature.[128]  The  Li–O2  cell  exhibited  a  high  energy  density  of  3500  Wh  kg−1.  Kitaura  and  Zhou  fabricated  a  Li/PE/LATP/ CNT@LATP–O2  battery,  which  exhibited  a  high  capacity  of  400  mA  h  g−1  with  an  average  discharge  voltage  of  2.9  V.[129]  They identified a large cell resistance, which limits its rate performance, and which mainly comes from the interfacial resistance between the Li metal and the polymer electrolyte. To overcome  this  problem,  they  adhered  lithium  metal  onto  one  side  of an LAGP pellet by a thermal melting method.[129] Such a Li/ LAGP/LAGP@CNT–air  battery  was  built  and  presented  excellent electrochemical performance (Figure 18).

LTAP  has  been  commonly  utilized  as  a  separator  for  hybrid  battery  systems  with  both  non-aqueous  and  aqueous  electrolyte  compartments.[130]  Li  et  al.  built  a  Li/organic  electrolyte/ LTAP/aqueous  electrolyte/Ni(OH)2  battery,  which  exhibited  250  mA  h  g−1  with  an  average  voltage  of  3.5  V.[131]  Zhang  and  Zhou  demonstrated  a  Li/EC-based  electrolyte/LTAP/CNT  gel  battery,  which  delivered  an  ultrahigh  reversible  capacity  of

≈55 000 mA h g−1 (based on the catalyst carbon mass).[132] Ding  and  Yu  demonstrated  a  graphite/organic  electrolyte/LATP/ hydroquinone  aqueous  battery  (Figure  19),  which  showed  a  capacity of 500 mA h g−1 with a potential of 3.5 V.[133] Li et al.  designed  a  Li–O2  battery  with  a  hybrid  electrolyte  comprising  organic  electrolyte/LTAP/aqueous  electrolyte  and  NiCo2O4  and  N-doped  mesoporous  carbon  as  the  cathode  (Figure  20),  where  the  NiCo2O4  worked  as  the  oxygen-evolution  reaction  (OER)  catalyst  and  the  N-doped  mesoporous  carbon  served  as  the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst.[134] This cell presented an excellent cycle life.

NASICON  type  materials  are  considered  as  a  class  of  3D  framework compounds possessing a stable structure and high  ionic conductivity, leading to their wide applications, including  energy-storage,  membranes,  fuel  cells  and  gas  sensors.  This  review  presents  the  state  of  the  art  of  NASICON  as  Li-ion  or  Na-ion  storage  materials,  and  solid-state  electrolytes,  along  with  their  applications.  Usually,  the  operation  potentials  show  the  following  trend:  V5+/V4+  >  V4+/V3+  >  Fe3+/Fe2+  >  Ti4+/Ti3+  >  Nb5+/Nb4+  >  Nb4+/Nb3+  >  V3+/V2+  >  Ti3+/Ti2+.  On  the  other

hand,  polyanions  also  lead  to  different  potentials,  which  is  called the inductive effect. It is known that the weak M–O bands  (the NASICON structure has the formula of AxMM’(XO4)3) can  raise the operation voltage of the same redox couple. Therefore,  NASICON-type materials with high electronegative polyanions  will present high operation potentials due to their stronger electron-withdrawing  capability.  The  electrochemical  performance  of  NASICON  can  be  greatly  improved  by  carbon  coating,  decreasing  the  particle  size  and  doping.  The  structural  evolution  has  also  been  investigated  to  understand  the  ion-storage  mechanisms.

To avoid the risk of thermal runaway, solid-state batteries have  been  proposed  as  a  fundamental  solution.  Solid-state  batteries  face  great  challenges,  especially,  the  low  intrinsic  ionic  conductivity of solid electrolytes and large interfacial resistance between  electrodes and the electrolyte. To overcome the former problem,  new solid electrolyte materials with high intrinsic ionic conductivity should be developed. NASICON-type electrolytes can supply  a  choice.  For  Li-based  solid-state  electrolytes,  LATP  shows  high  ionic conductivity and low cost, while LAGP is also widely studied  due to its better stability than LATP. Many types of solid-state batteries and hybrid batteries have been fabricated, exhibiting superior  electrochemical  performance  and  expanding  the  family  of  battery  systems.  Concerning  the  latter  problem,  NASICON-type  materials  can  be  used  for  the  cathode,  anode,  and  electrolyte.  Therefore, all-NASICON solid-state batteries can be fabricated. It  can  form  an  electrolyte  buffer  layer  of  a  solid-solution  or  composite  between  NASICON  electrodes  and  electrolyte,  which  can  build fast ionic channels, leading to a low interfacial resistance.
