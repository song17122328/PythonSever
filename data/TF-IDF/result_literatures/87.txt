Pure Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) phosphates with the NASICON-type structure were synthesized using solid-state reaction. Depending on the cation M, the synthesis temperature and the annealing durations were optimized. The electrochemical performances of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 were evaluated as negative electrode material for Li-ion batteries over two different voltage ranges, 1.5 - 3.0 V and 1.0 - 3.0 V. The best electrochemical results were obtained for the voltage range 1.5 - 3.0 V with discharge capacities of 100 mAh g-1 and 80 mAh g-1 for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3, respectively, over 20 cycles with capacity retentions exceeding 80 %. Raman spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of the carbon layer after the carbon-coating procedure. In operando XRD was performed to investigate the structural changes upon the first discharge/charge cycle showing the progressive evolution of Li-poor and Li-rich phase fractions. Ex situ XPS analysis was conducted to follow the oxidation state of titanium during the insertion/de-insertion of lithium ions demonstrating that the redox couple (Ti4+/ Ti3+) is reversibly active during the electrochemical cycling.  
Nowadays, the energy community is aiming for a clean, safe and renewable energy due to the depletion of fossil fuels and their negative impact on the environment. Therefore, many electrode materials were investigated for high energy lithium ion and sodium ion batteries [1-9]. Among them, NASICON (Na Super Ionic CONductors) materials have gained considerable attention thanks to their interesting physical properties. NASICON-type structure materials, with the general formula AnB2(PO4)3 (where A: alkali metal, B: transition metal), were first reported by Goodenoough et al. [10] in 1976. The structure consists of a 3D network built up of corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra and BO6 octahedra with large interconnected channels where the A cations are inserted in two types of sites, usually labelled M1 and M2. Many chemical compositions were reported in literature [10-14] and their potential use for electrochemical energy storage was studied by many groups [10, 15-25]. The electrochemical storage reaction in titanium-based materials ATi2(PO4)3 (A: Li, Na) were first reported by Delmas’s group [16]. LiTi2(PO4)3 (abbreviated as LTP) exhibits a high ionic conductivity of ≈ 10−6 S cm−1, which can be further improved by doping. When testing LTP in Li half-cells, an insertion of two lithium ions is evidenced corresponding to the redox reaction Ti4+/ Ti3+ that occur at 2.48 V versus Li+/ Li. The XRD data revealed that Li-ion storage follows a typical two-phase reaction between LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3. Indeed, the R-3c symmetry of LiTi2(PO4)3 is no longer retained during lithiation and transformed to Li3Ti2(PO4)3 with R-3 space group, where the stronger electrostatic repulsion between [Ti2(PO4)3] lanterns significantly increases the c/a ratio of the hexagonal unit cell. 
Moreover, in the 3D framework, TiO6 octahedra are connected to PO4 tetrahedra where the electron is trapped by a Ti4+ cation and its migration to the next Ti4+ ion requires a long range Ti-O-P-O-Ti electronic transfer. Consequently, these materials show low electronic conductivity and strong cell polarization. Masquelier et al. [17] reported the synthesis of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 using the co-precipitation route and its electrochemical properties as potential negative electrode material for lithium and sodium ion batteries. In operando XRD technique was employed during the first cycle evidencing the existence of a solid solution over the investigated composition range. Moreover, the full pattern refinement revealed an anisotropic variation of the cell parameters while M1 sites were filled, leading to constancy in the cell volume. On the other hand, the cell parameters are increased when the M2 sites were filled with lithium ions. Aatiq et al. [19] reported the structural study of Li3Ti2(PO4)3 demonstrating that three Li+ ions (per formula unit) occupy two similar tetrahedral sites, 18f, named M3’ and M3” with a ratio of 2/3 and 1/3, respectively, while one Li+ is located at 6b, named M1, in LiTi2(PO4)3. In this work, a new chemical composition Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) is proposed by introducing a second metal in the M1 site of the LTP crystal structure. By this approach, we recently showed that the introduction of transition metal (Ni2+) onto the M1 site occupied by Li in Li1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 enhanced the kinetics of the lithium insertion/extraction leading to good rate capability [23].  In the present study, we selected two cations Co2+ with d-electrons and Mg2+ without d-electrons. Furthermore, the abundance of cobalt in earth crust is very low (around 0.0025 % compared to 2.1% for magnesium) and its toxicity is detrimental to the environment. Therefore, our study relies on synthesizing a material Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) with low cobalt content and its possible replacement with low cost, abundant and eco-friendly magnesium [26]. Moreover, the aim of this work is to develop a detailed study on the electrochemical behavior of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) in lithium half-cells correlating the structural and electronic properties using in operando X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  
The effect of calcination temperature on the material purity was investigated. The samples calcined at 600 °C, 800 °C and 1050 °C were analyzed by XRD. The XRD diffractograms of the three samples, shown in Figure 1, reveal that Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) with NASICON-type structure was obtained starting from 600 °C. However, some additional reflections of titanium pyrophosphate TiP2O7 were detected. Moreover, when increasing the calcination temperature to 1050 °C, pure phases of the Co-based compound were obtained. Nevertheless, the Mg-based compound at 1050 °C was inhomogeneous and the XRD confirms the presence of some TiP2O7 impurity. As a result, a second thermal treatment was required at 1050 °C/ 2 h (labeled in Fig. 1 as 1050 °C – 2) which lead to a pure phase.
Figure 2 shows the Rietveld refinement of the pure samples Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) prepared at 1050 °C. All reflections were indexed with the NASICON-type structure in the rhombohedral system, with R-3c space group. Pure Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 phases were obtained and no additional impurity peaks were detected. The cell parameters and atomic positions are displayed in Table 1.  
Figure S1 depicts the structure projection of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) onto (100). The prepared phosphates Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) crystallize in a rhombohedral structure with R-3c space group. The lithium, M: cobalt/ magnesium and titanium atoms reside in an octahedral site and the phosphorus atoms occupy a tetrahedral site. The M’ (Li, Ti, M: Co, Mg)O6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra form a three-dimensional rigid framework sharing common corners and forming interconnected channels for lithium intercalation. The M1 site on Wyckoff position 6b (0, 0, 0) is occupied with 0.8Li+ and 0.1M2+ (Co, Mg) which results in 10% vacant sites on M1, while the M2 site (18e) is totally vacant. This description is indeed general for NASICON-type structure with the general formula NaA2IV(PO4)3 (AIV = Ge, Ti, and Zr) and was first established using X-ray data in 1968 [29].  Li and Co/Mg are located in the same M1 site. Note that the two materials provide available vacant sites (especially M2 voids), 2 Li+ ions per formula unit can intercalate into the material lattice during the charge/discharge process within the potential window, corresponding thus to a theoretical specific capacity around 136.5 mAh.g-1. The morphology, particle size and distribution were observed using scanning electronic microscopy. Figure 3 shows the SEM images of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg). Both materials show interconnected, agglomerated and irregular particles. The morphology of the two samples is also quite similar. The particles have a bean-like to flaky shape. Furthermore, the particle size is micrometric around 0.5 – 5 μm which is attributed to the chosen synthesis route, i.e. solid-state reaction.  
Raman analysis was done on the samples with and without carbon coating to investigate the formation of the carbon layer on the particles. Figure S2 gathers the Raman spectra of uncoated Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and coated Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C (M: Co, Mg). The peaks appearing in the region 150 - 400 cm-1 are assigned to the cation – oxygen vibrations and (PO4)3- translation and rotation modes. The O - P - O bending vibrations are visible in the region 400 - 630 cm-1, while the stretching vibrations of P-O bonds are located around 900 - 1100 cm-1. Furthermore, the D and G bands, which are characteristic of carbon, are present only in the composite materials denoting that the carbon layer was successfully incorporated. D and G bands are detected at 1342.89 cm-1, 1594.79 cm-1 for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and around 1335.51 cm-1, 1596.77 cm-1 for Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3, respectively. The ratio IG/ID was estimated to be around 1.11 and 1.08 for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3, respectively. The ratio IG/ID is high denoting a partial graphitization of the incorporated carbon. 
The effect of the cut-off voltage on the electrochemical performance of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) was preliminary investigated. Figure 4 shows the discharge capacity vs. the cycle number of Li//Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) cell cycled at C/2 current rate over 1.5 - 3.0 V and 1.0 - 3.0 V voltage ranges. The prepared phosphates show poor electrochemical properties when discharging the cell to 1.0 V cut-off voltage. In fact, the Co- and Mg-based NASICON materials show discharge capacities of 113 mAh g-1 and 102 mAh g-1 during the first cycle and only 70 mAh g-1 and 44 mAh g-1 after 20 cycles of discharge/charge, respectively. Furthermore, the capacity retention is very poor, i.e. around 65 % and 38 % for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3, respectively. In contrast, when discharging Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 to 1.5 V cut-off voltage, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved. Higher discharge capacities around 100 mAh g-1 and 80 mAh g-1 are obtained after 20 cycles with good retention exceeding 80 % for the Co-based and Mg-based phosphates. Moreover, a high irreversible capacity around 90 mAh g-1 is observed for the materials discharged to 1.0 V whereas an irreversible capacity lower than 10 mAh g-1 is obtained for the materials cycled with 1.5 V cut-off voltage. The voltage vs. specific capacity profile of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (See Fig. S3) at the voltage range of 1.5 – 3.0 V reveal that these materials show a flat large plateau and lower polarization upon the excessive cycle of discharge/ charge. Therefore, the range 1.5 – 3.0 V was set as the optimized voltage window for this study. The in operando XRD and XPS techniques were carried out as well within this potential window.   
The voltage vs x in Li0.8+xM0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg and x: amount of exchanged lithium ions) curve during the first two cycles at C/10 current rate over 1.5 – 3.0 V voltage range is plotted in Fig. 5. During the first discharge, the OCV (i.e. open circuit voltage) drops rapidly to around 2.4 V where a large plateau occurs. This voltage plateau is attributed to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as confirmed by our XPS results described below. During the first cycle, an insertion of 1.57 and 1.68 lithium ions was estimated versus the de-insertion of 1.4 and 1.65 lithium ions for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C and Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C, respectively. During the second discharge, the plateau around 2.4 V of Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C shrinks significantly and higher polarization is observed compared to the Mg-based phosphate Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C. Generally, the strong polarization, related to the low electronic conductivity in such polyanionic materials, results from the fact that TiO6 octahedra are connected to each other by PO4 tetrahedra and the migration of the electron from a Ti4+ cation to its Ti4+ neighbor requires an electronic transfer through Ti-O-P-O-Ti [16]. However, magnesium is reported in many studies to enhance the electronic conductivity [30-32], which is clearly noticed in our case. Furthermore, a pseudo plateau (corresponding to the insertion of almost 0.1 Li+ ion, is observed around 2.8 V exclusively for Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3@C during the first charge and second cycle denoting the reversible insertion/ de-insertion of lithium ions in the M1 site. Indeed, M1 site is full with 1 cation/f.u while the starting composition of the studied phosphates shows only 0.9 cation/f.u. Moreover, the discharge/charge profiles are reversible revealing the insertion/ de-insertion reversibility of lithium ions into/from the Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 structure. In operando XRD analysis will be discussed in detail below. 
To elucidate the electrochemical mechanism in Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) versus Li+/Li, the structural changes were studied by in operando XRD at C/10 current rate over 1.5 – 3.0 V voltage range.  
Figure 6.a illustrates the series of in operando XRD diffractograms of Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 during the first discharge/ charge processes. The hexagonal unit cell parameters of the pristine material (Table 1: a = 8.51244(3) Å, c = 20.88365(1) Å) match those calculated for the OCV pattern (a = 8.51082(6) Å, c = 20.87119(3) Å). In the voltage region from the OCV to 2.41 V, around 0.1 Li+ ions were inserted into the structure on the M1 6b (0, 0, 0). Our Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern recorded at 2.46 V revealed that “a” is constant while “c” decreased (a = 8.51373(4) Å, c = 20.85212(6)). In the plateau region 2.41 – 2.33 V, a total insertion of 1.09 Li+ ions occurs in the vacant M2 site leading to the coexistence of two phases with the same space group R-3c: one is a Li-poor phase Li0.8+xCo0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where x ~ 0.1) and the other is a Li-rich phase Li0.8+xCo0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where  x ~ 1.47). The two-phase reaction was investigated using a two-phase model for refining the in operando XRD data. By analyzing the evolution of the peaks during the discharge, the main peaks of the Li-poor phase (110), (104), (113), (024), (211), (122), (116) detected at 2-theta 7.53°, 7.54°, 8.84°, 10.66°, 11.62°, 11.92°, 11.93°, respectively, vanish progressively. Whereas new peaks of the Li-rich phase were rising and increasing in intensity at 2-theta 7.53°, 7.57°, 8.84°, 10.67°, 11.62°, 11.93°, 11.94°, respectively. Figure 6.b shows the phase fraction versus scan number as deduced from the Rietveld refinement of all XRD data where the scan was performed. As shown, the Li-rich phase fraction increases continuously with the amount of the inserted Li ions during discharge. It reaches 77% by the end of discharge stopped at the cut-off of 1.5V (a = 8.39148(6) Å, c = 22.76475(1) Å) versus 23% of the Li-poor phase (a = 8.51354(3) Å, c = 20.82663(9) Å). During the inverse process (i.e. charge), the Li-poor phase (where the cell parameters are: a = 8.51135(9) Å, c = 20.83466(3) Å) ratio increases to reach 74% by the end of charge at the expense of the Li-rich phase (where the cell parameters are: a = 8.36162(7) Å, c = 22.04461(7) Å). The characteristic peaks of the Li-poor phase rise again and those of Li-rich decrease in intensity.  
Figure 7.a presents the in operando XRD diffractograms of Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 during the first discharge/charge process. The cell parameters of the pristine powder (a = 8.50335(5) Å, c = 20.87559(1) Å) are close to the calculated ones for the OCV pattern from the in operando XRD measurement (a = 8.51865(4) Å, c = 20.88021(1)Å). During discharge, it was observed from the electrochemical test data (see Fig. 5.b) that around 0.1 lithium ions are inserted in the structure (OCV – 2.45 V voltage range). This insertion occurs in the M1 site supported by a slight increase in “a” parameter versus a slight decrease in “c” (a = 8.52456(5) Å, c = 20.87956 (3) Å, measured for the XRD pattern recorded at 2.42 V). As the cell Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3//Li is discharged further, lithium ions insertion occurs on the M2 vacant site. Similar to its homologue Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3, two-phase reaction occurs in he plateau region (i.e. 2.45 – 2.31 V voltage range) where a Li-poor phase Li0.8+xMg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where x ~ 0.1) and a Li-rich phase Li0.8+xMg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where x ~ 1.58) coexist. Two-phase Rietveld refinement was carried during the first cycle and Figure 7.b shows the phase fraction versus scan number. Both phases have the same space group R-3c. In the beginning, the Li-poor phase is dominant with a ratio of 98% vs. 2% of the Li-rich phase. However, the ratio of Li-rich phase is increasing and reaches around 63% vs. 37% of Li-poor phase by the end of discharge, where the cell parameters of each phase are: a = 8.535578(5) Å, c = 20.85671(5) Å for Li-poor phase, and a = 8.403278(2) Å, c = 22.83947(9) Å for Li-rich phase. Moreover, new peaks belonging to the Li-rich phase are appearing whereas the initial peaks of the Li-poor phase are decreasing in intensity. During discharge, the peaks (110), (104), (113), (024), (211), (122), (116) located at 2-theta 7.52°, 7.53°, 8.83°, 10.65°, 11.61°, 11.91°, 11.91°, respectively, were decreasing in intensity. However, new peaks were rising at 2-theta angle 7.14°, 7.63°, 8.72°, 10.46°, 11.77°, 12.01°, and 11.38°. During the charging process, the characteristic peaks of the Li-poor phase Li0.8+xMg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where x ~ 0.1) increase in intensity while the intensity of the characteristic peaks of the Li-rich phase Li0.8+xMg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (where 0.1 < x ≤ 1.58) are decreasing. Furthermore, the phase fraction increases progressively in favor of the Li-poor phase (a = 8.52402(7) Å, c = 20.86424(8) Å) and reaches a ratio of 94% by the end of charge. 
Delmas et al. [16] reported that Li-ion insertion mechanism in the case of LiTi2(PO4) follows a typical two-phase reaction.  LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ti2(PO4)3 coexist in the plateau region where the R-3c symmetry of LiTi2(PO4)3 is no longer retained during lithiation and transformed to Li3Ti2(PO4)3 with R-3 space group. In another recent study, Voronina et al. [33] demonstrated the reversible intercalation/ de-intercalation of K+ ions in KTi2(PO4)3 electrode material via a two-phase reaction using operando XRD technique. At the end of discharge, only the peaks of potassium rich phase K1+xTi2(PO4)3 were observed with R-3c space group. Our work is in good agreement with these findings. During the first lithiation step which takes place in the void space of M1 site, a Li-poor phase Li0.8+xM0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (x ~ 0.1, M: Co, Mg) is dominant. However, by discharging our phosphates more and more to the plateau region, a new phase is growing which is a Li-rich Li0.8+xM0.1Ti2(PO4)3. The space group R-3c was maintained. The low cell polarization in the case of Mg-based phosphate probably results from the faster kinetics of the lithium diffusion between the two end-phases (in the plateau region), resulting from superior electronic conductivity of Li0.8+xMg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 phosphate in comparison to Li0.8+xCo0.1Ti2(PO4)3.    
The valence state of titanium was probed during different states of the first discharge/ charge process using XPS. Because of the low content of Co and Mg in our materials and of the detection limit of XPS, it was not possible to detect a signal of these two elements with enough intensity. The pristine electrode and ex situ samples discharged/charged at C/5 current rate and stopped at selected voltages were measured. Figure 8 presents the Ti 2p XPS spectra of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) upon the first cycle. 
Figure 8.a shows the XPS spectra of Ti 2p for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 during the first cycle. For the pristine electrode, the Ti 2p doublet with Ti 2p3/2 at 459.4 eV is in agreement with the expected result for Ti4+ oxidation state [34]. However, while discharging the material versus Li+/Li, a second doublet of weak intensity appears with Ti 2p3/2 at 457.7 eV attributed to Ti3+ (ΔE to Ti4+ of 1.7 eV [35]). At the end of discharge, the contributions from Ti3+ are noticed to increase, which is consistent with the electrochemical process occurring at this stage (i.e. successive Ti4+ reduction to Ti3+ upon the lithium insertion process). However, the reduction reaction is not complete at this voltage, which is in agreement with the electrochemical and in operando XRD results where only 1.57 Li+ ions were inserted and some Li-poor phase is present at the end of discharge. Subsequently, the intensity of the Ti 2p doublet typical for Ti3+ is decreasing during the charging process as expected from the oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ during the de-insertion of lithium ion. At the end of charge, both oxidation states Ti4+ and Ti3+ were detected. This finding follows the electrochemical results where the de-insertion reaction was found to be partially irreversible (about 1.4 Li+ ions were extracted). Figure 8.b presents the Ti 2p XPS spectra of Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 upon the first cycle. For the pristine electrode, Ti4+ is exclusively present in the sample where a doublet with Ti 2p3/2 at 459.4 eV is detected.  However, when discharging Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 against Li+/Li to 2.38V, some contributions of Ti3+ were noticed together with Ti4+ denoting partial reduction of Ti4+. At the end of discharge, the ratio Ti(III)/Ti(IV) is higher than 1. This result follows the obtained electrochemical data where a total of 1.68 Li+ ions were inserted during the first discharge process. When charging Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3 against Li+/Li to 2.49 V, the reverse process is observed (i.e. oxidation of Ti3+) where Ti3+ is decreasing in favor of the increase of the contribution of Ti4+. Furthermore, exclusively the doublet of Ti 2p characteristic of Ti4+ was observed by the end of charge denoting the completely reversible oxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+. This result confirms the electrochemical data where 1.68 Li+ ions were inserted versus the de-insertion of 1.65 Li+ ions. 
Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 (M: Co, Mg) were synthesized using a solid-state reaction at 1050 °C. Pure NASICON-type materials crystallize with the rhombohedral system and R-3c space group. The prepared phosphates were characterized using XRD, SEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of Li0.8M0.1Ti2(PO4)3 were studied in Li half-cells. Both materials show a large reversible plateau around 2.4 V denoting the reversible redox reaction Ti4+/Ti3+. The lower cut-off voltage was optimized and set to 1.5 V. The magnesium-based material shows specific capacities comparable to that of the cobalt-based materials. Discharge capacities around 100 mAh g-1 and 80 mAh g-1 are obtained for Li0.8Co0.1Ti2(PO4)3 and Li0.8Mg0.1Ti2(PO4)3, respectively, after 20 cycles with good retention exceeding 80 %. The results of the in operando XRD experiments revealed that the pristine structure evolves to a lithium rich phase at the end of discharge and the space group is well preserved as R-3c. First, the insertion of lithium ions takes place in the void space of M1 (6b), and then in the M2 (18e) vacant site which leads to the coexistence of two phases in the plateau region: one is a Li-poor phase and the second is a Li-rich phase. Furthermore, the Li-poor phase becomes dominant again by the end of charge. Ex situ XPS technique demonstrates the reversible reduction/oxidation of Ti4+/ Ti3+ during the discharge/ charge process.
