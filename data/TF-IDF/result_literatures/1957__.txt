Solid-state syntheses on the Na3Al2(PO4)3 composition have been carried out from 850 to 1273 K at pressures up to 8 GPa. At 923 K and pressures above ca. 0.5 GPa, Na3Al2(PO4)3 crystallises in a NASICON-type structure and becomes an ionic   2 S/cm at 600 K, 1.5 GPa. Actually, the form recovered at room conditions conductor with a bulk conductivity of around 5.10 is the monoclinic deformation of the rhombohedral NASICON cell. The two non-quenchable phase-transitions which lead to the true R-3c NASICON cell are met in high-pressure impedance spectroscopy (HPIS) experiments at 410 and 451 K, 0.4 GPa, and 454 and 508 K, 1.5 GPa, respectively. At 1073 K and pressures of 3.9, 6 and 8 GPa, another Na3Al2(PO4)3 form is obtained which is isostructural to rhombohedral Na3Fe2(AsO4)3 (II-NaFeAs), the high-temperature modification of Na3Fe2(AsO4)3 garnet (I-NaFeAs). 
Amorphous Na3Al2(PO4)3 has been recently recognised to belong to the vast family of solid ionic conductors referred in the literature to as NASICON [1,2]. The high sodium-conductivity and the good cation-exchange properties of the members of NASICON-structure compounds such as Na1 + xZr2SixP3   x O12 series with 0 < x < 3 (traditional NASICON series [3,4]), or new series like Na1 + xTi2   xAlx(PO4)3 with 0 < x < 0.9 [5] and Na3V2(PO4)3 [6], as well as a growing potential application of them in battery electrodes and for chemical sensors, have motivated recent studies of structurally related compounds. 
For example, most compounds with a general formula Me+ 3(Me3 +)2(Me5 +O4)3 (with Me+ = Na, Li, Ag or K, Me3 + = Ga, Cr, Fe, Al, Sc or In and Me5 + = As or P) belong to the NASICON-class where the mechanism of the electrical conductivity infers hopping of Na ions among adjacent sites M(1), M(2) and M(3) through channels parallel to the c-axis built in the anionic framework of Me3 +O6 octahedra and Me5 +O4 tetrahedra [3,7]. Besides the fast ionic conductivity, some of these compounds of NASICON-structure possess a low thermal expansion [8,9]. They can also be potentially used as sensors for some ion-exchange and redox insertion/extraction reactions under mild experimental conditions [6]. 
The sodium phosphates, Na3(Me3 +)2(PO4)3 (with Me3 + = Fe, Cr, In, Sc), crystallise with the true R-3c NaZr2(PO4)3 structure, first established in Ref. [10], and they all show similar structural properties [11]. Apart from Na3In2(PO4)3, all these phosphates display a monoclinic modification towards low temperatures [11 – 14], similar to that described in Ref. [15] for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 NASICON. Sodium arsenates, structurally related compounds, were less studied than their phosphate analogues. Sodium arsenates, with Me3 + = Cr and Fe, adopt the garnet structure [16] and show a hightemperature rhombohedral modification with an open structure, called II-NaFeAs [17]. Sodium arsenates with a smaller trivalent cation (Me3 +), like Al and Ga, are only known under the II-NaFeAs form. When, on the contrary, larger cations like Sc or In are incorporated, then Na3Sc2(AsO4)3 crystallises with the true R-3c NASICON structure whereas Na3In2(AsO4)3 crystallises into a fourth, alluauditelike, structure [18]. 
Besides that, the substitution of Li for Na in Na3Fe2(AsO4)3 stabilises the garnet structure [19].
The structures which were under the scope of previous 1-bar studies for Na3(Me3 +)2(PO4)3 and Na3(Me3 +)2(AsO4)3, with Me3 + = Al, Fe, Cr, Sc, the NaCa2Me2 + and In, are reported in a two-dimensional space of both pentavalent (As and P) and trivalent (Me3 +) cation ionic volume (Fig. 1). Three types of structures can be defined. The NASICON-type structure field includes phases with the NaZr2(PO4)3 structure with or without monoclinic modification. It is a wide field including all phosphate as well as scandium arsenate compositions. Most arsenates, however, crystallise with the rhombohedral II-NaFeAs structure (with or without garnet modification, I-NaFeAs). At one end of the diagram (Fig. 1), Na3In2(AsO4)3 corresponds to the compositions with the largest cations; Na3In2(AsO4)3 crystallises with the alluaudite structure. At the opposite end, Na3Al2(PO4)3 with the smallest cations has never been obtained from dry synthesis [15]. 
It must be noted that temperature does not affect the boundary between the various structure fields. In other words, polymorphic relationships have never been described at atmospheric pressure between the structures mentioned in Fig. 1. Actually, this does not hold true for 2(AsO4)3 compounds (with Me2 + = Mg, Ni, Co) which exhibit a garnet – alluaudite transition [21]. It has been claimed in Ref. [22] that the synthesis of Na3Al2(PO4)3 garnet could be achieved by cooling a molten Na3PO4 + AlPO4 mixture at ambient pressure. However, the inspection of Fig. 1 shows that the growth of Na3Al2(PO4)3 garnet at ambient pressure is unlikely. As a matter of fact, the garnet structure has been recognised in arsenate compounds but never in their phosphate counterparts the P5 + ion. in relation to the smaller size of Previous studies dealing with Na3(Me3 +)2(Me5 +O4)3 compounds were undertaken at atmospheric pressure. 
They mainly aimed at producing, by varying both temperature and cation size, NASICON compounds with various structural opening. Due to the small size of the Me3 + and Me5 + cations in Na3Al2(PO4)3, pressure appears to be a key parameter to obtain the R-3c NASICON structure, which is commonly found for Na3(Me3 +)2(Me5 +O4)3 compounds. It can be mentioned at this stage that the Na+ conductivity in Na3Al2(PO4)3 is expected to be comparatively low and the activation energy to be high in a NASICON framework composed by a small octahedral metal like Al3 + [9]. The ionic conductivity of crystalline Na3Al2(PO4)3 has never been investigated, however, and is the focus of this study.
The 3/2 Na2O + Al2O3 + 3/2 P2O5 stoichiometry is achieved by grinding under ethanol a mixture of Na2CO3 + Al2O3 + NH4H2PO4 (Aldrichn, 99.999%) in an agate mortar. The homogeneous mixture is then held for 1 h at 873 K and for another hour at 1273 K and then quenched in air. A recrystallised melt has been recovered, then it was crunched into millimetersized pieces and subsequently milled for 30 min under ethanol in an agate mortar. The final powder product was loaded in a gold or platinum capsule and hermetically welded.
Syntheses below 400 MPa and 873 K were carried out in externally heated cold-seal vessels. The experimental set-up is detailed in Ref. [23]. Syntheses at pressures between 400 and 800 MPa, and temperatures above 873 K, were performed in an Edinburghtype internally heated pressure-vessel (IHPV) using argon as pressure medium. Gas pressure is measured with an electronic gauge to F 1.5% and temperature was monitored by two S-type Pt/PtRh10 thermocouples. Synthesis at pressures from 1 to 4 GPa were carried out in an end-loaded piston-cylinder apparatus (Paris). An encapsulated sample was loaded in a conventional high-pressure assembly consisting of NaCl-sleeves as a pressure transmitting media and a graphite straight-wall furnace; see Ref. [24] for details. Temperature is measured with an S-type Pt/ PtRh10 thermocouple. Pressure calibration was done by using two known phase equilibria: farringtonite X Mg3(PO4)2-II phase transition [25] and albiteZ jadeite + quartz reaction [26].
A few syntheses at higher pressures up to 8 GPa were carried out in a multi-anvil MA-8 apparatus [27]. Tungsten carbide cubes with 40-mm edges and 25mm truncation-edge lengths were used. The pressure medium is a MgO-based octahedron (17-mm edges) with a stepped graphite furnace. For more experimental details, the reader is referred to Ref. [27].
All run products were first characterised using Xray powder diffraction. Ten milligrams of the powder sample was ground under ethanol in an agate mortar and smeared with ethanol on a glass slide. X-ray diffraction patterns were acquired on an INEL diffractometer (CoKa radiation) equipped with a CPS 120 detector. Silicon (NBS standard) pattern is used to convert channels into diffraction angle (2hj). Precise lattice parameters of selected single crystals (60 – 90 Am in average size) have been determined by means of single-crystal diffraction. The unit-cell parameters of the sample crystals were determined using a Huber four-circle diffractometer operated with non-monochromatized Mo X-ray radiation and using a singlepoint detector. Details of the instrument setting and the peak-centering algorithm are provided in Refs. [28,29]. The effects of crystal offsets and diffractometer aberrations were eliminated by applying the diffracted-beam technique [30]. 
Lattice parameters determined by a least-squares fit to the corrected setting angles of reflections showed no deviations from symmetry-constrained unit-cell parameters. The values of symmetry-constrained lattice parameters obtained by a vector-least squares fit [31] were determined from 22 to 27 accessible reflections up to 35j in 2hj. When crystal size was not suitable for single-crystal diffraction, lattice constants were refined on powder using the UnitCell software [32].
Electrical impedance measurements were performed on synthetic Na3Al2(PO4)3 powders at pressures from 0.3 to 1.5 GPa and temperatures up to 1050 K in an end-loaded piston-cylinder press [33] in Frankfurt. The room temperature Bi I – II and Bi II – III transformations at 2.56 and 2.7 GPa [34], respectively, as well as the melting curves of NaCl and CsCl [35] and the a  h transition in LiNaSO4 [33] were used for pressure calibration. Melting points of NaCl and CsCl as a function of pressure up to 2.5 GPa have been determined by in-situ electrical conductivity measurements and compared with the table values. Pressure is believed to be accurate within F 0.05 GPa. Electrical impedance measurements were carried out using a Solartronk 1260 Phase-Gain-Analyser interfaced with a PC. The device permits a single sine drive and analysis of a system under test over the frequency range of 10 AHz to 32 MHz. In this study, we applied a 1-V sine signal over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz. 
Typically, the frequency scan were performed with logarithmic frequency steps of 0.2 – 0.5 log units. Signals at higher frequencies (>100 kHz) were affected by cable impedance, and at lower frequency (< 0.01 Hz) signals became too noisy.
A cell for electrical impedance measurements in the piston cylinder utilised a coaxial cylindrical capacitor with two electrodes from pure Pt-tubes of 0.1 mm in thickness. Both outer and inner electrodes are made from Pt-tube having a diameter of D = 3.8 mm and d = 2.2 mm, respectively. The estimated geometric factor G varied from 5.8 to 6.3 cm from one experiment to another. The exact geometric factor of the cell was evaluated independently before high pressure impedance measurements from calibrations on NaCl solutions (for details see Ref. [33]). The starting material in the form of polycrystalline powder was pressed in a coaxial cylindrical gap between the two Pt-electrodes. Measurements of the geometric factor of the cell after high-pressure experiments revealed that due to the cell deformation under pressure the length of the cylindrical capacitor L increases by f 3 – 4%, the outer diameter D increases by 1 – 2%, and the inner diameter d remains constant. 
The main advantage of using a coaxial cylindrical geometry instead of a parallel plate geometry in a pistoncylinder apparatus is the negligible change of the geometric factor during loading of the cell under pressure.
During impedance measurements in the pistoncylinder, the press was isolated from the ground of the Solartronk 1260. Wires from the Pt-thermocouple and the nongrounded mass of the high-pressure autoclave were used to connect the measuring device and the cell electrodes. After each set of measurements, a measuring circuit was calibrated for short-circuit and open-circuit impedance over the frequency range 1 MHz – 0.01 Hz. A typical AC-resistance of the cell to a short connection was f 0.4 V. These calibrations have been taken into account in the final calculations of the electrical impedance as a function of frequency (NovocontrolR software). The electrical impedance measurements were conducted without automatic temperature control in order to avoid the electrical noise from the thyristor regulating the electric power applied to a graphite furnace in the high-pressure assembly. The temperature was adjusted manually through a variable transformer. 
The hydraulic oil pressure in the piston ram was regulated by the use of a servo-motor pushing back and forth the piston in a separate hydraulic cylinder. The estimated accuracy of pressure is F 50 MPa, the accuracy of temperature is F 3 K.
Three Na3Al2(PO4)3 polymorphs have been identified, named Na3Al2(PO4)3-I, -II and -III hereafter, in dry syntheses performed from ambient pressure up to 8 GPa in the 848 – 1273 K temperature range (Table 1). Syntheses in the presence of water were avoided since they were found to lead to the formation hydrous aluminium Na-phosphates.
Syntheses at pressures up to 0.66 GPa yielded a first compound with a Na3Al2(PO4)3 composition, Na3Al2(PO4)3-I (see electron microprobe analyses in Table 2). In a run at 660 MPa, 873 K, beside Na3Al2(PO4)3-I, a large amount of Na7(AlP2O7)4PO4 is present (the corresponding starting mixture has not been further used). It should be noted that most of the Na3Al2(PO4)3-I reflections are also present in the diffraction pattern of Na3Al2(PO4)3 from Ref. [36], which displays additional reflections that could be attributed to Na7(AlP2O7)4PO4 (Table 3).
Pressure is then slowly increased from 0.4 up to 1.5 GPa at 633 K within 30 min. The real component of the electric impedance (ZV) at 1 kHz (which approaches the bulk DC impedance value) is found to increase from 830 to 1810 V cm (i.e. 890 V cm   1). Then, the sample is held overnight at 853 K, GPa 1.5 GPa, i.e. under P – T conditions close to the initial sample synthesis conditions. Sample resistivity is found to decrease from 170 down to 70 V cm. It seems, the amount of low-pressure phase produced at 0.4 GPa back-transformed into the initial polymorph. It should be noted that due to the presence of Na3Al2(PO4)3-I in the sample measured at 0.4 GPa, sample resistance measured at 1.5 GPa is lower than that measured at 0.4 GPa at the same temperature, contrary to the expected trend for a single-phase material.   1 down to 411 K allows to meet the two phase-transitions encountered at 0.4 GPa but shifted to higher temperatures (508 and 454 K). 
The results of the quenched experiments and of the HPIS measurements are summarized into a tentative phase diagram in Fig. 4.
Na3Al2(PO4)3-I is likely to be the stable form of Na3Al2(PO4)3 at low pressure. It could even be stable down to atmospheric pressure if one assumes the Na3Al2(PO4)3 synthesis of Ref. [36] as a phase mixture including Na3Al2(PO4)3-I (Table 3). The relatively low ionic-conductivity of Na3Al2(PO4)3-I rather suggests that, contrary to the higher pressure polymorphs, Na3Al2(PO4)3-I does not crystallise into a fully open structure. It is therefore an unusual case of structure opening driven by pressure that renders the Na3Al2(PO4)3-I structure determination an exciting issue. The twinning of Na3Al2(PO4)3-I crystals observed in single-crystal diffraction experiments suggests a phase transition that could occur at around 763 K, in the 0.3 – 1.8 GPa range, according to our HPIS measurements. Submitted to pressure above 0.5 GPa, Na3Al2(PO4)3-I transforms into Na3Al2(PO4)3-II which shows a NASICON structure like other Na3(Me3 +)2(PO4)3 phosphates. 
The conductivity mechanism in Na3Al2(PO4)3-I is translational motion of Na+ ions [38]. The window allowing the translational movement of Na+ from one structural cavity to another is comparable with the size of the ion. This explains a rather high value of the activation energy of DC bulk conductivity. The requirement of high pressure to stabilise the NASICON structure is in keeping with the small size of the cation found in each Na3Al2(PO4)3 crystallographic site. 
Among the depicted phases, Na3Al2(PO4)3 shows one of the smallest volume and is, to our knowledge, the X+ 3(Y3 +)2(Z4 +O4)3 NASICON phase with the highest compaction ever reported. Interestingly, Na3Al2(PO4)3-II is super ionic conductor at high pressure with conductivity values around 3 10   2 S/cm at 373 and 973 K, respectively, at 1.5 GPa, i.e. close to that of the best NASICON-type conductors. For comparison, along the NASICON series Na1 + xZr2Six(P1   x/3O4)3, conductivity varies from 3 10   1 S/cm at 773 K to 5  10   4 S/cm at 323 K for x = 2, and from 3 10   2 S/cm at 773 K to 4 10   4 S/cm at 323 K for x = 1.2 [41]. In Na3Zr2   x/4Si2   x(P1 + x/3O4)3, x = 1/3, conductivity is highest for the compositions of NASICON structure and varies from 2 10   2 S/ cm at 473 K to 3  10   4 S/cm at 303 K [42]. 
In-situ impedance measurements allowed to identify two reversible transitions which have already been reported in similar compounds. By analogy to Na3Fe2(PO4)3, the low temperature phase (i.e. the structure recovered after quenching) corresponds to the a form (monoclinic transformation of the rhombohedral NASICON-cell). The middleand highertemperature forms would correspond to h and g, respectively, two closely related rhombohedral phases of NASICON structure which only show a slight volume difference according to high-temperature diffraction data on Na3Fe2(PO4)3 [14]. A major result of this study is the Na3Fe2(PO4)3-II – Na3Fe2(PO4)3-III transition encountered at pressures above 3 GPa and which involves the transformation of a NASICON structure into another open structure, II-NaFeAs (see Ref. [17] for II-NaFeAs structure description). Again, compared to Na3Fe2(AsO4)3 or Na3Cr2(AsO4)3 of same structure, Na3Al2(PO4)3-III appears to have a volume by around 15% smaller (Table 6).
The stability of a Na3Al2(PO4)3 polymorph with a II-NaFeAs structure is an interesting issue since it renders the existence of Na3Al2(PO4)3 garnet possible. At atmospheric pressure, Na3Fe 2(AsO4)3 and Na3Cr2(AsO4)3 show a transition towards low temperatures into a garnet form of smaller molar volume. By analogy, the transformation of Na3Al2(PO4)3-III into a garnet form, if any, is expected at higher pressure (or lower temperature) than that at which Na3Al2(PO4)3III was obtained. If one applies a volume change of about 9% to 10% at the transition based on the volume change encountered for the arsenate analogues (Table 6), the volume the Na3Al2(PO4)3 garnet (V/Z) would approach is 195 A˚ 3. The corresponding a-parameter assuming a cubic-garnet cell would then range from 11.5 to 11.6 A˚ . These predicted values are consistent  with the 11.7 A˚ value (i.e. V/Zf 200 A˚ 3), calculated using the linear regression in Ref. [43] where the size of the each cation is taken into account (i.e. Na, Al and P).
Na3Al2(PO4)3-I, which is likely to be the stable Na3Al2(PO4)3 form at ambient pressure, displays a moderate ionic conductivity comparable to that of amorphous Na3Al2(PO4)3 [39]. Its conductivity increases with temperature due to a progressive opening of the diffusional path of Na in the structure. Due to the relatively small size of the octahedral trivalent cation (i.e. Al3 +) in Na3Al2(PO4)3, pressure is required to stabilise the R-3c NASICON structure for that composition. Application of high pressures on the NASICON polymorph (Na3Al2(PO4)3-II) induces a phase transformation into a NaFeAs-II structure which is also known for its Na-conductivity properties. Towards very high-pressures, above 8 GPa, fast Naconductivity may cease due to a possible transition into a fourth polymorph with a garnet structure. In addition to the Na3Al2(PO4)3-I structure determination, this study should prompt additional high-pressure and high-temperature investigation towards the suspected garnet field. 
However, in order to achieve that goal, and due to the now recognised polymorphism wealth in the Na3Al2(PO4)3 system, in-situ characterisation techniques appear as the most appropriate.
