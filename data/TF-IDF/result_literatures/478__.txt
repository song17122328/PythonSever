The CO2 sensing of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensors were investigated. Experimental results show that the resistances for PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 in CO2 gas are larger than those in air and the responses for PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensors increase with an increase in room-temperature relative humidity. When exposed to 1000 ppm CO2, the response of PrFeO3 thick film based on nano-powders annealed at 700 °C can reach 8.44 at 160 °C for the background of wet air with 58% of room-temperature relative humidity (RH), which is much larger than the corresponding value (3.03) in wet air with 25% RH. The sensing response S of NdFeO3 thick-film sensor based on nano-powders annealed at 600 °C to 3000 ppm CO2 at the operating temperature 200 °C can reach 2.36 for the background of wet air with 72% RH, which is larger than the corresponding value (1.83) in the air with 25% RH. Compared with other CO2 sensing materials, the PrFeO3 sensor has larger response at lower operating temperature for CO2 gas and may be used as a new CO2 sensing material.

In recent years, global warming resulting from greenhouse gas emissions has become a widespread concern. As we all know, global warming is caused by the emission of large quantities of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Among these gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) contributes more than 60% to global warming.1 The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now close to 400 ppm, which is significantly higher than the preindustrial level of about 300 ppm.2 Moreover, CO2 is an asphyxiant gas. At concentration of 1% CO2 (10000 ppm), some people feel drowsy. Concentrations of 7%–10% may cause suffocation. Therefore, the detection and monitoring of CO2 concentration has become an urgency for aerospace and commercial applications. However, compared with gases such as O2, H2, Cl2, CO or NOx, CO2 is quite inert with respect to the ability to reduce or oxidize. So, the monitoring of CO2 based on redox reactions is difficult. For this reason, the development of CO2 sensors is a difficult and challenging task, and only a limited number of CO2 sensing materials3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 exist. The materials utilized for CO2 gas sensors are mainly electrolytes,8, 9, 10, 11, 12 organic polymers and metal oxide.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Among these gas sensors, metal oxide semiconductors have been widely used for CO2 gas.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 CO2 sensors based on metal oxides have various advantages such as low cost, good reliability, small size, easy mass production and feasible using for monitoring of gas compatible with solid state-based gas sensor technology.

Several oxides have been tested based on changes in the electrical conductance of the material upon exposure to CO2 in air. Examples include ZnO,27 SnO2,28 rare-earth metal oxide-based materials (such as LaOCl,20, 29 SmCoO3,30 GdCoO3,31 LaFeO3,32 Nd2O2CO3,33 La1−xCaxFeO3,34 La1−xBaxFeO335 and La1−xSrxFeO336), metal-oxide composite nanostructures (such as CuO-BaTiO3,4 LaOCl-SnO2 (p-n),22 La2O3-SnO224 and La2O3-BaTiO337). It has been reported that La-doped SnO224 and BaTiO338 are the most reliable options for CO2 detection. When exposed to CO2 gas, the resistance of n-type semiconductors sensor decreases, and the resistance of the p-type semiconductor increases.

Perovskite oxide is one of the most promising material systems for semiconductor gas sensors and has excellent sensing properties such as large sensitivity, high selectivity, good thermal stability and better structure control. As perovskite-type oxides, few sensing properties have been investigated regarding PrFeO339, 40 and NdFeO3, especially their CO2 sensing properties. In the present paper, two novel CO2 sensing materials, nanocrystalline PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 have been successfully demonstrated for CO2 detection. We have found that thick films sensors based on PrFeO3 nanocrystalline powders with annealing temperature of 700 °C can exhibit very good CO2 sensing performance. The response to 1000 ppm CO2 at the operating temperature of 160 °C reaches 3.03 and 8.44 at the room temperature and humidity of 25% RH and 58% RH, respectively. At the operating temperature of 180 °C with the room temperature humidity of 25% RH, the response of the PrFeO3 sensor to 1000 ppm CO2 is 2.38. PrFeO3 sensor is more sensitive than most reported CO2 sensing materials. For NdFeO3 sensor, the optimum operating temperature is 200 °C and the response to 1000 ppm CO2 is 1.39 at room temperature humidity of 25% RH. The response of the two new CO2 sensor materials to CO2 concentrations ranging from 1000 to 9000 ppm at a wide range of relative humidity is described in detail.

Nanocrystalline PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 powders were synthesized by sol-gel method according to previous work.17, 18, 19, 32, 34, 35, 36 First, stoichiometric ratio of praseodymium nitrate or neodymium nitrate, ferric nitrate and citrate acid (all analytically pure) was completely dissolved in deionized water at 80 °C. Citric acid was added in a ratio of 1:1.5 of metal nitrate to citric acid. Polyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular weight: 20000) was then added under constant stirring to obtain sol, and the sol was dried to a gel at a temperature of 100 °C for 12 h, and then the gel piece was ground to form a fine power. For subsequently annealing, the samples were placed in an oven at 400, 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 °C for 4 h, respectively. The structure of resultant powders was carefully characterized by X-ray diffraction using Cu Kα radiation and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Sensors were prepared based on previous works.18, 19, 28, 35 The powder was mixed with a suitable amount of deionized water to form a paste, which was then coated onto an Al2O3 ceramic tube (4 mm in length and 1.2 mm in diameter, attached with a pair of gold electrodes and platinum wires) by a small brush to form a thick film (thickness is about 250 μm), and dried in air for 1 h. A Ni-Cr heating wire was inserted into the tube to adjust the operating temperature of the sensors. The sensors are annealed at 240 °C for 48 h on aging equipment in air. All the sensors were placed in the test chamber and preheated at different operating temperatures to keep steady. Then CO2 was added in the test chamber. When the gas evenly filled the chamber, the system attained a new stable value. After that, the test chamber was opened to recover the sensor and all the measurements were repeated several times to ensure the reproducibility of the gas-sensing response. The sensitivity of thick film in the experiment was defined as S = Rg/Ra, where Rg is the resistance measured in CO2 gas and Ra is the resistance in air.

The XRD pattern obtained at room temperature of the polycrystalline PrFeO3 powder annealed at various temperatures of 400–900 °C for 4 h is shown in Fig. 1. It is observed that the XRD spectra are of a single phase PrFeO3. All peaks could be indexed to orthorhombic cell associated with space group Pbnm. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that as the annealing temperature increases, the crystallinity gradually becomes better. PrFeO3 powder annealed at 400 °C is amorphous. Typical SEM micrograph of PrFeO3 powders that were annealed at different temperatures of 600, 700 and 800 °C for 4 h are shown in Fig. 2. The microstructure reveals that the morphology of the prepared PrFeO3 sample contains a large number of small particles. Particles with a size of 10–100 nm can be observed. The histogram of the grain size distribution is also shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 shows the annealing temperature dependence of the PrFeO3 sensors (with different operating temperatures) on the CO2 response in the background of ambient air. Since PrFeO3 is a p-type semiconductor, the response value of S > 1 means that the resistance of PrFeO3 in CO2 gas is larger than that in air at the same temperature. As the annealing temperature rises, the response increases and reaches a maximum at 700 °C and then decreases rapidly. The PrFeO3 thick film sensor annealed at 700 °C can sensitively respond to CO2. For PrFeO3 thick film sensor: The optimum annealing temperature for obtaining the maximum inductive response is approximately 700 °C, while the best sensor response is found at 160 °C. When exposed to 1000 ppm of CO2, the corresponding responses were 3.03 and 2.38 at operating temperatures of 160 and 180 °C (with the room temperature humidity of 25% RH). For temperatures below 160 °C, the resistance of the PrFeO3 sensor is too large to measure. Therefore, we mainly investigated the operation temperature above 180 °C. As the operating temperature increases, the CO2 response of PrFeO3 sensor decreases.

The relationship between the response of PrFeO3 annealed at 700 °C and CO2 concentration at different operating temperatures is shown in Fig. 4. The response increased significantly with increasing CO2 concentration. It is well known that response and recovery characteristics are important for evaluating the performance of gas sensors. We investigated the response-recovery behaviors of PrFeO3 sensor. Fig. 5 shows resistance time curves of PrFeO3 sensor annealed at 700 °C for different concentrations of CO2: (a) 1000 ppm CO2; (b) 3000 ppm CO2; (c) 5000 ppm CO2; (d) 7000 ppm CO2. The resistance for PrFeO3 sensor annealed at 700 °C increases when exposed to CO2. Since PrFeO3 is a typical p-type semiconductor, the above results demonstrate that CO2 behaves as a reducing gas and releases electrons to the surface of PrFeO3 sensor. The sensor exhibits good response and recovery properties for CO2. As can be seen from Fig. 5(a), (b) and (d), the response of PrFeO3 sensor does not reach the maximum of 1000, 3000 and 7000 ppm of CO2. According to Fig. 5(c), we can find that the response time and recovery time of PrFeO3 sensor at 180 °C to 5000 ppm CO2 are 441 and 98 s, respectively.

Fig. 6 shows the humidity dependence of the sensing response to 1000 ppm CO2 at an operating temperature of 160 °C for PrFeO3 annealed at 700 °C. Relative humidity was measured at room temperature. The response S of PrFeO3 at 160 °C to 1000 ppm CO2 are 1.34, 1.55, 3.03, 4.97 and 8.44 in the background of air with the relative humidity of 12%, 18%, 25%, 37% and 58% RH. We can see that as the humidity increases from 12% to 58% RH, the sensing response of PrFeO3 sensor to 1000 ppm CO2 increases.

Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of polycrystalline NdFeO3 powders annealed at various temperatures from 400 to 900 °C for 4 h. The XRD pattern indicates that NdFeO3 nanocrystallines have an orthorhombic cell structure associated with space group Pbnm. As the annealing temperature increases, the crystallinity of the material is gradually getting better. Fig. 8 shows the SEM images of NdFeO3 powders annealed at different temperatures of 600, 700 and 800 °C for 4 h. For these samples, the nanosized particles are spherical. It can be seen that the samples exhibit a typical framework and the agglomerations of particles is observed in the micrographs. Grains with the size of 10–110 nm can be observed. The histogram of grain size distribution is also presented in Fig. 8.

Fig. 9 shows the annealing temperature dependence of the sensing response to 3000 and 5000 ppm CO2 gas for the NdFeO3 thick film sensors with the ambient air (with the room temperature humidity of 25% RH). As can be seen from Fig. 9, the optimal annealing temperature is 600 °C. The value of Rg/Ra > 1 indicates that the resistance of NdFeO3 in CO2 gas is larger than the resistance in air at the same temperature. For NdFeO3 is a p-type semiconductor, Rg/Ra > 1 means that CO2 acts as an electron donor during the sensing process. At operating temperature of 200 °C, the value of response S of NdFeO3 to 3000 and 5000 ppm CO2 were 1.83 and 2.55 at the optimum annealing temperature TA = 600 °C. Among the sensors studied, the NdFeO3 sensor shows the maximum response CO2 at its optimal annealing temperature TA = 600 °C. At the optimal operating temperature of 200 °C, the response of NdFeO3 to 1000 ppm CO2 was 1.39 at the room temperature humidity of 25% RH.

Fig. 10 shows the CO2 concentration dependence of the response of NdFeO3 thick film sensor for different operating temperatures. As can be seen from Fig. 10, 200 °C is the optimal operating temperature. The response of NdFeO3-based sensor increases with the increase of CO2 concentration. At 200 °C, the response increases linearly as the CO2 concentration increases from 1000 to 7000 ppm. After that, the response gradually reaches saturation. For 9000 ppm of CO2, the responses were 1.978, 3.75, 1.967, 1.355 and 1.145 for NdFeO3 at operating temperatures of 160, 200, 240, 260 and 300 °C.

Fig. 11 shows the dynamic gas-sensing characteristics of NdFeO3 thick film sensor exposed to different concentrations of 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 and 9000 ppm of CO2 in the background of ambient air. The operating temperature was 200 °C. The four exposures were carried out in an on-and-off process. When CO2 gas was introduced, the response of the NdFeO3 sensor increases, and when the CO2 gas was shut, the response of NdFeO3 sensor decreases again. The responses to 3000, 5000, 7000 and 9000 ppm CO2 at different humidity conditions are shown in Fig. 12 for NdFeO3 thick film sensors at 200 °C. From Fig. 12 it can be seen that as the humidity increases from 25% to 72% RH, the response of NdFeO3 to CO2 increases. At 200 °C, the responses to 3000 ppm CO2 are 1.83, 1.91, 2.09, 2.23 and 2.36 at 25%, 40%, 52%, 63% and 72% RH, respectively.

Selectivity is an important criterion of gas sensor, especially in the practical application. To study the selective behavior of PrFeO3 at 180 °C and NdFeO3 at 200 °C, the gas response sensitivity was measured by comparing the responses towards 1000 ppm CO2, H2, CO, NO, NO2 and C3H6, respectively. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 13. The results made from Fig. 13 are that the sensors based on PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 show larger response to all other target gases than to CO2. Since CO2 is an inert gas and the concentration of CO2 in the air is much greater than other test gases, the CO2 sensors based on PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 may still be used.

For most semiconducting oxide gas sensor, the change in resistance is primarily caused by the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on the surface of the sensing films. In air ambient, PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 will adsorb the oxygen molecule on the surface.

The chemisorbed oxygen captures electrons from the conductance band, resulting in a decrease of the surface resistance. When CO2 is introduced at moderate temperature, the adsorbed oxygen on PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 can react with the gas and the electrons are released back to PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 surface, resulting in the increase of sensor resistance (as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 11).

The optimum annealing temperatures of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensors are 700 and 600 °C, respectively. From the FE-SEM pictures in Fig. 2, Fig. 8, it can be seen that PrFeO3 powders annealed at 700 °C are looser than those annealed at other temperatures. The small diameters of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 will improve the special surface area, and the loose structure in PrFeO3 annealed at 700 °C and NdFeO3 annealed at 600 °C is beneficial for the diffusion of gas molecules, which may improve the response.

The responses of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensors initially increase and attain a highest value and then decline with the operating temperature (as shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 10). The quantity of the chemically adsorbed gas species on the surface gradually increases with the operating temperature increasing until the rate of desorption becomes equal to that of adsorption. If the temperature is further enhanced above this temperature, the balance will move to desorption, for the chemisorption is an exothermic reaction. Then the amount of adsorbed gas is reduced, resulting in a decreased gas response.41, 42

The adsorption of the test gas, which depends on both the concentration of the gas and the type of sensor materials, could hugely affect the gas response. PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 gas sensors present different responses to CO2 at the optimum operating temperatures. The sensitivity of the materials is affected by binding energy of the Pr–O and Nd–O bonds.43 The binding energy provides an indication of the possibility of the oxygen adsorbed on the surface to react with CO2. The higher the absolute value of the binding energy, the smaller the sensitivity towards the test gas. The binding energy of Pr–O is lower than that of Nd–O bond.43 The low binding energy of Pr–O bond may result in easy dissociation in the chemical bond. The much adsorbed oxygen that can be dissociated from the Pr–O bond will participate in oxidation reaction and be beneficial to improving gas sensing properties.

The adsorption of water on semiconductors' surfaces plays an important role in their application as a gas-sensing material. It has been acknowledged that water vapor or OH group from the dissociated H2O plays a vital role during the CO2 sensing process. The H+ dissociated from H2O would adsorb on O of the surface to form a new OH–.28 As shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 12, for PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensors, the greater the relative humidity, the higher the sensors response for CO2 gas. So humidity enhances the response of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 to CO2. DRIFTS data have corroborate the CO2 sensing response is water-assisted.8 Humidity underlining the great potential of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3-based sensors makes us propose that the reaction between CO2 and water-related species is responsible for the gas-sensing effect. It is reasonable to suggest that OH– may be present on the surface of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 at higher temperatures and CO2 reacts with OH group pre-adsorbed on the surface of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 to form carbonates containing (CO3)2–. And the changes in the sensing response are correlated with concentration changes of surface hydroxyl groups. It seems that the high room temperature humidity may be beneficial to the CO2 response of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensor at high operating temperatures. 

Furthermore, the response performances of PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 of the present study were compared with those of previous works (see Table 1). The values in present study are higher compared with those previously reported metal oxide-based CO2 sensors, indicating that PrFeO3 is much more favorable to detect CO2 gas at lower operating temperature.

In the present work, nanocrystalline powders PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 were prepared by sol-gel method, and followed by heat-treatment. CO2-sensing properties of thick films based on PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 nanocrystalline powder sensors were investigated. For PrFeO3 sensor, the optimal annealing temperature is 700 °C. CO2-sensing response increases with increasing of relative humidity from 12% to 58% RH. For NdFeO3 sensor, 600 °C is the optimal annealing temperature to obtain the best sensor with the largest CO2 response. On the other hand, 200 °C is the optimal operating temperature for obtaining a large sensing response. The CO2 sensing response S for NdFeO3 sensor increases with an increase of room-temperature relative humidity from 25% to 72% RH. Such results indicate that the sensitivity to CO2 has been enhanced by room temperature humidity for PrFeO3 and NdFeO3 sensor. Besides, the PrFeO3 sensor has larger response with lower operating temperature for CO2 gas compared with some other CO2 sensing materials. The PrFeO3 may be used as a new kind of CO2 sensing material. Our present work provides unusual p-type semiconductors for CO2 sensing in the presence of water vapor.
