An  all-solid  state  symmetric  monolithic  sodium  ion  battery  operating  at  200°C  is  described, 

using NASICON-type electrodes and electrolyte. Na3V2(PO4)3 is used at both electrodes as the 

active  material  while  Na3Zr2Si2PO12  stands  the  role  of  the  Na+  solid  electrolyte.  Both 

compositions  present  order-disorder  phase  transitions  and  present  decent  ionic  conductivity 

properties, 1.5 x10-3 S.cm-1 and 1.9 x10-4 S.cm-1 at 200°C for Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3V2(PO4)3, 

respectively. The full battery (560 m m in thickness) was assembled in a 10’ single step by spark 

plasma sintering at 900°C. The electrochemical characteristics at high temperature (200°C) were 

evaluated thanks to a new experimental set-up. The battery operates at 1.8 V with 85 % of the 

theoretical  capacity  attained  at  C/10  with  satisfactory  capacity  retention,  for  an  overall  energy 

density of 1.87 x10-3 W.h/cm2 and a capacity of 1.04 mA.h/cm2. 


Over the past decade, lithium-ion technology has become the leader of the energy storage market 

for portable devices due to its high volumetric and gravimetric energy densities. However, the 

increasing  demand  combined  with  possible  lithium  resources  restrictions  might  lead  to  a 

prohibitive price of these batteries [1, 2]. Thanks to its low cost, sodium does not fall under the 

same considerations and appears as a good alternative to lithium. However, safety issues related 

to flammable liquid electrolytes remain a serious concern and become even more serious because 

of the very high reactivity of sodium with moisture and oxygen. All solid-state batteries, which 

use  non-flammable  ion-conducting  solid  electrolytes  instead  of  an  organic  liquid  electrolyte, 

have been proposed as strong candidates for alternative energy storage devices [3-9]. 

The 3-D NASICON framework has been extensively studied for its structural stability and fast 

ion  conduction,  initially  as  a  solid  electrolyte  and  more  recently  as  a  host  for  reversible 

insertion/extraction of Li+ or Na+ [10]. The seminal papers were reported in 1976 by Hong and 

Goodenough [11, 12] for the solid solution Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12 (NZSP, 0 < x < 3) with highest 

conductivities of ~10-1 S.cm-1 at 300°C for 1.8 < x < 2.2 [13]. The exact values of these ionic 

conductivities depend on the exact stoichiometry of the NASICON composition prepared, itself 

sometimes  difficult  to  control  when  high-temperature  sintering  processes  are  required 

(~1150°C).  Since  then,  it  has  been  widely  studied  as  a  solid  electrolyte,  especially  for  gas 

sensors, ions sensors applications [14-17] and Na/S technology [18].  


Gopalakrishnan  was  the  first  to  report  [19]  on  the  chemical  oxidation  of  NASICON 

2(PO4)3  (Na+  extraction)  to  yield  the  new  mixed-valence  (V5+  and  V4+)  composition 

V2(PO4)3,  thus  providing  the  possibility  of  exchanging  more  than  one  electron  per  transition 

metal.  Later  on,  the  electrochemical  extraction  of  Na+  from  Na3V2(PO4)3  to  NaV2(PO4)3  was 

shown to occur following a two-phase reaction at 3.4 V versus Na+/Na (for a theoretical capacity 

of  117.6  mAh/g),  the  latter  phase  being  isotypical  with  NaTi2(PO4)3  [20-22].  Moreover,  as 

shown as well by Yamaki et al. [20] and Patoux  [21], V3+ may be reduced to V2+ through the 

insertion of one sodium towards Na4V2(PO4)3 at 1.6 V vs. Na+/Na (for a theoretical capacity of 

58.8  mAh/g).  Therefore,  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  may  be  used  as  either  a  positive  or  negative 

electrode  in  Na  batteries  and  offers  the  possibility  of  building  NVP  //  electrolyte  //  NVP 

symmetrical cells capable of delivering 1.8 V, as reported by Okada et al. [23, 24]. 

Recently, Aboulaich et al. [3] and  Delaizir et al [4] have demonstrated the benefits of using the 

Spark Plasma Sintering technique (SPS) to assemble dense monolithic all-solid state lithium ion 

batteries,  as  a  new  path  for  designing  safe  and  efficient  energy  storage  devices.  We  hence 

decided  to  follow  this  approach  and  focus,  for  the  first  time  to  our  knowledge,  on  all-ceramic 

dense  monolithic  Na-ion  batteries  based  on  symmetrical  Na3V2(PO4)3  /  Na3Zr2Si2PO12  / 

Na3V2(PO4)3 cells that operate remarkably well at temperatures as high as 200°C. 


Monoclinic,  NASICON-type  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  active  material,  was  prepared  by  solid-state 

reaction. NaH2PO4 (Prolabo, 98%) and NH4VO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) precursors were mixed 

(mortar)  in  stoichiometric  proportions,  heated  at  400°C  for  4  hours,  mixed  again  and  then 

calcined at 750°C for 8 hours with intermediate grindings. The whole annealing procedure was 

performed  under  an  argon-hydrogen  (5  vol%  H2)  gas  mixture  flow  to  reduce  VV  into  VIII,  as 

described in [25]. 

The solid electrolyte Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) was prepared by a sol-gel method as described by 

Zhou et al.[17]. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4, TEOS) (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%), Zirconium 

tert-butoxide  (Zr(OC4H9)4)  (Sigma-Aldrich,  99.99%),  sodium  nitrate  (Sigma-Aldrich,  99.5%) 

and ammonium di-hydrogenophosphate (Prolabo, 99%) were sequentially dissolved in a mixture 

of  ethanol,  water  and  nitric  acid  at  70°C  under  vigorous  stirring  during  4  hours.  Then,  the 

solution was dried in ambient air at room temperature for about 2 days to form a xerogel, then 

dried in an oven at 100°C for an hour. The resulting white powder was heat treated at 900°C for 

2 hours and grinded before annealing at 1100°C for 2 hours. 

X-Ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD)  diagrams  were  collected  from  a  Bruker  D8  diffractometer  

using the Cu-Ka

 radiation, mounted in θ–θ configuration. High quality diffraction patterns were 

recorded  overnight  between  2θ  =  10°  and  2θ  =  100°  by  steps  of  4.5  sec./0.01°.  Differential 

scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  measurements  were  performed  using  a  Netzsch  DSC  204  F1 

apparatus  operating  at  heating/cooling  rates  of  10  K.min-1  between  20  and  300°C  under  argon 

For  ionic  conductivity  measurements,  dense  ceramic  pellets  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  and 

Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NZSP) were prepared as follows. In each case, ~250 mg of powder was placed 

in a 10 mm graphite die and cold-pressed at 50 MPa at 298 K. The so-formed pellets were then 

sintered in a FCT Spark Plasma Sintering apparatus at 93 K.min-1 up to 900°C for 10 minutes 

under an applied pressure of ~ 100 MPa and under vacuum. The temperature was monitored by a 

thermocouple in contact with the die. The resulting pellets were polished and then metalized on 

each face by Platinum sputtering using a Bal-Tec SCD 050. The obtained pellets were 10.1 mm 

in diameter, 0.3 mm and 0.5 mm in thickness for NZSP and NVP, with overall compactnesses of 

72%  and  93%,  respectively.    Conductivity  measurements  were  performed  between  20-300°C, 

both  upon  heating  and  cooling,  under  static  Argon,  using  the  device  illustrated  in  figure  1, 

consisting mainly in a silica tube embedded between two Swagelok® cells.  

The pellet sample sits in the middle of the cell and is connected electrically to both sides through 

two  extended  stainless  steel  pistons.  The  high  temperature  cell  is  placed  in  a  custom  tubular 

furnace for precise temperature regulation with a thermocouple placed right besides the pellet. 

The  conductivity  was  monitored  using  a  Biologic®  VMP3  analyzer  and  impedance  data 

acquisition was made over the frequency range 100 mHz to 200 kHz at intervals of 10 points per 

decade with an applied voltage of 20 mV. 

For the fabrication of monolithic all-solid-state NVP // NZSP // NVP batteries, each positive and 

negative electrode contained 25% of NVP, 60 % of NZSP and 15 % of Carbon Super P, i.e. a 

rather  low  active  material  content.  Given  that  Na3V2(PO4)3  can  be  either  reduced  towards 

Na4V2(PO4)3  (1  Na+  exchanged  in  the  negative)  or  oxidized  towards  NaV2(PO4)3  (2  Na+ 

exchanged in the positive), positive and negative electrodes were fabricated using 40 and 80 mg 

of the above-mentioned NVP/NZSP/CSP mixtures, respectively. In between the electrodes, the 

total mass of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte used was of only 30 mg. The all solid state battery 

was first assembled, layer by layer, in a 10 mm diameter graphite die using an uniaxial press at 

50 MPa under ambient temperature. The monolithic battery was then sintered at 900°C using the 

SPS machine, as described in the previous section and then polished and metalized on both sides 

with  Pt.  The  electrochemical  tests  were  carried  out  on  a  Biologic®  VMP3,  using  the  high 

temperature cell described in figure 1. Galvanostatic cycling with potential limitations (GCPL) 

were performed between 0 V and 2.2 V. 

Generally  speaking  NASICON  compositions,  and  especially  Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12,  crystallize 

under rhombohedral symmetry except below a certain temperature and for specific composition 

ranges (1.8 < x < 2.2 in NZSP) were the lattice may be distorted to lower symmetry (monoclinic) 

as  a  result  of  Na+  ion  ordering  on  both  M(1)  and  M(2)  crystallographic  sites.  Above  the 

transition  temperature  from  the  monoclinic  ordered  state  to  the  rhombohedral  disordered  state 

(generally  between  90°C  and  200°C),  these  materials  become  “SuperIonic  CONductors”, 

characterized by a lowered activation energy for ionic conduction [26, 27].  

The full pattern matching refinements of the XRD data of NZSP and NVP samples are gathered 

in  figure  2.  The  NZSP  white  powder  is  composed  of  ~ 50  m m-sizes  particles  (as  revealed  by 

SEM)  and  was  successfully  indexed  using  the  C2/c  space  group  with  unit-cell  parameters  a  = 

15.616(6)  Å,  b  =  9.030(3)  Å,  c  =  9.211(3)  Å  and  β  =  123.83(1)  °,    in  good  agreement  with 

literature  [11,  26].  Besides  the  Na3Zr2Si2PO12  phase,  tiny  amounts  of  zirconia  and  of  an 

unidentified  phase  (sodium  silicates  and/or  sodium  phosphates)  were  detected.  The  obtained 

NVP dark green powder is considered as phase-pure of ~ 10 m m-sizes particles and can be, as a 

first  approximation,  indexed  in  a  C2/c  monoclinic  cell  similar  to  that  of  NZSP,  with  

a = 15.112(1) Å, b = 8.727(1) Å, c = 8.824(1) Å and β = 124.54(1) °. As of yet, we were not able 

to fully solve this complex superstructure, which disappears when the temperature is raised and 

finally  yields  to  a  rhombohedral  Na+-disordered  phase  above  200°C,  [25,  28]  as  for 

Na3Fe2(PO4)3 [29]. Our interpretation of the diffraction data of Na3V2(PO4)3 differs significantly 

with recently published literature [22, 23, 30-32].  

The  thermal  behaviors  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP)  and  Na3Zr2Si2PO12  (NZSP)  were  investigated 

through DSC experiments under Ar, reported in figure 3a.  

•  For NZSP, one can hardly detect a reversible tiny  thermal phenomenon at ~155°C that 

corresponds  to  the  well  documented  transition  to  the  superionic  state  in  NASICON 

compositions  [13,  26,  27,  33,  34].  As  reported  by  Boilot  et  al.  [33],  the  material’s 

preparation  method  and  the  sintering  temperature  in  particular,  impact  greatly  on 

temperature-dependent  effects  of  such  thermally  activated  transition.  Our  material, 

prepared via a sol gel route and a short sintering at 1100°C for two hours may not have 

reached the high degree  of crystallinity (and of purity) necessary for  observing a sharp 

phase order-disorder phase transition, as discussed in [33].  

•  For  NVP,  we  observed  two  reversible  thermal  phenomena  at  ~109°C  and  ~175°C 

corresponding to order-disorder transitions within the sodium sub-network, over the M(1) 

and M(2) crystallographic sites, as previously described and discussed for Na3Fe2(PO4)3, 

Na3Ti2(PO4)3  and  Na3Cr2(PO4)3  [35-37].  Some  of  us  confirmed,  from  temperature-

controlled  neutron  and  synchrotron  powder  diffraction,  these  order-disorder  transitions 

The variations of log10 s

 versus 1000/T for NZSP and NVP are reported in figure 3b, for both 

heating and cooling sequences. For NZSP, one can distinguish two linear domains with different 

activation  energies,  below  and  above  (140  ±  15)°C,  in  agreement  with  the  DSC  data  and 

published  literature  [26,  27,  33].  The  low  temperature  and  high  temperature  regions  are 

characterized by activation energies of 0.21 and 0.11 eV, respectively, i.e. smaller than most of 

the reported data. Our data, obtained from a pellet with 72% of compacity, fit well with those 

obtained by a similar sintering route (SPS, 900°C) [38] and are representative of the Na+ ionic 

conductivity that will be reached within the solid state battery itself. For Na3V2(PO4)3, the data 

follows some sort of diffuse transition profile that can be approximated by three linear domains 

with 0.31, 0.55 and 0.21 eV of activation energies within temperature ranges in coherence with 

the thermal phenomena  detected via DSC. The significant decrease of the activation  energy  at 

high  temperature  vs.  low  temperature  is  characteristic  of  order-disorder  transitions  towards  a 

superionic conducting phase into which Na+ ions are disordered [11, 12].  

Na3Zr2Psi2O12  and  Na3V2(PO4)3  were  then  assembled  as  the  electrolyte  (NZSP)  and  the 

electrodes  (NVP)  of  an  all  solid  state  symmetrical  battery  as  they  present  decent  ionic 

conductivity properties, of 1.5 x10-3 and 1.9 x10-4 S.cm-1 at 200°C, respectively. The realization 

of  such  battery  necessitated  several  important  steps  of  optimizations  and  compromises,  as 

described by Aboulaich et al. [3] and Delaizir et al. [4].  

As  described  in  the  experimental  section,  the  NZSP  electrolyte  was  sandwiched  between  the 

positive and negative electrodes, each of them being constituted of 25% NVP, 60% NZSP and 

15% Carbon. In order to prevent possible decomposition of the Na3V2(PO4)3 active material, the 

SPS sintering temperature of the whole battery was set to a maximum temperature of 900°C for 

10  min.,  after  which  a  dense  self-supported  three-layer  pellet  with  satisfactory  mechanical 

properties  was  obtained  (fig.  1).  Figure  4  illustrates  the  respective  thicknesses  of  the  battery 

components and shows excellent distribution of NVP and NZSP particles within each electrode 

as well as remarkable interfaces even for a thickness of solid electrolyte layer of 130 µm.   

Figure 5 gathers the galvanostatic cycling at 200°C of the all solid state battery, for current rates 

of C/10 and C/2, between 0 and 2.2 V. The potential limitations were selected so that optimal 

capacity of  Na3V2(PO4)3 could be attained at both negative and positive electrodes, given that it 

can  be  either  reduced  (Na3V2(PO4)3   1)  Na4V2(PO4)3  at  1.6  V  vs.  Na+/Na)  or  oxidized 

(Na3V2(PO4)3  1) NaV2(PO4)3 at 3.4 V vs. Na), hence providing a theoretical voltage of 1.8 V for 

the symmetrical charged cell. 

During  the  first  charge  up  to  2.2  V  at  C/40,  an  unexpected  (and  still  not  understood)  extra 

capacity (+25%) was observed and disappeared  upon further cycling, as  witnessed by the nice 

reversibility  of  the  reaction  attained  at  C/10  during  the  3rd  cycle.  Subsequent  cycling  is 

satisfactory (for this kind of all solid state technology) and rates as high as C/2 could be attained 

with decreased capacities, though, within the same potential windows. The shape of the V = f(x) 

data at slow rate, displayed as a non polarized plateau with almost theoretical capacity reached 

(95%  at  C/40)  suggests  that  the  electrochemical  reactions  at  both  negative  and  positive  

electrodes are biphasic, even though they were performed at 200°C. At increased charging and 

discharging  rates,  smaller  capacities  and  higher  polarization  result  most  likely  from  kinetic 

limitations  (both  ionic  and  electronic)  within  the  NVP  active  material  (non  carbon-coated  and 

with large grains) and possibly within the NZSP solid electrolyte as well that constitutes 60 wt% 

of each electrode. When the battery was cycled back at C/10 after 20 cycles at C/2, the capacity 

was almost recovered with, however, significant increase of the polarization. As revealed by the 

SEM picture of figure 4b, this probably originates from cracks within the particles (and hence 

loss  of  ionic  and/or  electronic  contact)  due  to  significant  unit-cell  volume  changes  of 

Na3V2(PO4)3 when Na+ is inserted (+4%) or extracted (-8%).  

The  characteristics  and  performances  of  the  sodium  solid  state  battery  described  here  are 

reported in table 2 and compared to other related works in this field of research. Compared to the 

previous  work  of  Noguchi  et  al.  [23]  on  the  same  NVP  /  NZSP  /  NVP  system,  the  operating 

temperature of 200°C and the monolithic conception via the SPS technique allowed us to reach 

85% of the theoretical capacity of the material at C/10, i.e. 97 m A/cm2 (vs. 58% at a current rate 

of 1.2 m A/cm2 in [23]). Ohtomo et al. [7] report on performances higher to than ours when using 

sulfur  based  glass  electrolytes  at  room  temperature:  the  capacity  per  gram  of  battery  of  11.8 

mA.h  is  surely  larger  than  ours  (5.1  mA.h)  for  an  average  potential  of  3.8  V  of  their  system 

compared  to  1.7  V  in  our  case.  It  should  be  noted  too  that  the  variations  in  total  gravimetric 

capacity  (of  the  pellet)  are  highly  dependent  on  the  percentage  of  active  material  vs.  solid 

electrolyte as well as on the molecular weight of the solid electrolyte itself. We obtained quite 

similar capacity retention properties as well, still to be improved with powder morphologies and 

ratios engineering.  

We reported here on the electrochemical performances of an all-solid state monolithic symmetric 

NASICON-based sodium ion battery, assembled by the SPS technique, operating at 200°C. For 

this  purpose,  a  specific  high  temperature  electrochemical  cell  has  been  constructed  and  shows 

remarkable stability on operation, up to 250°C. This technique and the development of suitable 

solid  electrolytes  stable  at  high  voltage  vs.  Li  (or  Na)  should  allow  studying  new  reaction 

mechanisms within Lior Na-based rechargeable batteries.  To this end, and in order to improve 

the  overall  reactions  within  the  electrodes  as  well  as  the  overall  gravimetric  capacity  reached, 

further developments need to be addressed and our efforts will focus on:     

  Preparing  smaller  and  homogeneous  (in  size  distribution)  particles  of  both  solid 

electrolyte and  electroactive materials 

  Optimizing the Solid Electrolyte vs. Electrode materials vs. Carbon ratio so as to ensure 

optimal percolation for high loadings of active materials. Recent successful operation of 

monolithic batteries with 40 wt% of active material within each electrode paves the way 

for future significant improvements of global energy density of such batteries.  

  Further  reducing  the  electrolyte  layer’s  thickness  so  as  to  decrease  the  overall  battery 

resistance. It should be noticed, though, that the more the thickness is reduced, the harder 

it is to avoid short-circuits 

  Developing  alternative  synthesis  routes  so  as  to  obtain  phase  pure  and/or  composite 

structures containing both electrode and electrolyte compositions.
