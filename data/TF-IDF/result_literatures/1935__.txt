Li and K-exchanged NASICON membranes have been prepared by an electromigration process from the Na3Zr2Si2PO12 compound. The exchanged rates are 30 and 43% against the initial Na molar content for K and Li ions, respectively. K-exchanged NASICON pellets present important cracks due to the high increase of the â€˜c â€™ crystallographic parameter. A proton insertion has been observed in the case of the Li exchange. Nevertheless Li exchanged NASICON membranes are sensitive both to Na and Li and present interesting selectivity properties.
NASICON-type ceramics present interesting sensitive and selective properties against alkaline cations due to their structure. The original NASICON (acronym of natrium superionic conductor) compound formula is Na1x Zr2Six P3x O12 with 05/x 5/3. In the ionocovalent structure, Na ions move from one site to another passing through bottle-necks defined by the anionic skeleton [Zr2Six P3x O12](1-x ). The composition which presents the best ionic conductivity properties is for x/2 [1,2].
NASICON materials are especially good candidates to determine alkaline ions concentrations in solution [3,4] or to separate monovalent cations from a mixture of multivalent ions for examples. In view of membrane applications, the ionic exchange properties of the material should be investigated. Ionic exchange studies on NASICON-type dense ceramic in aqueous solution are rather them have been performed on powder [6,7] or molten salts [8]. Then, the present paper describes Na/K and Na/Li exchange by electromigration on dense NASICON ceramic of composition Na3Zr2Si2PO12.
It is now well known that the sol/gel process is one of the more adapted to develop conductive ceramics [9]. Thus, the sol/gel process is particularly used to synthesized NASICON ceramic powders which are then pressed into pellets and sintered to prepare dense conductive ceramic membranes.
Non-exchanged Na3Zr2Si2PO12 NASICON powder is synthesized from zirconium and silicium alkoxides (Zr(OC3H7)4 purity 80% determined by gravimetry and Si(OC2H5)4 purity /99%), NaOH and NH4H2PO4 (analytical grade). The different steps of the process are summarised in Fig. 1 and described in the Ref. [3].
The high hydrolysis ratio h :/400 (h/[H2O]/ [A(OR)n ] where A(OR)n /alkoxides) allows us the formation of colloidal precipitates. The suspension formed is strongly stirred at 80 8C during 2 h. and the product is then dried by freeze drying to avoid powder agglomeration. A powder presenting a narrow granulometry is then obtained. Particles diameter is less than 1 mm.
Powders were pressed into pellets (diameter: 5 mm and thickness: 4 mm) using an isostatic pressure of 4000 bars during 10 min.
Then the sintering stage is optimised (heating rate, calcination and sintering temperature) by monitoring the dimensional parameters of the sample as a function of temperature. The right conditions to optimise ceramic fabrication are the following.
Such thermic conditions lead to the synthesis of pellets presenting a satisfying fraction of the theorical density (94%).
The ionic exchange properties were investigated on Na3Zr2Si2PO12 dense pellets by electromigration in a three compartments Plexiglas salt-splitting type cell. Anolyte and catholyte are separated by the NASICON membrane. The initial composition of the catholyte in all experiments was 0.033 M in H2SO4. The initial composition of the anolyte was 0.1 M in MCl where M is the exchanged cation (Li or K). The initial catholyte and anolyte ionic forces chosen limit the osmosis phenomena. The anolyte is constituted of two compartments separated by an anionic exchanging membrane to avoid the proton migration and the chlorine diffusion to the NASICON pellet. The circulation of the solutions inside the cell was assured using a peristaltic pump. A flow rate of approximately 0.15 l/h was chosen. The volume of the anodic and the cathodic compartments are 50 ml, the anolyte and catholyte solutions are 100 ml according to the capacity of the tank allowing us the solution circulation. 
The electrodes were titanium pieces of 25 cm2 area; the NASICON membrane surface in contact with the solutions is 2.15 cm2. The electrolysis cell operated in galvanostatic mode under a current of 10 mA (i.e. 4.6 mA/cm2).
Structural characterisation of the NASICON material were conducted by X-ray powder diffraction before and after exchange process.
Potentiometric measurements using the nonexchanged and the Li-exchanged NASICON membranes in contact with NaCl and/or LiCl solutions were investigated to determine the sensibility and the selectivity of both types of membranes according to the Nickolskii equation. The detail of experiments can be found in Refs. [3,4,6].
Following the electromigration stage, rinsing operations have been carried out in water. The amount of rejected potassium is around 1Â˜ of the inserted value, which allows us to confirm the insertion of K in the NASICON structure.
The non-exchanged compound Na3Zr2Si2PO12 have been indexed in a monoclinic cell with a space group C 2/c . The lattice parameters have been determined in a pseudo-hexagonal cell. The NASICON-type crystallographic structure is conserved after K exchange. The structure has now to be indexed in a hexagonal cell with the spacegroup R -3C . Lattice parameters are grouped Table 2. The K insertion leads to a slight decrease of the â€˜a â€™ parameter and an increase of the â€˜c â€™ parameter. Such evolutions agree with results obtained by ionic exchange on NASICON powder [6]. The important increase of the â€˜c â€™ parameter could explain the presence of cracks and the break of the sample.
Phases identification allows us to show the presence of a second phase which has been identified as a hydronium/NASICON phase. The primary Li-exchanged NASICON phase remains a monoclinic symmetry. The presence of the hydronium/NASICON cristalline phase could be explained by the evolution of the anolyte acidity. The latter has been measured at pH 4 after 24 h experiment. This phenomenon is due to the unavoidable proton diffusion through the anionic membrane used in the anolyte. In consequence, considering the high affinity of NASICON for proton [5,7], both H and Li have been inserted during the process. For Li exchange, the total substitution rate is around 150% (from Table 1). It could be explained by the fact that some of the conductive sites, empty in the NASICON stoichiometry Na3Zr2Si2PO12 [10] could be occupied by Li and/or Na in the case of the exchanged compound. 
The electromigration process has given a 43% molar of Na exchanged by Li, which could agree with the value of 51% molar deduced from the chemical analysis (Table 1). At this stage of the experiments, its seems to be difficult to give more explanation without the knowledge of the nature of the different cations occupying the different conductive sites.
The preparation of exchanged NASICON membranes by electromigration leads to partial Na substitution in the ionocovalent NASICON structure. The exchange rates are 30 and 43% against the initial Na molar content for respectively K and Li ions. Unfortunately due to the important anisotropic deformation of the structure in the case of the K exchange, a break of the dense is always observed. For Li ceramic pellets substitution, results have shown the possibility of the preparation of Li-exchanged membranes containing both Li and Na cations. Nevertheless, in this case, the presence of a second hydronium/NASICON phase has been observed. Despite this phase, Li-exchanged NASICON membranes present interesting detection and selectivity properties, which open another way of preparation of NASICON-type ionic conductor.
