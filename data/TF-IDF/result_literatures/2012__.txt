“Solid electrolytes” are functional materials that conduct electric charge accompanied by mass and are therefore ionic conductors. This feature is definitely different from electronic conduction in materials such as metals and semiconductors, where charge alone is transported. Solid electrolytes belong to the field of ionics in the solid state, and “solid state ionics” is regarded as an interdisciplinary science.

As early as the end of the 19th century, the relationship between the current passing through solids and the resulting chemical changes were found to obey Faraday’s law.1 One of the well-known solid

electrolytes, stabilized zirconia using one of the rare earths as an additive, was first developed in 1897 as a light source by a resistive heating and was called a “Nernst glower”. A more complete understanding of electrical conduction in such ionic solids was successfully realized in the thesis of Wagner in 1943.2 During the period between 1897 and 1943, several important discoveries concerning ionic conducting behavior in solids were reported, mainly in halide compounds. In particular, very high ion conducting characteristics were obtained for silver iodide (AgI) found by Tubandt.3 Silver iodide undergoes a structural phase transformation at 149 °C from the lowtemperature  231) phase to the high temperature R phase. Coincident with this transition, the Ag+ ion conductivity jumps more than 5 orders of magnitude to reach a value almost equivalent to the liquid AgI phase. In the course of trying to stabilize the high Ag+ ion conductive R-AgI phase down to room temperature, compounds with Ag+ and Iions such as RbAg4I5 were synthesized in 1965.4 However, RbAg4I5 is very unstable and has not yet found commercial application. At about the same time a lanthanum compound, LaF3 which shows Fion conducting characteristics, was reported.5 Another very important discovery after 1943 was the two-dimensional high Na+ ion conducting  226)-alumina found by Kummer et al.,6 despite knowledge of the existence of  226)-alumina dating back to the 1930s. Since the mobile ion species has mass and occupies volume, it was recognized that these characteristics had to be taken into account to improve transport through a threedimensional tunnel structure. One of the optimum candidate structures, which is generally accepted to be suitable for ion migration, was artificially designed by Goodenough et al. in 1976 in order to realize a high ion conduction.7 This “tailored solid electrolyte”, with chemical formula Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12, has been named NASICON (Na+ super ionic conductor).

In the 1980s, solid electrolytes with H+ as the mobile ion, and therefore called proton conductors, attracted a lot of interest. Iwahara et al.8 developed a solid electrolyte compound for operation at high temperature based on the perovskite structure in which a lanthanoid element plays an important role in the conduction process. After that, various types of perovskite-based ion conductors were eagerly investigated not only for proton but also for oxide anion conductors.

With regard to the practical applications, yttriastabilized zirconia was applied as an oxygen sensor around 1976, and a fluorine ion sensor with a LaF3EuF2 single-crystal solid solution has been already

Furthermore, Li+ ion conductors and oxide ion conductors are greatly expected to be utilized for the all solid-state rechargeable batteries and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

The rare earths’ (including lanthanoids) contribution is divided in three categories: first as the main constituent of the solid electrolytes; second is to function as additives to improve the ion conducting characteristics; third is rare earths (including lanthanoids) cation migrating solid electrolytes, and these electrolytes are exactly rare-earth solid electrolytes playing the main role in solid state ionics field.9,10

In this review article the sections are divided according to the three categories and each subsection is divided according to the individual migrating ion species. In some cases, ion-electron mixed conductors are covered in the solid state ionics field. However, in this review we mainly focus on only pure ion conducting solid electrolytes. In addition, strictly speaking, lanthanides include only 14 elements from Ce to Lu. Here, we use the abbreviation Ln (lanthanoids) and R for La + lanthanides and rare earths of Sc, Y, La, and lanthanides.

II. Solid Electrolytes with Rare Earths as Framework Elements

A. Cationic Conductors 1. Lithium Ion Conductors

a. Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 (0: vacancies). A perovskite-type material, whose general formula is described as ABO3 (A, larger cation (12-coordinate); B, smaller cation (6-coordinate)) and containing two different sized cations, can stably hold the structure even with a large amount of oxygen-deficient structure. It is well-known that a huge number of materials with the perovskite structure exist on and in the earth. One of most remarkable properties of the perovskite compounds in the solid state ionics field is that various compositions can be realized by the substitution of A or B sites for aliovalent cations, and the lattice size can be widely adjusted by the replacement. Consequently, a large number of solid electrolytes with the perovskite-type structure has been synthesized and studied. In 1984, LixLn1/3Nb1-xTixO3 (Ln ) La, Nd) was reported to be a lithium ion conductor with the perovskite structure by Latie et al.11 Since then, several studies have reported Li+ ion conductivity in perovskite-type solid electrolytes. In recent years, an extraordinarily high Li+ ionic conductivity even at room temperature was observed for Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 (where 0 denotes a vacancy), which belongs to the series Li0.5Ln0.5TiO3 (Ln ) La, Pr, Nd, and Sm).12,13 The Li+ ion conductivity for Li0.5Ln0.5TiO3 (Ln ) La, Pr, Nd, Sm) is presented in Figure 1. The conductivity at room temperature for the La system is ca. 10-3 S 226)cm-1, and the value is 3 orders of magnitude higher than that for the Pr system. Figure 2 depicts the perovskite parameter (ap) dependencies of the conductivity and the activation energy of conduction, which is calculated from the Arrhenius plots in the relationship log( 243)T) versus

(Reprinted with permission from ref 12. Copyright 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.) 1/T. Here, ap represents a cube root of the primitive perovskite cell; for example, the orthorhombic perovskite structure has a relation such as a0  25) b0  25) x2ap, c0  25) 2ap. Figure 2 shows that Li+ ion conductivity increases and the activation energy decreases with increasing ap for Li0.5Ln0.5TiO3. Among the Li3xLn2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 group, the La series shows the highest conductivity because the largest lanthanum ion provides the largest lattice size and, as a result, the widest conducting pathway in the perovskite structure.

Ion conduction is known to occur through the conduction path composed of Li+ ions and the vacancies. The Li+ ions in Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 migrate through the bottleneck which is defined as the 3c site (the space group is Pm3m) surrounded by four oxide ions in the structure as shown in Figure 3. A high Li+ ion conductivity is of great interest because the

conducting paths of the ions may exist in the vicinity of the A-site of the perovskite structure since the Coulomb potential for the B-site ions may be quite deep and does not allow the migration of cations through the B-site. The A-site defect concentration and the lattice volume of Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 series can change with x, which means that the Li+ ion conductivity can also vary with x.

By using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the optimum lattice size for Li+ ion conduction was estimated. The suitable lattice size predicted is larger than the actual lattice size in La0.6Li0.2TiO3, and this indicates that the Li+ ion conductivity in La0.6Li0.2TiO3 is expected to become several times higher by expanding the framework of the structure.14

The study of lithium ion conductivity in perovskitetype oxides is still important in solid-state chemistry and solid-state ionics as suggested by the following experimental results: (1) Cation conductivity other than for a proton is not yet known in the perovskitetype oxides. (2) Higher lithium ion conductivity, which is comparable to that of Li+226)-alumina, is achieved in a system with higher crystal symmetry. (3) The importance of the vacancy/charge carrier ratio has been experimentally confirmed. (4) A site percolation model (see the ref 15) has been found to explain the characteristics of the lithium ion conducting path through A sites. (5) Activation energy is simply related to the size of lattice, i.e., the bottleneck formed by the four oxygen ions. (6) Covalency of the host lattice is indispensable for the migration of lithium ions. However, these solid electrolytes are easily reduced due to the inclusion of Ti atoms, and therefore, improvement of the chemical stability of these materials is required for any application.

Interest in the Li+ ion conducting behavior of the Li3xLn2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 series led to extensive examination of the Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 series.16-19 Figure 4 shows the Li concentration dependencies of the conductivity for Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-2xTiO3 at various temperatures. The highest conductivity was obtained for 3x ) 0.34 (Li0.34La0.5500.11TiO3) at all temperatures measured. The reason for obtaining the highest Li+ conductivity in this perovskite structure was explained by site percolation theory.


NMR considerations, essentially two-dimensional Li+ ion motion in the almost empty O planes is predominant. However, some motions through b vacancies are also expected in addition to the motion between O and b.11

c. LiLnSiO4. The lithium rare-earth silicates, with a general composition described as LiLnSiO4 (Ln ) La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy), were reported as another type of Li+ conducting solid electrolyte with high Li+ ion conductivity of (2-4)  2) 10-3 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C.22-24 The crystal structure of LiLnSiO4 was refined to be an apatite-type structure by Sato et al.22,23 The compounds with Ln ) La-Dy are hexagonal, while those with Ln ) Ho-Lu and Y are orthorhombic. These materials include the silicon-rich component in the grain boundaries. For applying the apatite chemical formula to the samples, the bulk composition can be expressed as LixLn10-xSi6O24O3-x (1e xe 3). From Rietveld analysis of LixLn10-xSi6O24O3-x, the compounds can be divided into two groups: one is the La, Nd series and Sm set of compounds which has a high occupation factor of Li and a low vacancy concentration with hexagonal symmetry. The other is Eu, Gd, and Dy systems having the opposite features with respect to occupation factor and vacancy concentration. The bulk conductivity was investigated, and the author reported that both high lithium occupation and vacancy are necessary for achieving relatively high Li+ conductivity. However, the total conductivity including grain boundary conductivity reported in another paper24 shows a different order of magnitude than the bulk conductivity. Therefore, the influence of grain boundary seems to be large for these compounds and should be investigated further. d. YPO4-Li3PO4. The Y0.8Li0.6PO4-Li3PO4 mixed phase has a conductivity of 3.7  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C, and from electrolysis and concentration cell methods, the Y0.8Li0.6PO4-Li3PO4 phase was confirmed to be predominantly a Li+ ion conducting solid electrolyte.25 A Na3PO4-doped YPO4 phase was also prepared, but they do not make a solid solution. This is ascribed to the large difference in ionic radius between Y (0.1040 nm; coordination number (CN) ) 626) and Na (0.1160 nm; CN ) 626).

2. Proton Conductors

a. Perovskite-Structured Strontium or Barium Cerates (SrCeO3, BaCeO3). Pure strontium cerate, SrCeO3, does not show any proton conduction at all. The electrical conductivity of the cerate is very low, indicating that the cerate is almost an insulating material. However, by replacing the tetravalent Ce for trivalent rare earths, such as Yb3+, Sc3+, or Y3+, the rare-earth-doped SrCeO3 becomes a p-type semiconductor if the atmosphere is free from hydrogen or water vapor. Cerium in cerates exists as a tetravalent state with an ionic radius of 0.1010 nm (CN ) 626), which is in the radius range of heavier rare earths. Consequently, the suitable candidates for the dopant are trivalent rare earths whose ionic radius is close to the size of Ce4+ such as Yb3+, Y3+, etc. Proton conduction appears when the cerates are heated at several hundred degrees centigrade in H2

Figure 4. Li+ ion concentration dependencies of the Li+ conductivity for Li3xLa2/3-x01/3-xTiO3. (Reprinted with permission from ref 19. Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.) However, these Li+ ion conductors with perovskite structure were mainly discussed from the bulk conductivity viewpoint despite the samples being in a polycrystalline state. Therefore, for a complete understanding of the total ion conduction behavior, detailed investigations of the ion conductivity at grain boundaries are required in addition to the bulk conductivity. b. LixLn1/3Nb1-xTixO3 (Ln ) La, Nd). The compound with the general formula Ln1/3NbO3 (Ln ) La, Ce, Pr, Nd) was isolated by Dyer and White in 1964,20 and the crystal structure of this series of niobates was determined by Iyer and Smith.21 The structure of these compounds related to the perovskite-type structure and Nb is octahedrally coordinated with oxygen, and each octahedron shares corners in three directions. Parallel to the ab plane, one site is completely empty (O) and one is statistically occupied with a 2/3 filling factor by Ln (b) as shown in Figure 5. A higher conductivity is obtained for the above-

mentioned lithium compounds in comparison with the case for NaxLn1/3Nb1-xTixO3 (Ln ) La, Nd). The highest Li+ ion conductivity was obtained for LixLa1/3Nb1-xTixO3 (x ) 0.1). However, the value (ca. 10-5 S 226)cm-1 at room temperature) was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for the above-mentioned Li0.5La0.5TiO3. These above-mentioned results clearly indicate that the steric parameters greatly affect the conductivity characteristics. From the structural and

crease in water vapor pressure, as shown by its trace in the pH2O plane, while the total conductivity decreases. The number of holes formed by Yb doping in SrCeO3 decreases in a humid atmosphere to produce proton and lowers the total conductivity but enhances the proton transference number, thus explaining the observed behavior. Cerates become proton conductors after hydrogen enters the cerate crystal lattice.28 The hydrogen solubility in SrCe(Yb)O3 solid electrolyte is directly revealed by the proton conducting characteristics of the cerate solid electrolyte. The hydrogen solubility of SrCe(Yb)O3 is compared with those of other oxides in Figure 9. SrCe-

ity vs 1/T relationship of representative protonic conductors in comparison with SrCeO3. Most proton conductors are not stable at temperatures higher than 400 °C, except for cerates and KTaO3. For applications at higher temperatures, the cerates are expected to be useful since the conductivity of KTaO3 is considerably lower. Among the rare-earth-substituted cerates, Yb shows the highest proton conductivity at Yb3+ concentration of 5 mol % due to the fact that the ionic radius of Yb3+ (0.1008 nm; CN ) 626) is the same as that of Ce4+ (0.1008 nm; CN ) 626).

(Yb)O3 was found to show a high hydrogen solubility, and this directly results in the high proton conducting behaviors in this compound.

First-principles MD simulations were conducted for Y-doped SrCeO3 and the microscopic mechanism of the proton migration extracted from the stable H+ positions, probable proton conduction paths, and the doped acceptor effects. Figure 10 shows the stable ionic configurations near the proton in Y-doped SrCeO3. Small white, black, large gray, and large white circles are the positions of the proton, O2-,

(Reprinted with permission from ref 29. Copyright 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.) doped acceptor (in this case, Y3+), and Ce4+, respectively. It becomes clear that the proton exists as an O-H bond state and the frequency of the stretching vibration in O-H bonds is dependent on the position of the proton in the crystal. Proton motion is expected to diffuse in one of the following ways: proton diffuses around the O2ion to which it is bound while retaining the O-H bond length of about 0.1 nm; the proton diffuses between neighboring O2ions by switching the O-H bond in one octahedron; the proton can diffuse between two O2ions which belong to different octahedra.29,30

The proton conducting pathway was investigated by QENS (quasi-elastic neutron scattering) experiments on Sr Ce0.95Yb0.05H0.02O2.985 and is summarized in Figure 11. Proton starts in the trapped state

b. Proton Conductors with New Types of Perovskite. In the course of exploring new types of proton conductors with the perovskite-type structure, the off-stoichiometric complex was found as a suitable candidate. The compounds are categorized as a new complex or a mixed type and expressed as A2B¢ B¢ ¢ O6 and A3B¢ B¢ ¢ O6, A, B¢ , and B¢ ¢ represent divalent (Sr2+ or Ba2+), trivalent, and pentavalent cations, respectively. The mean valency on the B site is 4+ when A2B¢ B¢ ¢ O6 compound is in a stoichiometric state. Oxygen vacancies can be produced simply by changing the stoichiometry with an increase in B¢ content and a decrease in B¢ ¢ content. An example is Sr2(Sc1+xNb1-x)O6-x (x ) 0.05 and 0.1).


The proton conductivity of the simple perovskite Sr2(Sc1+xNb1-x)O6-x (x ) 0.05 and 0.1) is in the M3+doped SrCeO3 and BaCeO3 region. Since the compound does not contain Ce, ionic conducting behavior is predominant even in a severe reducing atmosphere such as CO/CO2.32 In this case, a p-type conduction appears at an oxygen pressure higher than 104 Pa, showing one of the typical features of the perovskite structure dependence of conduction mechanism on oxygen partial pressures. ¢ 2O9, B¢ is in the divalent state while A and B¢ ¢ have the same valency of 2+ and 5+, respectively. In the off-stoichiometric Ba3(Ca1.18Nb1.82)O9-x, the conductivity exceeds that of Nd-doped BaCeO3 while maintaining a similar activation energy. Since the valence states of A, B¢ , and B¢ ¢ are neither trivalent nor tetravalent, which rare earths generally possess, A3B¢ B¢ ¢ 2O9 cannot be grouped as solid electrolytes with rare earths. These off-stoichiometric solid electrolytes are still stable after exposure to a reducing atmosphere of CO/CO2, while well-known proton conductors of the cerate series can be easily reduced by the valence change of Ce4+ to the lower valent state.

c. Brownmilleriteand Pyrochlore-Type Proton Conductors. The compounds of Ba2GdIn1-xGaxO5 (x ) 0, 0.2, 0.4) have a conductivity up to 5  2) 10-3 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C and show relatively low activation energies supporting the premise that solid electrolytes with brownmillerite structure are promising materials for achieving high ionic conductivity.33 From their measurements, authors speculate that the brownmillerite solid electrolyte is a protonic conductor. However, it is not definitely determined whether the conducting species is proton or oxide yet. Pyrochlore-type Ln2Zr2-xYxO7-a (L ) La, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Er) have also been demonstrated to be protonic conductors. In this case also, replacing the tetravalent Zr with trivalent rare earths produces oxide vacancies which are essential for the proton conduction in the solid.34 3. Divalent Cation Conductors

¢ -Alumina-Type Divalent Cation Conductors.  226)-Alumina with general composition Na1+xAl11O17+x/2 (0.2e xe 0.7) was discovered in 1967.6 Na+226)-Al2O3 has a layered structure with a conducting NaO plane sandwiched between Al11O16 layers. The Na+226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3, whose composition is generally expressed as Na1+xMxAl11-xO17 (M ) divalent cation), also has a similar structure with a Na2O plane and a MgAl2O4 layer. The difference between these two representative alumina structures is the atomic arrangement within the layers. Three crystallographically nonequivalent sites exist for Na+ cations in the conduction planes of Na+226)-Al2O3 (the nine-coordinated Beevers-Ross-type position (BR), the five-coordinated anti-Beevers-Ross-type position (aBR), and the eight-coordinated mid-oxygen site (mO)). At room temperature, Na+ ions occupy the BR sites, and Na+ ions are distributed statistically between the three sites at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, Na+226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3 has only two sites which are eight-coordinated mO and seven-coordinated BR sites.

Ionic Conducting Lanthanide Oxides

Due to the fast diffusion properties of the cations in the conduction planes, the sodium ions can be easily replaced by another mono-, di-, or trivalent cation by a simple ion exchange reaction method. Generally the ion exchange occurs much faster in  226)¢ ¢ alumina than  226)-alumina and in single crystals than in polycrystals. A divalent rare-earth-containing Eu2+226)¢ ¢ -alumina single crystal was also prepared. The ion exchange was carried out with EuCl2 in an evacuated quartz tube in order to preserve the oxidation state of Eu(II) (in the case of Eu3+, the atmosphere in the quartz tube was filled with Cl2). The exchange was greater than 99%, and the con¢ -alumina was 4.7  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1 ductivity of Eu2+226)¢ at 400 °C. The conductivity and activation energy of the Eu2+226)¢ ¢ -alumina are almost equal to other divalent  226)¢ ¢ -alumina. While the exchange was almost complete (also greater than 99%) in the case of Eu3+ exchange, meaningful conductivity data were not obtained. The conductivity value must be biased low, and we must treat the data with caution because of residual Na+ ion migration in the single crystal.35 ¢ -alumina in polycrystalline form was later prepared by the same ion exchange method.36 Figure 12 shows the temperature dependence of the electri-

Figure 12. Temperature dependence of electrical conductivity for the Eu2+-polycrystalline  226)¢ ¢ -alumina and singlecrystal  226)¢ ¢ -alumina. (Reprinted with permission from ref 36.

The ion exchange ratio reached 99.5%, and the conductivity is 5.0  2) 10-3 S 226)cm-1 at 400 °C, which is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the single crystal. However, the conductivity of exchanged  226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3 was independent of the exchange ratio, and the reason is not clear yet. In addition, despite the presence of Eu2+ ions in ¢ -alumina, the conducting species was not the  226)¢ identified neither in Eu2+226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3 single crystal nor in the polycrystalline form and the residual Na+ cation contribution must be still taken into account. In the case of  226)-alumina single crystals, a satisfactory exchange ratio was not obtained because the ion diffusion rate is very low.37 For polycrystals with  226)-alumina structure, the ion exchange is even more difficult to proceed and the ion conducting characterization cannot be done satisfactorily at all. Some of the expected applications of these  226)and  226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3 phases are for novel phosphors and laser hosts.

ductivity is 3 orders of magnitude higher compared with that of pure divalent Ca2+ ion conducting CaS.

B. Anionic Conductors 1. Chloride Ion Conductors

Most chlorides are soluble in water, and they cannot be applied as practical solid electrolytes. For the purpose of developing Clanion conductors which are suitable for practical applications, only materials which contain Clanion and are water insoluble are possible candidates, and here, rare-earth oxychlorides were selected. Among rare-earth oxychlorides, lanthanum oxychloride shows the highest stability at elevated temperatures. However, the conductivity of LaOCl is very low. A route to enhance the conductivity is to dope a lower valent cation, compared with trivalent La3+, at the La site to create Clvacancies. For that purpose, Ca2+ was doped in the trivalent La site of LaOCl and ion conducting behavior was characterized.38 By the doping of 1.6 mol % Ca in the La site, the conductivities enhanced by 1 order of magnitude in comparison to that of pure LaOCl. For the compensation of charge neutrality, anion vacancies of Clor O2should be created. To clarify which vacant species is formed, polarization measurements were carried out in O2, N2, and 1 vol % Cl2 in nitrogen atmosphere. A clear polarizing behavior was similarly observed in both O2 and N2, while no such a polarization was recognized in 1 vol % Cl2 in nitrogen. This result clearly indicates the fact that by polarization measurement with applying dc current, Clanion was continuously supplied at the cathode and conducts inside the oxychloride bulk through the Clvacancies and moves to the anode and is released as

2412 Chemical Reviews, 2002, Vol. 102, No. 6

Cl2 gas. This proves that the conducting anion is Cl-. The Clanion transference number is estimated to be higher than 0.9.

2. Oxide Ion Conductors

a. Cerium Oxides. Cerium oxide, ceria, has a fluorite structure and exhibits oxide anion conducting behavior. The conductivity of pure cerium oxide is low due to a lack of oxide anion vacancies. Therefore, the substitution of tetravalent Ce by a lower valent cation is a method of enhancing the oxide ionic conductivity. One of the appropriate dopant candidates is a rare-earth cation which has a stable trivalent state.

Figure 14. Dopant ionic radius dependencies of the oxide ionic conductivity of doped ceria at 800 °C. (Reprinted with permission from ref 39. Copyright 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.)

Figure 14 depicts the dopant ionic radius dependencies of the oxide ionic conductivity of doped ceria at 800 °C.39 In the series of rare-earth-doped CeO2, the highest conductivity was obtained for the solid solution with Sm3+ doping. The conductivity of Ce1-xGdxO2-x/2 at 700 °C, which shows the second highest ion conductivity, is almost equivalent to that of stabilized zirconia at 1000 °C.40 Among the alkalineearth series, the doping of Ca2+ is most effective in enhancing the conductivity because its ionic radius is close to that of Sm3+.

Figure 15 presents the domain which behaves predominantly as a pure oxide anion conductor with fluorite structure.39 As can be seen from the figure, thoria(YDT) and zirconia-based oxides (CSZ) are still in the range of pure solid electrolyte domain even at low oxygen pressures. In contrast, doped Bi2O3 and CeO2 have a small electrolyte domain at the same low oxygen pressures. One of the crucial disadvantages of cerium oxide from a practical application point of view is that electronic conduction appears at relatively low oxygen pressures and the oxide ionic transference number decreases to 0.5 in the atmosphere where pO2 is equal to ca. 10-8 Pa (1000 °C). In the rare-earth oxide-doped ceria, Sm2O3-doped ceria is the most stable against reduction.

The hydrothermal syntheses of Ce1-xSmxO2-x/2 and Ce1-xCaxO2-x solid solutions were successfully carried out temperatures as low as 260 °C in less than 2 h and the properties were systematically investigated.41 The particles obtained were ultrafine crystallites with dimensions of 40-68 nm. Since the particle

size is small enough, the sintering of the solid solutions can be carried out even at 1400 °C, which is about 200 °C lower than the typical temperature of the solid-state reaction method. Furthermore, (Ce0.83Sm0.17)1-xLnxO2-y(Ln ) Pr, Tb) was also prepared by the same hydrothermal synthesis method at 260 °C.42 From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, the average crystallite size was in the range between 10 and 60 nm. The doping of Pr or Tb was attempted to investigate the electrolytic domain boundary (EDB) of Sm-doped ceria and clarified that neither Pr nor Tb doping shows a significant effect on the EDB of Sm-doped ceria. However, this result is not consistent with their preliminary results,43 and thus, the effects of Pror Tb-doping do not appear to be well understood yet. b. Perovskite-Type Structures. While LaYO3 (Tmp ) 1800 °C) and LaAlO3 (Tmp ) 2110 °C), both show a p-type conduction at high oxygen pressures, they have been reported to be oxide ionic conductors.44,45 These perovskite-type solid electrolytes are stable at low oxygen pressure and are useful for measurement of the Gibbs energy change of the overall cell reaction using a metal and metal oxide mixture.44 However, the conductivity is still low. Recently it was clarified that by doping Ca in the La site, the conductivity is enhanced by more than 2 orders of magnitude, and at a high oxygen pressure region such as air, p-type conduction appears and the perovskite compound shows a mixed conductor of oxide anion and hole species. The Caand Ga-codoping into NdAlO3 enhances the oxide ion conductivity comparable to the electrical conductivity of stabilized zirconia.46 As clearly indicated as a common feature of the perovskite-type in this review, the Caand Ga-co-doped NdAlO3 system also becomes a p-type semiconductor at oxygen pressures higher than 104 Pa. This boundary (pO2 )104 Pa) is identical for the perovskite-type ion conductor series with migrating ion species both for proton and oxide ions. The word “free” volume is defined as the difference between the perovskite unit cell volume and the volume occupied by the constituent ions in the lattice.

This free volume has been found to be applicable for both perovskite and fluorite phase solid solutions. Figure 16 shows the correlations between activation energy for ionic migration (¢E) for O2transport and the free volume for a perovskite-type solid. As can be seen in Figure 16, the relation can be extended for zirconates, cerates, and thorates. Since both O2and OHions (proton conduction appears through OH-) transport through the perovskite lattice, a linear trend is observed. Linear although opposite relations were observed in Figure 16; free volume would be an appropriate screening parameter. From a free volume point of view, the optimum value is 0.03-0.035 nm3 for perovskites.47

In a similar manner, BaCe0.9Bi0.1O3-x and BaTh0.95La0.1O3-x have been studied, and both oxides were found to show an oxide ion conducting behavior. However, these compounds are unstable and reproducible data could not be obtained.45

During the course of attempting to enhance the oxide anion conductivity with the perovskite-type structure, attention was focused on LaGaO3 and it was found that the doping of Sr on the La site and Mg on the Ga site greatly enhances the oxide ionic conductivity of LaGaO3. Figure 17 depicts the comparison of oxide ionic conductivity with some wellknown oxide ionic conductors.48 The oxide ionic conductivity of La-Sr-Ga-Mg-O exceeds the value of Sc-doped ZrO2 (SSZ) and is between the value of ZrO2-Sc2O3 and Bi2O3-Y2O3. The LaGaO3-based solid electrolyte maintains pure oxide ionic conducting characteristics over a wide range of oxygen pressures, ranging from 105 to 10-16 Pa, and over a wide temperature range from 500 to 1000 °C.49 In the case of CeO2and Bi2O3-based oxides, n-type semiconduction becomes predominant under a low oxygen pressure region, and especially for the Bi2O3based oxides, thermal stability is not satisfactory at all. In contrast, LaGaO3 co-doped with Sr and Mg possesses such high thermal durability, as mentioned

above, and is expected to be a promising new oxide ionic conductor. One of main targets is to apply this as a component of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).50 Another perovskite oxide, barium terbium oxide (BaTbO3) doped with 10 mol % indium at the Tb site, shows an ionic transference number of 0.87 at 600 °C. This perovskite solid electrolyte was reported to have some potential application at intermediate temperatures such as the operation temperatures of SOFCs.51

c. Lanthanum Molybdates. The La2Mo2O9 solid shows a phase transition at approximately 580 °C which is accompanied by an enhancement of the oxide ion conductivity of about 2 orders of magnitude. Above this temperature, the molybdate becomes a good oxide anion conductor and reaches a conductivity of 6  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1 at 800 °C as shown in Figure 18. La2Mo2O9 can be also described as La2Mo2O8+10,

Figure 18. Temperature dependencies of oxide anion conducting La2Mo2O9. Lines A and B represent the conductivities of 0.87(ZrO2)-0.13(CaO) and 0.9(ZrO2)-0.1(Y2O3), respectively. (Reprinted with permission from Nature (http://www.nature.com), ref 52. Copyright 2000 Macmillan Publishers.)

and through the vacancies (0), oxide anions can migrate. The electronic conductivity is estimated to be less than 1%, and also the molybdate is reported to show a high stability even in an atmosphere of 5 Pa of air (1 Pa O2) at 650 °C.52

2414 Chemical Reviews, 2002, Vol. 102, No. 6

The crystal structure of the fast oxide ion conducting La2Mo2O9 phase has been already clarified by ab initio using X-ray and neutron powder diffraction patterns.53 The details are given by Goutenoire et al. However, as can be easily speculated, the compounds with Mo as a constituent element are easily reduced, especially in contact with metals, which leaves some critical problems still to be overcome.

d. Lanthanoid Oxyfluorides. By the reaction between oxide and fluoride of single rare-earth series, single rare-earth metal oxyfluorides were prepared as in the chemical reaction described below.

When the reaction is carried out with Ln oxide and Ln¢ fluoride, where Ln and Ln¢ indicate different rareearth species, the binary rare-earth oxyfluorides of Ln2Ln¢ O3F3 and Ln2Ln¢ 2O3F6 were prepared as shown in eqs 3 and 4.

Ln2Ln¢ 2O3F6, in which Ln and Ln¢ are different rare earths, are the oxide anion conducting solid electrolytes showing a much higher ion conductivity compared with that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as presented in Figure 19.

ization method, the electron transference number is estimated to be smaller than 0.05. The preparation process of the oxyfluorides should be carried out in a dry atmosphere. For example, Nd2Eu2O3F6 is synthesized from 1:2 Nd2O3:EuF3. Nd2Gd2O3F6 was also prepared. Nd2Gd2O3F6 was stable up to approximately 650 °C, a temperature 50 °C below the stability temperature of Nd2Eu2O3F6. By comparing the oxide ion conductivity, Nd2Gd2O3F6 shows lower conductivity than Nd2Eu2O3F6.55

Once prepared, the oxyfluoride compounds are chemically stable up to ca. 600 °C even in a humid atmosphere. However, pyrohydrolysis starts at around 700 °C, and rare-earth oxyfluorides are easily hydrolyzed at temperatures higher than 800 °C.56

The oxyfluoride series has demonstrated a unique character of unusually high O2ion conductivity which exceeds stabilized zirconias, and Nd2Eu2O3F6 is reported to be a suitable oxide anion conducting solid electrolyte candidate for oxygen sensors and a fuel cell component applicable at a relatively moderate temperature of 450 °C. Despite these positive contributes, the compounds are still not promising due to their low stability at elevated temperatures where they function as solid electrolytes. Consequently, the temperature field of application is very limited.

Figure 19. Temperature dependencies of oxide anion conducting Ln2Ln¢ 2O3F6 in which Ln and Ln¢ are different rare earths (0, Nd2Eu2O3F6; O, Nd2Sm2O3F6; 9, La2Eu2O3F6; 4, Nd2Y2O3F6; ), Nd2Gd2O3F6; b, Nd2Ce2O3F6) with those of representative oxide anion conductors.

The conductivities of Nd2R¢ 2O3F6 (R¢ ) Y, Sm, Eu, and Gd) are higher than those of YSZ. Among the R2R¢ 2O3F6 series, Nd2Eu2O3F6 shows the highest oxide anion conductivity. In particular, the conductivity of Nd2Eu2O3F6 at 650 °C reaches 5.0  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1, and this value is close to the conductivity of (ZrO2)0.89(Y2O3)0.11 (YSZ-11) at 900 °C. Nd2Eu2O3F6 is an oxide anion conducting solid electrolyte, and the oxide anion transference number is higher than 0.9 at 500-700 °C (fluoride ion conduction was denied by the electrolysis measurement54). From a dc polar-

Figure 20. Relationship between the conductivity at 650 °C and various R for R2Y2O3F6 and Nd2R¢ 2O3F6. (Reprinted with permission from ref 58. Copyright 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.)

Figure 20 presents the relationship between conductivity and various R and R¢ for the R2Y2O3F6 and Nd2R¢ 2O3F6 systems. Most of the neodymium oxyfluorides show conductivities as high as 10-2 S 226)cm-1 (log  243) ) -2).

In the case of Nd2R¢ 2O3F6, conductivity higher than 10-2 S 226)cm-1 was obtained for R ) Y, Sm-Er. The conductivity reduces gradually with the increase in atomic number from Eu to Lu. An ionic transference number of higher than 0.75 was observed, except for two compounds containing Ce or Tb. From the oxygen pump method, the charge carrier was identified to be mainly oxide anion. Therefore, the fluoride anion transference number is estimated to be less than 0.01. The conductivity of Nd2Y2O3F6 is 8.0  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1 at 750 °C, and this value is comparable to that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ-11) at 1100 °C. The transference number of higher than 0.75 is still

Ionic Conducting Lanthanide Oxides

Chemical Reviews, 2002, Vol. 102, No. 6 2415

insufficient for practical application. In reality, a transference number higher than 0.99 is required. In the case of the simple oxyfluoride Nd2Nd2O3F6, the conductivity decreases appreciably, which may be due to the impossibility of the formation of a special arrangement of anions in the crystal to produce an easy pathway for oxide anions. However, the stability of solid electrolytes based on oxyfluorides is questionable, especially for applications such as rechargeable batteries and fuel cell components.57

The high-temperature cubic ZrO2 phase can be stabilized by using rare-earth fluorides as additives at temperatures around 1100 °C. This rare-earth fluoride-stabilized zirconia (LnFSZ) also shows oxide anion conducting characteristics. While the oxide anion transference number is greater than 0.9 even at 450 °C, the conductivity is smaller than that of YSZ.54,58

e. Lanthanum Oxides. Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) doped with SrO or CaO with a hexagonal structure shows an oxide anion conducting behavior. The aliovalent cation doping creates oxygen vacancies, and they act as charge carriers at elevated temperatures. The bulk oxide anion conductivity of La2O3 doped with SrO or CaO is similar to that of similarly doped ZrO2. In addition, the solid solutions are predominantly ionic conductors in a wide oxygen pressure region (from 10-3 to 10-20 Pa).59

f. Brownmilleriteand Pyrochlore-Type Structures. Among the perovskite-related A2B2O5 lattice in which oxygen vacancies appear (1/6 of the oxygen atoms are removed in the unit cell) and which corresponds to the brownmillerite structure, Sr2Gd2O5 and Sr2Dy2O5 have conductivities of 2  2) 10-2 and 3.65  2) 10-2 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C, respectively. A high population of anion vacancies is presented in the lattice and explains the high oxide ion conductivity.60 A new single-phase compound of Ba3In2CeO8 has been prepared by including Ce in Ba2In2O5, which crystallizes in the Brownmillerite structure at room temperature. Since Ce4+ is randomly distributed while introducing oxygen vacancies, this results in a significant increase in conductivity in the temperature region from 100 to 450 °C, which is remarkably higher than that obtained for Gd-doped CeO2 and Y-doped ZrO2. The ionic transference number of Ba3In2CeO8 reaches 0.94 at 500 °C.61

The system of Y2O3-TiO2 was investigated and reported to structurally change from fluorite-type to pyrochlore-type with the TiO2 amount higher than ca. 55 mol %.62 While the conductivity of the pyrochlore phase is higher than that of fluorite one, the conductivity increases at oxygen pressures below ca. 10-13 Pa, depending on the operating temperature, as well as at pressures higher than 105 Pa. Even if the stability of Y2Ti2O7 is in a satisfactory temperature region, application of this oxide ion conductor is limited only in the intermediate oxygen pressure region. Another Sm2Zr2O7 pyrochlore phase was also prepared. However, the oxygen pressure dependencies are similar.63 The stoichiometric pyrochlore phase of Gd2Zr2O7 was reported to be another candidate for an oxide ion conductor.64 The ion conductivity was still lower than that of lanthanum oxide

(La2O3) doped with SrO or CaO, which is described in section II.B.2.e and is not attractive at this stage. High oxide ion conductivity was obtained for Gd2(Ti1-xZrx)2O7,65 and it was clarified that Gd2(Ti1-xZrx)2O7 shows a large enhancement in oxide ion conductivity as the composition changes from Gd2Ti2O7 to Gd2Zr2O7. This conductivity increase is estimated to be due to the structural disorder which increases the concentration of the oxygen vacancies and increases the oxide anion conductivity.66, 67

III. Solid Electrolytes with Rare Earths as Dopants A. Cationic Conductors 1. Lithium Ion Conductors

Li1+xTi2-xScx(PO4)3 was reported in 1986;68 with the Ti site substitution for Sc3+, the lattice size increases, since the ionic radius of Sc3+ (0.0885 nm; CN ) 626) is slightly larger than that of Ti4+ (0.0745 nm; CN ) 626). From this observation, it was clarified that the bottleneck size of the Li+ ion migration path appreciably affects the ion conducting properties in the LiM2(PO4)3-type structure.

In 1989, various types of rare-earth elements such as Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ were mixed with LiTi2(PO4)3 to enhance the ion conductivity in Li1+xTi2-xRx(PO4)3 (R ) Sc, Y, or La).69 Sc3+ ion can replace Ti, while the substitution of Ti with Y or La was not successful due to their large difference in ionic radius and results in the LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3Ln2(PO4)3 (Ln ) Y or La) mixed phase. However, from the Li+ ion conducting behavior, all the LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolytes mixed with Sc3+, Y3+, or La3+ show a considerably higher conductivity than LiTi2(PO4)3. By rare-earth mixing with LiTi2(PO4)3, regardless of whether they make a solid solution, the relative density (porosities of Li1.3Ti1.7Sc0.3(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3+Li3La2(PO4)3 mixed phase with Li:La ) 1.7: 0.3 are 2.0% and 0.1%, respectively) becomes appreciably higher and enhances the conductivity.70,71

Figure 21 shows the effect on ion conductivity with change in x in Li1+xTi2-xMx(PO4)3 at 25 °C. By the M3+ substitution, the conductivity greatly increased, and a maximum conductivity was obtained at about x ) 0.3. In particular, Li1.3Ti1.7M0.3(PO4)3 (M ) Al or

2416 Chemical Reviews, 2002, Vol. 102, No. 6 Sc) has the highest ion conductivity of 7  2) 10-4 S 226)cm-1 at 25 °C, and this value is comparable to that of Li3N, which shows the highest Li+ ion conductivity among Li+ ion conductors as shown in Figure 22.

Figure 22. Ionic conductivity at 25 °C for the various Li+ conducting solid electrolytes.

LiLnTiO4 (Ln ) La, Nd) were also prepared, and the lithium ion conductivity of LiLnTiO4 (Ln ) La, Nd) was measured. It becomes clear that LiLaTiO4 shows 1 order of magnitude higher conductivity than that of LiNdTiO4. However, the Li+ ion conductivity of the layered perovskite LiLnTiO4 (Ln ) La, Nd) is much lower than that of the 3D-perovskite (Li, Ln)TiO3 series as discussed in section II.A.1.a. The high conductivity of (Li, Ln)TiO3 is ascribed to the presence of Li+ ions in the cubooctahedral sites along with La ions and also the existence of Li+ ion vacancies. In contrast, there is no Li+ ion vacancies in LiLnTiO4 and the mobility of Li+ ion is considerably restricted.72

2. Sodium Ion Conductors

a. Silicate-Based Materials. Na5MSi4O12-type silicates (M ) Fe, In, Sc, Y, Lu-Sm) show a comparable conductivity to that of Na+226)-Al2O3 and of NASICON (Na3Zr2PSi2O12). The silicate structure is composed of Si12O36 rings which stack to form columns held apart by MO6 octahedra. In Na5YSi4O12, Na+ ions are immobile and are situated within the rings while Na+ ions between the columns easily migrate. Figure 23 depicts the log  243)-1/T relation for the Na5MSi4O12 series. The trivalent ion which holds the largest ionic radius shows the highest conductivity and is in this case Sm. Since Na+226)-Al2O3 possesses an anisotropic Na+ ion conductivity, it prompted research on new high Na+ ion conductors in the framework or tunnel structure where threedimensional migration can be realized. Figure 24 presents some representative results of Na+ ion conducting behaviors. At 25 °C, Na+226)-Al2O3 exhibits the highest conductivity, while two silicates give a comparable conductivity to Na+226)-Al2O3 at 200 °C. One of great advantages of the silicate series is that the synthesis can be completed at lower temperatures compared with that of Na+226)-Al2O3, although the raw materials for silicates are more costly.73

b. Sulfate-Based Materials. Sodium sulfate has five polymorphic forms. Na2SO4-V is stable at room temperature but transforms to Na2SO4-III on heating and then finally transforms to the Na2SO4-I phase. This Na2SO4-I phase is a high Na+ ion conducting

phase, and the sulfate functions as a solid electrolyte. In contrast, on cooling, Na2SO4-I phase makes a phase transition via the unstable Na2SO4-II phase then to Na2SO4-III phase. The Na2SO4-III phase gradually transforms to Na2SO4-V, but this transformation is sluggish and may take several months. To maintain the high Na+ ion conducting Na2SO4-I phase, it is necessary to dope with aliovalent ions. Rare-earth cations contribute greatly for that purpose. Figure 25 shows one of the representative log( 243)T) vs 1/T relationships for sodium sulfate-based solid electrolytes. To realize the stabilization of the high-temperature Na2SO4-I phase, the rare-earth doping in Na+ site has been carried out by mixing with NaVO3. By this modification, Na+ cation vacancies are produced and the enhancement of Na+ ion conductivity is successfully achieved. By simply mixing R2(SO4)3 (R ) Eu, Pr, and Y) with Na2SO4, the conductivity also increases. However, the phase transformation from phase I to III still appears when the rare-earth-doped sulfate is cooled. Rare-earth

sulfate mixing with sodium sulfate is therefore not sufficient for the stabilization of the high Na+ ion conducting phase. Codoping of NaVO3 and R2(SO4)3 (R ) Eu, Pr and Y) with Na2SO4 is considerably more effective in preserving the phase similar to the high Na+ ion conductive Na2SO4-I phase.74

Another attempt which has been undertaken to stabilize the Na2SO4-I phase is to mix rare-earth sulfate and silicon dioxide or aluminum oxide75,76 with Na2SO4.77 This results in a Na+ ion conductivity that is comparable to Na2SO4-NaVO3-Y2(SO4)3 and prevents the electrolyte from becoming ductile. By further additional mixing of lithium sulfate with Na2SO4-Y2(SO4)3-SiO2 solid electrolyte, the conductivity becomes approximately 320 times higher than pure sodium sulfate at 700 °C, which is within the high Na+ ion conductive I phase region.78

3. Proton Conductors

Proton conduction is the charge transport mechanism in Sc (2 mol %) doped SrTiO3 in a wet air atmosphere. The proton is bounded by oxide anion as if the proton shows the hydrogen bond between two oxide anions. This is expected to be responsible for the high proton conduction also in SrTiO3.

The perovskite-type structure is one of famous frameworks of proton conductors. However, the perovskite structure cannot always support the proton conduction. For example, Y-doped BaTiO3 does not show proton conducting behavior. For 4 mol % Scdoped SrTiO3, the conductivity in water vapor is higher than that in dry atmosphere in the temperature region below 200 °C. However, above 400 °C, conduction occurs mainly by holes or oxygen vacancies and not protons.79 This tendency is commonly observed among perovskite-type oxide series.

SrZrO3 also shows proton conducting properties at temperatures below 700 °C. At temperatures higher than 700 °C, hole conduction becomes predominant. By doping the Zr site with Y, proton conduction increases rapidly, and at x ) 0.06, the solid solution shows the highest proton conductivity among Ydoped SrZrO3 single crystals. Using the isotope effect, it has been shown that the proton conduction occurs by migration in a crystal without tunneling.80 The conductivities of SrTiO3 and SrZrO3 are presented and compared in Figure 26. Also in SrMY0.05O2.75 (M

Figure 26. Temperature dependencies of the conductivities of Sc-doped SrTiO3 and SrZrO3.

) Ce or Zr) it becomes clear from isotope investigations that the proton is bound in the interstitial site between oxide anions and conducts by hopping with a thermal activation process.81

The great disadvantage commonly observed for perovskite-type structures is that p-type conduction appears in a relatively high oxygen pressure and high temperature region, and this feature greatly deteriorates the applicability of the proton conductors based on the perovskite-type structure.

Perovskite-type BaTh0.9Gd0.1O3 solid also shows proton conducting behavior. However, thorium is a low radioactive element (half-life ) 1.4  2) 1010 years), and this restricts the wide application of the Thcontained-perovskite-type solid electrolyte.82

B. Anionic Conductors 1. Zirconium Dioxides

In 1899, Nernst demonstrated oxide ion conduction in ZrO2-9%Y2O3.83 Doping with 9 mol % Y2O3 is the minimum content for stabilization of the fluorite phase. The high solubility of Y2O3 in ZrO2 is ascribed to the similarity between the ZrO2 fluorite structure and the rare-earth oxide cubic, C-type structure.

In the case of the rare earth, La, as a dopant, the pyrochlore La2Zr2O7 is formed due to the large ionic size of La3+. Among the rare earths as a dopant, the most interesting dopant is Sc3+. As the ionic radius of Zr4+ (0.098 nm; CN ) 826) and Sc3+ (0.101 nm; CN ) 826) are similar, only 6% is necessary to fully stabilize the fluorite phase.

In the ZrO2-R2O3 series, the fluorite-type solid solutions have a maximum conductivity at 8-10 mol % RO1.5 (R ) Nd-Lu, Y, Sc) at compositions corresponding to near the lower fluorite phase boundary, and an increase in rare-earth doping decreases the conductivity. Since the ionic radii of rare earths are larger than that of Zr4+, the free volume for oxide ion migration decreases with the increase of the rareearth content, which explains the effect on conductivity.

The oxide ion conductivity linearly increases with reducing ionic radius of the dopant rare earth in the sequence Nd < Gd < Dy < Ho ) Y < Er < Yb < Lu < Sc (Figure 27) as expected. Among the rare-earthdoped stabilized zirconias, the highest ion conductivity was obtained for the solid solution of ZrO2-Sc2O3.

2418 Chemical Reviews, 2002, Vol. 102, No. 6

Figure 27. Relationship between the O2ion conductivity and the doped rare-earth radius for stabilized zirconias at 800 (() and 1000 °C (b). (Reprinted with permission from ref 85. Copyright 1999 Springer-Verlag.)

Despite the observation that the oxide ion conductivity is the highest for ZrO2-Sc2O3 among rareearth-doped ZrO2 solid solution series, the critical disadvantage is the low stability of the solid solution. An effective way to stabilize the solid solution is to add Y2O3, Yb2O3, or Lu2O3 to the ZrO2-Sc2O3 solid solution which does not affect the oxide ion conductivity. The ZrO2 solid solution mixed with another rare-earth oxide is much more stable than ZrO2 with individual rare-earth oxide.84

The ternary system ZrO2-Sc2O3-Y2O3 shows a higher conductivity than that of YSZ, and the degradation rate is much slower than that of scandiastabilized zirconia (SSZ). The typical content of YO1.5 and ScO1.5 is 3-7mol % and up to 6 mol %, respectively.

Stabilized zirconia with ceria or praseodymia shows mixed conducting properties. In general, the electron transference number of these oxides is less than 0.1. Oxygen permeability and oxygen exchange properties of stabilized zirconia are also described in the literature.85

The addition of Al2O3 into ZrO2-Sc2O3-Y2O3 where two different rare-earth species are introduced is also effective in making a composite, and it shows much better conductivity behavior in comparison to aluminafree materials.86

2. Bismuth Oxides

In Bi2O3, there are four polymorphs (R,  226),  231),  228)). The phase transformation from R-phase to  228)-phase occurs at approximately 730 °C (Figure 28). The  228)-Bi2O3 phase is stable until it melts at about 825 °C. When Bi2O3 is cooled from the high-temperature  228)-Bi2O3 phase, a large hysteresis was observed and two intermediate metastable phases, tetragonal  226)-Bi2O3 and cubic  231)-Bi2O3, are recognized. On cooling, the  226)-Bi2O3 phase appears at around 650 °C and the  231)-Bi2O3 phase appears at 640 °C. The  231)-Bi2O3 phase is stable down to room temperature, if the sample is cooled very slowly. In contrast, it is not possible to maintain the  226)-Bi2O3 phase and it transforms to R-Bi2O3. The  226)-Bi2O3,  231)-Bi2O3, and  228)-Bi2O3 phases all show mainly ionic conduction with the oxide anion as the charge carrier. The R-Bi2O3 phase shows a

variation in conductivity with oxygen pressure, and the main charge carrier is found to be a hole.

The reasons of the high oxide anion conductivity in  228)-Bi2O3 are understood as follows: one-fourth of the oxygen sites are vacant in the  228)-Bi2O3 hightemperature phase which has the fluorite structure; Bi3+ possesses 6s2 lone pair electrons and its high polarizability of the cation network allows oxide anions to migrate; Bi3+ makes highly disordered surroundings.

The Bi2O3-M2O3 solid solutions showing high ionic conducting characteristics are categorized as cubic  228)-Bi2O3 or rhombohedral structure. Whether the cubic  228)-Bi2O3 or rhombohedral structure is formed is dependent on the dopant species and its concentration. The Bi2O3-Gd2O3 system belongs to both cubic and rhombohedral phases, and both are excellent oxide anion conductors.

The rhombohedral phase is formed in the case for larger M3+ ions, while the cubic phases are, in general, formed for smaller cations. Among the Bi2O3-R2O3 (R ) Y and/or rare earths) system, the Bi2O3-Y2O3 system has been investigated in the most detail. The  228)-Bi2O3 phase containing 25 mol % Y2O3 in Bi2O3 is stable at temperatures lower than 400 °C. The composition 0.75Bi2O3-0.25Y2O3 is the lowest R2O3 composition where no phase transition occurs and composition maintains the highest conductivity over a wide region of temperature as shown in Figure 28.

The stability region of the high-temperature  228)-Bi2O3 phase is between 25 and 43 mol % Y2O3. When the content is less than 25 mol %, a significant hysteresis was observed between the heating and cooling process and the temperature difference is between 50 and 100 °C.

The ion conductivity of the (Bi2O3)1-x(R2O3)x solid solution system for the minimum value of x to stabilize the cubic phase vs ionic radius of R3+ is plotted in Figure 29. The smallest xmin value is obtained for Er2O3-stabilized Bi2O3 with the ionic transference number of unity, and it is clear that the Bi2O3-Er2O3 solid solution shows the highest ion conductivity. The value of xmin increases with the ionic size. That is, a high xmin value results in a low ionic conductivity.87

From an application point of view, stabilized Bi2O3 is not an appropriate candidate for SOFC electrolyte,

due to the reduction in a low pO2 environment. The thermodynamic stability of Bi2O3 solid electrolyte along with phase stability at low temperatures are also required.88

3. Thorium Oxides

Thorium oxide (ThO2) possesses a fluorite structure, and the addition of rare-earth oxides introduces anion vacancies. While Sc2O3 can only make a solid solution with ThO2 at low Sc2O3 contents, other lighter lanthanide oxides in which rare-earth ionic radii are appreciably larger than that of Sc are very soluble in ThO2. The cations of the rare-earth oxides holding a C-type structure do not show a complete miscibility with ThO2 due to their small ionic size. In addition, ThO2 shows a greater stability compared with ZrO2 in a highly reducing atmosphere where n-type conduction becomes significant for ZrO2-based electrolytes. The unusually high stability of ThO2based solid electrolytes is an outstanding advantage compared to ZrO2-based electrolyte, especially for application in a low oxygen pressure region. ThO2based solid electrolytes are chemically very inert, and ThO2 shows an excellent corrosion resistance in molten alkaline metals such as molten sodium. Impurities in ThO2 usually result in electronic conduction because of the introduction of energy levels near the conduction band. Therefore, the purity of the starting materials is essential for the case of ThO2 in considering it in the solid electrolyte field.

4. Hafnium Oxides

Another candidate element which is located in the same IV A group in the periodic table but having a higher atomic number than Zr is Hf. Figure 30 shows the relationship between the ion transference number (tion) and the oxygen pressure for HfO2-based fluorite solid electrolyte at 1600 °C. The data of CaO-doped zirconia is also plotted. From the figure it becomes clear that the HfO2-based electrolytes are preferable for use at high temperatures and in the low oxygen pressure region. Electronic conductivity is negligible, indicating a suitability for fully killed steel melts condition (compared with the ZrO2-based electrolytes which show n-type electronic conduction and are not applicable). Another way of obtaining a low oxygen

pressure application is to use the ternary electrolyte of HfO2-ZrO2-Y2O3 and HfO2-ThO2-Y2O3.89

5. Apatites

The calcium oxyhydroxyapatites, Ca10-xRx(PO4)6(OH)2-xOx (R ) Y3+ or La3+), show ion conducting behavior. Among these, the highest conductivity is obtained for Ca9.3Y0.7(PO4)6(OH)1.3O0.7. For x appreciably larger than 1, the dominant charge carrier is O2-, while in the range of 0 < x <1, mobile ions are OHand O2-. However, there still remains a possibility of proton conduction through OH-.90

Since rare-earth-based apatites show a considerable oxide anion conductivity, various types of stoichiometric compounds have been investigated in addition to the stoichiometric compound (R0.8A0.2)10(MO4)6O2. One type is the cation-deficient compound R9.33(MO4)6O2; the other is the oxygen excess compound of R10(MO4)6O3 and (R10-xAx)(MO4)6O3-x/2 (R ) La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy; A ) Ca, Sr, Ba; and M ) Si, Ge).

The R10(SiO4)6O3 (R ) La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Y, Ho, Er, and Yb) series has been demonstrated to be good oxide anion conductors. The structure is composed of interconnecting LaO6 octahedra and SiO4 tetrahedra comprising a three-dimensional network structure.

The electrostatic interaction between the oxygen and Ln3+ reduces with increasing Ln3+ ion radius. Among the series, the compound with La shows the highest conductivity. Figure 31 presents the relation between the ionic radius and the electrical properties of R10(SiO4)6O3. With increasing ionic radius of R3+ in R10(SiO4)6O3, the activation energy decreases and the conductivity increases. The maximum conductivity of 1.4  2) 10-3 S 226)cm-1 was obtained for La10(SiO4)6O3 at 700 °C. As can be seen, the conductivity of R10(SiO4)6O3 with monoclinic structure (R ) Y, Ho, Er, Yb) is appreciably lower than that of the samples with hexagonal structure (R ) La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy). The oxide ion transference number of R10(SiO4)6O3 with R ) Nd and Sm was investigated, and it was found to be almost unity at >600 and >700 °C, respectively. Although La10(SiO4)6O3 shows the highest conductivity, microcracks appear in the bulk, and this makes it impossible to conduct the electromotive

conductors. However, these reports have neither directly nor quantitatively demonstrated any trivalent ion migration in solids as listed in Table 1. The methods utilized for Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina,  226)-LaNb3O9, and LaAl11O18 are indirect and not quantitative. Among them, especially, Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina solid electrolytes were prepared by ionically exchanging the Na+ site in Na+226)¢ ¢ -alumina for Ln3+. Therefore, a small amount of Na+ ion still remains in these solid electrolytes and might contribute to ion conduction. Recently, M2(M¢ O4)3 (M ) Al, In, Sc, Y, Er-Lu; M¢ ) W, Mo) solid electrolytes with orthorhombic Sc2(WO4)3-type structure were shown to have trivalent M3+ cation conducting characteristics.114-134 The Sc2(WO4)3-type structure is a quasi-layered structure and has a large pathway where M3+ ion can migrate smoothly, and the hexavalent tungsten ion bonds to 2four surrounding oxide anions to form a rigid WO4 tetrahedral unit. This results in a considerable reduction of the electrostatic interaction between M3+ and O2and the realization of the M3+ ion conduction. In 1999, a new trivalent rare-earth conducting solid electrolyte with NASICON-type structure135-139 was reported as an advanced trivalent cationic conductor, which is one of the appropriate candidates for practical applications.

In La9.33Si6O26, a considerable number (ca. 14%) of oxygen atoms are displaced from the ideal position, which creates Frenkel-like defects. In addition, in the channel sites, disorder is also observed.93 Therefore, these compounds possess a comparable conductivity to or higher than that of yttria-stabilized zirconia at 600 °C and show a high oxide ion transference number of higher than 0.9 in a wide oxygen partial pressure region of 105-10-16 Pa with low activation energy of 0.6-0.8 eV. They are potentially useful, especially for a low or intermediate temperature range of operation.94 However, a significant disadvantage is the instability of the La9.33Si6O26 solids in comparison to the commonly known stabilized zirconia.

IV. Trivalent Cation Conductors

Up to now, the conducting ion species in solid electrolytes introduced are mainly limited to monoand divalent ions because the ionic conductivity strongly depends on their valency. For trivalent cations, the electrostatic interaction between the conducting trivalent cation and surrounding anions has been believed to be too strong to realize a trivalent ion migration in a solid lattice. Therefore, trivalent cations such as rare-earth ions in solid electrolytes are commonly used for adjustment of the defect concentration and the lattice size. For realizing the trivalent cation conduction in a solid lattice, it is necessary to reduce such a strong interaction between the mobile trivalent cation and the lattice forming anions. Some papers have claimed that Ln3+226)/ 226)¢ ¢ -alumina,35-37,95-107  226)-alumina-related materials,108-112 and Ln3+226)-LaNb3O9,20,113 are trivalent ion

between 25 and 500 °C.101 From these measurements it was found that the only 10% Pr3+ occupied the BR sites at room temperature and the BR position occupancy was increased up to 250 °C where both BR and mO sites are occupied to a nearly equal extent. At even higher temperatures, a redistribution of Pr3+ back into mO sites was again observed. Therefore, it seems to be difficult for Pr3+ to migrate at low temperature because the Pr3+ ions are trapped within the BR site and unable to exhibit a long-range migration due to considerably high potential barriers of the nonequivalent BR and mO sites. The result is that the residual Na+ ions may migrate. However, at high temperatures, the Pr3+ ion is able to obtain an enough energy to overcome the barriers and to migrate out of BR into the next mO sites. Recently dc electrolysis was performed for Nd3+¢ -alumina (degree of exchange was ca. 98%) at both  226)¢ 250 and 650 °C in order to directly clarify the conducting species in ionically exchanged Ln3+226)¢ ¢ alumina.103 A schematic illustration of the setup of dc electrolysis for Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina is shown in Figure 33. The line electron probe micro analysis

the conductivity at elevated temperatures increases and is assumed to result from a Gd3+ ion transport, generating a conductivity of 10-3 S 226)cm-1 at 600-700 °C.96 For other lanthanide ion (Ln ) La, Pr, or Nd) exchanged Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina crystals, conductivity values of 10-4-10-6 S 226)cm-1 have been reported for temperatures around 400-500 °C. However, the identity of the charge carrier in these solids was not conclusively identified. Since these Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -aluminas are prepared by an ion exchange method, a small amount of Na+ ion may still remain despite the authors’ claim that the ion exchange ratio is ca. 100% (for example, the composition of Gd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina crystal, which was almost completely ion-exchanged, has been identified by labeling the original Na+ ion content of the starting crystal with 22Na so that the remaining sodium ion content can be identified). For other highly ion-exchanged  226)¢ ¢ -alumina with La3+ (98%), Ho3+ (98%), and Er3+ (96%) (see Table 2), at least 2% or 4% Na+ still remains, and the remaining Na+ ions contribute predominantly to the ion conduction in the  226)¢ ¢ -alumina solids. Furthermore, the presence of divalent Mg2+ cations in the spinel blocks must be speculated to conduct in the solid as well. Therefore, the conducting candidate species are Ln3+, Mg2+, remaining Na+ cations, protons, oxide anions, and electronic charge carrier. Unfortunately, the ionexchanged Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -aluminas have not been directly identified to be Ln3+ ion conductors by experimental procedures. Only electrical conductivity and XRD measurements are performed, and they conclude them to be the trivalent cationic conductors. The activation energy at lower temperature for all samples derived from the Arrhenius plot was very low in comparison with those in the higher temperature region. As an example, the temperature dependencies of the conductivity for ion-exchanged Na+/Ho3+226)¢ ¢ alumina101 are depicted in Figure 32. The activation

Copyright 1995 Elsevier Science B. V.) energies for 98% ion-exchanged Na+/Ho3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina are 0.058 eV at 150 °C and 0.456 eV at 500 °C. For the purpose of investigating this unique behavior in ion-exchanged Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina, the Ln3+ cation occupation in the conduction plane of  226)¢ ¢ -alumina structure was extensively studied by using X-ray diffraction for Pr3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina at temperatures

Schematic illustration of the setup of dc electrolysis for Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina and the EPMA line analysis results for Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina which were electrolyzed at both 250 °C (a) and 650 °C (b). (Reprinted with permission from ref 103. Copyright 2000 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH.) (EPMA) was performed for the Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -aluminas, which were electrolyzed at both 250 (Figure 33a) and 650 °C (Figure 33b). The significant segregation of Nd atoms was not observed at the cathodic surface for the sample electrolyzed at 250 °C, while Na atoms significantly segregated. On the other hand, for the sample heated to 650 °C, a strong Nd peak was also recognized together with a Na peak. These results clearly indicate that the migrating species in Nd3+ 226)¢ ¢ -alumina is Na+ and Na+/Nd3+ at lower and higher temperatures, respectively, and that the ion-exchanged Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina is not a pure trivalent

Nd3+ cationic conductor but Na+ and Nd3+ mixed ion conductor at elevated temperatures. In other ionexchanged Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -aluminas there is also doubt as to whether only the Ln3+ cation migrates or not by the same reason as for Nd3+226)¢ The ion exchange into Na+226)¢

¢ -alumina. ¢ -alumina polycrystal is much more difficult than for single crystalline material, in particular for the case of trivalent cations. Therefore, trivalent ion exchange reactions for polycrystalline Na+226)¢ ¢ -alumina have been rarely reported, e.g., only for the Na+/Nd3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina104 and the Na+/Ce3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina36 systems. However, electrical conductivity measurements were not conducted on these samples. Furthermore, the grains of the latter compound exhibit microcracks due to expansion in the crystal structure which occur when the large lanthanide ions substitute for Na+ for Nd3+ into the conduction planes.

As for the  226)-alumina, the Ln3+226)-aluminas (Ln ) Pr, Nd, Ho) were synthesized by an ion exchange method.105-107 However, the ion exchange of Ln3+ for Na+ in  226)-alumina is difficult since the structural characteristics as well as mechanisms of charge compensation differ from  226)-alumina to  226)¢ ¢ -alumina, and the degree of exchange ratio was, therefore, only 95% at maximum. The low ion exchange seems to be due to the excess amount of Na+ ion compensated by interstitial O2ions in the conduction planes. The ionic conduction properties of Ln3+226)-aluminas were not investigated at all.

B.  226)-Alumina-Related Materials

It is also possible to replace Al2O3 within the spinel framework by other oxides, such as Ga2O3, forming ¢ -gallates,140,141 the corresponding isomorphous  226)or  226)¢ ¢ -gallates often exhibit faster respectively. The  226)/ 226)¢ ionic conductivity than the corresponding  226)/ 226)¢ ¢ -aluminas. The faster ion exchange occurs due to the larger ionic radius of Ga3+ (0.076 nm; CN ) 626) than that of Al3+ (0.0675 nm; CN ) 626), whose ion appears in the spinel blocks. The large Ga3+ cation in the spinel block causes the enlargement of the space between the two adjacent spinel blocks. As a consequence, the steric hindrance for the conducting cations is reduced, resulting in faster ion exchange. However, since the gallates do not have the same thermal stability as the  226)-alumina in addition to its high cost, its application is limited.

12O19) compound is another related material. The structure is shown in Figure 34. In the magnetoplumbite structure, a mirror plane sandwiched between two spinel blocks is similar to  226)/ 226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3. These magnetoplumbite-type materials are easily obtained by a conventional solidstate reaction methods. However, the mirror plane has no oxygen vacancies and ions are more densely ¢ -Al2O3. Owing to these packed compared to  226)/ 226)¢ factors, the magnetoplumbite-type compounds exhibit a considerably lower conductivity and a higher activation energy than  226)/ 226)¢ ¢ -Al2O3. For the magnetoplumbite-type solid electrolytes with lanthanoid atoms, LnAl11O18 (Ln ) La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) and LnAl12O18N (Ln ) La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd) were

reported.108-112 From impedance spectroscopic and EMF measurement results, trivalent lanthanide cation conduction was assumed. However, similar to the case for Ln3+226)¢ ¢ -alumina, a direct demonstration of trivalent cation, which denies the possible migration of oxide anion and proton, etc., has not been carried out yet.

C. Perovskite-Type Structures

Trivalent cationic conduction in perovskite structure was reported for  226)-LaNb3O9.113 The compound is A-site deficient, which is one of key points of high valency cation conduction. La3+ ions are surrounded by 12 oxygen atoms adopting an ordered distribution. One of the A-sites located in the plane parallel to the ab plane is entirely empty, and one is statistically occupied by 2/3 of the lanthanum ions as already illustrated in Figure 5. The vacant A-positions are energetically equivalent and double the number of total La3+ ions in the lattice, therefore providing an interconnected 3D-channel for the assumed ionic motion. The  226)-LaNb3O9 is a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, and the electronic conduction appears at temperatures higher than 577 °C, while it is reported that the La3+ predominantly conducts below 577 °C. dc electrolysis of  226)-LaNb3O9 was performed to demonstrate La3+ migration in the solid. After electrolysis, the color change of both the cathodic and anodic surfaces and a high concentration of La atom at only the cathodic surface was observed. However, the electrolysis was done at ca. 727 °C, which is higher than the ambit temperature of ionic and electronic conduction. Therefore, it seems that the sample decomposed. Furthermore, since the material, which is expected to segregate at the cathodic surface by the cation migration, was not identified at all, it is still questionable whether  226)-LaNb3O9 can be called a “pure” trivalent cationic conductor or not.

In 2000, a new trivalent Y3+ ion conducting solid electrolyte with A-site-deficient perovskite structure, Yx(Ta3xW1-3x)O3 (0e xe 0.33),142 was reported by Sato et al. By substituting the pentavalent Ta5+ site for

21,143-145 which holds the hexavalent W6+ in Y1/3TaO3 perovskite structure, A-site cations, such as Y3+, are completely lacking on alternate layers and Y3+ vacancies are introduced. In the Yx(Ta3xW1-3x)O3 series, Y0.06(Ta0.18W0.82)O3 (x ) 0.06) shows the highest conductivity (ca. 2.58  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1 at 362 °C), which is about 400 and 800 times higher than that of La1/3NbO3 and La1/3TaO3, respectively. The polarization behavior for Yx(Ta3xW1-3x)O3 was investigated, and a clear polarization was obtained. As a result, Yx(Ta3xW1-3x)O3 was claimed to be a Y3+ ion conductor because a good polarization phenomenon in oxygen atmosphere indicates that no O2anion conduction appears and the high-valent Ta5+ and W6+ ions are considered to be difficult to migrate in the solid. However, the polarization measurements in O2 atmosphere indicate only the impossibility of oxide anion conduction, and the experiments applied for Yx(Ta3xW1-3x)O3 are still insufficient for the demonstration of trivalent cation migration in the solid.

D. Sc2(WO4)3-Type Solid Electrolytes

The tungstate with trivalent cation, M2(WO4)3, has two crystal structures depending on the trivalent cation size as shown in Figure 35.146 One is a Sc2-

(WO4)3-type structure with orthorhombic symmetry, and the other is a monoclinic Eu2(WO4)3-type structure. The Sc2(WO4)3-type structure has a quasilayered one and a large pathway where M3+ ion can migrate smoothly as shown in Figure 36. In this

structure, hexavalent tungsten ion (W6+) bonds to 2four surrounding oxide anions to form a rigid WO4 tetrahedron unit, resulting in a considerable reduc-

tion of the electrostatic interaction between M3+ andO2and the realization of the M3+ ion conduction. On the other hand, while Eu2(WO4)3-type structure also contains W6+, the trivalent cation in Eu2(WO4)3type structure is 8-coordinate (M3+ in Sc2(WO4)3-type structure is 6-coordinate). Therefore, M3+ cannot migrate in a Eu2(WO4)3-type lattice due to the stronger electrostatic interaction with eight oxide anions.

Figure 37. Electrical conductivities at 600 °C and activation energies for M2(WO4)3 with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure. (Reprinted with permission from ref 119. Copyright 1998 American Chemical Society.)

Figure 37 shows the electrical conductivities at 600 °C and activation energies for M2(WO4)3 with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure. The conductivity of M2(WO4)3 changes with the variation of ionic radius, and Sc2(WO4)3 shows the highest conductivity among the M2(WO4)3 series. In solid electrolytes with trivalent M3+ ion larger than Sc3+, the conductivity decreases because the conducting M3+ cation size becomes disproportionately large compared with the lattice size. On the other hand, for the ion species of Al3+ which has a much smaller ionic radius (0.0675 nm; CN ) 626) in comparison with the Sc3+ (0.0885 nm; CN ) 626), the ion conductivity decreased considerably due to the larger contraction of the volume of the migrating trivalent ion from Sc3+ to Al3+ compared with that of the crystal lattice from Sc2(WO4)3 to Al2(WO4)3.

Trivalent cation conduction in Sc2(WO4)3-type solid electrolyte was directly demonstrated by the measurements of oxygen pressure dependencies of the electrical conductivity, polarization measurement, and dc electrolysis. All samples which hold the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure show the constant conductivity in a wide oxygen pressure range, which indicates that no electronic conduction appears in the sample. The dc conductivity of the samples was measured in a different oxygen partial pressure atmosphere, and the dc to ac conductivity ratio was drastically decreased with passing time. This phenomenon clearly shows that the probability of oxide anion conduction in solid was eliminated because if O2anion is a migrating species, the dc conductivity should be equal to the ac conductivity and the above-mentioned ratio should be unity. This should be independent of the time exposure in O2 atmosphere where the migrating

species is constantly provided. The ionic transference number, tion, calculated from the value at 10 min after electrolysis, was 0.99. The EMF measurement of the O2 concentration cell using Sc2(WO4)3 was also conducted in various temperatures with the aim of excluding the electronic conduction. The measured EMF is in excellent agreement with the theoretical value calculated from Nernst equation, and tion was estimated to be unity.

For the purpose of identifying the conducting cationic species in Sc2(WO4)3, dc electrolysis was performed by applying a dc voltage of 10 V, which is higher than the decomposition voltage of Sc2(WO4)3 (ca. 1.2 V) with Pt as an ion blocking electrode. Figure 38 shows the scanning electron microscope (SEM)

To demonstrate macroscopic trivalent cation conduction in tungstates, dc electrolysis was carried out by using two tungstates of Al2(WO4)3 and Sc2(WO4)3 (the setup is presented in Figure 39). After the

Figure 39. Setup of dc electrolysis and EPMA line analysis for the Sc2(WO4)3 solid electrolyte with Al2(WO4)3. (Reprinted with permission from ref 116. Copyright 1998 Electrochemical Society Inc.)

electrolysis, Al clearly existed inside the Sc2(WO4)3 bulk where no Al atom appears before electrolysis, as shown in Figure 39. This phenomenon clearly indicates that Al3+ ion migrated from Al2(WO4)3 (anodic side) to Sc2(WO4)3 (cathodic side).

The trivalent Al3+ ion conducting properties in Al2(WO4)3 single crystal with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure were measured. A large-sized Al2(WO4)3 single crystal (15 mm in diameter and up to 35 mm in length) with high transparency was successfully grown by modified Czochralski (CZ) method.120 The Al3+ ion conducting behavior should be different parallel to each of the these crystals since the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure is orthorhombic. It was found that the ion conductivity along the b-axis was the highest conductivity among the three axes. The conductivity along the b-axis at low temperature (<500 °C) was higher than that of polycrystalline sample. The conductivity along the c-axis is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the b-axis. Therefore, the Sc2(WO4)3 series is expected to show the highest ion conductivity along the b-axis.

Various kinds of solid solution with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure were also extensively investigated for the purpose of enhancing the trivalent ion conductivity of the tungstates. Figure 40 shows the electrical conductivities of (1-x)Sc2(WO4)3-xLn2(WO4)3 (Ln ) Lu,124 Gd117) at 600 °C. For the Lu3+ system, the discontinuity of the conductivity is recognized between x ) 0.5 and 0.6. From dc electrolysis of the samples with the composition x ) 0.4 and 0.6, the

After dc electrolysis, the needle on the material included an amount of Sc that was 9 times higher than that in the mother bulk Sc2(WO4)3 which identified to be Sc6WO12 at the cathodic surface. On the other hand, the color at the anodic surface of the electrolyzed sample changed to yellow and WO3 was detected. Furthermore, a strong Sc peak was detected at only the cathodic surface. These results strongly indicate that the following reaction occurred during dc electrolysis and the macroscopic migration of Sc3+ in Sc2(WO4)3.

trolysis and followed by SEM observation and EPMA. After electrolysis, the Al2O3 deposits were observed only at the cathodic surface. From the EPMA line analysis of the electrolyzed pellet, only a considerable Al3+ segregation appeared on the cathodic surface while other cations were homogeneously distributed from the anodic to cathodic surfaces. These results mean that the Al3+ ion migration is much easier than the ionic migrations of Sc3+, Lu3+, and also W6+ in the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure.

Molybdates with Sc2(WO4)3-type structure, M2(MoO4)3, were also prepared. Their trivalent M3+ conductivities were higher than those of tungstates as shown in Figure 42 due to the smaller ionic radius

of Mo6+ (0.055 nm; CN ) 426) and W6+ (0.056 nm; CN ) 426), resulting in a smaller lattice size which is more suitable for trivalent ion conduction in the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure. In Sc2(MoO4)3, trivalent Sc3+ ion conduction was also demonstrated by dc electrolysis to be similar to the case for Sc2(WO4)3. Deposits of only Sc were recognized at the cathodic surface after electrolysis, while that observed for Sc2(WO4)3 had cathodic deposits consisting of both Sc and W. The result indicates that the Sc3+ cation migrated into the Sc2(MoO4)3 and deposited at the cathodic surface where the Pt blocking electrode was in contact and consequently the deposited Sc metal was oxidized. However, the scandium oxide did not react with the mother bulk Sc2(MoO4)3. This behavior is quite different from the case for Sc2(WO4)3, since Sc was left in an oxide state.

From dc electrolysis, molybdates with Sc2(WO4)3type structure were clearly shown to be trivalent cation conductors, but molybdates were easily reduced compared with tungstates; e.g., Sc2(WO4)3 is not reduced even at the partial oxygen pressure of 10-17 Pa, while Sc2(MoO4)3 is reduced even at 10-13 Pa at 700 °C (as shown in Figure 43).

NASICON is one of the high Na+ ion conducting solid electrolytes as well as Na+226)¢ ¢ -alumina. The structure has a three-dimensional network where PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra are linked by

Sc/Lu ratio at the cathodic surface changed from 0.76 (before electrolysis) to 1.14 (after electrolysis) and from 0.48 to 0.40, respectively. These results clearly confirm that the predominant conducting species was Sc3+ at the range of x smaller than 0.5 and the charge carrier changes to Lu3+ at the higher x region. On the other hand, the conductivity of the Gd system drastically decreased at around x ) 0.7. This decrease occurs because of the structural change from Sc2(WO4)3to Eu2(WO4)3-type as suggested by Figure 35. To enhance the conductivity of Al2(WO4)3, the Al2(WO4)3-Sc2(WO4)3-Lu2(WO4)3 solid solutions were prepared.118 Figure 41 shows the electrical conductiv-

ity at 600 °C for the obtained solid solutions. Among the solutions investigated, the 0.1(Al2(WO4)3)-0.9((Sc0.5Lu0.5)2(WO4)3) solid solution shows the highest electrical conductivity of 8.71  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1 (log  243) ) -4.06), and the conductivity is approximately 25 times higher than that of pure Al2(WO4)3 (3.39  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1) (log  243) ) -5.47). The conducting trivalent species in the 0.1(Al2(WO4)3)-0.9((Sc0.5Lu0.5)2(WO4)3) solid solution was directly investigated by dc elec-

sharing an oxygen, which is well-known as one of the suitable structures for ion conduction. In 1994, Talbi et al.147 reported that Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (Ln ) rare earths) with the NASICON-type structure could be prepared by a sol-gel method. However, the Ln3+ cations contained in these materials are limited for some lanthanide atoms and ionic conducting characteristics were not investigated at all.

In 1999, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 with NASICON-type structure was prepared and the Sc3+ conducting behavior was investigated. For realizing the high trivalent cationic conduction, the A ratio () conducting ion size/lattice size) was introduced in order to develop a solid electrolyte with an appropriate conducting pathway size in the lattice. The A ratio in R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 monotonically decreases with decreasing Ln3+ radius, and only Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 shows a smaller A ratio compared to monovalent Li+ conducting LiTi2(PO4)3, which was reported to show the highest Li+ conductivity among Li+ conducting NASICON-type solid electrolytes. Since the electrostatic interaction between the mobile trivalent ion and surrounding oxide anions becomes stronger compared with the monovalent Li+ ion and oxide anions, the optimum A ratio for the trivalent ion conduction in the NASICON-type structure should be smaller than that for the monovalent Li+ ion conducting NASICON. Therefore, high conductivity is expected for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3. Figure 44 shows the A ratio dependencies of the electrical conductivity for R1/3Zr2(PO4)3, which were prepared

Adachi et al. by a sol-gel method, at 600 °C. As expected, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 possessed the smallest A ratio and showed the highest conductivity among R1/3Zr2(PO4)3. A further detailed investigation of the relationship between the A ratio and the conductivity was carried out by preparing other solid solutions whose A ratios were similar to that of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (the result is shown as the insert in Figure 44). From the measurements, both conductivities of 0.6Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)30.4Al1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and 0.8Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3-0.2In1/3Zr2(PO4)3 were lower than that of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, and the highest trivalent conductivity is achieved for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (demonstration of trivalent Sc3+ ion conduction in Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is described below) in trivalent cation conducting NASICON-type solid electrolytes.

The Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid was demonstrated to be a Sc3+ ion conductor by applying various experimental methods applied to the above-mentioned tungstate solid electrolytes. The ac conductivity maintained a constant value while the O2 partial pressure was varied, indicating that no electronic conduction appears. The polarization behaviors in both O2 and He atmospheres were similarly observed, and the transference number, tion, was estimated to be 0.95 from the  243)dc/ 243)ac ratio after 30 min. dc electrolysis was also performed in order to directly demonstrate which cation migrates in the solid. After dc electrolysis applying a dc voltage of 3V at 700 °C for 400 h, deposits were recognized at the cathodic surface. The deposits were identified by EPMA to be materials whose Sc/(Sc+Zr+P) ratio increased approximately 7.6 times as much as that in the bulk before electrolysis. These results explicitly indicate that Sc3+ ions were found to migrate to the cathodic side by the electrolysis and deposited on the cathodic surface, and the mobile cationic species in Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is identified to be Sc3+ ions. However, the conductivity (1.07  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C) of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared by a sol-gel method was low in comparison with that (3.74  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C) of Sc3+ conducting Sc2(WO4)3 tungstate since Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 obtained by a sol-gel method possessed a low crystallinity. In addition, the crystallization (ca. 800 °C) and the decomposition temperatures (ca. 950 °C) of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared by a sol-gel method are close, and improvement of the crystallinity seems to be difficult by a conventional sol-gel method. Furthermore, it is very difficult to prepare the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte by a conventional solid-state reaction because the energy for the solid-state reaction cannot be supplied enough at the temperature below the decomposition temperature of 950 °C. To enhance the crystallinity of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, the ball milling method was applied for the synthesis. The ball milling method can mix the starting powder with a strong force and make the powder form an amorphous phase by applying a high mechanical energy and is expected to be effective to obtain a high crystallization of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 series. The crystallinity of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 was greatly enhanced, and the Sc3+ ion conductivity increased up to 2.91  2) 10-5 S 226)cm-1 at 600 °C (g), as shown in Figure 44. The conductivity of Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared

Rare-earth (including lanthanoid) elements have been widely applied in the solid state ionics field. Generally by holding the trivalent state stable, the doping of rare earths (including lanthanoids) to improve the ion conducting characteristics has been the main direction of investigation. In this case, the rare-earth contribution is only as additives. One exception is lanthanum fluoride (LaF3), which is a main component of the solid electrolyte, and as the doping element, divalent europium cation is also added as additives to form a solid solution. Other representative exceptions are proton conducting cerates solid electrolyte based on perovskite-type and oxide anion conducting fluorite-type cerium dioxide. The perovskite-type structure is a very attractive framework which contributes not only in the field of Solid State Ionics but also as metallic, semiconducting materials and dielectrics, and the structure “perovskite” is an interdisciplinary framework in solid state chemistry. However, as described above, both oxide series contain Ce4+ ions in them, and due to the properties of their easy reduction nature, the application fields are very limited.
