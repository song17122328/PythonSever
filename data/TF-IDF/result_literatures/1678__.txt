The high-temperature enthalpy increments of the phosphates La1/3Zr2(PO4)3, Nd1/3Zr2(PO4)3, Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Lu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 have beenmeasured by high-temperature drop calorimetry in the temperature range 484.5–1090.7 K.
From these results the heat capacity of the studiedcompounds has been derived.
Among the various compounds that are considered forradioactive waste immobilization, the attention has beendrawn to the phosphates with a framework-type structure ofNaZr2(PO4)3, generally abbreviated asNZP.
The structureof this phosphate was first studied in 1968 .
A natural mineralKZr2(PO4)3, isostructural with the Na-analogue was discoveredin 1991 and named kosnarite .
A number of useful propertiesattributed to this structure make NZP-based phosphates alsoattractive for designing newcompositions for other applications:low thermal expansion materials, catalysts, ionic conductors,luminescent materials and some others.
The uniqueness of NZP compared to other waste forms is theability to include a large variety of cations in its structure, basedon the principles of isovalent and heterovalent isomorphism thatis possible for different cation positions of the structure.
This is an undeniable advantage with regard to complex wastecompositions.
Two types of crystallographically nonequivalentstructural positions are available for cation substitutions in theNZP structure .
These are framework positions of Zr andinterstitial positions of Na.
NZP-type phosphates containing f-elements (lanthanides) arereported in literature in several papers and these studiesindicate that lanthanide cations can occupy both framework andinterstitial positions of the structure.
However, they can onlyexist as framework forming cations in case their radius does notexceed ∼90 pm, e.g.from 86 pm (Lu3+) to 91pm (Dy3+).
Moreover,the concentration limit of their inclusion into frameworkpositions depends on the cationic size and rapidly decreaseswith radius increase.
Apparently, incorporation of americium(rAm3+ = 98 pm), plutonium (rPu3+ = 100 pm), other actinides(III) and lanthanides, nuclear fission products, in these positionswill be hampered.
Trivalent f-element cations of biggersize, the lanthanides Ce-Tb, enter interstitial positions, but alsothe lanthanides of smaller size Dy-Lu can be found in thisposition.
In this case the compounds with the general compositionLn1/3Zr2(PO4)3 are formed .
Detailed investigation ofthese compounds by IR spectroscopy carried out in showedthe reduction of symmetry, accompanied with the change ofspace group from R¯3c in AZr2(PO4)3 (A = alkali metals) to R¯3 inB1/2Zr2(PO4)3 (B = alkaline-earth metals and some d-elements)and to P¯3c in R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (R = rare earths).
In most papers published such rare earth element (REE)phosphates are considered as future ionic conductors, luminescentmaterials or thermo mechanically stable compounds.
Theirstudy is also very relevant to the immobilization of long-livedactinides to achieve their isolation from the biosphere over thelong time periods required for their storage and disposal, as thelanthanides can be used a proxy.
However, there are only a fewpapers available on this topic .
A number of questions stillremain open, among which that of their thermodynamic properties.
While thermodynamic properties of NZP phosphates with1- and 2-valent cations in the interframework positions of theNZP structure have been reported in several papers , dataon the phosphates with 3-valent cations, including lanthanides,were not found.
In this paper we report the high-temperature enthalpyincrement of the phosphates La1/3Zr2(PO4)3, Nd1/3Zr2(PO4)3,Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Lu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 measured using dropcalorimetry in the temperature range 485–1091 K.
From theresults the heat capacity of these compounds has been derived.
The precipitation method was used for the synthesis of the R1/3Zr2(PO4)3(R = La, Nd, Eu, Lu) compounds .
Weighed amounts of the rare earth oxidesR2O3 (99.99%) were dissolved in a diluted nitric acid solution and mixed witha stoichiometric amount of ZrOCl2 solution (92.136 g l−1 Zr4+).
Next, the stoichiometricamount of H3PO4 solution (8.5%) was added continuously to theobtained mixed solutions under constant stirring and heating.
The precipitatesthus obtained were subsequently dried and thermally treated at 400 ◦C (24 h),600 ◦C (24 h) and 800 ◦C (24 h) in air.
Each stage of heating was followedby careful grinding in an agate mortar.
The powders were pressed into pellets,repeatedly heated at 800 ◦Cfor 20 h and subsequently used for the measurements.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the samples for calorimetric measurementswere performed using a Seifert XRD3003HR diffractometer (Seifert& Co GmbH, Germany) in a range 15 < 2θ < 60, with a step of 0.02 and a counttime of 15 s/point, using CuK radiation.
They indicated the presence of hexagonalNZP phases with no additional peaks from impurities.
No significant changeswere found for the XRD patterns of the samples performed after the calorimetricmeasurements.
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TG)of the samples were performed using a Netzsch STA 449 C device, in aluminacrucibles, from room temperature up to 1400 ◦C.
The samples mass used for themeasurements varied from 33.33 mg to 51.14 mg.
Oxygen gas (70 ml min−1)was used as an atmosphere.
The heating rate was 10Kmin−1.
The drop-calorimetric measurements were performed with a Setaram HTCcalorimeter that was described in an earlier paper .
All the measurementswere performed in air.
Pieces of pure platinum (2mm diameter, massfraction purity 0.9995 Pt, Goodfellow Cambrige Ltd.) of typical masses(127.8–347.7) mg were used as a caloric standard.
The background subtractionevaluations and peak integration were made using the DSCEval software.
The DTA curves of all four R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 compounds arecharacterized by the presence of several exothermal effectsappearing between 850 and 1220 ◦C, which must be attributed toa decomposition process as is described in .
As an example,the DTA/TG curves for La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 are given in Fig.1. 
TheDTA/TG curves for the other studied compounds were similarexcept that peaks positions varied in a small range, conformingto specific temperatures of each compound.
The correspondingmass loss occurred from approximately 960 ◦C on.
This factgives evidence for the closeness of crystallization and decompositiontemperatures in the studied compounds.
Bearing thatin mind, the upper temperature limit for the thermodynamicmeasurements by high-temperature drop calorimetry has beenassigned to be 1090 K.
The enthalpy increment data of the R1/3Zr2(PO4)3 compoundsbeing studied are given in Table 1 and shown in Fig.2.
The values at each temperature correspond to an average of 3to 4 sample drops for each isothermal run.
After the first fitting, we estimated that C0p(298.15 K) should be around 380 JK−1 mol−1,and a consistent set of estimated values was derived, presentedin Table 2. Then the enthalpy data were fitted with the estimatedC0p(298.15 K) as constraint.
The corresponding a and bcoefficients for each compound are listed in Table 2.
As can be seen in Fig.3, the heat capacity curves showa regular behaviour which can be interpreted as follows.
La1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Lu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 represent the 4f0 and 4f14electronic configurations of the Ln3+ ions, and the heat capacityof these compounds are composed of a lattice component only.
Nd1/3Zr2(PO4)3 has a 4f3and Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 a 4f6electronconfiguration of the Nd3+ and Eu3+ cations, respectively, as aresult of which an electronic (excess) contribution is present.
The lattice heat capacity varies gradually within isostructuralseries, as our studies of a series of LnPO4 monazite compounds have shown.
Due to the excess heat capacity the curves ofNd1/3Zr2(PO4)3 and Eu1/3Zr2(PO4)3 cross the Lu1/3Zr2(PO4)3curve at about 900 K.
The same trend was observed for theLnPO4 series .
