LiCoO2 thin films were deposited on the NASICON-type glass ceramics, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12, by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and were annealed at different temperatures. The as-deposited and the annealed LiCoO2 thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the films exhibited a (1 0 4) preferred orientation after annealing and Co3O4 was observed by annealing over 500 ◦C due to the reaction between the LiCoO2 and the glass ceramics. The effect of annealing temperature on the interfacial resistance of glass ceramics/LiCoO2 and Li-ion transport in the bulk LiCoO2 thin film was investigated by galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry (CV), potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the Li/PEO/glass ceramics/LiCoO2 cell. The cell performance was limited by the Li-ion diffusion resistance in Ohara/LiCoO2 interface as well as in bulk LiCoO2.

In recent years, all-solid-state thin-film Li-ion batteries have received much interest due to their potential application in microdevices. A solid electrolyte with a high Li-ion conductivity is essential to fabricate practical all-solid-state Li-ion batteries. Recently, the NASICON-type Li-ion conducting electrolyte consisted of Li2O–Al2O3–SiO2–P2O5–TiO2 has received great attention because of its high Li-ion conductivity of 10−4 ∼ 10−3 S c m−1 at room temperature [1,2]. Birke et al. [3] successfully cycled the all-solid-state Li4Ti5O12/Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3/LiMn2O4 cell which exhibited a charge–discharge plateau at around 2.5 V. Inda et al. [4] also reported the all-solid-state Li4Ti5O12/composite electrolyte/LiCoO2 cell which showed good charge–discharge performance. The composite electrolyte was composed of NASICONtype glass ceramics and ployethyleneoxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolyte. In both cases, composite electrodes were used. Iriyama et al. [5] fabricated the all-solid-state thin-film Li-ion cell using the NASICON-type solid electrolyte and the pulsed laser deposited amorphous Li–Mn–O film cathode. Generally, it is necessary to anneal the thin film at high temperature in order to achieve good electrochemical performance of the batteries. Thus, the chemical stability of the electrode materials toward electrolyte is rather important. It was reported that some electrode materials, such as LiMn2O4 (up to 600 ◦C) [6], L i4Ti5O12 (up to 600 ◦C) [7], LiCoPO4 and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (up to 900–1000 ◦C) [8], showed chemical stability toward NASICON-type solid electrolyte. By contrast, Nakata and Nanno [8] observed obvious reaction between the electrolyte and LiCoO2 at 900–1000 ◦C. Therefore, it is important to clarify the reaction mechanism and its effect on the electrochemical performance of LiCoO2-based thin-film Li-ion batteries with the NASICON-type solid electrolyte. In our present work, LiCoO2 thin films were deposited on the NASICON-type solid electrolyte by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, and the interfacial stability at elevated temperature was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The interfacial resistance of solid electrolyte/LiCoO2 and the Li-ion diffusion in LiCoO2 were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) using the Li/PEO/glass ceramics/LiCoO2 cell.

The glass ceramics plates, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12, p r o vided by OHARA Inc. (0.15 mm in thickness) were used as the solid electrolyte for the following experiments. The glass ceramics is named Ohara in the following paragraphs. LiCoO2thin films (8 mm × 8 mm) were deposited on Ohara substrates (10 mm × 10 mm) by RF magnetron sputtering using a Ulvac SCOTTC3. The sputtering of LiCoO2 was carried out in pure Ar with a working pressure of 2 Pa and a sputtering power of 50 W. The thickness of the film was about 0.8 ?m for 2 h sputtering. The as-deposited LiCoO2 thin films were annealed at 300–700 ◦C for 30 min in air to improve crystallization. The crystal structure of the sputtered LiCoO2 thin film was characterized by XRD using a RINT2000/PC diffractometer with Cu K? radiation and by Raman spectroscopy using a RNANOD T64000M1. The cross-section morphology of the films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4000. The Li/PEO18–Li(CF3SO2)2N/Ohara/LiCoO2 cells were fabricated to investigate the interfacial resistance of Ohara/LiCoO2 and Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient in LiCoO2. Au was sputtered on the surface of LiCoO2 thin film as the current collection. To prevent the reaction between Li and Ohara, the PEO based solid polymer film (PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N, abbreviated as PEO) was inserted between them. The polymer electrolyte was prepared using our previously reported method [9]. The electrochemical performance of the all-solid-state cells was characterized by galvanostatic cycling at 10 ?A between 3 and 4.3 V and cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scanning rate 0.2 mV s−1. Li-ion transfer resistance through Ohara/LiCoO2 interface was measured by EIS. Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient in LiCoO2 bulk was measured by PITT and EIS. The detailed measurement method was described elsewhere [10,1 1]. All the above electrochemical measurements were performed at 50 ◦C. To see the interfacial resistances of Li/PEO, PEO/Ohara, and Ohara/LiCoO2 in the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cell, symmetric cells Li/PEO/Li, Au/PEO/Au, Au/Ohara/Au, Li/PEO/Ohara/PEO/Li and Au/LiCoO2/Ohara/LiCoO2/Au were fabricated and characterized by EIS in at 5–80 ◦C. The EIS measurements were carried out by applying an AC signal of 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface combined with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of LiCoO2 thin films sputtered on Ohara annealed at various temperatures. It can be seen that the asprepared LiCoO2 thin film is not well crystallized evidenced by a broad peak located 45◦. Note that, with increasing annealing temperatures, the broad peak become sharp with its position shifted to a high angle. It is clear that LiCoO2 thin films on Ohara crystal Fig. 2. Raman spectra of LiCoO2 thin films on Ohara annealed at different temperatures. lized with a (1 0 4) preferred orientation. Similar orientation was also observed for the 1.35 ?m thick LiCoO2 thin film on Au substrate in our previous work [10]. The (1 0 4) preferred orientation is favorable for the rapid Li-ion diffusion through the LiCoO2 lattice, because the Li layers lie parallel to the direction of the diffusion for this orientation. When the film was annealed at 600 ◦C for 30 min, a small peak appears at around 31◦, which suggests reaction between LiCoO2 and Ohara. The intensity of the additional peak increases with increasing annealing temperature. The XRD pattern suggests the presence of Co3O4. Raman spectra of the LiCoO2 thin films on Ohara annealed at various temperatures gave clearer results for the reaction between LiCoO2 and Ohara as shown in Fig. 2. Tow peaks located at around 490 and 600 cm−1 correspond to O–Co–O bending mode (Eg) and Co–O stretching mode (A1g), respectively, which are typical of the high temperature hexagonal LiCoO2 phase. The peaks at around 520 and 700 cm−1 are attributed to Co3O4 [12–14]. Note that, Co3O4 is formed at 500 ◦C and the formation of Co3O4 becomes significant at 600 ◦C. Fig. 3 shows the cross-sectional SEM images of LiCoO2 thin films sputtered on Ohara substrates. The thickness of the film is about 0.8 ?m. According to the weight gain of the sputtered film and the observed thickness, the compactness of the film is estimated to be about 90%. Note that the film is homogeneous and crack free and it becomes compact after annealing at 400 ◦C. The cell performance of the all-solid-state lithium secondary cell with Ohara electrolyte, Li anode, and LiCoO2 cathode was examined. The NASICON-type glass ceramics is chemically unstable with the direct contact with Li metal. Therefore, the PEO based electrolyte, PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N, was used as the interface protecting layer between Li and Ohara. The ion conductivity of PEO is too low to pass a high current at room temperature. Therefore, the electrochemical performance was obtained at 50 ◦C. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots of freshly assembled Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cells at 50 ◦C. The cell resistance depends on the annealing temperature as seen in Fig. 4. The impedance profiles show two semicircles in a high and medium-frequency range followed by a sloping line in a low-frequency range. The diameter of medium-frequency semicircle increases with increasing annealing temperature. It means that this semicircle corresponds to the Ohara/LiCoO2 interface. The high interfacial resistance for the 500 ◦C annealed Ohara/LiCoO2 could be explained by the formation of Co3O4. The diameter of the high-frequency semicircle shows no dependence on the annealing temperature.

Fig. 5 shows the charge and discharge curves of the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cells at 50 ◦C as a function of the annealing temperature of Ohara/LiCoO2. The as-deposited LiCoO2 shows a high capacity of 180 mAh g−1, corresponding to an extraction of 0.64 Li from LiCoO2, which is a little higher than that observed for the LiCoO2 cathode with liquid electrolytes. The high capacity may be due to a low estimation of the LiCoO2 mass or a high charge potential. The capacity of the cell decreases by annealing the Ohara/LiCoO2 couple. It could be explained by the increasing cell resistance as shown in Fig. 4.

As observed above, the Li/PEO interfacial resistance, and PEO and Ohara bulk resistance are not so high compared with the PEO/Ohara interfacial resistance at 50 ◦C. The interfacial resistance has been more precisely studied. Fig. 10 shows typical Nyquist plots of the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cell at various electrode potentials, where Ohara/LiCoO2 was annealed at 400 ◦C for 30 min. The Nyquist plot is composed of a small semicircle in a high-frequency range, a large semicircle in a medium-frequency range and a sloping line in the low-frequency range. The high-frequency small semicircle, as clearly shown in the inset of Fig. 10, is attributed to the PEO/Ohara interfacial resistance. The diameter of the small semicircle shows a slight change with the increasing electrode potential. The large semicircle may correspond to the Li-ion transfer through Ohara/LiCoO2 interface, which is on the increase with the increasing electrode potential. Fig. 1 1 compares the impedance spectra between the full cell Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2/Au at open circuit voltage and the symmetric cell Au/LiCoO2/Ohara/LiCoO2/Au at 50 ◦C. The results prove that the low-frequency semicircle in Fig. 10 is due to the Li-ion diffusion in the Ohara/LiCoO2 interface. Fig. 12 shows the potential dependence of Li-ion transfer resistance, Rct, through Ohara/LiCoO2 interface at 50 ◦C. Note that the Li-ion transfer resistance increases with increasing annealing temperature of the Ohara/LiCoO2 couple, especially that annealed at 500 ◦C. The increase of interfacial resistance is ascribed to the formation of the Co3O4 layer at elevated annealing temperature. The interfacial resistance of the Ohara/LiCoO2 annealed at 300 ◦C and the as-deposited one show small change with the electrode potential, while it shows a gradual rise for the sample annealed at 400 ◦C and a sharp rise for the sample annealed at 500 ◦C, indicating that it becomes more difficult for Li-ion to transfer through the Ohara/LiCoO2 interface containing Co3O4 a t a l o w L i content in Li1−xCoO2. The interfacial resistance of Ohara/LiCoO2 annealed at 400 ◦C is comparable with those of Ohara/LiMn2O4 and Ohara/Li4Ti5O12 annealed at 600 ◦C [6,7]. In addition to the Ohara/LiCoO2 interface, the Li-ion diffusion in LiCoO2 bulk also plays an important role in the electrochemical performance of the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cell. Therefore, Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient of Li1−xCoO2 sputtered on Ohara, ˜DLi, was measured using PITT and EIS methods proposed by Huggins et al. [15,16]. The details for the measurement were described in [1 1]. In this study, the lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte,Ohara, was used instead of the liquid electrolytes. Fig. 13 shows the potential dependence of Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient in Li1−xCoO2 thin film annealed at different temperatures measured by PITT. Note that the ˜DLi values for the as-sputtered and 300 ◦C annealed Li1−xCoO2 show no clear dependence on the electrode potential in amorphous Li1−xCoO2 lattice. The films annealed at higher temperatures show clearer dependence of ˜DLi on the electrode potential as observed in the Li1−xCoO2 film on Au annealed at 700 ◦C [1 1]. As shown in Fig. 13, a maximum of ˜DLi value is observed. The maximum is associated with the order/disorder transition near the composition Li0.5CoO2, where the degree of Li vacancy ordering is increased [17]. It is interesting to note that the potential, at which the maximum ˜DLi value occurs, shifts to a large x value (high potential) in Li1−xCoO2 with increasing annealing temperature. It was reported that for the well-crystallized LiCoO2 thin films, the maximum of ˜DLi value appears at around 4. 15 V (or x = 0.5 in Li1−xCoO2) [17–19], which is close to our 500 ◦C annealed sample. The ˜DLi values of the poorly crystallized LiCoO2 thin films (as-deposited, annealed at 300 and 400 ◦C) range from 2.5 × 10−12 to 5 × 10−13 cm2 s−1. The film annealed at 500 ◦C shows ˜DLi values of 2 to 6.3 × 10−13 cm2 s−1, which are one order smaller than those reported by us previously [1 1] and two orders smaller than those reported by Xia and Lu [19], which were measured with liquid electrolytes for (1 0 4) oriented films by PITT. These high diffusion coefficients may be due to the fact that the penetration of liquid electrolyte into electrode may facilitate the Li-ion diffusion. Li-ion diffusion in Li1−xCoO2 bulk may also be limited by the inert Co3O4 layer. The chemical diffusion coefficient was also measured by EIS. Fig. 14 gives a typical Nyquist plot at 4.05 V for the Li/PEO/Ohara/asdeposited LiCoO2 cell. The plot was fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset. The calculation method of ˜DLi values using EIS can refer to [1 1]. Fig. 15 shows the potential dependence of Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient of Li1−xCoO2 using EIS. The ˜DLi values of the poorly crystallized LiCoO2 thin films range from 1 × 10−12 to 1 × 10−11 cm2 s−1, which are comparable with that by Wang et al. [20] for the amorphous LiCoO2 measured with Lipon electrolyte using EIS. We cannot obtain the ˜DLi values using EIS for the LiCoO2 thin film annealed at 500 ◦C due to the poorly developed impedance spectra in the low-frequency Warburg region. Wang et al. [20] observed a rise of ˜DLi value by two orders of magnitude when the LiCoO2 thin film transforms from an amorphous to the well crystalline state measured by EIS using Lipon as an electrolyte. For the as-deposited and 300 ◦C annealed LiCoO2 thin film, the Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients in these films are in a range of 10−11 to 10−12 cm2 s−1 at 50 ◦C. The total cell resistance of the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cell was about 500 ? cm2, therefore, the IR drop at 1 mA cm−2 was about 0.5 V. With the increasing annealing temperature, the IR drop will become significant and the cell cannot tolerate large current density. The limiting current density, Il, controlled by the Li-ion chemical diffusion in LiCoO2 could be estimated from the following equation: ˜DLi = IlL FC , (1) where L is the thickness of LiCoO2, F the faraday constant and C the Li-ion concentration in LiCoO2. The liming current density for the as-deposited and 300 ◦C LiCoO2 thin films of 0.8 ?m thickness is about 6 × 10−1 mA cm−2 for ˜DLi = 10−11 cm2 s−1 and 6 × 10−2 mA cm−2 for ˜DLi = 10−12 cm2 s−1. From above analyses, it seems that the cell performance was limited by the Li-ion diffusion resistance in Ohara/LiCoO2 interface as well as in bulk LiCoO2.

LiCoO2 thin films deposited on Ohara by RF magnetron sputtering exhibited a (1 0 4) preferred orientation. Interfacial reaction between LiCoO2 and Ohara occurs at 500 ◦C to form Co3O4. The interfacial resistance of Ohara/LiCoO2 and the Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient in Li1−xCoO2 were evaluated using the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cells. It was found that the formation of Co3O4 layer hinders the Li-ion transfer in a voltage range 3–4.3 V. The Co3O4 layer not only blocks the Li-ion diffusion through Ohara/LiCoO2 interface, but also limits the Li-ion transfer within the LiCoO2 bulk. The interfacial resistance of Ohara/LiCoO2 was below 2000 ? cm2 when it was annealed below 400 ◦C. By annealing at 500 ◦C it increased to over 8000 ? cm2. Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficient in the LiCoO2 bulk ranges from 2.5 × 10−12 to 5 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 by PITT and from 1 × 10−11 to 1 × 10−12 cm2 s−1 by EIS when annealed below 400 ◦C. The LiCoO2 film annealed at 500 ◦C shows low ˜DLi values. The ˜DLi values by EIS showed similar dependence on annealing temperature with those by PITT. The Liion diffusion resistance through Ohara/LiCoO2 interface as well as LiCoO2 bulk is the limiting factors in determining the electrochemical performance of the Li/PEO/Ohara/LiCoO2 cell.
