Li ion batteries have been widely used in almost all types of electronic products and more recently in electronic vehicles. The current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries consist of cathode and anode electrode separated by a thin membrane with organic liquid electrolyte. Many types of structures of cathode materials are used, such as LiCoO2, LiMnxNiyCo(1-x-y)O2,1 LiMn2O4,2 LiFePO4,3–5 but only graphite is commercially used as the anode material although a lot of other types of anode are being studied. One of most noticeable anodes is lithium titanate.6,7 Although LiFePO4 is commonly recognized to be the safest cathode, possible growth dendrite and other defects from copper and aluminium substrates may cause short circuits. Therefore the only way to design hazard free Li ion rechargeable batteries is completely replace currently used polymer separator and organic electrolyte by inﬂammable ionic conductor. ion rechargeable batteries with inorganic ceramics as the solid electrolytes have attracted growing interests in recent years since the solid electrolytes possess many advantages including high safety, high reliability, and wide potential windows. To fabricate all solid state batteries, solid electrolytes with high Li ionic conductivities, wide potential window and high stability with both the cathode and anode materials are essential. Several kinds of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and good electrochemical ability have been studied, such as LiPON, sulphide glass, Li1zxMxTi2-x(PO4)3, Li-V-Si-O and Li-La-Ti-O et al.8–14 Some of these electrolytes show low stability when contacted with cathodes or anodes, and some of them are moisture sensitive.15

NASICON structured Li1?5Al0?5Ge1?5(PO4)3 (LAGP) has been reported to have a conductivity as high as 1023–y1025 S cm21 with an electrochemical potential window of about 6 V. It is also known that LAGP is electrochemically stable when contacted with Li metal. Therefore LAGP is a promising solid state electrolyte for all solid state Li batteries.16–22 However, only little research has been reported using LAGP as the electrolyte for the Li metal batteries.

In the present study, all solid state Li batteries using LiMn2O4 as a cathode, LAGP as an electrolyte and Li metal as an anode are fabricated. Electrochemical properties of the all solid state batteries are investigated. The results show that LAGP can be a good electrolyte for the all solid state Li batteries.

LAGP was synthesised through a typical solid state method as reported before.16,20,21 In a typical process, Li2CO3 (99%), GeO2 (99%), Al2O3 (99%) and NH4H2PO4 (98%) of analytical grade (all from Aldrich, USA) in a stoichiometric ratio were thoroughly mixed by ball milling for 48 h and then heated in a platinum crucible at 700uC for 2 h to release the volatile compounds. The powder was reground and ball milled again for another 24 h, after which the powder was heated to 1350uC with a heating rate of 1uC min21 and homogenised at 1350uC for 1 h. The melted LAGP was quickly cooled to 500uC and held for 2 h at 500uC, followed by cooling down to room temperature. The as synthesised LAGP was then crystallized at 850uC for 10 h. Finally the sintered LAGP was shaped to pellets of 8 mm diameter and 1 mm in thickness.

The structures of the as synthesised LAGP pellets were measured using Shimadzu XRD-6000 X-ray diffraction with Cu Ka radiation (l51?5406 A˚ ), at a scan rate of 2 deg/min. Surface morphologies of the LAGP

compacted together without appearance of porosity and cracks and no clear crystalline grain can be observed. This type of morphology was observed before.16

To measure the conductivity of the as-prepared LAGP, AC impedance measurement was performed using a Pt/LAGP/Pt impedance spectrum of the LAGP electrolyte pellet is shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum is composed of only one semicircle in the high frequency range and a straight line in the low frequency range, which is well known due to the bulk resistance and the Warburg resistance. No second semicircle due to the grain boundary resistance is observed, indicating extremely low grain boundary resistance of the LAGP electrolyte. It is known that the LAGP will form a glass-ceramic structure during fast cooling.16,20 The lower grain boundary resistance will greatly facilitate the Li ions transportation during the charge and discharge processes. The total ionic conductivity can be calculated from

where Rtot is the total resistance which is equal to sum of bulk resistance, Rb and grain boundary resistance, Rgb of the samples, L is the thickness of the electrolyte pellet, S is the cross sectional area of the electrolyte. The Rtot can be obtained from the right intercept of the semicircle with the real axis ray. If Rtot is taken to be 2700 V, S is 50 mm2, and L is 1 mm, the total conductivity, s is 761025 S cm21 which is a little lower than the best

pellets before and after coating LiMn2O4 were characterized with a Hitachi S-4100 ﬁeld emission scanning (FE-SEM) electron microscopy.

Ionic conductivity was measured using AC impedance (Solartron1287 electrochemical interface combined with a Solartron1260 frequency response analyser) in the frequency range between 1021 and 106 Hz based on Chowdari et al.11 To study the ionic conductivity of the LAGP electrolyte, the LAGP powder was pressed into a pellet of 1mm thickness and 50 mm2 area at 10 MPa, and the pellets were then sintered at 850uC for 10 h. Pt was coated on both sides of the LAGP electrolyte pellet, followed by heating the Pt coated specimens to 400uC for half an hour. The Pt coated pellets in the form as Pt/ LAGP/Pt were assembled into a cell using stainless steel (SS) as a current collector to test the AC impedance.

All solid state battery was prepared by deposition of a 300 nm thick LiMn2O4 layer on the LAGP pellet by radio frequency (rf) magnetron sputtering at 600uC. The sputtering was carried out in an Ar/O2 (9 : 1) atmosphere at a working pressure of 1?4 Pa and a sputtering power of 100 W. A Pt ﬁlm was sputtered on the LiMn2O4 surface as a positive current collector.

A Li metal foil was directly pressed onto the LAGP pellet, forming a LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li all solid state cell in the glove box. The battery performance of the Li/ LAGP/LiMn2O4 cells was characterised by galvanostatic cycling between 2 and 4?5 V and cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scanning rate of 0?1 mV s21 with a Solartron 1287 and 1256 two-terminal cell test system with a Lab-made cell.

Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of as prepared LAGP. Although 25% percentage of Ge4z ion is replaced by Al3z ion, the XRD diffraction can be indexed as pure NASICON structure LiGe2(PO4)3 (JCPDS41-0034) radii of Ge4z (0?053 nm) and Al3z since (0?050 nm) are similar, which is similar with those reported before.16–21 Sharp diffraction peaks of the NASICON structure indicate a good crystallinity after crystallization at 850uC. The scanning electron micrographs of the as synthesised pellet are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the as synthesised LAGP was well

Figure 4 shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) spectrum of the solid electrolyte (Pt/LAGP/Li) measured at room temperature with a scan rate of 0?1 mV s21 in the voltage range from 20?4 to 6 V. Figure 4 reveals that the Li metal can reversibly be deposited and dissolved between 20?4 and 0?6 V. No other reactions are observed even at 6 V, indicating that LAGP can work at least up to 6 V potential while for most of cathode materials the highest potential is only up to 5 V. The result is also consistent with previous reports.16,17 The high ionic conductivity and high potential window make the LAGP be a promising electrolyte for the all solid state Li batteries.

the LiMn2O4 layer deposited on the LAGP pellet. The cathode ﬁlm appears smooth, dense, and free of cracks and pin holes. The grain diameter is about 40 nm. The insert in Fig. 5 shows the LAGP pellets before (white) and after (black) deposition of the cathode, showing that the LAGP electrolyte is fully covered by black LiMn2O4. As shown in Fig. 6, a pure LAGP phase (Fig. 6a) can be seen before LiMn2O4 deposition. After deposition a new diffraction peak at 2h 518?6uC appears and the diffraction can be indexed to be the spinel LiMn2O4 (111) diffraction.23 The week LiMn2O4 diffraction peak

is due to thin LiMn2O4 ﬁlm character. There is no distinguished change in the diffraction from the LAGP pellet, implying that the LAGP structure is stable and no reaction with LiMn2O4 at the present deposition conditions. To test

the LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li cell, CV measurement was carried out between 2 and 4?5 V. Figure 7 shows a typical CV curve of the LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li cell at a scan rate of 0?1 mV s21. From Fig. 7, two separated pairs of peaks can clearly be seen, which are resulted from the typical lithium intercalation and de-intercalation feature of LiMn2O4. The slightly large separated distance between anodic and catholic peaks is mainly due to large polarization caused by the relatively lower conductivity of the LAGP compared with the liquid electrolytes as well as low conductivity of the cathode material since there is no conductive additive is used as the traditional bulk Li ion rechargeable batteries. It is also noted that the pairs of anodic and cathodic peaks are week and broad which are resulted from large polarization. Figure 8 gives the 150 typical charge/discharge curves of the LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li cell at a constant current of

25 mA g21 in a potential range from 2 to 4?5 V due to the fact that polarization was very high resulting in large drop in discharge voltage and increase in charge voltage. The voltage proﬁles show an expected potential plateau for LiMn2O4 with the ﬁrst charge capacity of 80 mAh g21 which is due to the well known lithium intercalation and de-intercalation reaction of LiMn2O4.23–25 The subsequent cycles show a similar shape with an increased capacity as well as coulombic efﬁciency. We ascribe the increased capacity to be caused by activation and reduction in impedance between the electrode layers and electrolyte. When a Li metal foil is pressed directly onto the electrolyte, interface impedance is high due to the formation of solid interface ﬁlm (such as Li2O).25,26 In addition, the Li metal foil is also unable to fully contact with the electrolyte. With cycling, the impedance layer may be broken and the contact area between the Li metal and the electrolyte may also increase. After 150 charge/ discharge cycles, the capacity increases from 80 to 115 mAh g21, which is also reported in other papers.24 The charge/discharge spectra of the LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li full cell are almost similar during cycling demonstrating that the LiMn2O4 /LAGP/Li cell has a good cyclability. The reason for the high capacity retention in the current study may be contributed reduced Mn2z disslovation when the solid electrolyte is used.27,28

NASICON structured LAGP was prepared and tested as the electrolyte for all solid state lithium batteries. The results show that LAGP has a 6 V potential window and an ionic conductivity of 7?561025 S cm21. For the ﬁrst time, a LiMn2O4/LAGP/Li cell was constructed and tested. The cell showed an 80 mAh g21 ﬁrst charge capacity and 115 mAh g21 after 150 cycles, suggesting that LAGP can be used as a promising electrolyte for high performance lithium metal rechargeable batteries and an electrolyte for test high potential cathode materials.
