Sodium-ion batteries (NIBs) are attracting considerable interestas a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) forportable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale grid, dueto the abundant resource and low cost of sodium.

Moreover,sodium (Na) and lithium (Li) share close similarity in manychemical properties, which has advanced rapid developmentof NIB technologies.

Thus early research on NIB electrodematerials was inspired by structures and composition thathad proved to operate well for Li intercalation/de-intercalation.

 For the cathode side, many oxides (e.g., Na x CoO 2 ,[ 2 ]Na x MnO 2 ,[ 3 ] Na x VO 2 ,[ 4 ] and Na x CrO 2[ 5 ] ) and polyanion-based(e.g., NaFePO 4 ,[ 6 ] Na 2 FePO 4 F, [ 7 ] NaVOPO 4 ,[ 8 ] and Na 2 MnP 2 O 7[ 9 ] )compounds were studied.

Compared to oxides, polyanionbased cathodes exhibit stable 3D host frameworks due to strongcovalent bonding of oxygen atom in the polyanion polyhedra,resulting in their better thermal stability and safety and longercycle life.

 Within the family of polyanion compounds, Nasuper-ionic conductor (NASICON)-type Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 (NVP) isof particular interest.

The crystal structure of NVP, as revealed by experimentaland theoretical studies, [ 12 ] is composed of [VO 6 ] octahedra and[PO 4 ] tetrahedra interlinked via common apical oxygens toform [V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ] “lantern” units; Na ions occupy Na1 (M1, sixfold coordination) and Na2 (M2, eightfold coordination) sites( Figure 1 a, upper right corner).

This NASICON-type framework provides 3D open diffusion pathways for Na + transport,resulting in rapid Na + diffusivities exceeding 10 −11 cm 2s −1,[ 13 ]which are many orders of magnitude larger than that for manyother NIB cathodes (e.g., around 10 −14 cm 2s −1for NaMn 3 O 5[ 14 ]and ≈10 −17 cm 2s −1 for NaFePO 4[ 6 ] ).

More importantly, with thehelp of the connected interstices, Na ions can be extracted/intercalated reversibly from/into NVP structure over a widerange of Na compositions (up to two Na per unit formula ofNVP) at high potential of 3.4 V versus Na + /Na, giving rise to animpressive theoretical capacity of 118 mA h g −1 (energy densityas high as 401 W h kg −1).

Inspired by these approaches,improved performance has been achieved for NVP cathodes,such as delivering 104 (0.5 C) and 95 mA h g −1(5 C) for NVP@Ccore-shell nanocomposites, [ 17 ] 118 (0.5 C) and 100 mA h g −1(5 C) for NVP/acetylene carbon, [ 11a ] and 114 (1 C), 91 (20 C),and 61 mA h g −1(40 C) for porous NVP/C.
 Despite thesesuccesses, the realization of advanced NVP cathode combiningsupercapacitor-like rate performance (e.g., less than 60 s to fullcharge/discharge) and battery-like capacity (e.g., keeping >60%of theoretical capacity) to meet PHEV and EV applications isdiffi cult to achieve.

It is because the traditional technologyfor the preparation of carbon-coated NVP is mainly based onthe thermal decomposition of ball-milled carbon-containingprecursors, [ 18b ] which often produces micrometer-sized NVPparticles with insuffi cient carbon coating, leading to a largepolarization of the electrode since this structure is not benefi -cial for electron transfer (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

Moreover, these traditional NVP architectures have small electrolyte-accessible surface areas, slowing Na ion mass transportin the whole electrode.

Herein, to create effi cient charge transfer, we propose a3D hierarchical meso- and macroporous NVP-based hybridcathode concept with connected Na ion/electron pathways forultrafast charge and discharge NIBs, schematically illustratedin Figure 1 a, consisting of NVP nanocrystals coated with amorphous carbon and then wrapped by reduced graphene oxidenanosheets (abbreviated as NVP@C@rGO).

thesmall nanograins shorten the lengths of solid-state Na ion diffusion; ii) the macro/mesopore network enables rapid iontransport and buffers the strain during repeated Na + extraction/insertion to maintain the structural integrity; iii) highly conductive amorphous coating carbon and rGO nanosheets facilitatfast electron transfer within the electrode and to the currentcollector.

The designed NVP@C@rGO cathode is shown toachieve excellent rate capability (86 mA h g −1 at 100 C) and outstanding cycling stability (64% retention after 10 000 cycles at100 C), indicating its superiority in practical applications.

The NVP@C@rGO nanocomposite was synthesized by afeasible freeze-drying-assisted method as outlined in Figure 1 b.

Briefl y, the aqueous NVP precursor solution was mixed thoroughly with a neutral polymer poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) andgraphene oxide (GO) nanosheets at the atomic level.

Then themixture was freeze-dried, and further heat treated at 750 °C inAr/H 2 atmosphere to obtain NVP@C@rGO.

In this case, PVPwas employed as not only a chelating agent, but also a carbonsource to generate a nanoporous carbon matrix for hosting thecrystallized NVP nanoparticles (NPs).

Moreover, the carbonmatrix combined with GO nanosheets effectively inhibited thegrowth of primary NVP grains during the high-temperaturesintering process.
