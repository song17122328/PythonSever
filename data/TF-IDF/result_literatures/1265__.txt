The chemical stability and conductivity of nasicon-structured a-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 make it a possible candidate for a cathode material in Li-battery. The x-ray diffraction pattern of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 showed the monoclinic structure with space group of P21/n. In the zero-Ô¨Åeld-cooled (ZFC) curve, the magnetization remained constant while the temperature was increased up to the splitting temperature (TS¬º 11 K) of two sub-lattices, indicating the antiferromagnetic behavior below TS. Magnetization curves of both ZFC and FC from 4.2 to 295 K showed ferrimagnetic behavior below the Neel temperature (TN¬º 29.5 K). We observed the change in the slope of the temperature-dependent Hhf curve at TS. These results suggest that the change in the spin ordering in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is originated from the difference in hyperÔ¨Åne interactions between the localized Fe3√æ magnetic ions at each of two sub-lattices. The spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 under applied magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 5 T exhibit the magnetic phase transition around TS, indicating antiferromagnetic behavior below TS and ferrimagnetic behavior between TS and TN.

The crystal structure of synthesized Li3Fe2(PO4)3 sample was characterized by XRD with Cu-Ka radiation (k¬º 1.5406 AÀö ). Temperature dependence of zero-Ô¨Åeldcooled (ZFC) and Ô¨Åeld-cooled (FC) curves was obtained by VSM under 100 Oe from 4.2 to 295 K. Also, the M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra were recorded with 57Co source in rhodium matrix under applied magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 5 T, parallel to c-ray direction inside of a superconductor cryostat.

The XRD pattern of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was analyzed with Rietveld reÔ¨Ånement method using FULLPROF program, as shown Fig. 1. The crystal structure of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was determined to be monoclinic (space group: P21/n). The lattice constants and unit cell volumes (V) are a0¬º 8.570 AÀö ,

Lithium ion battery is highly attractive as a secondary energy storage system. Many of the experimental works have been focused on Ô¨Ånding the suitable cathode materials such as LiFePO4, LiCoO2, Li2FePO4F, and LiFeSO4F for lithium ion battery application.1‚Äì5 These materials are required to have the necessary electrochemical properties such as structure stability, high ionic conductivity, large capacity, and long cycle life. The nasicon-structured Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is highly possible as a cathode material due to its high ionic conductivity and structural stability as well as with simple fabrication procedure.6

The understanding of its magnetic properties is very important since its magnetic properties are strongly related to its electrochemical properties. So far, many of research efforts have been only focused on the electrochemical aspects of Li3Fe2(PO4)3.7‚Äì9

In this study, we have investigated the crystal structure and magnetic properties of the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 using x-ray diffractometer (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectrometer, to explore the magnetic characteristics of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, which are essential for the lithium ion battery application.

The Li3Fe2(PO4)3 was prepared by solid state reaction (99.999%), and method. Li2CO3 FeC2O42H2O (99%) were used as starting materials, mixed with appropriate stoichiometric ratio, and then ground in an agate mortar. The mixtures were calcined at 300 C for 4 h under Ar and pressed into a pellet form under 5000 N/m2.

b0¬º 12.014 AÀö , c0¬º 8.616 AÀö , c¬º 90.511, and V¬º 887.116 AÀö 3, respectively. The Fe ions are expected to locate at two crystallographic positions.10,11 Therefore, we have considered that Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has two different sub-lattices of [1,1,1] and [2,2,2] in asymmetric FeO6 octahedral sites.

Figure 2 shows the temperature-dependent ZFC and FC magnetization curves of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 from 4.2 to 295 K with an applied Ô¨Åeld of 100 Oe. The ZFC curve remains constant up to the splitting temperature of sub-lattices (TS¬º 11 K) with increasing temperature. Below the Neel temperature (TN¬º 29.5 K),12 the ZFC and FC curves show the ferrimagnetic behaviors.

In order to investigate the hyperÔ¨Åne interaction between two sub-lattices of Fe3√æ ions in each FeO6 sites, M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 were obtained at various temperatures from 4.2 to 295 K, as shown Fig. 3. The isomer shift (d) values of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 are between 0.32 and 0.46 mm/s at all temperatures range, indicating ferric (Fe3√æ ) state relative to Fe metal.13 Above TN, the M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra show two doublets due to the disappearance of magnetic ordering between Fe ions. The M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra below TS were analyzed by a set of six-line with the resulting values of Hhf¬º 558 kOe, DEQ¬º 0.24 mm/s, and d¬º 0.44 mm/s at 4.2 K. However, the M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra above TS split into two sextets. The corresponding values of Hhf in each sextet

TABLE I. M‚Ç¨ossbauer parameters of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 under 0 and 5 T at various temperatures: magnetic hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åeld (Hhf), electric quadrupole splitting (DEQ), isomer shift (d), and the area ratio of A2,5/A1,6.

at TS¬º 11 K are Hhf,B1¬º 535.78 and Hhf,B2¬º 526.35 kOe, respectively. The observed set of six-line indicates that each Fe ion is arranged with antiparallel spin direction and has almost identical magnetic ordering below TS. However, the splitting of the spectrum above TS can be explained as Fe ions in each sub-lattice having the different hyperÔ¨Åne interaction, leading to the ferrimagnetic structure.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åeld (Hhf) curves of Li3Fe2(PO4)3. The Hhf values decrease with increasing temperature. We have also observed the change in the slope of the temperature-dependent Hhf curves at TS, indicating the change in superexchange interaction with the spin-reorientation of each FeO6 octahedral by the strong crystalline Ô¨Åeld.14 These results suggest that the change in the spin ordering in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is originated from the different hyperÔ¨Åne interactions between localized magnetic Fe3√æ ions at each of two sub-lattices, which induces the magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic.

The M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra under applied magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 5 T are shown in Fig. 5 and the resulting M‚Ç¨ossbauer parameters at zero Ô¨Åeld and 5 T are listed in Table I. We observed that the ratio (A2,5/A1,6) of second and Ô¨Åfth area to Ô¨Årst and sixth area is constant under zero external Ô¨Åeld. However, there was an apparent change in A2,5/A1,6 under the applied Ô¨Åeld of 5 T. We also observed magnetic phase transition at TS¬º 11 K. Below TS, the second and Ô¨Åfth of the six absorption areas (A2,5) are larger than those of the Ô¨Årst and sixth of the six absorption areas (A1,6). However, the ratio of A2,5/A1,6 decreases with increasing temperature above TS. We expect that Li3Fe2(PO4)3, antiferromagnetic below TS, becomes ferrimagnetic because Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe1-Fe2 below TS, while above TS this coupling is weakened. This is due the fact that above TS the change in spin orientation of Fe1 and Fe2 with increasing temperature enhances ferrimagnetic coupling under magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 5 T.

In summary, the nasicon structured Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has been studied with XRD, VSM, and M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectrometer. We found that Li3Fe2(PO4)3 has two different sub-lattices of

Fe3√æ with the different spin ordering and superexchange interaction. In the ZFC magnetization curves, the magnetization was constant below TS¬º 11 K, indicating the magnetic phase transition from antiferromagnetism to ferrimagnetism. Also, we have observed that M‚Ç¨ossbauer spectra above TS split into two sub-lattice sextets with the sudden change in the slope of hyperÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åeld curve due to the magnetic phase transition, due to different thermal agitation and spin orientation in each Fe3√æ

Under applied magnetic Ô¨Åeld of 5 T, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows the magnetic phase transition of antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic around TS.
