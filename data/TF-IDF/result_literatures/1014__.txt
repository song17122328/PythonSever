Two isostructural iron molybdates NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M=Ni, Zn) have been prepared as single crystals by flux method and as powder by soft combustion synthesis technique. Both compounds crystallize in triclinic system with the space group P 1, Z= 2 and similar parameters : a = 6.812(1) Å, b=6.828(1) Å, c=11.567(3) Å, α=76.31(1)°, β=77.05(1)° and γ=87.44(2)° for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and a= 6.820(1) Å, b=6.872(1) Å, c=11.636(1) Å, α=75.89(1)°, β=75.66(2)° and γ=87.71(2)° for NaZnFe(MoO4)3. Their structure, isostructural with that of β-NaFe2(MoO4)3, is built up from [M,Fe]2O10 units of edge-sharing [M,Fe]O6 octahedra (M=Ni or Zn), connected to each other through the common corners of MoO4 tetrahedra. The resulting anionic threedimensional framework leads to the formation of channels along b axis, where the Na+ cations are located. The disordered distribution of iron and divalent element in the same site is confirmed by bond valence calculation. Magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that the title compounds are antiferromagnetic with Néel temperature TN below 4.5 K. At high temperature, the susceptibility follows a Curie–Weiss law with θ=−19 and −18 K for Ni and Zn phases, respectively. Ionic conductivity results obtained by the impedance spectroscopy technique show that these materials are good ionic conductors with particularly low activation energies: 0.29 eV for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and 0.36 eV for NaZnFe(MoO4)3 close to those of Na super-ionic conductor (NASICON)-type compounds with similar formula such as AZr2(PO4)3 (A=Na, Li).

Iron polyanionic materials are subject to very intensive research for many applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion inhibition in steel enforcements and, more recently, as positive electrodes for rechargeable batteries [1–6]. In these materials, the anionic framework is constructed from XO4 tetrahedra linked to the iron coordination polyhedra leading to a large variety of crystal structures with a high capacity for cationic and anionic substitution. This versatility is essentially due to the double ability of iron to adopt a mixed valence and various coordination polyhedra [FeO]n with n=4, 5 and 6.

Compounds with general formula AxFe2(XO4)3 are of particular interest. They exhibit an open anionic framework, [Fe2(XO4)3]x− , built up by corner sharing of FeO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra, with the A cations occupying interconnected interstitial sites. Because compounds such as Fe2(XO4)3 (X=Mo, W, S) [7, 8] and AxFe2(XO4)3 (A=Li, Na and X=P, As) [9, 10] are potentially good ionic conductors, they are studied for lithium insertion utilizing the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple.

Until now, a total of five crystalline structures in the Na–Fe– Mo–O system have been reported [11–13]: NaFe(MoO4)2, αNaFe2(MoO4)3, β-NaFe2(MoO4)3, Na3Fe2(MoO4)3 and NaFe4(MoO4)5. All these structures are described in terms of three-dimensional networks of connected [MoO4] tetrahedra and [FeO6] octahedra. The sodium and mixed valence iron molybdate NaFe2(MoO4)3 exhibits two polymorphs, both crystallizing in the triclinic system. The low-temperature αphase changes irreversibly at high temperature into a β-phase. More recently, N. M. Kozhevnikova et al. have investigated the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3 system. They attributed the Na super-ionic conductor (NASICON)-type structure with space group R 3 c to the phase of variable composition Na(1 − x)Ni(1 − x)Fe(1 + x)(MoO4)3 and an original structure with triclinic space group P 1 to the NaNi3Fe(MoO4)5 compound [14].

Our interest in these materials concerns the preparation of related compounds and the study of their structural and physical properties. As an extension of the earlier works, we report here on the synthesis and characterization by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility and ionic conductivity of two isomorphic compounds NaMFe(MoO4)3 with M=Ni and Zn.

Brown single crystals of NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 were grown in a flux of sodium dimolybdate starting from a mixture of NaNO3, M(NO3)2·6H2O (M=Ni, Zn), Fe(NO3)3· 9H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O in a molar ratio of 5:1:1:7. All the reactants were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Each mixture was ground in an agate mortar and then heated in a platinum crucible, for 24 h at 673 K. After intermediate grinding, the product was melted for 2 h at 1123 K and subsequently cooled down to room temperature with rate of 5 K/h. Crystals without regular shape were separated from flux by washing in boiling water.

After the structural determination, polycrystalline samples of composition NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M = Ni and Zn) were synthesized by a soft combustion synthesis technique [15] according to the following procedure. First, stoichiometric amounts of NaNO3, M(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were dissolved in distilled water, then mixed with aqueous glycine solution. The stoichiometric composition of glycine was taken to be twice the molar fraction of the starting materials. The obtained yellow solution was heated to boiling at about 373 K leading to the formation of dark-yellow paste-like substance which is subsequently heated for 6 h at 523 K. The final step was the calcination of the formed dark-brown powder for 24 h in air at 943 K. The purity of the obtained phases was checked from an examination of their X-ray powder diagrams.

Chemical and morphological characterizations of NaNiFe(MoO4)3 have been carried out on an electron microscope (JEOL, JSM6335F) equipped with Thermo Noran system for quantitative elemental analysis by energy dispersion (EDAX). Within permissible statistical limits, the weight and atomic % of Na (6.4), Ni (6.1), Fe (6.3), Mo (17.6) and O (63.6) are in agreement with those calculated from the proposed formula. Figure 1 shows typical compositional spectrum and crystal morphology (with dimensions around 40– 80 μm in length) for this sample.

The purity of the synthesized powders was checked by the examination of their X-ray diagrams collected in the range 5°≤2θ≤100° on a PANalytical diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å).

The X-ray powder patterns reported in Fig. 2 indicate that NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 are isostructural with β-NaFe2(MoO4)3 [12]. No additional peaks due to any impurity phase were observed at the resolution limit of the instrument. The refined cell parameters are reported in Table 1.

Two crystals of NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 were selected from their respective preparations for the structural determination. Both data collections were performed at 298 K with a CAD-4 Enraf-Nonius X-ray diffractometer using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ= 0.7107 Å). The measured intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. Then, an empirical absorption correction was performed using DIFABS program [16]. Relevant crystallographic data and structure refinement details are summarized in Table 2.

The structure was solved in the triclinic space group P 1 by direct methods using the SIR-92 program [17] which revealed the positions of molybdenum atoms. The remaining atoms were located by Fourier synthesis alternating with least-squares structure refinement based on F2 (SHELXL97) [18]. A possible disordered distribution of Fe3+ and Ni2+ (Zn2+) in the same crystallographic sites was considered due to their similar ionic radii (r(Fe3+)=0.645 Å, r(Ni2+)=0.69 Å and r(Zn2+)=0.74 Å) [19]. The refinements based on this hypothesis converged to a distribution close to 0.5Fe+0.5Ni(Zn). The occupancy factors of atoms of Fe and Ni(Zn) in both sites were then fixed to the value 0.5. The final cycle of refinement, including the anisotropic thermal parameters for all atoms, converges to reliability factor R1= 0.045 and 0.034 for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3, respectively, which confirms consequently the proposed formula. Fractional atomic coordinates and isotropic thermal parameters are given in Table 3 and selected bond distances in Table 4. All calculations were performed using the Wingx software package [20].

Further details of the crystal structure investigations may be obtained from the Fachinformationszentrum Karlsruhe, D-76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen (Germany), on quoting the depository numbers CSD-427951 and CSD-427966.

In order to confirm the proposed cationic distribution, the final structural model was examined with bond valence sum (BVS) calculations [21, 22]. The BVS rule states that the formal charge (Vi) of a cation (anion) must be equal to the sum of the bond valence (Si=∑j Sij) around this cation (anion).

This method is used to validate structures, as in the case where atoms having similar diffusion factors are disordered in the same crystallographic site [23]. The deviation between formal charge and BVS can be quantified by means of a global instability index (G=(∑i{Si−Vi}2 / N)1/2) and used as a measure of inadequacy of the structure [24]. In the present structures, the calculated valences for [M,Fe](1)O6 and [M,Fe](2)O6 sites are, in all cases, close to 2.50. In addition, the smallest G value (12 %) is obtained from this model, for other arrangements with ordered Fe and Ni(Zn) atoms in the [M,Fe](1) and [M, Fe](2) site, the G value significantly increases up to about 24 % (Table 5). This confirms the disordered cationic distribution and validates the structural model.

Variable temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements for NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M=Ni and Zn) were performed using a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS-XL magnetometer. The measurements were carried out on powdered samples in the 4–300-K temperature range under a constant applied field of 500 Oe.

Cylindrical pellets were prepared by compressing the powder (5 t) to 1.32 mm in height and 13 mm in diameter, sintering at 943 K during 48 h and coating with platinum paint on both sides. The SEM study (not shown) evidenced that the above sinterization conditions allowed good intergranular contacts. Electrical properties have been performed from the analysis of ac complex impedance spectroscopy. A Solartron SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer was used with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 10 MHz in the temperature regions 283–523 K. Measurements were carried out in nitrogen atmo−1 and sphere, increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 K min stabilizing the temperature before collecting data. X-ray patterns showed that no phase changes took place. The absence of water in the initial and final samples was confirmed by IR spectra, excluding, therefore, any possible contribution of protonic conductivity in these processes.

The structure is based on a three-dimensional framework of [M,Fe]2O10 units of edge-sharing [M,Fe]O6 octahedra (M=Ni or Zn), connected to each other through the common corners of MoO4 tetrahedra. In this structure, all [M,Fe]2O10 units are parallel to the [0 1 1 ] direction (Fig. 3). In this way, eightmembered rings of alternating MoO4 tetrahedra and [M,Fe]O6 octahedra are formed parallel to the (a, c) plane. The resulting anionic three-dimensional framework leads to the formation of channels along the b axis, where the sodium ions are located (Fig. 4).

For the NaNiFe(MoO4)3 compound, the [Ni,Fe]–O distances and the cis O-[ Ni,Fe]–O angles in the [Ni,Fe]2O10 unit range from 1.964(7) to 2.086(7) Å and from 80.7(3)° to 97.7(3)°, respectively. This dispersion reflects a slight distortion of [Ni,Fe]O6 octahedra. The average distances<[Ni, Fe](1)–O>= 2.023 Å and<[Ni,Fe](2)–O>= 2.020 Å are between 1.990 Å observed for six-coordinated Fe3+ in NaFe(MoO4)2 [11] and 2.147 Å reported for Ni2+ with the same coordination in Na2Ni(MoO4)2 [25]. This result is related to the disordered distribution of Fe3+ and Ni2+ in both sites. The Mo(1)O4, Mo(2)O4 and Mo(3)O4 tetrahedra present Mo– O distances included between 1.708(5) and 1.832(4) Å. Their mean distances < Mo(1)–O > = 1.765 Å, <Mo(2)–O > = 1.772 Å and<Mo(3)–O>= 1.759 Å are in a good accordance with those usually observed in molybdates [11, 25, 26]. Similar comments are also valid to the NaZnFe(MoO4)3 compound as shown in Table 6.

Assuming sodium–oxygen distances below 3.13 Å as suggested by Donnay and Allmann [27], the Na site is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms with Na–O distances ranging between 2.285 and 2.971 Å. Two NaO8 polyhedra related by an inversion centre share one edge and form a Na2O14 dimer. In the [010] direction, the tunnel can be considered as made up of Na2O14 dimers alternating with cento-symmetric interstitial spaces that can accommodate sodium ions at Wyckoff position: 1a (Fig. 5).

Based on structural consideration, the anionic framework is three-dimensional; sodium ion mobility would be restricted to the one-dimensional channels formed along the b axis. One could visualize migration of sodium from an occupied NaO8 polyhedron to the neighbouring vacant site through two triangular windows that are common between them (Fig. 6). The largest window dimensions of about 2.98×3.40×4.14 Å should easily permit such migration of sodium. As a consequence, the motion of sodium cations through the tunnels seems feasible. This possibility will be confirmed by the electrical measurements.

The magnetic susceptibility as a function of temperature was assessed for the compounds NaMFe(MoO4)3, where M=Ni and Zn. Plots of the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibilities and their reciprocal are shown in Fig. 7. The relevant magnetic data are presented in Table 7. For both compounds, in a wide temperature range, the thermal evolution of χm follows a Curie-Weiss law, χ=C / (T−θ). The experimental and theoretical values of the magnetic moments, taking only into account the spin contribution for magnetic cations, are very similar for each compound. On the other hand, the Weiss temperatures determined through a linear least-squares extrapolation to zero have negative values, indicating that antiferromagnetic interactions appear at very low temperatures. No minima are found in the magnetic susceptibility variations for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 down to 4.5 K, although the above interactions are suggested from the deviations found in the reciprocal susceptibility graphs, which are more clearly evidenced for the Zn compound. This assumption is also in agreement with the very low values of χ·T obtained at lower temperatures, as is shown in the insets of Fig. 7. The suggested interactions are weak, and no additional measurements were carried out.

The complex impedance plane (Z*) plots for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 at different temperatures are given in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. In the temperature range 283– 350 K, two well-resolved semicircular arcs spanning the whole frequency range are obtained for both materials. This behaviour could be best modelled by invoking an equivalent circuit consisting of a series of two constant phase elements (CPE) (instead of ideal capacitor) connected in parallel to the resistors [28]. The dispersive frequency-dependent capacitance associated with a CPE element is given by C(ω)= −α, where A is a constant independent of frequency A.(jω) and α is a measure of the distribution of relaxation times. The α values are related to the electrical heterogeneity in the sample or to electrode polarization behaviour.

The parameters (R1, R2), (C1, C2) and (α1, α2) represent the resistive and capacitive elements associated with the high- and the low-frequency dielectric responses of Z*, respectively. An impedance analysis software Z-VIEW was used to fit the impedance data, in this way that the capacitances (C1, C2), resistances (R1, R2), and the exponent values (α1, α2) were directly obtained from the fit. Table 8 summarizes these data for M=Ni at 338 K and M=Zn at 313 K.

At temperatures above 350 K, the Z* plots consist of single semicircles with a nonzero intercept at high frequency. This value decreased upon increasing the temperature. Based on the equivalent circuit sated, made by two parallel RC elements in series, the nonzero intercept indicates the presence of an arc with ωmax higher than the maximum frequency measured, about 106 Hz. Although in these cases, it is not possible to −1 calculate their capacitances, they are lower than 300 pF cm −1 for the Zn one (graphs for the Ni molybdate and 500 pF cm not shown). Therefore, the intercept at high frequencies could, in principle, be attributed to the bulk or grain resistance, R1 [31], that is, temperature-dependent (see Figs. 8 and 9). The parameter values of the equivalent circuit obtained for both compounds at 443 K are given in Table 8.

The conductivity data were extracted from the corresponding resistance values obtained from the fit. The variation in grain conductivity with temperature could be fitted in terms of an exponential law, typical for small polaron hopping processes (Fig. 10), obtaining activation energies values of Ea= 0.29(1) and 0.36(1) eV, for M=Ni and Zn, respectively. In both cases, only one slope was obtained and these Ea values indicate that these molybdates are very good ionic conductors, being the Ni derivative even better than the Zn one, although this latter molybdate shows a slightly higher conductivity (see Fig. 10 and Table 9). As suggested by several authors [32, 33], the observed variations in conductivity may be related to differences in the respective cell volumes (Table 1). On the other hand, the higher and unexpected value of the activation energy for the Zn compound can be probably attributed to the grain boundary contribution, clearly dominating the electrical performance of samples at high temperatures (above 350 K). Such a contribution has been confirmed by the results obtained from the modulus and impedance spectra (not shown).

The title molybdates, NaMFe(MoO4)3 (M=Ni and Zn), −6 S/cm at show very high conductivity values, around 2.10 −4 S/cm at 523 K, i.e. room temperature and rise beyond 2.10 close to those of the NASICON-type conductors and comparable to or even better than those of one-dimensional ion conductors, such as molybdates with lyonsite-type structure. For comparison, along the series of NASICON-type compounds with general formula AMM’(PO4)3, conductivity varies at −4 −6 S/cm for LiNbFe(PO4)3 to 2.5×10 573 K from 6.6×10 −4 S/cm for NaZr2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3, respecand 5.0×10 tively [34–37]. In the system Li2 + xMg2(1 − x)Fex(MoO4)3 with lyonsite-type structure, conductivity ranges at 573 K from −7 S/cm for 1.1×10 Li3Fe(MoO4)3 (x=1) [38].

NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and NaZnFe(MoO4)3 have been prepared both as single crystals and powder form and characterized by X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements and ionic conductivity. These compounds are isostructural with βNaFe2(MoO4)3. Their structure exhibits an anionic threedimensional framework built up from [M,Fe]2O10 bioctahedra (M=Ni or Zn), connected to each other through the MoO4 tetrahedra. The resulting tunnels along the b axis can be considered as made up of Na2O14 dimers alternating with interstitial spaces. The magnetic susceptibility measurements show that both compounds are antiferromagnetic with Néel temperature TN below 4.5 K. Ionic conductivity results confirm that these materials are good ionic conductors with particularly low activation energies: 0.29 eV for NaNiFe(MoO4)3 and 0.36 eV for NaZnFe(MoO4)3 close to those of NASICON-type compounds with similar formula such as AZr2(PO4)3 (A=Na, Li) and better than those of one-dimensional ion conductors such as molybdates with lyonsite-type structure. This allows us to consider them as a promising solid electrolyte. Additional work is required to clarify the role of the cationic substitution on the behaviour of the observed ionic conductivity.
