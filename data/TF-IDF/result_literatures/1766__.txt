Crystallographic structures of two new orthophosphates Ca0.50SbFePO43 and CaSb0.50Fe1.50PO43obtained by conventional solid state reaction techniques at 900 °C, were determined at roomtemperature from X-ray powder diffraction using Rietveld analysis.

Ca2+ andvacancies in Ca0.503a0.503bM1SbFePO43 are ordered within the two positions, 3a and 3b, ofM1 sites.
Structure refinements show also a quasi-ordered distribution of Sb5+ and Fe3+ ions withinthe Nasicon framework.
Thus, in Ca0.503a0.503bM1SbFePO43, each Ca3aO6 octahedronshares two faces with two Fe3+O6 octahedra and each vacancy 3bO6 site is located between twoSb5+O6 octahedra.
In CaM1Sb0.50Fe1.50PO43 compound R3¯c space group, all M1 sites areoccupied by Ca2+ and the Sb5+ and Fe3+ ions are randomly distributed within the Nasiconframework.
Phosphates within the Nasicon-type family have gainedsome attention in the last decade because of their potentialapplications as a solid electrolyte, electrode material, lowthermal, expansion ceramics, and as storage materials fornuclear waste .
Particularly, thediscovery of Nasicon materials was an important developmentin the solid electrolytes field as it provided a threedimensionalnetwork that encloses channels where superionicconductivity may occur  octahedra surroundedby six PO4 tetrahedra and of PO4 tetrahedra surroundedby four .
This framework results in channels where theadequate amount of compensating cations, A, are located.

In the second step of refinement, the Ca atoms wereallowed to occupy the two possible positions of M1 sites 3aand 3b instead of only 3a in the previously refinement.
Thetotal calcium content was constrained to 0.5.
 In this refinement0.041 Ca2+ ions are found in 3b position of M1 site.
The final reliability factors for Ca0.50SbFePO43 obtained inthe last refinement RB=3.4%; RWP=10.5% are slightly betterthan those obtained for only one of the 3a sites occupiedby Ca2+ ions.
The final reliability factors and atomic parametersfor Ca0.50SbFePO43 are summarized in Table III.
A comparison of the experimental and calculated XRD profileis shown in Figure 3. 
The structure of Ca0.50SbFePO43 isrepresented in Figure 4. 
In order to facilitate the structuredescription, we use in the following Ca3aO6 to define thesite occupied to 96% by Ca2+ and 3bO6 for the site whichcontains 4% of Ca2+ ions.
The presence of a quasi-orderedvacancy-calcium distribution leads to two inequivalent SbO6and FeO6 octahedra.
Each Ca3aO6 octahedron shares twofaces with two FeO6 octahedra and each weakly occupied3bO6 site is located between two SbO6 octahedra.
XRDspectra, realized in the 10–35° 2 range with a constantcounting time of 1 s by step of 0.05°, of five compositions x=0.10, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.40 of theCa0.50+xSb1−xFe1+xPO43 system are gathered in Figure 5.
In the XRD diagrams, significant amounts of the competitiveFePO4 phase PDF number 77-94 were observed.
A carefulanalysis of the XRD patterns shows, as was not expected, thepresence of diffraction peaks corresponding to both end,Ca0.50SbFePO43 and CaSb0.50Fe1.50PO43, type-phases.
Inorder to clarify this assumption, a structural analysisusing the Rietveld method of the selected compositionx=0.25 was undertaken.

With regard to the respectiveion size and charge of Ti4+, Cr3+, Sb5+, and Fe3−, theexact reason behind the absence of a continuous solid solutionwithin the Ca0.5+xSb1−xFe1+xPO43 system is notclear.
Comparison between ah and ch hexagonal parameters ofCa0.50SbFePO43 and CaSb0.50Fe1.50PO43 phosphatesshows a decrease of ch from 22.2762 to 21.8712 Å andan increase of ah from 8.2571 to 8.5141 Å with calciumcontents.
Note that the rule governing the variation of theNasicon-type phosphate parameters has already been reportedCherkaoui et al.
, 1986.
Since the ionic radii valuesof Sb5+ and Fe3+ cations are relatively comparable, in ourcase, the evolution of ch parameters results from the Coulombicattraction between Ca2+ in M1 sites and the surroundingoxygens and also from the O2−-O2− repulsions Figure 4occurring when M1 sites are empty.
The Ca-O interatomic distances, ah andch parameters of CaSb0.50Fe1.50PO43 are given in Figure 7for comparison.
The linear increase of M13b-O2 distance,versus rA, is accompanied with a regular increase of ch hexagonalparameters Figure 7a.
Thus, an increaseof the ch parameters is generally accompanied by a decreaseof the ah one.
