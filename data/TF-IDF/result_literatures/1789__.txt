Data on the synthesis and properties of NASICON complex phosphates MxA2(PO4)3are summarized.
The crystal chemistry and homology of these compounds are surveyed.
The existence of large channelsand numerous voids in the structure and various occupations of these voids by mobile cations generate manyvaluable physical and chemical properties of the MxA2(PO4)3complex phosphates.
The details of phase transitions,ionic conductivity, thermal expansion, ion-exchange properties, and sensor properties of the NASICON  materials are considered, as well as the possibility of purposefully changing these properties through partial heterovalentsubstitution for the metal or phosphorus atoms.
The structural specifics of NASICON double phosphatesendow them with a set of valuable properties that allows their use as proton-conducting solid electrolytesin current sources, sensors, and other devices.
It isfor this reason that these materials have been a focus of attention of the scientific community for almost threedecades.
The comparatively high solubilities of severaloxides in NASICON structures at the synthesis temperatures and the ion-exchange properties offer a meansfor modifying NASICONs; in addition, these featurescall for extensive investigations of the homo- and heterovalent doping of NASICONs.
For several years after the discovery of high ionicconductivity, the researchers concentrated their effortson sodium NASICON-type materials: sodium-containing NASICONs have the maximal ionic conductivities.
However, in the last years, the focus of research has steadily shifted to lithium double phosphates.
Rapidprogress in the hydrogen power industry gives us hope that the hydrogen analogues of NASICONs will find application.
