The Raman spectra of two systems, namely titanium-doped lithium iron and lithium nickel phosphates have been investigated. At room temperature, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 is reported having a monoclinic structure with P21/n space group, and transforms to a rhombohedral structure (␥-phase) with Pcan space group above 513 K. An orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group is reported for LiNiPO4 and Ti-doped LiNiPO4 polycrystalline samples.
The Raman spectra of the ﬁrst system, speciﬁcally Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Ti-doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3, are assigned with respect to band positions reported in the literature for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Fe2(SO4)3 and, Nasicon-type compounds Li3In2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3. Although spectra show a marked change in the broadness and number of bands observed, the overall proﬁle is similar to ␣-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 which indicates up to 20 mol% solubility of titanium in the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase.
The second LiNiPO4 system shows mixed phase behaviour and is composed of orthorhombic LiNiPO4 and a secondary phase, likely a titanium phosphate. With increasing Ti-dopant concentration up to 20 mol%, there is an increase in the relative proportion of the secondary phase, characterised by a strong band at 784 cm.
Superionic materials possess exceptionally high values of ionic conductivity in the solid state, and have a large number of technological applications including rechargeable lithium batteries, sensors, and displays. They comprise potential to meet the requirements of size-compactness, integration, and stability at ambient temperature, and are desirable for the development of new rechargeable lithium battery systems [1–3].
Workers have utilised Raman and infrared spectroscopy to characterise the structure of the monoclinic AE3M2(PO4)3, where AE = Li and Na, and M = Fe, Sc, In, Zr, Cr [4–11].
Kravchenko et al. [6] have reported the Raman spectrum of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Li3Sc2(PO4)3, however, only the bands due to Li vibrations were assessed in any detail and the full assignment of the Raman modes has not been reported to date. 
Barj et al. [8] report the factor group analysis and spectra of compounds belonging to the Nasicon family of structures, and characterised the short-range disorder occurring in these systems.
Li3Fe2−xTix (PO4)3, where x = 0–0.20, and Li(Ni1−xTix)PO4, where x = 0–0.20, were prepared using the standard solid-state technique [13] between Li3PO4, Fe2O3, TiO2, NiO, and NH4H2PO4. The mixtures with stoichiometric amounts of these materials were ground in an agate mortar. The resulting mixtures were heated in an open crucible at 500 K for 1 h and then at and 900 K for another 1 h to decompose phosphates and nitrates, respectively. This process was followed by further heating at 1100 K for 15 h in air with an intermediate regrinding after 10 h. The ﬁnal products were quenched to room temperature.
Physics argon-ion laser was employed to excite laser Raman spectra using a 514 nm laser line at an incident power of ca. 10 mW, and a water-cooled photo multiplier tube. Raman spectra were obtained using a 50× objective and 500 ␮m slit width. The scanning rate used to collect the spectra was kept at 0.5 cm
According to [6,10], the space group for the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 has monoclinic C2/c (no. 15) structure with 2 formula units, i.e. Z = 2 at room temperature. The monoclinic ␤-phase is formed (space group, C2/c) at 368 K, and above 418K the rhombohedral ␥-phase exists (R3c). Similarly, Li3Fe2(PO4)3 can exist as three structures: low temperature monoclinic (P21/n) ␣,␤-phase, and high-temperature orthorhombic (Pcan). Table 1 shows the Raman and infrared modes for these compounds and structures obtained earlier [6,8] and calculated in this work.
A total of 60 Raman active, 117 infrared active and no coincident or inactive modes were predicted for the low temperature ␣-phase of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, studied in this work. However, for the high temperature Li3Fe2(PO4)3 ␥-phase 144 Raman and 105 infrared modes have been predicted for the orthorhombic structure. The factor group analysis of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 phases shows the change in the number of active modes with change in symmetry.
The Raman spectra of titanium-doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 1. The Raman spectrum of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, agrees well with that reported in the literature [5] for the monoclinic ␣-phase. The band positions are compared in Table 2 with that observed by Kravchenko et al. [6] for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and those of compounds with similar structure, to characterise the spectrum. It can be seen that the band position match those reported for Li3Fe2(PO4)3, and the spectra of monoclinic Li3In2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3 show very similar band positions. The bands are as−1), signed to vibrations, of FeO6 octahedra (300–400 cm deformations −1) and vibrations of the valence bonds of (400–700 cm PO4 , with respect to the work of Kravchenko et al. [6]. A total of 28 bands are observed at room temperature, of the 120 Raman modes predicted for the P21/n space group. 
The spectra of titanium-doped lithium iron phosphate, Li3Fe2−xTix(PO4)3, where x = 0.05–0.20, show a Raman proﬁle that is signiﬁcantly different to that for undoped Li3Fe2(PO4)3. A total of 15 bands are observed, almost half that of the undoped compound, and the bands are broader, −1. Table 3 gives a particularly in the range 900–1200 cm comparison of the band positions of Li3Fe2−xTix(PO4) with monoclinic Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and rhombohedral Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The Raman proﬁles of the Ti-doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3 more closely resembles that of the rhombohedral Na3Fe2(PO4)3 compound. Doping Li3Fe2(PO4)3 with titanium appears to ion increase the symmetry of the structure likely via the Li positions.
At 20 mol% Ti dopant, there are several extra bands ob−1. These bands may indicate the served at 161 and 942 cm formation of a secondary phase at the high Ti-dopant level or the formation of a new phase, which is the subject of a present publication.
The Raman spectra of Li(Ni1−xTix)PO4, x = 0–0.20, are shown in Fig. 2. Band positions and relative intensities of the observed spectra are listed in Table 4. For the Raman spectrum of LiNiPO4, there are a total of 15 bands observed at room temperature, of 42 predicted Raman active modes calculated from factor group analysis. The bands are assigned with reference to the relative wave number positions, and compared to the reported assignments of the spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, and NiO [6,14,15,16]. The Raman spectra of Ti-doped LiNiPO4 (Fig. 2) show the presence of a secondary phase, characterised by a strong −1. With increasing Ti-dopant concentration band at 784 cm there is an increase in the relative proportion of the secondary phase. Fig. 2 compares of the Raman spectra of LiNiPO4, Li(Ni0.80Ti0.20)PO4 and the subtraction spectrum of the two. It can be seen that at 20 mol% Ti, the secondary phase is predominant in the system. 
The spectrum of the secondary phase (Fig. 3, b−a) matches that of the secondary phase reported by Cretin et al. [15] for the system Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 prepared by the sol gel method, and sintered at 950 C. Cretin et al. [15] did not assign this secondary phase and reported that it was invisible to X-ray diffraction. 
The Raman spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Ti-doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3 are reported with 28 modes observed of the 120 Raman modes predicted for the monoclinic ␣-phase of Li3Fe2(PO4)3. The spectra are assigned with respect to band positions reported in the literature for Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Fe2(SO4)3 and Nasicon-type compounds Li3In2(PO4)3 and Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The Raman spectra of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 doped with TiO2 show a marked change in the broadness and number of bands observed, although the overall proﬁle is similar to Li3Fe2(PO4)3. It has been shown that titanium is soluble in Li3Fe2(PO4)3 up to 20 mol%, however, the Raman spectra resembles that observed for a rhombohedral structure rather than a monoclinic structure.
A total of 15 bands were observed for LiNiPO4 at room temperature, from a total of 42 predicted Raman active modes for the orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group. Bands were observed at 115, 168, 270, 305, 365, 413, −1 461, 585, 635, 844, 943, 1003, 1062, 1074 and 1289 cm and assigned to types of vibrations according to the relative wave number positions. Raman spectra of Ti-doped LiNiPO4 show a mixed phase system composed of the orthorhombic LiNiPO4, and a secondary phase, likely a titanium phosphate. With increasing Ti-dopant concentration there is an increase in the relative proportion of the sec−1. ondary phase, characterised by a strong band at 784 cm Ti is shown to be insoluble in the system LiNiPO4 under these fabrication conditions.
