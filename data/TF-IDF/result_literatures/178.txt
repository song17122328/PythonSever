Natrium super ionic conductor (NASICON) materials providing attractive properties such as the high ionic conductivity and good structural stability are considered as very promising materials for use as electrodes for lithium (LIBs) and sodium (NIBs) ion batteries. Herein, a new high-performance electrode material Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C was synthesized via the sol-gel method and was electrochemically tested as an anode for lithium ion batteries proving enhanced electrochemical performance as a result of nickel substitution into the lithium site in the LiTi2(PO4)3 family of materials. The synthesized material showed good ionic conductivity, excellent structural stability, stable long-term cycling performance, and improved high rate cycling performance compared to LiTi2(PO4)3. The Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode delivered reversible capacities of about 93% and 68% of its theoretical one at current rates of 0.1C (6.42 mA.g-1) after 100 cycles, and 5C (320.93 mA.g-1) after 1000 cycles, respectively. Theoretically, three Li+-ions can be inserted into the vacancies of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C structure. However, when the electrode is discharged to 0.5 V, more than three Li+ ions are inserted into the NASICON structure, leading to its structural transformation, and thus to an irreversible electrochemical behavior after the first discharge process.
In order to face the growing demands in energy and to limit the growing environmental pollution and global warming, the use of eco-friendly and renewable energy sources as alternatives of the widely used fossil resources has attracted much interest worldwide. In particular, high effective energy storage devices are required as complementary systems toward the use and development of these new energy sources. Li-ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting great potential due to their high volume and gravimetric energy density, stand as the convenient candidates.
Among the various existing electrode materials, including oxides, carbonaceous, and polyanionic materials, phosphate based NASICON (NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor) structure-type compounds exhibiting high structural and thermal stabilities, in addition to their fast ionic conductivity, are attractive materials for use in energy storage devices, namely lithium ion (LIBs) and sodium ion batteries (SIBs). They have been tested as both cathode and anode materials thanks to their very rich and various compositions. NASICON materials generally exist with the general formula AxM2(PO4)3, where “A” can be either monovalent (Li+, Na+) or divalent (Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, etc.) ions, and M is a transitional metal (Ti, Fe, V, Zr, Sc, etc.)thanks to their very rich and various compositions. NASICON materials generally exist with the general formula AxM2(PO4)3, where “A” can be either monovalent (Li+, Na+) or divalent (Ni2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, etc.) ions, and M is a transitional metal (Ti, Fe, V, Zr, Sc, etc.) . Among these materials, AxTi2(PO4)3 is usually considered as a negative electrode because of its low working voltage vs. Li+/Li (~2.5 V). However, likely to other phosphatebased materials such as the olivine cathodes , the use of the NASICON-type phosphates is limited due to the low electronic conductivity resulting from the long M-M distance (existence of -M-O-P-O-M- linking) in their structural framework. To overcome this inconvenience, carbon coating and chemical substitution (or doping) are considered as efficient methods in order to improve the electrochemical performance of these materials, mainly their rate capability.
Aiming to enhance the structural stability and electrochemical properties of the previously studied Li1.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 NASICON-type material, a novel substitution strategy targeting the A (Li) site is considered. Among several transition metals, nickel was used as substitute because of its attractive properties, mainly the ionic radius of Ni2+ ions (RNi+2 = 0.69 Å) which can be considered of the same order as that of lithium (RLi+1 = 0.74 Å). This property would ensure an optimized interstitial channel size for lithium diffusion in the structure during the intercalation/de-intercalation processes.
In this work, Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 material was synthetized via the sol-gel method and its particles were carbon-coated using sucrose as carbon source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) allowed to confirm the NASICON structure of the obtained composite material, using the Rietveld method to refine the lattice parameters, the atomic positions and the inner-atomic distances. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy allowed to analyze the morphology of the pristine and composite materials. Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the carbon coating of the composite material and to confirm its NASICON structure. The electrochemical performance of Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C was tested via galvanostatic test methods and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode-based cell impedance was followed during the first discharge-charge process using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Lithium diffusion kinetics during the first discharge process were also studied using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates.
Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 was synthesized via a conventional sol-gel method as described in our previous work 14. Firstly, stoichiometric amounts of anhydrous Li(OOCCH3) (99.998%; Aesar PURATRONIC) (2.51 mmol), Ni(OOCCH3)2·4H2O (99.0% ; Sigma-Aldrich) (2.4 mmol) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (98.0% ; Sigma-Aldrich) (2.4 mmol) were dissolved in about 15 ml of ethanol with stirring for 1 hour. Then, H3PO4 (85%; Sigma-Aldrich) (14.86 mmol) and TiCl4 (99% ; Aldrich) diluted in ethanol (7.19 mmol equivalent of TiO2) were added into the first solution under continuously stirring. Few drops (about 40 to 60 µl) of deionized water were added into the mixture to adapt the pH to ⁓0 and form a gel. The obtained gel was dried at 100°C overnight and ball-milled for 30 min at 400 rpm using a planetary ball mill (Retsch PM100), and about 10 balls with different diameters varying between 5 and 15 mm. The obtained powder is then heated to 400 °C for 3 hours with a heating rate of 5 °C/min under air, ball milled again within the same conditions, then heated up and kept at 700°C for 12 hours under air atmosphere. Afterwards, the resulting powder (85 wt%) was ground with 15 wt% of sucrose in acetone (5 ml) for about 10 min using an agate mortar, dried and annealed at 600°C for 6 h under an argon flow. The final obtained carbon-coated Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C composite was black.
The XRD pattern of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 sample was obtained by a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å), between 2θ =10 and 60°, with a step of 0.01°. Rietveld refinement method was used to calculate the structural parameters through the FULLPROF program. A pseudo-Voigt profile function was used to describe the shape of the diffraction lines.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured with a Tescan Mira3 LM FE electron microscope (0.5-30 kV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained with a Tecnai Spirit instrument (120 kV) .
Raman spectra were collected using a Cofotec MR520 3D Raman confocal microscope with a 532 nm beam under ambient conditions.
The carbon content in the composite material was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with a heating rate of 10°C min-1 using a Discovery TGA instrument under air atmosphere.
The specific surface area was calculated at 77K using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method on Gemini VII 2390 Surface Area Analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corp.). The degassing conditions were set to be 200°C during 24 h under vacuum for all samples.
The electrochemical performances of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode material were tested in C2030 coin cells, using a mixture of Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C, carbon black (super P) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a binder with a weight ratio of 75:15:10 as cathode and metallic lithium foil as anode (counter electrode). The average active material mass loading of the electrodes was about 1.5 mg cm-2. The current and specific capacity are calculated according to the mass of the active material (75%) per electrode. Celgard membrane was used as separator, and commercial LiPF6 (1 M) dissolved in 50:50 (by volume) ethylene carbonate (EC): dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was used as electrolyte. All the electrochemical tests were measured on a Biologic MPG2 and SP300 at room temperature (⁓25 °C). Lithium diffusion kinetics during the first discharge process were also studied using the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) with various sweep rates from 0.02 to 0.2 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a biologic instrument SP150..
The crystal structure of the synthesized Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 material was studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Figure 1, all the diffraction peaks can be indexed assuming a rhombohedral symmetry, and R c space group implying the high purity of our 3 Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 material. Rietveld refinement allowed calculating the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 related lattice parameters a(b) = 8.4987(3) Å and c = 20.6999(1) Å and cell volume V = 1294 ±1 Å3. The small values of Rwp = 7.44% and Rp = 7.62% (<10%) suggest the reasonable refinement results. The Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 NASICON-type material is constructed by lantern-like units sequenced along the c-axis, where each unit is composed of octahedral [Ti(Fe)O6] sharing corners (O atoms) with tetrahedral [PO4] as displayed in the inset of Figure 1.
In this rhombohedral structure, both Ni and Li are supposed to be placed in the more stable M1 sites, which are located at the Wyckoff position 6b with site symmetry 19. Accordingly, Table 3 S1 gives more detailed information regarding the atomic position of the different elements constituting the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 material, and Table S2 gives the different inter atomic distances that were calculated, as well as the average (M-O) bond lengths. The obtained results are in very good agreement with the ones reported for the LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) material, with a Li–O distance equal to 2.26 Å, and Ti–O average distance of 1.9 Å 19. In addition, the calculated cell volume was in good agreement with the one obtained for the LTP material 19,20. These results confirmed our first hypothesis of putting Li and Ni of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 material at the same more stable M1 site, similar to Li in the LTP. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C composite was also obtained and no changes of the crystal structure were observed after the carbon-coating process (Figure S1).
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2-(b)) was also employed for both, pristine Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 powder and the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C composite material in order to confirm the NASICON structure and the presence of the carbon coating on the composite material.
Raman spectra of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C show the appearance of two extra bands at 1326 and 1590 cm−1, attributed to the D and G bands, and characteristic of the carbon coating. The intensity ratio of ID/IG is 0.96, which is a sign for a highly disordered carbon structure . TGA measurement gave the carbon amount in the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C composite material, which was determined to be ~4.2 wt% (Figure 2-(a)). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 and Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C are 19.53 m² g-1 and 38.02 m² g-1, respectively. The increased surface area of Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material is likely due to the formation of porous carbon on the surface of the pristine material.
The morphologies of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 and Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C materials were investigated by SEM and TEM, as shown in Figure 3. The SEM images show that Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C is composed of irregularly shaped and aggregated particles (Figure 3-(a) & (b)). The morphology of the primary particles can be considered spherical-like with an average diameter of about 60 nm (Figure S2). The corresponding TEM image (Figure 3-(c)) shows the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 particles before carbon coating, confirming the morphology and particle size determined via SEM, while the other TEM image (Figure 3-(d)) shows the agglomerated Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 nanoparticles with an heterogeneous thin layer of carbon coating on the surface of some particles.
The electrochemical behavior of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C composite material as an electrode for lithium ion batteries was investigated in detail using an electrochemical half-cell system within the voltage ranges of 1.85-3.0 V and 0.5-3.0 V vs Li+/Li.
Figure 4-(a) shows the charge-discharge curves of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material within the voltage window 1.85-3.0 V at 0.1C current rate. One feature appearing at about 2.8 V can be related to the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox couple, while a more important plateau is appearing at about 2.48 V, which is associated to the Ti3+/Ti4+ redox couple.
Theoretically, the reduction of 0.5 Fe3+ to Fe2+ and 1.5 Ti4+ to Ti3+ allows the insertion of two lithium ions into the structure giving a theoretical capacity of about 128 mAh.g-1.
The observed experimental capacity of the first discharge is 142 mAh.g-1, however, this capacity drops to about 120 mAh.g-1 afterwards. The extra obtained capacity at the first discharge compared to the theoretical one can be related to the SEI formation and its participation in the consumption of lithium ions even though the cut-off voltage is higher than 1 V vs Li+/Li. One can notice that the slope seen at the end of the first discharge, which is responsible for the extra-capacity, disappears after the first cycle. Cyclic voltammetry results in the voltage window 1.0-3.0 V vs Li+/Li (Figure S3), confirms the occurrence of side reactions of the electrolyte at a high voltage of 1.6V. Furthermore, fitted Nyquist plots of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode at different states of discharge and charge (Figure S5 and Table S3) confirm the increased cell resistance when the electrode was initially discharged to 1.85 V, confirming the formation of the SEI layer at this voltage range.
The obtained Galvanostatic results were also confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (Figure 4-(a) insert), where the oxidation-reduction peaks of Fe2+/Fe3+ appeared at 2.81 V and 2.79 V, respectively. For the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+, an intense peak was observed at the first discharge around 2.2 V, which was then shifted to ~2.45 for the subsequent cycles. During the charge process, the oxidation peak of Ti3+ to Ti4+ appeared at around 2.6 V. Besides, an extra peak appeared at the end of the first reduction process (1.85 V), while it disappeared afterwards confirming the previously concluded result related to the formation of the SEI layer during the first discharge process at relatively high voltage (1.85V).
Rate capability measurements revealed that the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material delivers an average specific capacity of about 110 mAh.g-1 at the current rate of 0.1C. This capacity decreased slightly while cycling at the faster rate of 5C by delivering a capacity of about 95 mAh.g-1 (Figure 4-(b)). This rate-related performance is better than that obtained for the L1.5Fe0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/C or other LiTi2(PO4)3 materials.
The long-term cycling performance of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material at the slow rate of 0.1C was tested ((Figure 4-(c)). After 100 cycles, the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode material delivered a high reversible specific capacity of ~115 mAh.g-1 which corresponds to about 90% of its theoretical capacity. At the higher current rates of 5C, about 91% of the initially obtained capacity (95 mAh.g-1) was retained after 1000 cycles. Over all the cycling process, the Coulomb efficiency of Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C was determined to be almost 100%,demonstrating the highly reversible lithium-ion insertion/disinsertion into and out of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode material. These remarkable results can be directly related to the presence of Ni in the lithium site of the NASICON structure. As it was mentioned before, the presence of non-active divalent ions with an ionic radius of the same order as the one of lithium optimizes the lithium diffusion within the NASICON structure and facilitates the lithium intercalation into and out of the structure. Another reason for this improved electrochemical performance of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material compared to the previously studied LFTP@C or other LiTi2(PO4)3 based materials can be related the better electronic conductivity provided by nickel in the structure instead of lithium as well as the more stable structural network built with stronger Ni–O covalent bonds than Li–O bonds leading to an improved long-term cycling stability.
At the high current rate of 20C, the material showed a very good reversibility with an initial discharge capacity of more than 80 mAh.g-1. After 1000 cycles, the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode delivered ~81% of this initial capacity.
The electrochemical behavior of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material was also tested at lower voltages within the potential window 0.5-3.0 V vs Li+/Li at a current rate of 0.1C (Figure 5-(a)). The first discharge profile was very different from the subsequent ones, with an excessive first discharge capacity of more than 620 mAh.g-1. This capacity dropped to about 380 mAh.g-1 after six cycles.
Similar to the electrochemical behavior obtained for the LFTP@C material , the difference between the first discharge profile and the subsequent ones can be directly associated with the decomposition of the pristine structure while discharging to 0.5 V. Ex-situ XRD analysis was performed at different states of discharge/charge between 0.5 and 3.0 V and confirmed the irreversible structural transformation that takes place once the electrode is discharged to 0.5 V vs Li+/Li (Figure S4). Based on these results, the reactional mechanism at this voltage range can be considered similar to the one reported for Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3. Hence, after the first reaction that occurs in the first voltage range (1.85 – 3.0 V) allowing the insertion of two Li+-ions into the structure, there should be one more remaining void in the Li2.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 structure for lithium insertion. The second Li+ ion insertion reaction should take place at around 0.8 V (1.7 V lower than Ti3+/Ti4+ redox potential vs. Li+/Li (2.48 V)) corresponding to the reduction of Ti3+ to Ti2+. This would happen according to the following reaction.
In addition to the Ti3+/Ti2+ peak that should appear around 0.8 V, the CV curve shows a very strong reduction peak at 0.6 V. Meanwhile, all the M1 and M2 voids of the NASICON structure were occupied by Li+ and Ni2+ with an extra 0.5 of Li+. Further intercalation of Li+ ions would thus lead to the decomposition of the pristine structure, according to the following reaction.
Accordingly, during the first discharge, the complete Li+ intercalation process into the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode involves 8.5 Li+ ions that are inserted into the crystal structure, resulting in a theoretical capacity of 545.6 mAh.g−1. The higher obtained experimental capacity (623.8 mAh.g−1) can be attributed to the SEI phenomena and its consumption of lithium ions leading to the obtaining of the observed extra capacity. Furthermore, Ex-situ XRD analysis of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrodes at different states of discharge and charge, respectively (Figure S4), confirmed the structural rearrangement when the electrode is discharged below 0.6 V. Below this voltage, all the NASICON-structure related peaks disappeared. When the electrode is discharged to 0.5 V and then charged back to 3.0 V, the NASICON-structure was not recovered, confirming the irreversibility of the conversion reaction that takes place at this low voltage.
The rate capability performance of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material at different current rates varying from 0.1C to 5C was also tested at this potential window (Figure 5-(b)). The material delivered its highest capacity at the slow rate of 0.1C with an average of 380 mAh.g−1. At 5C, the material delivered only a capacity of about 220 mAh.g−1. Unlike the acquired results at the smaller potential window of 1.85 – 3.0 V, and because of the structural rearrangement taking place as demonstrated by the ex-situ XRD, we have observed a very weak reversibility depending on the applied current at this potential range (0.5 – 3.0 V).
In order to evaluate the electrochemical kinetics of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C material within the potential window of 1.85-3.0 V, for which a clear reversibility was observed, cyclic voltammetry and GITT were employed to calculate the electrochemical lithium diffusion coefficient DLi+ in particular during the first discharge process. Figure 6-(a) shows the GITT curve during first discharge at a very slow rate of 0.05C (discharge for 2 hours then relaxation for 16 hours). An example of a single discharge pulse at around 2.75 V is demonstrated in the inset of the same figure.
Moreover, the cell voltage during titration is considered to be linearly proportional to τ1/2 (Figure S6). Then, the chemical diffusion coefficient of the Li+-ions can be calculated based on Fick’s second law of diffusion through the simplified equation (1).
Where τ is the duration of the current pulse (s); nB is the number of moles (mol); Vm is the molar volume of the electrode (cm3 mol-1); S is the electrode/electrolyte contact area (cm2); ΔEs is the steady-state voltage change due to the current pulse, and ΔEτ is the voltage change during the constant current pulse. DLi+ of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode was calculated at different voltages during discharge (Figure 6-(b)) and an average DLi+ value is ~1.38 x 10-13cm2 s-1.
yclic voltammetry technique was also used as a confirmative technique to determine the kinetics of Li+ insertion and extraction in Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C. Figure 6 (c) shows the redox reactions of Ti4+/T3+and Fe3+/Fe2+. The major redox reaction occurred at 2.4 V and 2.65 V vs Li+/Li at 0.2 mV s-1, corresponding to Ti4+/T3+ and the small redox peaks correspond to Fe3+/Fe2+. The potential difference between anodic and cathodic peaks became narrower while decreasing the scan rate.
Figure 6-(d) shows that the cathodic (R1 and R2) and anodic (O1 and O2) current peaks are linearly dependent on the square root of the scan rate (R2 of 0.98, 0.998, 0.995, and 0.933 for anodic and cathodic lines, respectively). Based on this relation, the Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+) in the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrode is calculated using the Randles-Sevcik  equation (2).
Where Ip is the current peak (in mA), n is the number of electrons, S is the surface area of the electrode (in cm2 g-1), D is the diffusion coefficient (in cm2 s-1), C is the concentration of Li+ (mol cm-3), and is the scan rate (in mV s-1).
The calculated DLi+ for Li+ insertion corresponding to Ti4+/T3+ is 6.4 x 10-13 cm2 s-1, which is  in the order of magnitude of the average DLi+ obtained via GITT, while that related to the extraction of Li+ in Ti4+/T3+ was higher, 1.05 x 10-12 cm2 s-1 at 25 °C. These values are higher than the DLi+ reported for LiTi2(PO4)3 (1.55 × 10-14 and 1.31 × 10-14 cm2 s-1 for the anodic and cathodic reactions, respectively) using the same CV technique 30 and are in quite the same order for the recently reported Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3 delivering high electrochemical performances.
On the other hand, the reduction current peak of Fe3+/Fe2+ was about 10 - 15 % of that of Ti4+/T3+, while the oxidation current peak of Fe3+/Fe2+ was 15 - 24 % although the stoichiometric ratio of Fe is ca. 33 % of Ti in the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C compound. These low redox current peaks of Fe3+/Fe2+reflected the low slope in Figure 6-(d), corresponding to DLi+= 1.56 x 10-14 and 6.38 x 10-14 cm2 s-1 for Li+ insertion and extraction, respectively. In both cases of Ti and Fe, the anodic current intensities were higher than the cathodic ones (Figure 6(c)), meaning that the kinetic of Li+ extraction is faster than that of Li+ insertion in the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C structure.
Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 NASICON material was synthetized via the sol-gel method, and carbon coating of its particles was performed using sucrose. SEM and TEM images confirmed the nano-size and spherical shape of the primary particles of the studied material. When tested as an anode for lithium batteries, the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C delivers a high reversible capacity around 110 mAh.g-1 at a current rate of 0.1C in the voltage range of 1.85 – 3.0 V vs Li+/Li, with an excellent capacity retention of more than 96% after 100 cycles. At high C-rates such as 5C and 20C, the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C electrodes deliver an initial capacity of 95 and 80 mAh.g-1, and remarkable capacity retention of 91% and 81% after 1000 cycles, respectively. When tested at lower voltages down to 0.5 V, the pristine NASICON structure of the material was deformed due to the excess of Li+ insertion, confirmed by ex-situ XRD patterns of the Li0.5Ni0.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3/C at different state of charge.
