Structure transformations and proton conductivity of hydrogen zirconium phosphates with the NASICON structure, H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3?H2O (X = 0, 0.02 and 0.1, M = Nb, Y), were studied by X-ray powder diffraction, calorimetry, IR- and impedance spectroscopy. Substitution of zirconium by niobium leads to decrease of the lattice parameters, while yttrium doping leads to their increase. H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 structure was determined at 493 and 733 K. This phase crystallizes in rhombohedral space group R ¯3c with lattice parameters a = 8.8564(5) A˚ , c = 22.700(1) Aåt 493 K and a = 8.8470(2) A˚ , c = 22.7141(9) Aåt 733 K. The a parameter and lattice volume were found to decrease with temperature increasing. Structure transformations upon heating are caused mainly by the decrease of the M1 site and C cavities. Ion conductivity of obtained materials was found to increase in humid atmosphere. Activation energies of conductivity were calculated. Rhombohedral–triclinic phase transition found by X-ray powder diffraction was proved by calorimetry data. According to XRD and IR spectroscopy data hydrogen bond in HZr2(PO4)3 was found to be weaker than in hydrated material.

Hydrogen zirconium phosphate with the NASICON structure (HZr2(PO4)3?H2O) is known to show high thermostability and proton conductivity [1,2]. For the first time, the synthesis of the dehydrated material (HZr2(PO4)3) from NH4Zr2(PO4)3 has been reported by Clearfield and co-workers [1,3]. Refluxing HZr2(PO4)3 in water converted it to the hydronium ion form (HZr2(PO4)3?H2O). Later, the HZr2(PO4)3?H2O structure and its proton conductivity in the low-temperature range has been studied [3]. Conductivity of H0.8Zr1.8Nb0.2(PO4)3?0.4H2O obtained from lithium form was studied in [2]. HZr2(PO4)3?H2O lost its water above 420 K to yield triclinic HZr2(PO4)3 [5]. Further heating leads to the reversible triclinic–rhombohedral phase transition at about 490 K. Moreover, the a parameter of HZr2(PO4)3 lattice was found to decrease upon heating [4]. Therefore, it will be interesting to study the hydrogen zirconium phosphate properties above the phase transition temperature. At the same time, ion conductivity of materials doped by heterovalent ions could be higher [2]. For example, partial substitution of Zr4+ ions by three- or pentavalent cations in LiZr2(PO4)3 was the most effective [6]. The similar situation can take place in the case of HZr2(PO4)3?H2O. The aim of this work was to study the high-temperature structure and ion conductivity of the NASICON-type hydrogen zirconium phosphates doped by niobium and yttrium.

Lithium zirconium phosphates (Li1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3, X = 0, 0.02 or 0.1, M = Nb, Y) were obtained by solid state reaction using a standard procedure [2]. Hydrogen forms were prepared by their refluxing in hot nitric acid for 20 days. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to monitor the degree of ion exchange, which was found to be complete. TGA data were obtained on STA 449 (Netzsch) in the temperature range 293–1273 K in different atmospheres with various humidity with a heating rate of 10 K/min. According to TGA data, the as-prepared compounds should be formulated as H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3?H2O (X = 0, 0.02 or 0.1, M = Nb, Y). X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were obtained using ARL X0TRA powder diffractometer (Thermo ARL corp., Cu Ka1+a2 radiation, Peltier solid state detector) equipped with a hightemperature Otto HDK 1.4 camera. The data were collected over the range of 5–1008 (2Q) with a step of 0.028, effective counting time was 10 s per step. All crystal structure calculations were carried out with the updated JANA2000 program [5]. The split-type Psevdo– Voigt peak profile function was used for X-ray powder data. The background was approximated by a Chebyshev polynomial. MarchDollase texture formalism was used while processing X-ray pattern [7]. Refinement of structure parameters of H0.8Zr1.8Nb0.2(PO4)3?H2O was performed at 493 and 733 K. The starting model for the structure refinement was taken from [8]. The LCR meter HP4284A Agilent with a frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz was used for conductivity measurements. Impedance data were collected on round pressed pellets (diameter 5 mm, thickness 2 mm, prepared under pressure of 5 ? 108 Pa) with painted silver electrodes. Humidity was maintained by constant water vapor transmission. IR spectra of the samples in KBr were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 Fourier spectrometer.

All thus obtained hydrated compounds have rhombohedral symmetry at room temperature. In some cases a small amount of zirconium pyrophosphate as impurity phase (no more than 2%) was observed. Zirconium substitution by niobium leads to decrease of lattice parameters while doping by yttrium leads to their increase. Niobium doping is accompanied by vacancy formation according to the equation: NbZrðPO4Þ3=HZr2ðPO4Þ3 ¼ V0H þ ZrZr þ Nb? Zr þ 3PO4ðPO4Þ (1) where VH is proton vacancy, superscripts ‘‘*’’ and ‘‘0’’ denote positive and negative charge of ions relative to the lattice. Yttrium doping leads to introduction of additional protons into interstitials (Hi*): H3Y2ðPO4Þ3=HZr2ðPO4Þ3 ¼ HH þ 2H?i þ 2Y0Zr þ 3PO4ðPO4Þ: (2) Hydration of protons in interstitials is accompanied by the lattice volume increase. Heating of H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3?H2O leads to significant changes of XRPD patterns due to material dehydration [4]. According to TGA data, materials lost their crystalline water at 420–510 K yielding H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3. Maximal rate of weight loss is observed at 480 K (Fig. 1). So high temperature is not typical for dehydration and testifies the high acidity of the PO4H group. H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 decomposition accompanied by condensed phosphates formation occurs at high temperature. Decomposition starts at 820 K and maximal rate is observed at about 900 K. One endothermic peak was observed on DTA curves obtained in humid atmosphere. However, its maximum (510 K) is shifted to the high temperature range in comparison with the maximum of weight loss (Fig. 1c). The relative humidity decrease leads to decrease in dehydration temperature (Fig. 1d and e). At the same time, endothermic peak splits into two, and maximum of the first one (480 K) almost coincides with the peak on differential curve of weight loss. The second peak was observed at the higher temperature (510–515 K). Thus, taking into account data [4] this effect can be attributed to the phase transition of H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 from triclinic form (formed as result of dehydration) to the hightemperature rhombohedral phase. Indeed above this temperature reflections of triclinic H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 disappeared at the XRPD patterns [4]. Fig. 2 shows conductivity plots vs. 1/T for H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3?H2O in humid atmosphere. They differ from those obtained at usual relative humidity [2]. Conductivity increase at low temperatures can be explained by conductivity of water sorbed on the surface of H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3?H2O particles. This water can be lost easily, and conductivity decreases a little. Activation energy of conductivity of hydrated H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 in the temperature range (380–500 K) is of 31 ? 1 kJ/mol. At 480–500 K conductivity decreases twice due to water loss (Fig. 2). Above 500 K material conductivity is determined by conductivity of anhydrous H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 with activation energy of 60.2 ? 0.3 kJ/mol. Hydrated materials are more stable in humid atmosphere. Dehydration takes place in a narrow temperature range, and the conductivity correlates with the TGA ones. The NASICON-type phosphates are known to exhibit low thermal expansion [9,10]. H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3 have similar behavior showing the near-zero coefficients of thermal expansion. Therefore, it was of interest to study structure transformations of dehydrated materials at high temperatures. Rietveld refinement of H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 structure was carried out in order to better understand its thermal expansion behavior. Final refinement, positional and thermal parameters are given in Tables 1 and 2, except for the position of hydrogen which remains undetermined. Important bond distances and angles are given in Table 3. H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 structure is a three-dimensional framework consisting of vertex-linked ZrO6 and PO4 polyhedra (Fig. 3). Usually cations M+ occupy two different sites [6]: the antiprismatic M1 site surrounded by six oxygen atoms with M1–O distances nearby 2.64 A˚ , and the M2 site surrounded by eight oxygen atoms. The coordination of the M2 site is less symmetrical. According to [11] both sites form two crossed systems of conduction channels. Dehydration of HZr2(PO4)3?H2O and H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3?H2O i s accompanied by increase in the a and decrease of the c lattice parameters (Fig. 4). On the contrary, further heating of HZr2(PO4)3 and H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 leads to decrease of the a and slight increase in the c parameter. The c parameter is determined by the sizes of the M1 site and a small cavity (C) formed by two ZrO6 octahedra linked by three phosphate-ions (Fig. 3a). The last one increases slightly after the dehydration of HZr2(PO4)3?H2O while the size of the M1 site decreases. H3O+ ions are located in the M1 sites of HZr2(PO4)3?H2O structure [3]. The size of the antiprismatic M1 site is governed by the distance between the nearest oxygen atoms of ZrO6 octahedra [6]. This distance is equal to 4.79 A˚ for HZr2(PO4)3?H2O (calculated using data [3]), and 4.55 A˚ for anhydrous form at 493 K. Its change due to cooperative polyhedral rotations described in [12] leads to the observed decrease of the c parameter upon dehydration. It results simultaneously in the increase in the size of the vacant M2 site. Thus, the M1 and M2 sites are the most ‘‘mobile’’ elements which determine the lattice parameters. Comparison of H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 structures at 493 and 733 K shows the increase in the bond lengths in the ZrO6 octahedra with temperature. Moreover, ZrO6-octahedra become more symmetric at higher temperatures. A simultaneous decrease of the sizes of the M1, M2 sites and C cavity takes place. The average distance between the M2 site centre and surrounded oxygen atoms decreases from 2.577 to 2.562 A˚ (0.6%). Similar distances decrease is more pronounced for the M1 site and C cavity: from 2.655 to 2.601 A˚ (2.1%) and from 2.150 to 2.079 A˚ (3.4%) respectively. The decrease of size of these cavities upon heating is determined by rotations of ZrO6 and PO4 polyhedra. At the same time, these cavities determine the a and c parameters (Fig. 3a and b). Therefore we concluded that the low thermal expansivity of this material is determined by the behavior of these cavities upon heating At 733 K, the P–O2 bond length (1.538 A˚ ) is larger than the P–O1 bond length (1.511 A˚ ). Most probably, at this temperature hydrogen ions are mostly bonded to O2 oxygen atoms. It is well-known that the O–O distance in the O-H O bond correlates with the strength of the hydrogen bond [13]. The higher is the strength of H–bond the higher is the shift of valent vibration band of OH-groups from 3750–3650 cm?1 to lower frequencies in IRspectra. In the case of HZr2(PO4)3?H2O this shift is higher than that for HZr2(PO4)3. Bands corresponding to the O–H valent vibrations was observed at 3150 cm?1 for HZr2(PO4)3?H2O and at 3450 cm?1 for HZr2(PO4)3. In hydrated material oxygen atom of H3O+ ion is localized in the M1 site. The distance between it and the nearest oxygens (of PO4 polyhedron) is short enough (there is no other short distances for H-bond in the structure). During dehydration this oxygen leaves the material as H2O, and the M1 site contracts. However, the distances between its oxygens is high enough. All short O–O distances (<3 A˚ ) belong to the oxygen atoms of the same PO4 or ZrO6 polyhedra. Hydrogen bond formation between them would lead to formation of cycle, where the value of O-H O angle is about 668, and H–O distance is 2.641 A˚ . Other O–O distances in the H0.9Zr1.9Nb0.1(PO4)3 structure exceed 3.5 A˚ . In any case it is a weak H-bond. It correlates with IR spectroscopy data. Thus, hydrogen bonds in HZr2(PO4)3 become weaker and its length should increase upon dehydration.

Hydrogen zirconium phosphates with the NASICON structure (H1?XZr2?XMX(PO4)3, M = Nb, Y) have high proton conductivity at high temperatures. They are low thermal expansion materials. Structural study shows that it is a result of the vacant M1 site and C cavity size decrease.
