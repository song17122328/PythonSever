Li1 + xTi2 – xCrx(PO4)3 NASICON 2)type materials have been prepared and characterized by X 2)ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that Cr3+ doping increases the ionic conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 within the single 2)phase region of the doped material, which extends to x = 0.7. From temperature 2)dependent ionic conductivity data, the activation energy for lithium transport through interstitial sites and the enthalpy of defect formation in LiTi2(PO4)3 are estimated at 30.0 ± 0.5 and 56 ± 1 kJ/mol, respectively. 

The study of ion mobility in inorganic materials is a priority issue in modern materials research. Materi 2) als with high cation mobility find application in many areas of science and technology. Modern technologies typically  employ  lithium  ion  conductors  to  develop compact  current  sources  and  batteries.  Among  the most  promising  lithium  ion  conductors  are  NASI 2) CON materials (LiM2(РO4)3 with M = Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, Ge, and other metals), which offer high cation mobil 2) ity and high hydrolytic and thermal stability [1]. The structure  of  LiM2(PO4)3  is  made  up  of  M2(PO4)3 blocks, each composed of two MO6 octahedra, which share  corners  with  three  PO4  tetrahedra  [2–4].  The lithium cations reside in two inequivalent sites: M1, in the center of inversion, with sixfold oxygen coordina 2) tion, and M2, around the threefold axis, with eightfold oxygen  coordination  [5].  The  alternation  of  the  two types of sites along conductive channels gives a three 2) dimensional network for fast ion transport.

The  best  studied  compounds  of  this  family  are LiZr2(PO4)3  and  LiTi2(PO4)3  [1,  6].  It  is  worth  men 2) tioning studies by Paris et al. [7], who investigated cat 2) ion mobility in LiTi2(PO4)3 by  7Li NMR and imped 2) ance spectroscopy. According to their results, the lith 2) ium ions acquire high mobility at temperatures from 230 to 330 K. There is also evidence that the ionic con 2) ductivity  of  NASICON 2)type  double  phosphates  can be raised by heterovalent doping. The incorporation of M'3+ (M = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, Sc, In, Lu, Y, La, and other metals) trivalent cations into the Ti4+ site increases the ionic conductivity of the material [1, 8–11]. In partic 2) ular, Hamdoune et al. [10] investigated compounds of composition Li1 + хTi2 – хInx(PO4)3 in the range 0 < x < 2.0.  Subramanian  et  al.  [8]  described  compounds  of composition  Li1 + xTi2 – xScx(PO4)3  with  0.1  <  x  <  2.0. Pinus et al. [11] presented detailed data illustrating the effect of gallium doping on the transport properties of LiTi2(PO4)3. The mobility of interstitials in this mate 2) rial was shown to substantially exceed that of vacancies [11, 12].

Detailed  data  on  cation  mobility  in  Cr3+ 2)doped LiTi2(PO4)3 2)based materials in a wide range of doping levels are not available in the literature. In view of this, the  purpose  of  this  work  was  to  synthesize  Li1 + xTi2 – xCrx(PO4)3 lithium titanium double phosphates, deter 2) mine their composition stability limits, and study cat 2) ion mobility in these materials.

Li1  +  xTi2  –  xCrx(PO4)3  materials  were  prepared  by solid 2)state  reactions  according  to  the  following scheme: where x = 0, 0.02, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 1.

Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (>99%, Fluka), (NH4)2HPO4  (>97%,  ROTH),  Cr(NO3)3  ⋅  9H2O (99%,  ACROS),  and  TiO2  ⋅ nH2O  were  mixed,  thor 2) oughly ground in a mortar, and fired at 870 K for 6 h in platinum  crucibles.  The  mixture  was  then  reground and  pressed  into  pellets  to  improve  interaction between the particles. The pellets were embedded in powder of similar composition, containing 20% excess lithium carbonate, in order to prevent lithium vola 2) tilization at high temperatures, and fired at 1470 K for 24 h.

The  microstructure  of  the  resultant  materials  was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a  Carl  Zeiss  NVision  40  operated  at  an  accelerating voltage of 1 kV.

The phase composition of the samples was determined  by  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  on  a  Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (CuKa1 radiation). XRD data were analyzed using the Rigaku Application Data Processing software package.

Electrical conductivity was measured at tempera 2) tures from 298 to 873 K (about 30 2)K steps) and fre 2) quencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz using an IPU 2)62 ac bridge.  The  samples  had  the  form  of  pressed  pellets (R = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) with platinum contacts. The conductivity  was  determined  by  extrapolating  the semicircle representing the bulk component onto the real axis. Impedances were measured with an accuracy of 5%.

According to electron microscopy data, all of the samples prepared by solid 2)state reactions had the form of polydisperse crystalline powder consisting of rela 2) tively small crystallites, on the order of 1 to 10 μm in size  (Fig.  1).  According  to  XRD  results,  the  as 2)pre 2) pared LiTi2(PO4)3 was phase 2)pure and had a hexagonal structure. At lower annealing temperatures, impurity phases were present. Partial Cr3+ substitution for Ti4+ (x  =  0.02–0.7)  in  the  structure  of  LiTi2(PO4)3  at 1470 K had no effect on the phase composition of the material (Fig. 2). This led us to assume the existence of a limited series of Li1 + xTi2 – xCrx(PO4)3 solid solutions (х = 0–0.7). Further increase in х in the NASICON phase  led  to  the  formation  of  impurity  phases,  pre 2) sumably those based on chromium phosphates.

The XRD patterns of the synthesized compounds could be indexed in a hexagonal cell. Figure 3 presents the composition dependences of unit 2)cell parameters for  the  chromium 2)doped  compounds.  Chromium doping increases both the a and c cell parameters of LiTi2(PO4)3.  The  most  likely  reasons  for  this  are  the larger  ionic  radius  of  chromium  in  comparison  with titanium and the incorporation of excess lithium ions into vacant M2 sites.

Heating  of  Li1.1Ti1.9Cr0.1(PO4)3  to  870  K  produces no changes in its phase composition. The 012 and 104 reflections shift to smaller angles, whereas the position of the 110 reflection remains unchanged (Fig. 4). Sim 2) ilar changes occur in other parts of its XRD pattern. The  reason  for  this  is  that  the  coefficient  of  thermal expansion is anisotropic. In particular, as the temper 2) ature is raised from 300 to 870 K the с cell parameter increases  from  20.897  to  21.111  Å,  whereas  the  а parameter decreases from 8.519 to 8.503 Å.

Therefore,  the  coefficient  of  thermal  expansion along the с axis is  (1.75  ± 0.04)  × 10–5 К–1, and that along the а axis is negative and an order of magnitude smaller in magnitude: (–1.8 ± 0.6) × 10–6 К–1 (Fig. 5). LiTi2(PO4)3 exhibits similar behavior: on heating, its с cell parameter increases, whereas its а parameter varies little. The estimated thermal expansion coefficient of LiTi2(PO4)3 is (0.75 ± 0.07) × 10–6 К–1 along the a axis and (2.78 ± 0.08) × 10–5 К–1 along the c axis [11]. Note that NASICON 2)type materials were reported to have small coefficients of thermal expansion [13].

The ionic conductivity of our samples varies non 2) monotonically  with  doping  level.  In  particular,  Cr3+ substitution for 1% of the Ti4+ cations in the structure of  LiTi2(PO4)3  sharply  increases  its  conductivity (Fig. 6).  The  defect  formation  process  induced  in LiTi2(PO4)3 by Cr3+ doping can be represented by the following quasi 2)chemical reaction:LiTi PO.

where * and ' signify, respectively, a positive and a neg 2) ative  charge  of  ions  relative  to  the  lattice  site.  The insufficient positive charge of chromium relative to the Ti4+ position is compensated for by the formation of extra  interstitial  lithium  ions.  Their  concentration should be equivalent to the concentration of the triva 2) lent  chromium  that  substitutes  for  tetravalent  tita 2) nium. This should lead to an increase in defect density and conductivity with increasing doping level within the single 2)phase region.

When the chromium content approaches х = 0.7, the conductivity rises more gradually. This is obviously due to defect association processes, which are rather active  at  high  degrees  of  substitution.  Negatively charged relative to their lattice site, the chromium ions form pairs with positively charged lithium ions localized in interstices:Li Cr.

This process markedly reduces the heterovalent doping  effectiveness.  Further  increase  in  the  degree  of substitution (х > 0.7) leads to a drop in ionic conduc 2) tivity  because  of  the  formation  of  higher  resistivity impurity phases (Fig. 6).

The  ionic  conductivity  of  LiTi2(PO4)3  increases with temperature and shows Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures (Fig. 7). The activation energy for low 2) temperature conduction in undoped lithium titanium phosphate  is  58.0  ±  0.5  kJ/mol.  At  higher  tempera 2) tures,  the  variation  of  logσ  with  inverse  temperature deviates  from  Arrhenius  behavior.  The  composition dependences  of  conductivity  for  the  doped  samples also have a break. Let us interpret these changes using Li1.2Ti1.8Cr0.2(PO4)3 as an example.

At low temperatures (below 410 K), the activation energy for conduction is 52  ± 3 kJ/mol. In this tem 2) perature  range,  the  activation  energy  for  conduction meets the relation Ea Em ΔHD.

where Em is the activation energy for defect migration and ΔHD is the enthalpy of defect formation [14]. The increase  in  lithium  cation  mobility  with  increasing temperature ensures a more uniform lithium ion distri 2) bution over positions M1 and M2. Owing to this, after reaching a threshold value the contribution of the sec 2) ond term in Eq. (4) drops to almost zero. As a result, the activation energy for conduction decreases at high temperatures (410–870 K), down to 30.0 ± 0.5 kJ/mol.

With increasing chromium content, the activation energy decreases at low temperatures and varies little at  high  temperatures.  These  findings  correlate  well with previous data for gallium 2)doped LiTi2(PO4)3 [11]. One possible reason for this is that increasing the dop 2) ing level increases the initial concentration of intersti 2) tial (position M2) lithium ions, which leads to a gradual  decrease  in  the  contribution  of  the  enthalpy  of defect formation to the activation energy for conduc 2) tion. Figure 8 shows the composition dependence of the activation energy for low 2)temperature conduction in Li1 + xTi2 – xCrx(PO4)3. Characteristically, the activa 2) tion energy at the boundary of the homogeneity range approaches that at high temperatures.

The present data suggest that the activation energy for  high 2)temperature  conduction  corresponds  to  the energy  of  lithium  ion  migration  through  interstices and is 30.0 ± 0.5 kJ/mol. At the same time, it follows from  Fig.  8  that  the  composition  dependence  of  the activation energy for low 2)temperature ionic conduc 2) tion in Li1 + xTi2 – xCrx(PO4)3 extrapolates rather well to the  value  obtained  for  undoped  LiTi2(PO4)3  (58.0  ± 0.5 kJ/mol). This confirms that the nature of the ion transport process remains unchanged throughout the solid  solution  series  and  allows  us  to  evaluate  the enthalpy  of  defect  formation  in  this  material  using Eq. (4): 56 ± 1 kJ/mol.

We have  evaluated the Li1  +  xTi2  –  x  Crx(PO4)3  solid  solution.  Doping  with trivalent chromium has no effect on the phase compo 2) sition of the samples but increases the ionic conductiv 2) ity of the materials for х ≤ 0.7. Doping to higher levels reduces the ionic conductivity.
