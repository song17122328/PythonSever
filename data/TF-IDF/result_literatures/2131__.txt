Solid-state ceramic NOx sensors based on interfacing an ionic conductor (NASICON) with semiconducting oxides (rare earth perovskite-type oxides) were investigated. NASICON powders were pressed into thimbles 12 mm long with 3 mm inner diameter and 4 mm outer diameter, then sintered at 1270 14)C in air. A Pt wire was attached to the outer surface of the tubes using a platinum paste. A uniform Au/Pd (60 wt.%) coating, permeable to oxygen but not to NOx, was sputtered for 40 min on the sensor external surface to allow the exposure of both electrodes to the gas atmosphere without using reference air. Windowless energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to evaluate the chemical composition of the Au–Pd layer before and after the performance of sensing tests. Sodalite powder as an auxiliary phase was tightly packed into the NASICON thimbles with a Pt lead for the electrical contact. To get an in-situ NO conversion to NO2, a Pt-loaded alumina powder was used as a catalyst and incorporated with the sensor on the top of the auxiliary phase. Nano-sized and chemically-pure rare earth perovskite-type oxide (LaFeO3, SmFeO3, NdFeO3 and LaCoO3) powders, prepared by the thermal decomposition of the corresponding hexacyanocomplexes, were also used in the electrochemical cells. Each of the tested oxides was packed into the thimbles replacing the sodalite and the Pt-loaded alumina catalyst. Tests were performed also using only the perovskitic oxides. The microstructure of the materials tested was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The NO2 sensing properties of the prototype sensors were investigated at controlled temperature (in the range 300–600 14)C) by measuring the electromotive force (EMF) at dierent NO2 concentrations (in the range 2–2000 ppm in air). Some measurements were performed at various NO concentrations diluted with Ar. The results obtained showed a promising NO2 sensing performance when ferrites were used. SmFeO3 has a lower catalytic eect on NO oxidation than the Pt-loaded alumina catalyst, and has a similar eect to sodalite when used as auxiliary phase. The perovskite-type oxides are more preferable as auxiliary phase than sodalite because they improve the stability of the electrochemical sensor performances. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The growing attention to environmental problems increases the need of reliable and selective solid-state NOx sensors, both for air quality monitoring and automotive applications.1,2 The requirements are dierent for each application; sensors able to selectively detect NO2 in the concentration range 1 ppb–10 ppm are needed for environmental monitoring, while sensors are needed to detect NOx in the concentration range 10– 2000 ppm for combustion control and exhaust monitoring. At present, analytical techniques are approved by the environmental standards to monitor NOx, which use very costly and bulky equipment.3

Therefore, the control and monitoring of pollutants for ambient air quality is limited by the high costs of the techniques at present accepted by regulations. The use of devices based on solid-state gas sensors would be enormously cheaper than the use of analytical techniques, and would lead to a wider distribution of environmental monitoring stations than exist at present with the same cost, resulting in an improved picture of air quality.4 However, the performance of solid-state gas sensors is not satisfactory yet for this application.5

For automotive applications, NOx sensors usually have to operate in harsh environments. The stability of sensing materials thus becomes of paramount importance. Ceramics appear to be more convenient as active elements for NOx sensors, given their thermal and chemical stability, especially for the control of combustion exhausts.

Solid-state sensors based on semiconducting oxides or electrolytes are currently studied for NOx detection. Several n-type6 255)15 and p-type16 255)21 semiconducting oxides have been studied as NOx sensors, mainly for applications at high temperatures. Few examples have been reported in the relevant literature for the use of semiconducting oxide NOx sensors for indoor22 and outdoor23 255)25 air quality monitoring, and for the control of air quality inside passenger cars.26 The main limitations of semiconductor NOx sensors are the lack of selectivity and the inability to detect the very low gas concentrations as environmental standards.5

required by the Ceramic NOx electrochemical sensors, mostly potentiometric and some amperometric, have been studied for use in combustion exhaust control systems.27 255)31 In general, most of the equilibrium-potential sensors use oxyacid salts as auxiliary phases in combination with a solid electrolyte.32 The auxiliary phases used for most of the solid electrolyte NOx sensors so far studied are sodium nitrite or nitrate-based metal oxides.33 255)35 These compounds have a low melting temperature and thus they show problems of thermal and chemical stability.

A more stable compound, nitrited sodalite, has been used as an auxiliary phase.36 Sodalite belongs to the zeolite family and contains NO2 in its formula Na8[Al6.xH2O, which makes it sensitive to gasSi6O24](NO2)2 eous NO2 permitting its use as auxiliary phase. Given that it is an ionic conductor with Na+ ions as charge carriers, nitrited sodalite has been also used as a solid electrolyte for NOx electrochemical sensors.37,38 However, stable operating conditions have been obtained at maximum 400 14)C.

A new approach to improve the stability and the selectivity of the NOx devices is to combine a solid electrolyte with an electrode of semiconducting oxides, substituting the auxiliary phase of the electrochemical sensor with a metal oxide.39 This approach has been proposed to improve thermal and chemical stability of CO, CO2, H2S and hydrocarbon sensors,40 255)44 though one of the most appealing application of these concepts is in the study of NOx sensors.45,46 The oxide electrode used as auxiliary phase can act as an electrode catalyst increasing the selectivity of the device. The design of sensors based on the integration of materials with different electrical properties is an alternative way of producing devices with improved performance and novel functions.47 The better sensing performance to NO and/ or NO2 as well as the stability at higher temperatures can be due to novel detection mechanisms, probably based on changes of mixed potential at the interface.48,49 Another possible working electrode method for the detection of NOx of such ionic conductor/semiconductor structures is the amperometric one,50,51 which can have advantages for the detection of low gas concentrations.46

In this work, an investigation on solid-state ceramic NOx sensors based on interfacing an ionic conductor (NASICON) with semiconducting oxides (rare earth perovskite-type oxides) is reported. NASICON is a sodium conductor with a very high ionic conductivity at relatively low (<400 14)C) temperatures. It has been used for NOx electrochemical sensors using mixtures of nitrites and nitrates as auxiliary phases.32 Nano-sized and chemically-pure rare earth perovskite-type oxide powders were used as electrodes. These powders were prepared by the thermal decomposition of the corresponding hexacyanocomplexes,52 255)56 according to a procedure well investigated by one of the authors of this paper.57 Some of the perovskite oxide powders, in thick ﬁlm form, have been already successfully tested as semiconductor NO2 sensors.58,59

NASICON powders with the formula Na3Zr2Si2PO12 were prepared by solid-state reaction.60 Nitrited sodalite .xH2O formula was synthewith Na8[Al6Si6O24](NO2 )2 sized using the method reported by Hund.61 Rare earth perovskite-type oxides (LaFeO3, SmFeO3, NdFeO3 and LaCoO3) were prepared by the thermal decomposition at low temperatures of the corresponding heteronuclear hexacyanocomplexes.52,53 The phases present were conﬁrmed by X-ray diraction (XRD) analysis.

Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a prototype sensor. NASICON powders, containing 0.5 wt.% of an organic sintering aid, were isostatically pressed at 250 MPa into thimbles 12 mm long with 3 mm inner diameter and 4 mm outer diameter. The thimbles were then sintered at 1270 14)C in air. A platinum wire was attached to the outer surface of the tubes using a platinum paste that was ﬁred at 1000 14)C for 5 min.

Fig. 2 shows a SEM micrograph of the SmFeO3 powder prepared by the thermal decomposition of the hexacyanoferrite complex at 700 14)C for 1 h. SEM observations showed that the morphology of SmFeO3 powders consisted of large agglomerates (in the size range of micrometers) made of nano-sized particles of about 50–80 nm.21 Some non-agglomerated nanometric particles are also visible in the micrograph. Similar morphologies were observed for the other ferrite oxides. In the case of LaCoO3, the presence of the micron-sized agglomerates was not observed and the formation of nanometric particles occurred already at 700 14)C.57

SEM observations with EDS analysis were performed on the sputtered Au/Pd coating on as-sputtered samples and after exposure to NO2 gas. After gas testing, the sample surface became darker. SEM observations showed that the Au/Pd coating became more continuous after gas exposure. Fig. 3 shows the EDS spectra for the as-sputtered sample (Fig. 3a) and for the sample after gas exposure (Fig. 3b). The signiﬁcant dierence between the EDS plots is the presence of the oxygen peak on the sample after gas exposure. This can be interpreted as a partial oxidation of the metallic coating.

The need for a reference atmosphere would make the sensing device complicated and impractical. To simplify the operation, both electrodes should be exposed to the analyte. Thin electrodes layers of Au–Pd have been demonstrated to be blocking to all gases and vapours but oxygen.62 Therefore, an uniform Au/Pd (60 wt.%) coating, permeable to oxygen but not to NOx, was sputtered for 40 min on the sensor external surface.62 Thus, during testing the sensors were wholly exposed to NOx atmosphere without using reference air for the reference electrode.

A solid-electrolyte NOx electrochemical cell developed in Cambridge was used as standard comparison. Sodalite as auxiliary phase was tightly packed into the NASICON tubes with a platinum lead for the electrical contact. To get an in-situ NO conversion to NO2, a Ptloaded alumina powder was used as a catalyst and incorporated with the sensor on the top of the auxiliary phase. The sensors described can be represented by the following electrochemical cell:  133) 255) 134)O2;NOxjjPt-alumina catalystjsodalitejNASICONjj

To evaluate the eect of the rare-earth perovskitetype oxides on the performance of the electrochemical sensors, each of the tested oxides was packed into the thimbles instead of sodalite and of the Pt-loaded alumina catalyst. Tests were performed also using only the perovskitic oxides into the NASICON thimbles. The resulting electrochemical cells were:  133) 255) 134)O2;NOxjjRE perovskite oxidejsodalitejNASICONjj

NOx sensing experiments were carried out at controlled temperatures in the 300–600 14)C range in a conventional ﬂow apparatus equipped with a heating facility. The sensor response, expressed as electromotive

Fig. 4 shows the EMF response to various concentrations of NO2 for the electrochemical cell (1), i.e. the comparison sensor, measured at 400 14)C. This prototype sensor was sensitive to NO2 and its response time, which is the time to get the 90% of the stable EMF value in presence of NO2, was within few minutes. However, the response at each gas concentration tested was not stable. Moreover, the EMF base-line in air decreased signiﬁcantly during the tests.

Gas sensing measurements were performed on the electrochemical cells (2), (3), and (4), where sodalite, or catalyst, or both sodalite and catalyst were substituted with a rare-earth perovskite-type oxide. The results obtained using SmFeO3 as perovskitic oxide are shown here below. The results obtained using the other rareearth orthoferrites (LaFeO3 and NdFeO3) were similar

to the results obtained with SmFeO3, while the EMF gas response for the sensors using LaCoO3 was worst. The EMF measured at each NO2 concentration for all the sensors based on the orthoferrites was larger than the corresponding EMF measured for the cell (1). The response time of the sensors was in most of the cases about one minute for all the samples tested. The response time decreased with increasing the NO2 concentration. The recovery time in air was in the range of 4–10 min, and it was the slowest for the type (3) cells, and the fastest for the type (4) cells that used only rare-earth ferrites.

Fig. 5 shows the EMF response to various concentrations of NO2 for the electrochemical cell (2), where SmFeO3 was used as a catalyst together with the sodalite auxiliary phase, measured at 400 14)C. The NO2 response was fast but the stability of the results was not satisfactory. Moreover, the base-line in air increased by more than 100 mV during the test period.

Fig. 6 shows the EMF response to various concentrations of NO2 for the electrochemical cell (3), where SmFeO3 was used as auxiliary phase together with the Pt-loaded alumina catalyst, measured at 400 14)C. Also this sensor was quickly responding to NO2, though its response was the slowest, but its performance was the less adequate, even though its EMF values were the largest measured. the EMF values were scattered as a function of the NO2 concentration.

Fig. 7 shows the EMF response to various concentrations of NO2 for the electrochemical cell (4), where only SmFeO3 was used inside the NASICON thimble, measured at 400 14)C. This sensor showed the best overall performance, because the sensor answer was the most stable. The EMF base-line values in air increased by about 40 mV during the tests.

These ﬁndings showed that the perovskite-type oxides can be used as auxiliary phase in the NO2 electrochemical sensors. The NO2 response of the devices based on interfacing the ionic conductor with a semiconducting oxide is larger than the gas response of the electrochemical cell based on sodalite as an auxiliary phase. It is possible to say that the perovskite materials might be eective also if used as in-situ catalyst for NO oxidation.

Fig. 8 shows that the EMF responses of SmFeO3based sensors were linear when plotted against the logarithm of NO2 concentration (logPNO2 ), with positive slopes. The NO2 sensitivity was the largest for the type (3), using SmFeO3 and Pt-alumina catalyst, though the data were largely scattered. The NO2 sensitivity for the type (2), using SmFeO3 and sodalite, and (4), using only SmFeO3, was almost the same. Therefore, one can infer that while SmFeO3 has a lower catalytic eect on

NO oxidation than the Pt-loaded alumina catalyst, it has a similar eect as sodalite when used as auxiliary phase. Therefore, the perovskite-type oxides are more preferable than sodalite because they improve the stability of the electrochemical sensor performances.

From these plots, using the Nernst equation, the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reactions were evaluated to be between 1.3 and 1.5. These ﬁndings allowed us to infer that the sensing mechanism for these devices was non-Nernstian, and probably mixed potential behaviour should be postulated as their sensing mechanism.32 Moreover, it should be kept in mind that both electrodes of the sensors were exposed to the same atmosphere.

The inﬂuence of the temperature on the EMF response to dierent NO2 concentrations was also evaluated. Fig. 9 shows the dependence of EMF responses of type (4), SmFeO3-based sensor on the

The EMF responses of these SmFeO3-based sensors were linear, with a positive slope, to the logarithm of NO2 concentrations at all the temperatures tested, and the EMF values increased with increasing the tempera-

ture.The NO2 sensitivity was the largest at 400 14)C, while at 200 and 500 14)C the slope was almost ﬂat.

EMF measurements were also performed at various NO concentrations at 400 14)C. The EMF values at each NO concentration for all the tested sensors were smaller than the corresponding EMF measured at the same NO2 concentration and the response time was longer. EMF responses decreased with increasing NO concentration, being linear to logPNO with negative slopes. These results are in agreement with the ﬁndings of other authors who used similar electrochemical systems.33,46,48 In fact, the EMF in the presence of NO gas went always in the opposite direction with respect to the EMF in NO2.

Solid-state ceramic sensors based on NASICON with rare-earth perovskite-type orthoferrites as an auxiliary phase are promising candidates for the detection of NO2. Their response time was fast and the EMF values increased when the ferrites were used as auxiliary phase. Moreover, the use of an oxide as auxiliary phase improves the stability of the gas sensing performance of the electrochemical cells, which is extremely important for automotive applications. Further studies are necessary to clarify of the sensing mechanism.
