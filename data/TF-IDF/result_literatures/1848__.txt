Ternary indium (III) pyrophosphates with three-dimensional frameworks of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been found, and the crystal structures have been first reported in this paper. The optical and bonding properties were investigated in terms of the absorption and emission spectra, as well as the calculated band structures and density of states. The crystal band structures calculated by the DFT method show that the solid compounds of MInP2O7 are insulators with direct band gaps, and the calculated average third-order susceptibilities are increasing in the order of K < Rb < Cs in the MInP2O7 crystal (M ) K, Rb, Cs).
The past years witnessed an increasing interest in the synthesis and characterization of metal phosphates with open framework structure due to their rich structural chemistry and potential applications in catalysis, adsorbents, and ion-exchangers.1-3 Specially, the interest in the ternary orthoand pyrophosphates containing alkaline metals along with various other metals has increased considerably. This is due to the possibility of using these compounds in single or polycrystalline form as nonlinear optical materials,4 solid electrolytes,5-7 ionic conductors,8-13 battery electrodes,14,15 sensors for detection of NOx in atmospheric environment,16 etc. In contrast to the well-known aluminophosphates and gallophosphates,17 ternary alkali metal phosphates containing indium atom are still to be explored besides reported compounds.18-31 Of them, the Na7(InP2O7)4PO4 is particularly important due to the high conductivity anisotropy along two principal unequal crystallographic directions.26 
Belkouch and co-workers have given the lattice parameters of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, and Cs),32 but until now, no X-ray crystal structural determinations support these parameters. The above compounds have been mostly discovered by mild hydrothermal or high-temperature flux-growth method. 
Additionally, the band structures and optical properties of the typical solid compounds have been seldom reported in contrast to the alkali metal titanyl phosphates, which are mostly investigated in these respects.33-35
In this work, we will present synthesis, crystal structure determinations, and spectral measurements for indium pyrophosphates MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, and Cs). At the same time, we will make the calculations of crystal energy band structures and optical response functions to understand the chemical bonding properties and electronic origin of optical transition for the solid compounds.
The single-crystals of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) were prepared by solid-state reactions among analytical grade In2O3, NH4H2PO4, and either M2CO3 (M ) Na, Rb, Cs) or MNO3 (M ) K) in a molar ratio corresponding to In/P/M)1:9:11. The samples were ground, heated in air at 923 K for 10 h, and afterward heated at 1273 K (M ) Na, K, Rb) or 1223 K (M ) Cs) for 24 h in a platinum crucible. The mixtures then were cooled to 1023 K at a rate of 2 K/h and finally quenched to room temperature. Some colorless crystals were selected carefully. 2.2 Crystal Structure Determinations. Single crystals of MInP2O7 having dimensions 0.26  2) 0.18  2) 0.16 mm3 (M ) Na), 0.19  2) 0.14  2) 0.12 mm3 (M ) K), 0.44  2) 0.25  2) 0.18 mm3 (M ) Rb), and 0.40  2) 0.31  2) 0.22 mm3 (M ) Cs) were selected for intensity data. The data were collected on a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer with graphite monochromated Mo Ka radiation ( 236) ) 0.71073 Å) at the temperature of 293 K using the scan mode. 
Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied to the data. The systematic extinctions, h0l: l ) 2n; 0k0: k ) 2n; 00l: l ) 2n, are consistent with the space group P2(1)/c. We determined the crystal structures of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) in terms of the SHELXL36 software. 
The positions of metal atoms were located by application of the direct methods with SHELXL program; the remaining atoms were located in succeeding difference Fourier synthesis. Table 1 lists details of cell parameters, data acquisition, and structure solution. The atomic coordinates and thermal parameters are listed in Table 2. Selected bond distances and angles are given in Table 3.
The samples used for spectral measurements were prepared from pressed abradant of selected micro crystals. To give evidence that it contains pure phase of sample, we determined the powder XRD patterns of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) using an X’Pert diffractometer with a monochromated Cu ”R X-ray source (step size of 0.02° and range 2ı ) 10-80°). Figure 1 gives the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, Rb). These patterns compare with those simulated by the program Visualizer Software using the crystallographic data, confirming the monophasic nature of the prepared samples. The absorption spectrum was recorded by a UV-3101PC spectrometer at 300 K from 200 to 2000 nm, and the luminescence was measured by a FL/FS 900 time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer using a Xe lamp at room temperature for MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) solid compounds.
The symbol “ is summation over the valence bands (v) and conduction bands (c), and the symbol s is integration over k vectors in Brillouin zone (BZ). The e 226)Mcv(k) is an electron transition moment between the conduction and valence bands at the k point, and the argument of the  228) function is the energy difference between the conduction and valence bands at k point with absorption of a quantum p 246), (Ec(K) Ev(K) p 246)).
CASTEP calculated the real  15)( 246))1 and imaginary  15)( 246))2) parts of the dielectric function.38 The  15)( 246))2 can be thought of as detailing the real transitions between occupied and unoccupied electronic states. The real and imaginary parts were linked by a Kramers-Kronig transform.41 This transform was used to obtain the real part  15)( 246))1 of the dielectric function. The first-order nonresonant susceptibility at low-frequency region was given by ł(1)( 246))ii ) [ 15)( 246))ii -1]/4 240), and third-order nonresonant susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the first-order susceptibilities at the four different frequencies  246)q,  246)m,  246)n, and  246)p as follows:
The expression is derived from a classical anharmonic oscillator (CAHO) model42 in which m and e are, respectively, electron mass and charge. The lattice constant d and frequency  246)0 are, respectively, 3 Å and 1  2) 1016 rad/sec, and N is unit cell density number with units of cm-3 in the present study.
The structure of NaInP2O7 is illustrated in Figure 2. It consists of a three-dimensional framework of corner sharing InO6 octahedra and P2O7 groups. The sodium ions are located in infinite channels running along [1 0 1] with 6-sided windows, each of which is formed by the edges of two InO6 octahedra and four PO4 tetrahedra. Lateral 3-sided windows are also observed, but they are not of enough space to permit sodium ions to migrate through. 
The crystallographic data of four ternary indium (III) pyrophosphates MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) determined by X-ray were used to calculate electronic band structures of the solid compounds. The calculations of band structures were made by the density functional theory (DFT) with local gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functional37 and performed with the CASTEP code,38,39 which uses a plane wave basis set for the valence electrons and norm-conserving pseudopotential40 for the core states. The number of plane waves included into the basis was determined by a cutoff energy of 450 eV. Pseudo atomic calculations were performed for O 2s22p4, P 3s23p3, In 5s25p1, Na 2s22p63s1, K 3s23p64s1, Rb 4s24p65s1, and Cs 5s25p66s1. The calculating parameters and convergent criteria were set by the default values of CASTEP code.37 The calculations of linear optical properties described in terms of the complex dielectric function.
As shown in Figure 4, the compounds MInP2O7 (M ) K, Rb, Cs) possess three-dimensional (InP2O7)anionic frameworks with one-dimensional tunnels occupied by cations, K+, Rb+, or Cs+. Since the features of the anionic frameworks that built up from corner sharing InO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra are the same, we discuss these structures by taking RbInP2O7 as an example. In RbInP2O7, the tunnels running along [0 0 1] result from stacking of rings formed by the edges of three octahedra and four tetrahedra (Figure 5). Adjacent layers are generated by c-glide plane and these layers form a threedimensional network with tunnels running along the c-axis.
The Rb+ cations are located in these tunnels, realizing a 10-fold coordination with Rb-O distances ranging from 2.871(3) to 3.396(3) Å compared to Shannon’s 3.01 Å.43
Each InO6 group is connected, via In-O-P bonds, to five P2O7 groups: two corners of the InO6 octahedron
The band structures and DOS of KInP2O7 and CsInP2O7 are similar to those of RbInP2O7. It is shown that the valence bands are flat, and the conduction bands are oscillating. The lowest k-point of conduction band is localized at G point and the direct band gap is at about 3.5, 3.7, 3.7, and 3.7 eV for the MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, and Cs), individually. The valence bands between energy -8.0 eV and the Fermi level (0.0 eV) are crowed and mostly formed by the O 2p and P 3p states, but mixings with small In 5s and In 5p states and the valence bands lying about between -21.0 and -16.0 eV are the main contributions from the hybridizations of P 3s and O 2s states for the MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, and Cs), respectively. The other valence bands are separate and they are assigned as M valence orbital states. For example, the valence bands localized at about -23.0 and about -8.5 eV are made from Rb 4p and Rb 5s states, respectively, as shown in Figure 8a. The conduction bands localized about between 4.0
In general, the flexibility of the P2O7 group is remarkable: it is very adaptive to the bonding requirements of the other groups by adjusting the P-O-P bond angle and the configurations of two PO4 tetrahedra. This adaptability is perhaps more striking for MInP2O7 (M ) K, Rb, Cs) in that the height of one P2O7 group corresponds to that of an octahedron, and one P2O7 group alternates with an octahedron (Figure 6).
Figure 9a shows the absorption spectra of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) determined from reflection measurements. From this figure we can see the strongest absorption peaks at about 180 nm (6.89 eV) and shoulder peaks at about 250 nm (4.96 eV) for MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs). Wide transmission ranges from about 400 to 2000 nm for MInP2O7 are also found in this figure. As shown in Figure 9b, two broad emission spectra are obtained from 522 to 622 nm for NaInP2O7 and from 550 to 630 nm for MInP2O7 (M ) Rb, Cs) when a light of wavelength 396 nm excites the pressed micro crystals. We also observe several weak emission peaks centered at about 688, 712, 766, and 824 nm for MInP2O7 (M ) Na, Rb, and Cs).
Now, to evaluate and assign the observed spectra, we examine the linear optical response spectra of MInP2O7 crystals. The calculated imaginary  15)2( 246)) and the real  15)1( 246)) parts of the frequency-dependent dielectric functions are displayed in Figure 10. The part  15)2( 246)) can be used to describe the real transitions between occupied and unoccupied bands.
Furthermore, we have also calculated the atomic site and angular momentum projected DOS of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) to elucidate the nature of the electronic band structures and chemical bonds. From about -3.2 to 0.0 eV the DOS is higher for O 2p states than P 3p states, and from about -9.0 to -4.0 eV the DOS is lower for In 5p states than O 2p states, while we compare the total DOS in Figure 7 with the angular momentum projected DOS for P 3p and O 2p states displayed in Figure 8. These findings show that some electrons from P 3p and In 5p transform into the valence bands and take part in the strong covalence interactions between P and O atoms, and weak covalence interactions between In and O atoms. It is also found that the DOS is much higher for M ns (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs; n ) 2, 3, 4, 5) state than O 2p state from -8.5 to -7.5 eV, and the electrons from M ns states transform into the valence bands and take part in the ionic interactions between M and O atoms mostly. 
In this work, four pyrophosphates MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been synthesized by solid-state reaction and their structures have been determined by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique. These compounds crystallize in monoclinic system with space group P2(1)/c and possess three-dimensional (InP2O7)anionic frameworks with channels occupied by M+ cations. The frameworks are built up from corner sharing of InO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. There are different arrangements of the tunnels between the NaInP2O7 and MInP2O7 (M ) K, Rb, Cs). For the former, the tunnel running along [1 0 1] with 6-sided window is formed by the edges of two InO6 octahedra and four PO4 tetrahedra. For the latter, the tunnel running along [0 0 1] results from stacking of rings formed by the edges of three octahedra and four tetrahedra. 
The observed absorption and luminescence spectra of MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) microcrystals show the first absorption peak at about 260 nm for MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Cs) and at 226 nm for RbInP2O7, and the broad emission spectra from 522 to 622 nm for NaInP2O7 and from 550 to 630 nm for MInP2O7 (M ) Rb, Cs), respectively. The findings indicate that the emission fluorescence of MInP2O7 originates from defects or excitons. The calculated results of crystal band structures by the DFT method show that the solid compounds of MInP2O7 are insulators with direct band gaps of about 3.5 eV for NaInP2O7 and 3.7 eV for MInP2O7 (M ) K, Rb, Cs) crystals. The calculated total and partial density of states indicate that the top valence bands are contributions from the mixings of O 2p and P 3p states and low conduction bands mostly originate from In3+ valence sates in the MInP2O7. The P-O bonds are substantial covalence features and In-O bonds are lesser ones, but the M-O bonds are almost ionic interactions. 
The observed firstand second-absorption peaks are assigned as the charge transfers from the O 2p  240) states and from the mixings between the O 2p and P 3p states to the In3+ valence states, respectively, for the MInP2O7. The calculated susceptibilities of the MInP2O7 crystal (M ) Na, K, Rb,to bottom in the periodic table with the exception of M ) Na. The variation trends of energy gap and susceptibility of the NaInP2O7 is an exception among the MInP2O7 (M ) Na, K, Rb, Cs) crystals. It is due to the different arrangements of the tunnels between the NaInP2O7 and MInP2O7 (M ) K, Rb, Cs).
