The stability of NASICON-type conducting glass–ceramic electrolyte, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (Ohara LICGC)has been characterized after prolonged exposure to deionized water and HCl(aq) solutions supported with LiCl.
X-ray diffraction shows that the bulk crystallographic structure of the LICGC membranes remains unchangedwhen exposed to these solutions.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) shows that the conductivity ofLICGC membranes immersed in deionized water remains stable over a one month period, while there is a significantincrease in resistance when exposed to the acidic solutions.
When exposed to pH 4 and 2 solutions forjust 24 h, the resistances of the LICGC membrane increase by a factor of 8.5 and 23.5, respectively.
EIS coupledwith morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy, shows that this resistance growth is dueto the development of a surface layer on the LICGC membrane.
However, this substantial increase in resistancecan be mitigated by adding LiCl to the HCl solutions.
For a pH 4 solution supported with 6.75 M LiCl, the impedance spectrum and surface morphology are qualitatively comparable to pristine, dry LICGC material,suggesting that surface layer formation was suppressed.
This was also confirmed via cyclic voltammetry measurementsin four-electrode electrochemical cells.
