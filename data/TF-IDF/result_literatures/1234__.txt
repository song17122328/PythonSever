Amorphous a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) Ô¨Åne powder with the composition of Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 in Li2OeAl2O3 eTiO2eP2O5 system was prepared directly from a mixture of Li2O, g-Al2O3, TiO2, and P2O5 as starting materials, by using a mechanical milling (MM) technique at room temperature. A NASICON-type Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) (c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) solid solution was obtained by the heat treatment of mechanochemically prepared amorphous a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) material. The sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet  1 at room temperature and activation showed high lithium ion conductivity of the order of 10  1. The high-conducting lithium ion c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) solid electrolyte Ô¨Åne energy of about 35 kJ mol powders were investigated as surface modiÔ¨Åcation materials of LiCoO2 cathode in lithium cells using nonaqueous electrolyte solutions. The c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes exhibited high ca 1) and good cycle performance with a high charge cut-off potential of 4.5 V (vs. Li/ pacity (ca. 180 mAh g √æ ) in lithium cell. The increase in the electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance for the LiCoO2 electrode Li modiÔ¨Åed with c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) Ô¨Åne powder was inhibited.

LiCoO2 positive electrodes have been used in most commercial lithium ion secondary batteries with nonaqueous electrolyte solutions. In the development of high-performance storage batteries, it is necessary to enhance the energy density of the lithium ion secondary battery. LiCoO2 electrodes show good cycle performance with respect to Li metal at the charging voltage lower than 4.2 V. Although LiCoO2 cathodes charged at voltages higher than 4.2 V (vs. √æ Li/Li ) show high capacities and make high voltage operation

possible, their capacities decrease drastically during cycling [1,2]. Chen and Dahn reported that the improved cycling behavior was caused by the reduction in the contact area between LiCoO2 and electrolyte [2]. The decrease in capacity was ascribed to the side reactions between nonaqueous electrolyte solutions and LiCoO2 surface [2,3]. In fact, the oxidative decomposition of nonaqueous electrolyte solutions is enhanced signiÔ¨Åcantly at voltages higher √æ than 4.2 V (vs. Li/Li ). As a result, the electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance will increase, and the high-power performance of the cell will decrease remarkably.

Many researchers have reported that modifying LiCoO2 with metal oxides, such as ZrO2 [2,4e6], Al2O3 [4e7], SiO2 [4,5], TiO2 [6], and MgO [8e10], improves the electrode performance. Forexample, LiCoO2 modiÔ¨Åed with ZrO2 has been reported to show better cycle performance than LiCoO2, when charged at high √æ voltage of 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li ) [2]. With the modiÔ¨Åcation with insulating oxide materials, enhancement in the life cycle is expected. However, they may hinder lithium ion transfer and cause increase in the interfacial resistance of electrodes and electrolytes. The modiÔ¨Åcation agent, which has high lithium ion conductivity and inhibits the side reaction at the interface of electrolytes and electrodes, will enhance both the cycle stability and high-power performance.

Lithium-ion-conducting solid electrolytes with inorganic solids with high lithium ion conductivity at room temperature have been reported, such as NASICON-type LiM2(PO4)3 (M ¬º tetravalent cation, e.g., Ti, Ge)-based ceramics composed of both MO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, which are linked by their corners to form a threedimensional network structure [11e13]. LiTi2(PO4)3-based solid electrolytes were prepared by a solid-state reaction in air. Their applications are electrochemical energy devices, such as all solidstate lithium secondary batteries [14,15] and lithium/air secondary batteries [16,17], because they exhibit lithium ion conductivity  1 at room temperature [11e13] and are stable as high as 10 in air and water [16,17]. The conductivity of ca. x ¬º 0.3 composition in the Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (LATP) formula was the highest for the LiTi2(PO4)3 system [13]. In addition, NASICON-type solid electrolytes are expected to show high electrochemical oxidative decomposition in lithium cells. For example, NASICON-type LiGe2(PO4)3based solid electrolytes have been reported to show high electro√æ chemical oxidative potential of about 6 V (vs. Li/Li ) [18]. Therefore, NASICON-type solid electrolytes are expected to show high electrochemical oxidative decomposition in lithium cells.

On the other hand, much attention has been paid to the mechanical milling (MM) technique using a high-energy ball mill as one of the new preparation procedures for inorganic solid electrolytes, such as ZrO2-based [19] or Bi2O3-based oxide ion conductors [20], and Li2S-based conductors with high lithium-ion conductivity [21e23]. The samples prepared mechanochemically by using MM processes are directly used as battery materials without pulverizing procedures, because they are obtained as Ô¨Åne powder. Hence, an increase in the contact interface of electrode and electrolyte is expected. Here, we try to prepare a high-performance LiCoO2 cathode modiÔ¨Åed with c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) solid-electrolyte Ô¨Åne powder that has a high lithium-ion conductivity, prepared by MM. In this study, amorphous (a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) Ô¨Åne powder with the composition of

Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) in Li2OeAl2O3eTiO2eP2O5 system was synthesized directly from a mixture of starting materials Li2O, gAl2O3, TiO2, and P2O5, using MM technique at room temperature. NASICON-type Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) (c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) solid electrolyte with high lithium-ion conductivity was prepared by the heat treatment of a-LATP materials. Chargeedischarge cycling behavior and electrode/electrolyte interphase impedance of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes were investigated for a charge √æ cut-off potential of 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li ) in a lithium cell using nonaqueous electrolyte solutions.

Reagent-grade g-Al2O3, Li2O, P2O5, and anatase-type TiO2 were used as starting materials. Mechanical milling treatment was

carried out on the mixture of starting materials using a planetary ball mill (Fritsch, p-7) with a rotation speed of 450 rpm at room temperature in dry Ar atmosphere. Stainless steel pots and zirconia balls were used for planetary ball milling. The volumes of pots and the number of balls were 45 mL and 10, respectively. Balls-tomixture weight ratios ranging from 10:1 to 20:1 were employed using balls with diameters of 10 mm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Rigaku, MiniFlex) with Cu Ka radiation were performed to identify the crystalline phase of the product powder obtained by mechanical milling treatment. The measurement conditions were set as follows: tube voltage was 30 kV; tube cur 1; diffraction angle, 5e80; and rent, 15 mA; scan speed, 2 min sampling width, 0.01. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) (Rigaku, Thermo plus TG8120) measurement was performed to the powder obtained by MM treatment under air Ô¨Çow from room temperature  1 heating rate. Particle size and to 1000 C at a 10 morphology was estimated by SEM (JEOL, JSM-6510) observations. 2.2. Preparation of sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet and its conductivity measurements

A pellet-type sample was obtained by cold-pressing the amorphous powder (a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) prepared by mechanical milling. The sample was sintered at 900 C for 10 h in air. Electrical conductivity was measured for sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellets with the diameter and thickness of 10 mm and about 1 mm, respectively. Au paste was applied over the pellets, and the pellets were then calcined at 850 C for 2 h to prepare the electrodes. Then, AC impedance measurement was carried out in air using an impedance analyzer (Ivium, IviumStat) in the temperature range of 25e 70 C. The frequency range and applied voltage were 0.1 Hze1 MHz and 20 mV, respectively.

Charge/discharge measurements for the cycle performance at  2 during the Ô¨Årst cycle and constant current densities of 0.2 mA cm  2 from the second cycle to the last cycle were carried 0.5 mA cm out for the 2032 coin cells at room temperature by using a battery test system (Hokuto Denko, HJ1001SM8). These cells have a lithium metal counter electrode (Honjo chemical, lithium foil of 0.5 mm thickness) and a working electrode. The working electrodes were fabricated from LiCoO2 or mechanically milled c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder mixed with LiCoO2 (85 wt%), acetylene black (AB, 5 wt%), and polyvinylidene Ô¨Çuoride (PVDF, 10 wt%). In this experiment, the

mechanically milled NASICON powder and LiCoO2 were manually mixed by pestle and agate mortar at room temperature. The contents of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) vs. LiCoO2 were 1, 5, and 20 wt%. Next, these mixtures and acetylene black were again mixed manually. The powder was mixed with PVDF binder solution with 1-methyl2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as solvent. This slurry was painted on the Al sheet of current collector and dried at 80 C. It was pressed and  3 LiPF6 in dried in vacuum at 120 C. The electrolyte was 1 mol dm solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (3:7 volume ratio). Chargeedischarge measurements were carried out at the cut-off potential range from 3.0 to 4.5 V √æ versus Li/Li at room temperature. AC impedance spectroscopy measurements for the cells were carried out by using an impedance analyzer (Ivium, IviumStat). The frequency range and applied voltage were 10 mHze100 kHz and 5 or 20 mV, respectively.

is basically observed after milling for 20 h although the peaks due to anatase-type TiO2 and rutile-type TiO2 are very slightly observed. The amorphous phase will be formed by the mechanochemical reaction by using g-Al2O3, Li2O, P2O5, and anatase-type TiO2 as a starting material. Amorphous material (a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) in the Li2OeAl2O3eTiO2eP2O5 system will be synthesized at room temperature using the MM method. Fig. 1(b) shows the XRD pattern of

c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder after the heat treatment of a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder at 850 C for 2 h, showing the diffraction pattern assigned to LiTi2(PO4)3 compound with NASICON-type structure. Fig. 2 shows the DTA curve of a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder. An exothermic peak is observed near 600 C (exothermic onset temperature: 575 C) during the heating processes. This result is assigned to the crystallization of amorphous material, and it indicates the validity

to the results of XRD measurements shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of (a) a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder prepared by MM and (b) c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder obtained by heat treatment of a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder at 850 C for 2 h. The roundish particles with diameter less than 1 mm are observed for a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder in Fig. 3(a). Probably existence of amorphous particles is suggested. It will be because it has an isotropic conÔ¨Åguration. On the other hand, from the SEM image of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder in Fig. 3(b), some square particles are observed by the heat treatment of a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder. Such results also suggest the crystallization of amorphous material. Fig. 4 shows the results of the AC impedance measurements of sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet obtained from pelletized a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) by sintering at 900 C for 10 h. The diameters of the semicircles of Nyquist plots decreased with the increase in the measurement temperature. The diameters are considered to be the resistance (R) of the sample, and the electrical conductivities are calculated from the following formula. s ¬º √∞1=R√û√∞L=S√û;

where L and S are the thickness and cross-sectional area of sintered pellet sample, respectively. Fig. 5 shows Arrhenius plots of the electrical conductivities of sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet. The sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet  1 at room shows high conductivity of the order of 10 temperature. The total conductivity of bulk and grain boundary is  1 at 25 C. The conductivities for the sintered ca. 1.5  10 sample follow the Arrhenius-type equation: s ¬º s0√∞   Ea=RT√û; where Ea is the activation energy for conduction, s0 is the preexponential factor, and R is the gas constant. The activation energy of the c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) sample is calculated to be about 35 kJ mol in good agreement with that of Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) ceramics obtained by solid reaction method [13]. Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the powder obtained by mixing of LiCoO2 and c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder in agate mortar [(a) LiCoO2, (b) 1 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3), (c) 5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3), (d) 20 wt% cLATP (x ¬º 0.3)]. The images demonstrate that c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) particles are scattered on the surface of LiCoO2 particles. It is observed that the surface of LiCoO2 particles was further coated with the increase in c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) powder. Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes [(a) LiCoO2, (b) 1 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3), (c) 5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3), and (d) 20 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)], which indicate that both c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) and AB powder with PVDF binder modiÔ¨Åed the surface of LiCoO2 particles. These solid materials function as electric conduction path for electrons and ions, and they will surely prevent the direct contact of LiCoO2 particles with the liquid electrolyte in the cell. Fig. 8 shows the 1st and 30th charge/discharge curves of c-LATP  1) (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes. The horizontal axis (mAh g is based on the weight of LiCoO2. LiCoO2 electrodes with and without c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) exhibited similar polarization behaviors at the 1st cycle. The discharge curves above the charge cut-off po 1. At the tential of 4.5 V exhibit the high capacity of ca. 180 mAh g 30th cycle, LiCoO2 electrode yields larger polarization than LiCoO2 electrodes with c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3). Fig. 9 shows the cycle performance of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes. LiCoO2 electrodes with c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) reduce the capacity degradation of LiCoO2. LiCoO2 electrodes with 5 and 20 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) exhibit high capacities and good cycle performance during 50 cycles. Lithiumion-conducting c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) particles may inhibit the

oxidative decomposition of electrolytes at the LiCoO2 particle surface without preventing the lithium ion transfer.

The electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance was investigated using the AC impedance technique. Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plots of Li/c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 cells at 25 C after the 2nd and 5th charge. After two charge cycles, two semicircles were observed in Nyquist plots for all electrodes. In this paper, the semicircles for highand middle-frequency ranges of AC impedance measurements for Li/LiCoO2 cells were attributed on the basis of Refs. [24e27] to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or surface Ô¨Ålm

resistance and charge transfer resistance (Rct), respectively. For high-frequency range, the 1 and 5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes show slightly larger semicircles compared to LiCoO2 electrode. On the other hand, 20 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-

modiÔ¨Åed electrode shows smaller semicircle compared to LiCoO2 electrode. For middle-frequency range, the diameter of the semicircle for 5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrode is the smallest among all electrodes. After the 5th charge cycle, the

diameters of the semicircles of both highand middle-frequency ranges are larger than after the 2nd charge cycle. The semicircle of the middle-frequency range for 5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes remains almost unchanged after the 2nd charge cycle. It is suggested that c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrode inhibits the increase in charge transfer resistance. As a result, c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes can inhibit the capacity decrease during the charge/discharge cycle. The decay of the positive electrode active material upon side reactions, such as the attack of HF on the active material, may be prevented at the interphase of electrolyte and electrode. In addition, it is found that the effects of modiÔ¨Åcation of c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) can be evaluated using the AC impedance technique for charged cells during the early cycles.

We examined the temperature dependence of AC impedance measurements of the cell after the charge. Figs. 11 and 12 show the temperature dependence (5e25 C) of the Nyquist plots of Li/ LiCoO2 and Li/5 wt% c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 cells after the 2nd charge. Open circuit potentials (OCP) of the cells before the AC √æ impedance measurements were stable at 4.48 or 4.49 V (vs. Li/Li ). The charge transfer resistances increase clearly with decreasing measurement temperature. Fig. 13 shows the Arrhenius plots for the charge transfer resistances obtained from the Nyquist plots in Figs. 11 and 12. The activation energies for the charge transfer resistance of LiCoO2 and c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 elec 1, respectively. It is suggested that the trodes are 61 and 55 kJ mol c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åcation of LiCoO2 electrode decreases the activation energy for the charge transfer resistance. A new phase may be formed on the electrode/electrolyte interphase.

Amorphous (a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) Ô¨Åne powder with the composition of Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) in the Li2OeAl2O3eTiO2eP2O5 system was prepared directly from a mixture of starting materials using a mechanical milling (MM) technique at room temperature. NASICON-type Li1√æxAlxTi2 x(PO4)3 (x ¬º 0.3) (c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)) solid solution was formed close to 600 C by the heat treatment of aLATP (x ¬º 0.3). The sintered c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) pellet, obtained by sintering of a-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) at 900 C for 10 h showed high con 1 at room temperature. The cductivity on the order of 10 LATP (x ¬º 0.3) Ô¨Åne powder-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrodes exhibited  1) and good cycle performance at high capacity (around 180 mAh g √æ a high charge cut-off potential of 4.5 V (vs. Li/Li ) in lithium cell. It is suggested that the c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3)-modiÔ¨Åed LiCoO2 electrode inhibits the increase in charge transfer resistance and decreases the activation energy for the charge transfer resistance of LiCoO2 electrode. The high lithium ion conductive c-LATP (x ¬º 0.3) solid electrolytes are promising as modiÔ¨Åcation agents for the modifying

the surface of particles of high-energy-density positive electrode materials that need high charge voltage.
