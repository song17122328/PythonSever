The nanostructured NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) material has been synthesized by Pechini-type polymerizable complexmethod.
The use of water-soluble ammonium citratoperoxotitanate (IV) metal complex instead of alkoxides as precursor allows toprepare monophase material.
Thermal analyses have been carried out on the powder precursor to check the weight loss and synthesistemperature.
X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRD) has been performed on the LTP powder obtained after heating the powderprecursor over a temperature range from 550 to 1050 1C for 2 h.
By varying the molar ratio of citric acid to metal ion (CA/Ti) and citricacid to ethylene glycol (CA/EG), the grain size of the LTP powder could be modified.
The formation of small and well-crystalline grains in the order of 50–125nm in size, has been determined from the XRD patterns and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
The NASICON-type, LTP nanostructured material wassuccessfully prepared by a Pechini-type polymerizablecomplex method.
The method described herein is basedon the formation of highly water-soluble precursors toavoid the use of alkoxides.
A pure phase of LTP powderwas obtained when EG/CA ¼ 1, with a calcination of thepowder precursor in the temperature range from 650 to1050 1C.
Both XRD and TEM showed that nanostructuredparticles of 50 nm size are formed at 650 1C.
This methodallowed us to reduce considerably the synthesis temperatureand synthesis time of this oxide in comparison to theconventional solid-state reaction method and to obtainnanosized powder.
