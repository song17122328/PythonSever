It is believed that there are many issues related to traditional fossil fuel energy supply techniques, such as the climate changes and limited reserves, therefore considerable attention has been paid to renewable energy sources. 

As a consequence, eﬃcient energy storage systems are in high demand to make the best use of the sources. Electrochemical energy storage systems, including batteries and supercapacitors, are some of the most promising energy storage systems with a broad range of applications. Among diﬀerent types of electrochemical energy storage devices, supercapacitors have attracted great interest because of their relatively high power density, fast charge/discharge capability and exceptional cycle life.2–10 Generally, supercapacitors can be classied into two categories depending on the energy storage mechanisms: electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors.11 EDLCs involve reversible adsorption of the ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface without any chemical reactions, which are commonly related to carbon-based materials with high surface area.

In terms of the pseudocapacitors, fast and reversible faradaic reactions at the electrode surface are utilized to contribute the energy storage capability.

Typically, the transition metal oxides,16–18 hydroxides,19,20 suldes21,22 and conducting polymers23 such as polypyrroles,24 polyanilines25 andAs mentioned above, the reversible ion adsorption of the pseudocapacitive materials usually takes place at the electrode surface, which may limit the energy storage capacity. 

It can be deduced that the energy density could be improved if the bulk ion intercalation is achieved because the extra ion adsorption into the active materials will contribute more capacitance. 

From this point of view, it is important to explore appropriate materials which can allow the ion intercalation/deintercalation without the structure destruction. Lukatskaya et al. demonstrated the electrochemical intercalation of cations including Li+, Na+, K+, NH4 +, Mg2+ and Al3+ from aqueous solutions into the two-dimensional Ti3C2 MXene layers.

Li2Ni2(MoO4)3, as a member of NASICON-type compounds, has been studied as positive electrode in lithium batteries.

 In this work, the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 was synthesized via a combustion method.Its electrochemical properties were rstly evaluated inThe Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 compound was synthesized by a combustion method similar to a method described in previous studies.29,31 The sequential synthesis procedures are described in Scheme 1.29,31 The sequential synthesis procedures are described in Scheme 1. Specically, aqueous solutions containing the lithium nitrate, nickel nitrate hexahydrate and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate were homogeneously mixed with an appropriate stoichiometry of Li : Ni : Mo at 1 : 1 : 1. Specically, aqueous solutions containing the lithium nitrate, nickel nitrate hexahydrate and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate were homogeneously mixed with an appropriate stoichiometry of Li : Ni : Mo at 1 : 1 : 1.5.5.

Subsequently, citric acid was added to the solution at stoichiometric amount of 1 : 1 to the total metal ions. The resulted solution was stirred overnight and then heated to boiling at around 100 C to evaporate water. Then the resulted dried precursor was further heated at 180 C to obtain black ash. The ash was ground into powders with a mortar. The single-phase powders of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 in yellow were obtained upon annealing the as-prepared powders at 600 C for 4 h in ambient air. Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 was synthesized using the same method by replacing LiNO3 with NaNO3. Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 was synthesized using the same method by replacing LiNO3 with NaNO3.

The working electrode was prepared by mixing the assynthesized Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 powders with acetylene black and polytetrauoroethylene (PTFE) in a mass ratio of 85 : 10 : 5 in water under magnetic stirring to make slurry. 

Then the slurry was coated onto a piece of Ni foam (1  1 cm2), pressed at 10 MPa, and nally dried at 60 C in a vacuum oven overnight. The mass loading of the active materials on the Ni foam was 1. 

The mass loading of the active materials on the Ni foam was 1.5 mg cmTo fabricate the asymmetric supercapacitor, the as-prepared Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode and an activated carbon (AC) electrode were used as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. 

The AC negative electrode was obtained by mixing the activated carbon (Black Pearl 2000, Cabot) and PTFE at a mass ratio of 95 : 5 in water under constant magnetic stirring. 

The prepared slurry was spread onto a Ni foam (1  1 cm2) and then pressed at 10 MPa and dried at 60 C overnight under vacuum. To assemble the full cell, the negative electrode and positive electrode were face to face placed into a container in which the electrolyte was added.18Physical characterization. The thermal analysis was obtained on a NETZSCH 449 F3 thermal analyzer using simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The phase formation of the products was identied by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) on a Panalytical X'Pert Pro Multi-Purpose Diﬀractometer (MPD) with Cu Kalpha1 radiation working at 45 kV and 40 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (ZEISS SUPRA 55-VP) was applied to observe the sample morphologies. The elemental compositions were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies (EDX) attached to the SEM.

The specic capacitance of the electrode in three-electrode mode was calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves according to the following equation:32(1)  1), I is the constant where Cs is the specic capacitance (F g discharge current (A), Dt is the discharge time (s), m1 is the mass loading of the active materials (g), DV is the potential change excluding the IR drop in the discharge step (V). 

In terms of the two-electrode system, the charge should be balanced between the positive and negative electrodes to obtain high electrochemical performance.The charge stored at the electrode can be calculated by the equation:33(2)  1), DV is the constant where Cs is the specic capacitance (F g potential range of charge–discharge process (V), m is the mass of the active materials (g).As q+ ¼ q , the mass ratio of active material on the positive and negative electrode in a asymmetric supercapacitor can be calculated based on the eqn (2),34Additionally, the specic capacitance of the asymmetric supercapacitor was also calculated from the galvanostatic charge–discharge curves with the same formula:35where m2 is the total mass of the active material in positive and negative electrodes (g).

The energy densities and corresponding power densities of the asymmetric supercapacitor were obtained by the following equations:35,36where E is the energy density, Cs is the capacitor capacitance, V is the capacitor potential window excluding the IR drop, P is the power density and Dt is the discharge time.18The thermal stability and phase formation process of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 was evaluated by simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. 1a shows the typical TG-DSC curves of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 precursor complex, the small endothermic peak at 81 C is due to desorption of adsorbed water while the exothermic peaks between 200 and 600 C can be attributed to the decomposition of the precursors.The total weight loss is about 52 wt%, and itFig.1 TG and DSC curves of (a) the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 precursor complex and (b) the 600C annealed Li2Ni2(MoO4)3.1 TG and DSC curves of (a) the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 precursor complex and (b) the 600C annealed Li2Ni2(MoO4)3.

terminates at around 600 C, indicating the completion of the phase formation reaction. Therefore, the products were annealed at 600 C and the corresponded TG-DSC curves are in Fig. 1b. The phase purity and structure of the synthesized Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 were examined by X-ray diﬀraction (XRD). It can be seen from Fig. 2a, the observed peaks of the sample are consistent with the peaks from the orthorhombic Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 (ICCD 04-009-2490), conrming the formation of a well crystalline single-phase with orthorhombic structure. In addition, the polyhedral structure of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 drawn by CrystalMaker Soware is shown in Fig. 2b. The 3D framework is composed of MoO4 tetrahedron and NiO6 octahedron with Li atoms occupying the sites between them. This open structure could favor the intercalation/ deintercalation of small-sized ions such as Li+ ions which has been conrmed in previous studies.29,30 Not only for lithium ion battery, this property can also be used to develop electrode materials for supercapacitors.

Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy studies (EDX) on selected area indicates the existence of Ni, Mo and O elements (Fig. S1†).

To explore the electrochemical properties of the Li2Ni2 (MoO4)3 material, the prepared electrode was tested using a typical three-electrode system. Fig. 4a presents the CV curves of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode at various scan rate from 1 to 10 mV  1 in the potential range between 0 and 0. 4a presents the CV curves of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode at various scan rate from 1 to 10 mV  1 in the potential range between 0 and 0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 2 M s LiOH aqueous solution. 

The anodic and cathodic peaks indicate the pseudocapacitive behavior of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3, showing good reversibility. The peak positions are slightly changed with the increase of the scan rate but still reversible. In terms of the CV behaviors in 2 M NaOH solution (Fig. 4c), similar results are obtained. But noticeably, the CV curve in Li-based electrolyte displays larger enclosed area than it in Na-based electrolyte at the same scan rate, implying higher capacitance, which means that the charge delivered by the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ ions is higher than that of Na+ ions.The possible reason is that, Li+ ions are much smaller than Na+ ions thus would beFig. 3 Typical SEM images of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 at (a) low and (b) high magniﬁcation.

The inset of (f) shows the impedance in high-frequency region.

The high electrochemical performances of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode such as high capacitance and outstanding rate capability can be attributed to well-connected ber-like structure, which improves the ion transport. Moreover, the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3, as a NASICON-type material, supplies the channels for the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ ions without structure destruction.

It is known that the charge stored in the electrode is contributed by diﬀusion-controlled faradaic process and capacitive process.The specic contribution of diﬀusioncontrolled process and capacitive eﬀects could be quantied by the following equation:40–43where i is the current in CV curves, n is the scan rate and k1, k2 are constants. 

The terms k1n and k2n1/2 represent at a given potential, the current response due to capacitive eﬀects and diﬀusion-controlled faradaic process, respectively. The k1 and k2 can be calculated by plotting i/n1/2 vs. n1/2, thus the fraction of the charge from capacitive eﬀects and diﬀusion-controlled faradaic process could be determined.

 Fig. 5a demonstrates the diﬀusion-controlled contribution to the overall charge  1 in LiOH storage on Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 at scan rate of 5 mV s electrolyte. 50. 50.7% of the capacitance is contributed by the faradaic process and the remaining portion is from the capacitive eﬀects. Fig. 5b compares the diﬀusion-controlled process contribution at diﬀerent scan rates in both LiOH and NaOH. It is clear that the diﬀusion-controlled process dominates the capacitance at lower scan rate, specically, around 80% at 1 mV  1 in both LiOH and NaOH. While the capacitive properties s increase gradually with the increasing scan rates.It should be noted that at each specic scan rate, the diﬀusion-controlled contribution in LiOH is higher than that in NaOH, suggesting that the intercalation/deintercalation of the smaller Li+ ions areFig. 5 (a) Capacitive and diﬀusion-controlled charge storage process at scan rate of 5 mV s diﬀusion-controlled charge storage at various scan rate in LiOH and NaOH electrolyte respectively.

A Na-containing NASICON material with nominal composition Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 was synthesised using the same method to compare the performance with Li2Ni2(MoO4)3.A Na-containing NASICON material with nominal composition Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 was synthesised using the same method to compare the performance with Li2Ni2(MoO4)3. Fig. S2a† shows TG and DSC curves of the Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 precursor complex. Based on the results, the products were annealed at 600 C and the corresponded X-ray XRD patterns are presented in Fig. S2b.

 As no standard data was indexed for the Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 from the database, it is hard to conrm if the single-phase is obtained. Nevertheless, majority of the observed peaks of the sample are consistent with the peaks from Na1. Nevertheless, majority of the observed peaks of the sample are consistent with the peaks from Na1.86Ni2.86Ni2.07(MoO4)3 (ICDD: 00-031-1315) (Fig. S2b†), which may prove that there is a similar structure between the two materials. According to the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3 phase diagram, the solubility limit of Na2 2xNi2+x(MoO4)3 solid solution lies at 0 # x # 0. According to the Na2MoO4–NiMoO4–Fe2(MoO4)3 phase diagram, the solubility limit of Na2 2xNi2+x(MoO4)3 solid solution lies at 0 # x # 0.7.7.44 Therefore Na1.44 Therefore Na1.86Ni2.86Ni2.07(MoO4)3 (x ¼ 0.07(MoO4)3 (x ¼ 0.07) and Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 (x ¼ 0) should exhibit the same structure.

The electrochemical properties of nominal Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 in diﬀerent electrolyte LiOH and NaOH are demonstrated in Fig. S3. S3.

The nominal Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 exhibits higher capacitance in LiOH than in NaOH, implying the charge delivered by the intercalation/deintercalation of Li+ ions is higher than that of Na+ ions. It can deduce that in the Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 lattice, Li+ ions are easier to be intercalated/deintercalated than Na+ ions, which could be attributed to the smaller size of Li+ ions. 

The highest  1 at capacitance of nominal Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 performed is 835 F g  1 in LiOH, which is still lower than the value obtained by 1 A g  1). The Na2Ni2(MoO4)3 also shows Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 (1137 F g a larger resistance than Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 (Fig. S3d†). Similar to the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3, the capacitance contribution of diﬀusioncontrolled process is larger in LiOH at a given scan rate, while the percentage decreases gradually with the increase of the scan rate in both LiOH and NaOH (Fig. S4†). In conclusion, the overall performance of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 is better than Na2Ni2(MoO4)3. In conclusion, the overall performance of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 is better than Na2Ni2(MoO4)3.

To further investigate the electrochemical performances of Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 under practical conditions, we have assembledan asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) by employing the prepared Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode as positive electrode and AC electrode as negative electrode. 

The electrochemical properties of AC electrode exhibits typical features of double layer capacitors (see more details in Fig. S5†). A series of CV measurements at  1 to diﬀerent voltage windows were performed at 5 mV s determine the optimal working potential of the ASC.

 According to the Fig. 6a, the stable operating voltage window can be extended as high as 1. 6a, the stable operating voltage window can be extended as high as 1.7 V, and the polarization curve becomes very obvious when the potential increases to 1.7 V, and the polarization curve becomes very obvious when the potential increases to 1.8 V, indicating severe electrolysis of water. 

Therefore, all the measurements of the ASC were carried out between 0 and 1. Therefore, all the measurements of the ASC were carried out between 0 and 1.7 V. Fig. 6b depicts the CV behaviors of the ASC at diﬀerent scan rates ranging from 1 to  1. 6b depicts the CV behaviors of the ASC at diﬀerent scan rates ranging from 1 to  1. 

It should be noticed that the ASC performs quasi20 mV s rectangular CV curves in all scans, illustrating that the capacitance is contributed by both electric double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. The charge–discharge curves measured  1 are shown in Fig. 6c. at the current densities from 0. at the current densities from 0.5 to 20 A g 

The discharge curves are nonlinear especially at lower current densities, suggesting combination eﬀects of the electric doublelayer capacitance and pseudocapacitance for the ASC, which coincides with the above CV results. The specic capacitance calculated from the GCD curves is presented in Fig. 6d. The  1, and the capacitance is 93 F g  1, which is value gradually deceases to 73 F g comparable with some previous ASCs.45,46 Impressively, the asfabricated asymmetric supercapacitor reveals excellent rate  1: the capacitances are 67, 64, 62 and capability from 5 to 20 A g  1, respec59 F g tively. 

To further investigate the durability of the asymmetric supercapacitor, the cycling performance was evaluated at 2 A  1 (Fig. 6e). The specic capacitance decreases about 20% of g the initial value for the rst 2000 cycles, which might be caused by the dissolution of the active materials47 and the destruction of the electrode under rapid redox reactions.48 The electrode experiences a decrease around 10% of the capacitance during the rest 8000 cycles, demonstrating excellent electrochemicalIn summary, we have successfully synthesized the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 through a combustion method. 

The Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performances and it displays higher specic capacitance in LiOH than in NaOH, which can be attributed to the easier intercalation/deintercalation of small Li+ ions in the NASICON-type structure.The specic capacitance  1 in 2 M LiOH, and still maintains reaches 1137 F gMoreover, in an asymmetric supercapacitor 63% at 20 A g (ASC) with an activated carbon electrode as negative electrode, it  1 at the average delivers energy density as high as 36.The specic capacitance  1 in 2 M LiOH, and still maintains reaches 1137 F gMoreover, in an asymmetric supercapacitor 63% at 20 A g (ASC) with an activated carbon electrode as negative electrode, it  1 at the average delivers energy density as high as 36.5 W h kg  1, the power density of 420 W kg capacitance retains 68% of the initial value, showing reasonably good stability. 

The remarkable specic capacitance with reasonable cycling stability suggest the potential of the Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 to be used as a high-performance candidate for energy storage.
