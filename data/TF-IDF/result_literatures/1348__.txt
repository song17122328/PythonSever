Polyanionic  compounds  with  3D  framework  structure  were fully  studied  as  cathode  of  lithium  battery  over  the  last  decades  due to  quick  lithium  ion  diffusion,  stable  structure,  and  easy  preparation,  low  cost  and  so  on  [1–4].  In  this  context,  much  attention  was given  to  phosphates  [2–4].  However,  only  very  little  is  known  so far  of  the  behavior  of  Ti4+-containing  polyanionic  materials  toward lithium  insertion.

The  Nasicon-type  LiTi2(PO4)3 has  attracted  a  signiﬁcant  interest for  applications  in  all-solid-state  rechargeable  lithium-ion  batteries  as  solid  lithium  ion  electrolytes  [5,6].  However,  few  reports  on electrochemical  properties  of  this  compound  as  lithium  intercalation  electrode  materials  for  reversible  lithium  batteries  were  found. LiTi2(PO4)3 has  a  rhombohedral  (space  group:  R3c)  structure  with an  open  three-dimensional  framework  of  TiO6 oc tahedra  sharing  all  corners  with  PO4 tetrahedra  and  vice  versa.  Li+ ions  occupy the  interstitial  spaces,  either  18e  or  6b  sites.  Therefore,  Nasicontype  LiTi2(PO4)3 can  be  used  not  only  as  solid-state  electrolytes, but  also  as  lithium-storage  materials  in  rechargeable  lithium  batteries,  based  on  their  structural  characteristics.  In  the  late  1980s, Delmas  was  the  ﬁrst  to  show  the  possible  lithium  insertion  into LiTi2(PO4)3 [7–11].  LiTi2(PO4)3 may   reversibly  insert  two  lithium ions,  operating  on  the  Ti4+/Ti3+ at  2.48  V  vs.  Li+/Li,  according  to

a  two-phase  mechanism  between  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  Li3Ti2(PO4)3 [7,12,13].  LiTi2(PO4)3 is  an  interesting  cathode  electrode  material  for  2.5–2.6  V  polymer  lithium  batteries  containing  Li  at  the negative  electrode  [7],   and  it  is  also  a  promising  anode  electrode  material  in  aqueous  rechargeable  lithium  batteries  [1,12,13]. However,  the  low  intrinsic  electronic  conductivity  of  these  3-D phosphates  is  a  major  drawback  for  possible  applications.  Tremendous  effort  has  been  devoted  to  improving  the  performance  of these  compounds.  The  results  clearly  show  that  both  particle  size reduction  and  intimate  contact  with  a  highly  conductive  material (usually  carbon)  improve  the  performance  as  a  battery  cathode  by reducing  the  solid  phase  diffusion  thickness  for  lithium  ions  and increasing  the  overall  electronic  conductivity  for  electron  transport [14,15].

The  most  common  and 

to  prepare LiTi2(PO4)3 is  the  solid-state  reaction  synthesis.  This  approach, nevertheless,  suffers  from  the  problems  of  complicated  producing  processes  including  grinding,  ball  milling,  and  subsequent  heat treatment  generally  at  1000 ◦C  until  the  crystalline  LiTi2(PO4)3 formed  [1,13,16],  which  inevitably  induces  high  energy  consumption  and  large  particle  sizes  of  the  product.  Therefore,  LiTi2(PO4)3 synthesized  following  the  classical  solid-state  reaction  show  poor electrochemical  properties.

In  this  work,  LiTi2(PO4)3 was   ﬁrstly  synthesized  by  a  polyethylene  glycol  (PEG-2000)  assisted  sol–gel  method,  then  it  was   ball milled  with  acetylene  black  to  form  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite. The  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  shows  superior  electrochemical properties  as  lithium  intercalation  electrode  material  for  reversible lithium  batteries.

Certain  amount  of  PEG-2000  was  dissolved  in  distilled  water. Then  stoichiometric  amount  of  Li2CO3,  TiO2,  and  NH4H2PO4 were dispersed  in  the  PEG  solution  under  constant  stirring  at  80 ◦C  to form  an  emulsion,  and  then  the  emulsion  product  was   dried  at 150 ◦C  to  form  the  precursor.  The  precursor  was  grounded  and  then sintered  at  450 ◦C  for  4  h  under  an  argon  atmosphere.  Following that,  the  pre-sintered  mixture  was  calcined  at  850 ◦C  in  argon  atmosphere  for  12  h  to  form  LiTi2(PO4)3.  The  as-prepared  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  acetylene  black  (the  weight  ratio  is  85:15)  were  ball-milled  in  a planetary  ball  mill  (PM  200)  at  400  rpm  for  3  h  to  yield  LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite.

The  precursorwas  analyzed  by  thermogravimetry  (TG)  using  a Thermogravimetric–differential  Thermal  analyzer  (Standard  Type High  temp.  Type,  Rigaku).  The  tests  were  conducted  in  N2 atmosphere.

The  structures  of  synthesized  samples  were  characterized  by X-ray  diffraction  spectroscopy  (XRD).  X-ray  powder  diffraction data  were  obtained  using  a  Rigaku  D/MAX-2500  powder  diffractometer  with  a  graphite  monochromatic  and  Cu  K␣   radiation ( 2)

  =  0.15418  nm)   in  the  2  range  of  10–80◦. Scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  images  of  the  samples were  collected  on  the  FEG  SEM  Sirion  scanning  electron  microscope,  which  was  used  to  observe  the  particle  morphology,  particle size  and  particle  size  distribution.  The  transmission  electron microscopy  (TEM)  images  were  collected  using  Hitachi  H-800 transmission  electron  microscope  at  an  acceleration  voltage  of 200  kV.

The  cathodes  for  lithium  cells  were  fabricated  by  mixing  the cathode  material,  carbon  black,  and  polyvinylidene  diﬂuoride (PVDF)  binder  in  a  weight  ratio  of  85:10:5.  The  testing  cells  were assembled  with  the  cathodes  thus  fabricated,  metallic  lithium anode,  celgard  2300  ﬁlm  separator  and  1  M  LiPF6 in  1:1  ethylene carbonate  (EC)/dimethyl  carbonate  (DMC)  electrolyte.  The  assembly  of  the  testing  cells  was  carried  out  in  an  argon-ﬁlled  glove  box, where  water  and  oxygen  concentrations  were  kept  less  than  5  ppm. The  discharge–charge  cycle  tests  were  run  at  different  current  of 0.1  C,  0.5  C,  1  C,  2  C,  5  C  and  10  C  (140  mA   g−1 was  assumed  to  be  1  C rate)  densities  between  3.5  and  1.5  V.  All  the  tests  were  performed at  room  temperature.

Cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  tests  were  performed  on  a  Zahner  Zennium  electrochemical  workstation.  CV  tests  were  carried  out  at  a scan  rate  of  1  mV   s−1 on  the  potential  interval  1.5–3.5  V  (vs.  Li+/Li).

Fig.  1  shows  the  thermogravimetric  (TG)  curve  of  the  precursor  obtained  over  the  temperature  range  from  room  temperature (17 ◦C)  to  1000 ◦C.  Three  distinct  regions  of  weight-loss  are  found  in the  regions  of  17–250,  250–450  and  450–1000 ◦C.  The  ﬁrst  weightloss  region,  i.e.  before  250 ◦C  is  mainly  attributed  to  the  release  of little  physical  adsorbed  water  and  the  decomposition  of  NH4H2PO4 (ca.  6  wt.%).  The  steep  weight  loss,  which  occurs  between  250  and 450 ◦C,  arises  from  the  decomposition  of  PEG  and  H3PO4 (formed  by the  decomposition  of  NH4H2PO4).  Following  that,  there  is  a  subtle, continuous  weight  loss  (around  4%)  from  450  to  1000 ◦C,  which is  attributed  to  the  formation  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 with  the  release  of

H2O  and  CO2.  Based  on  the  TG  data,  we  chose  to  use  a  calcining temperature  of  450 ◦C  to  prepare  the  pre-sintered  material.

Fig.  2  shows  the  XRD  patterns  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C composite.  All  the  reﬂections  in  both  the  samples  could  be  indexed on  the  basis  of  a  rhombohedral  LiTi2(PO4)3 structure  with  a  space group  of  R3c  (JCPDS:  35-0754)  without  any  detectable  impurity phases.  Nevertheless,  no  detectable  reﬂections  corresponding  to carbon  could  be  seen  in  the  XRD  pattern  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  composite  due  to  its  low  content  and  amorphous  structure.  The  most common  and  traditional  method  to  prepare  LiTi2(PO4)3 is  the  solidstate  reaction  synthesis.  The  raw  materials  should  be  sintered  at 1000 ◦C  until  the  crystalline  LiTi2(PO4)3 formed.  Using  this  PEG assisted  sol–gel  method,  single  phase  LiTi2(PO4)3 can  be  obtained at  a  much  lower  temperature  (850 ◦C)  than  the  classic  solid-state reaction  synthesis.  This  is  may   be  due  to  PEG  is  a  good  dispersant and  nonionic  surfactant  that  can  facilitate  particle  growth.

SEM  and  TEM  images  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 are  shown  in  Fig.  3a and  b,  respectively.  The  LiTi2(PO4)3 is  composed  of  irregular  micrometer-sized  particles.  The  range  of  particles  size  is ␮m.   After  ball  milling  with  acetylene  black,  the  morphology 2–10  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 changed  a  lot.  Fig.  3c  presents  a  scanning  electron microscopy  (SEM)  image  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C.  The  image  shows

that  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  is  composed  of  submicro  particles,  and few  submicro  particles  agglomerate.  However,  the  acetylene  black could  not  be  identiﬁed  by  the  SEM  analysis  but  required  transmission  electron  microscopy  (TEM)  analysis.  Fig.  3d  shows  a  TEM image  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C.  As  indicated  by  the  inset  in  Fig.  3d,  the AB  carbon,  instead  of  forming  a  ﬁne  layer  around  the  individual LiTi2(PO4)3 particles,  assumed  a  particulate  form  and  dispersed among  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles.  The  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles  with  particles  15–30  nm  in  size  are  in  intimate  contact  with  the  dispersed carbon  particles  so  that  clusters  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles  are  interconnected  by  a  network  of  carbon  particles.  The  acetylene  black particles  contribute  to  the  form  of  network,  which  can  interconnect the  isolated  particles,  so  that  the  electrons  can  be  readily  transmitted  to  the  sites  where  redox  reactions  take  place.  Moreover,  it  has been  shown  by  several  researchers  that  the  morphology  can  make an  important  effect  on  electrochemical  performance  of  samples. The  process  of  Li+ intercalate  the  cathode  is  a  diffusion  process. Therefore  the  small  grains  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  that  would  lead  to  a short  path  for  Li+ is  advantageous  to  intercalation.  For  these  reason, LiTi2(PO4)3/C  has  large  discharge  capacity  and  rate  capability  as  it will  be  shown  and  discussed  in  the  following  section.  The  reduced

crystalline  LiTi2(PO4)3 phase  is  well-surrounded  by  the  amorphous acetylene  black  phases.  This  homogeneously  mixed  morphology,  as shown  by  the  schematic  description  in  Fig.  3e,  may   be  beneﬁcial  to provide  good  electrical  contact  between  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles and  limit  the  growth  of  particles.

Fig.  4  compares  the  rate  capabilities  (at  0.1–10  C  rates) of  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite.  Fig.  4a  and b  illustrate  the  discharge/charge  evolution  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite,  respectively,  as  a  function  of rate  ranging  from  0.1  to  10  C.  The  discharge–charge  proﬁles  of both  samples  appear  with  the  typical  voltage  plateau  attributed to  the  two-phase  reaction  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  Li3Ti2(PO4)3 system.  At  a  slow  rate  (0.1  C),  the  discharge  curves  are  characterized  by  a  plateau  at  about  2.4  V,  which  corresponds  to  the reaction  LiTi2(PO4)3 +  xLi+ +  xe− →   Li1+xTi2(PO4)3.  At  0.1  C,  the  electrode  capacities  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite are  129.8  and  140.7  mAh   g−1,  respectively.  It  can  be  calculated that  pristine  LiTi2(PO4)3 insert  1.88  mol   of  lithium  per  mole  of LiTi2(PO4)3,  and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  insert  2.40  mol   of lithium  per  mole  of  LiTi2(PO4)3.  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite shows  higher  capacity  than  LiTi2(PO4)3.  The  higher  capacity  is

attributed  to  the  presence  of  the  conductive  carbon  phase  that embeds  and  connects  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 nanoparticles  and  to  the small  particle  size  of  the  composite  that  facilitates  ionic  transport  across  the  interfaces  between  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles  and  the electrolyte.  It  is  interesting  that  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  can insert  more  lithium  ions  than  the  value  reported  by  Delmas  et  al. [7–11],  and  the  reason  needs  further  researches.  It  is  clear  that,  as the  current  density  increases,  the  speciﬁc  capacity  decreases,  while the  charge/discharge  polarization  becomes  more  pronounced.

However,  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 delivers  much  lower  discharge  capacities  at  high  current  densities  than  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  composite; e.g.,  41.8  and  91.3  mAh   g−1 at  1400  mA  g−1 (10  C)  are  obtained  for LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C,  corresponding  to  32.2%  and  64.9% of  their  discharge  capacities  at  14  mA   g−1 (0.1  C)  as  summarized in  Fig.  4c  and  d,  respectively.  The  high  rate  (or  fast)  charge  and discharge  capability  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  can  be  greatly  improved because  of  the  improved  kinetics  provided  by  electronically  conducting  carbon  network  existed  in  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite.

nanocomposite  at  different  rates.  Noticeably,  capacity  fading  is somewhat  more  pronounced  at  the  lower  rates,  especially  for LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite.  The  increased  capacity  fading  at  low rates  is  a  common  observation  in  nanometric  cathodic  materials and  probably  results  from  a  combination  of  increased  reactivity  towards  the  electrolyte  and  prolonged  contact  between  the active  material  and  electrolyte  [17].  In  any  case,  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite  exhibits  a  good  electrochemical  response  in  terms of  both  capacity  and  cycling  properties  over  a  wide  range  of  rate capabilities.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  both  the  lithium  ion  conduction  and  electronic  conduction  play  a  critical  role  in  controlling the  electrochemical  properties  of  electrode  materials.  LiTi2(PO4)3/C composite  has  much  smaller  particles  than  LiTi2(PO4)3,  and  a smaller  lithium  diffusion  length  in  the  sample  will  lead  to  better  electrochemical  properties.  Besides,  in  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  composite, the  uniformly  distributed  carbon  particles  formed  a  network  of electrically  conductive  paths  among  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 particles,  so the  active  LiTi2(PO4)3 material  can  be  fully  utilized  for  lithium extraction  and  insertion  reactions.

Fig.  6  compares  the  cyclic  voltammograms  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite.  A  pair  of  redox  peaks  is  observed for  both  samples.  The  peak  observed  in  the  cathodic  sweep  and the  peak  observed  in  the  anodic  sweep  are  characteristic  of  the insertion  and  removal  of  Li  into/from  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/Li3Ti2(PO4)3 structure.  The  redox  peaks  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 are  located  at  2.111  and 2.849  V,  while  the  redox  peaks  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  are  located  at  2.321 and  2.719  V.  The  voltage  difference  between  the  anodic  and  the cathodic  peaks  can  reﬂect  the  degree  of  polarization  of  the  electrode.  The  potential  difference  between  the  anodic  and  cathodic peaks  (Ep)  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 is  found  to  be  0.738  V,  indicating a  serious  polarization  behavior,  which  is  due  to  the  very  limited  electrical  conductivity  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3.  The  LiTi2(PO4)3/C Ep  compared  with nanocomposite  has  the  much  lower  value  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3,  showing  the  weak  polarization  and  good  reversibility  of  the  electrode.  This  is  consistent  with  the  excellent  rate capability  and  cycle  performance  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite.  Moreover,  the  CV  proﬁle  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  composite  exhibits the  higher  peak  current,  which  facilitates  the  kinetic  process  of  the electrochemical  reactions,  indicative  of  a  higher  speciﬁc  capacity.  In a  word,  as  compared  with  the  LiTi2(PO4)3,  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  has  more  intense  anodic  and  cathodic  peaks,  less  polarization Ep),  indicating  an  improved  speciﬁc  capacity,  cycle  perfor(lower  mance,  and  rate  capability.

To  show  the  advantage  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite,  a comparison  of  cycle  performance  at  different  C  rates  between  samples  LiTi2(PO4)3 and  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  was   performed and  shown  in  Fig.  5.  The  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  shows  much  better  cyclic performance  than  the  LiTi2(PO4)3(see  Fig.  5c).  The  discharge  capacities  of  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  after  100  cycles  at  0.1,  0.5,  1.0,  2.0,  and  5.0  C are  105.7,  95.2,  91.2,  85.8,  and  78.8  mAh   g−1,  respectively.  Even at  a  high  rate  of  10  C,  the  discharge  capacity  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite  is  74.4  mAh   g−1 after  100  cycles,  retaining  approximately  81.5%  of  the  initial  capacity.  However,  the  discharge capacity  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3 is  only  26.8  mAh   g−1 after  100  cycles, retaining  approximately  64.1%  of  the  initial  capacity.  The  data demonstrate  the  excellent  capacity  retention  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C

The  micrometer-sized  LiTi2(PO4)3 has  been  successfully  synthesized  by  a  PEG  based  sol–gel  route.  Then  we  developed  a  simple method  to  transform  micrometer-sized  LiTi2(PO4)3 powders  into a  new  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  by  a  ball-milling  technique.  According  to  the  electrochemical  studies,  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C nanocomposite  delivered  the  higher  discharge  capacity  at  different C  rates  when  compared  to  bare  LiTi2(PO4)3.  In  addition,  the  composite  showed  better  capacity  retention  upon  extended  cycling  at all  of  the  C  rates  examined.  The  improved  rate  capability  and  cycling performance  of  the  LiTi2(PO4)3/C  nanocomposite  is  ascribed  to  the reduction  of  LiTi2(PO4)3 particle  size  and  the  formation  of  uniform  electrically  conductive  carbon  network,  leading  to  a  better electrochemical  reversibility.
