Thick ®lms of NASICON (Na conductor, Na3Zr2Si2PO12) were prepared for the fabrication of a planar CO2 sensor. The powder of a precursor of NASICON, derived through a sol±gel process, was screen-printed on an alumina substrate and converted into a NASICON thick ®lm by calcination. The formation of crystalline NASICON was almost complete after calcination at 900 and 10008C, but the ®lms remained rather poor in densi®cation. On the other hand, the ®lms were densi®ed after calcination at 11008C or above, but NASICON phase disappeared by decomposition. The planar CO2 sensor device was thus fabricated by using the NASICON thick ®lm (30 mm thick) calcined at 10008C. The device attached with a binary carbonate auxiliary phase (Li2CO3±BaCO3) showed fairly good CO2 sensing properties at 450±6008C, despite rather poor densi®cation of the thick ®lm used. # 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A compact carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor has been demanded for monitoring or controlling CO2 in various spaces. The ®rst potentiometric device for CO2 detection, reported about two decades ago [1], was a concentration cell of CO2 using a metal carbonate (K2CO3) as a solid electrolyte diaphragm. This was followed by a proposal of a simpler probe-type potentiometric CO

2 sensor, in which a metal carbonate (Na2CO3) as an auxiliary phase was combined with a disk of NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, Na ionic conductor) solid electrolyte [2]. This device worked fairly well under ideal conditions but was unable to overcome various problems encountered in practice. We found that the device could be improved when the metal carbonate was replaced by a Na2CO3-based binary carbonate system, such as Na2CO3±BaCO3 or a Li2CO3-based one such as Li2CO3± CaCO3 and Li2CO3±BaCO3 [3±5]. The device improved in this way has much increased feasibility in practice [6], but it still remains prototype in structure. Its electrochemical cell is fabricated into a laminated type by using a disk of NASICON and placed on a substrate attached to a heater at the backside. It is considered that a planar structure using a NASICON thick ®lm, if available, would help one to

decrease the fabrication cost as well as the size of the device. Presently, thick or thin ®lm technology is popularly used for the mass production of microdevices. In fact, explorations in this direction have already been attempted for the CO2 sensor [7±9], but there is a lack of suf®cient information about the preparation of NASICON thick ®lms. In this paper, we tried to prepare NASICON thick ®lms based on a sol±gel method and explored the possibility of fabricating a planar type CO2 sensor.

The powder of a precursor of NASICON (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) was prepared by a sol±gel method, as shown in Fig. 1. This method was basically the same as one reported by Haung et al. [10]. Each of the alkoxides of constituent elements, i.e. tetraethoxysilane (Si(OC2H5)4, TEOS), zirconium n-butoxide (Zr(OC4H9)4), tri-n-butylphosphate (PO(OC4H9)3) and sodium ethoxide (NaOC2H5) were dissolved in ethanol solvent at 708C under the ¯ow of dry N2 and kept standing for a designated period (1±6 h) under stirring. At the beginning of this procedure, a designated amount of H2O was

added into the solvent together with HNO

3 (catalyst) to hydrolyze TEOS partially. The partial hydrolysis of TEOS has been claimed to enhance its polymerization into chains.

was then kept open to atmospheric air at room temperature for 1 month in order to allow the alkoxides to hydrolyze gradually with atmospheric moisture (sol±gel process). The resulting xerogel was dried at 1208C for 24 h and then calcined at 7508C for 1 h to eliminate the organic remains.

A planar CO2 sensor was fabricated by stacking a NASICON thick ®lm, a layer of Li2CO3±BaCO3 (1:2 in molar ratio) auxiliary phase and Pt electrodes on an alumina substrate, as shown in Fig. 2. To prepare the NASICON thick ®lm, the above precursor of NASICON was mixed with a-terpineol and ethyl cellulose and the resulting paste was ®nally applied (30 mm thick ®lm) on the alumina substrate by a screen-printing method. For the counter and sensing electrodes, a commercial Pt paste was screenprinted (1 mm thick) on the designated regions before and after the screen-printing of the NASICON precursor. The whole assembly was calcined at 10008C for 5 h unless otherwise noted. Finally the auxiliary phase, Li2CO3± BaCO3, was deposited (10 mm thick) on the Pt sensing

electrode by melting at 7508C and solidifying through quenching.

The CO2 sensing measurements were carried out on a conventional gas-¯ow apparatus equipped with a heating facility. The device was exposed to the ¯ow (100 cm3/min) of sample gases which were prepared by diluting a parent gas, 2000 ppm CO2 in air, with synthetic air. The electromotive force (emf) of the device was measured with a digital electrometer (ADVANTEST TR8652).

3. Results and discussion

It is important to know the optimum calcination temperature to convert the NASICON precursor to NASICON. For a disk specimen, this conversion was known to take place without problem by calcination at 12008C for 5 h, accompanied by satisfactory densi®cation of the sintered body. However, in the present case of thick ®lms, the formation and densi®cation of NASICON were found to be very different. The thick ®lms of NASICON precursor, screenprinted on the alumina substrate, were calcined for 5 h at several temperatures between 800 and 12008C. Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the thick ®lms obtained. After calcination at 8008C, broad XRD peaks ascribable to NASIOCON were clearly observed, indicating a signi®cant formation of crystalline NASICON. The formation of NASICON was more complete at 900 and 10008C, while decomposition products of NASICON like ZrO2 began to appear at 10008C and became dominant at 1100 and 12008C. It follows that the NASICON formation was almost complete after calci-
nation at 900 and 10008C whereas the calcination at 11008C and above leads to the devastating decomposition of NASICON. Thus, the optimum calcination temperature to obtain crystalline NASICON was signi®cantly lower for the NASICON thick ®lm than that for a disk. This difference seems to be natural if one assumes that the decomposition of NASICON is caused by the sublimation of phosphorus. The sublimation would take place more preferentially in the surface region so that a ®lm specimen is more vulnerable than a disk specimen. This lowering in optimum calcination temperature gave rise to a problem in the densi®cation of the thick ®lm. As seen from the SEM images in Fig. 4, the ®lms calcined at 900 or 10008C were still poor in densi®cation. The densi®cation was much improved by calcination at 1100 or 12008C, but these ®lms were useless as a solid electrolyte because of the decomposition of NASICON just mentioned. As a compromise between the formation of NASICON and the densi®cation, the thick ®lm calcined at 10008C was used for the CO2 sensor, as already stated.

Fig. 5 shows the emf response of the resulting device to CO2 in dry air at 450, 500, and 6008C, as a function of CO2 concentration (100±2000 ppm). The emf is seen to be linear to the logarithm of CO2 concentration at each temperature, as have usually been observed with the laminated devices using a disk of NASICON. The slopes of the Nernstian correlations were slightly less steep than usually expected. That is, the number of electrons (n) associated with the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at the sensing electrode was slightly larger than 2 in each case. These results indicate that the present planar device works on the same principle as the laminated devices, although the Nernst slopes deviate

slightly from the theoretical ones. It is suspected that the deviations may be associated with the poor densi®cation of the NASICON thick ®lm, but further study is needed to con®rm it.

The response transients of the present device was sharp enough over the temperature range of 450±6008C. For example, the response of emf to stepwise increase in the CO2 concentration from 0 through 2000 ppm is shown in Fig. 6. The time for 90% response was 20 s or shorter. The recovery on switching-off CO2 was somewhat slower, but still sharp enough for usual purposes.

As stated above, it did not turn out easy to prepare a NASICON thick ®lm well-quali®ed in both formation and densi®cation of NASICON. The planar device using the ®lm calcined at 10008C, which was still poor in densi®cation, nevertheless gave fairly good CO2-sensing properties at 450±6008C. This is encouraging because a low-cost planar CO2 sensor would be brought forward to reality once the NASICON ®lm can be densi®ed. The preparation of well-quali®ed ®lms of NASICON is thus a matter to be investigated urgently.
