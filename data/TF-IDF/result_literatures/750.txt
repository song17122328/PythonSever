Sodium-ion batteries are potential low-cost alternatives to current lithium-ion technology,yet their performances still fall short of expectation due to the lack of suitable electrode materialswith large capacity, long-term cycling stability and high-rate performance.
In this work, wedemonstrated that ultrasmall (~5 nm) iron selenide (FeSe2) nanoparticles exhibited a remarkableactivity for sodium-ion storage.
They were prepared from a high-temperature solution method with anarrow size distribution and high yield, and could be readily redispersed in non-polar organicsolvents.
In ether-based electrolyte, FeSe2 nanoparticles exhibited a large specific capacity of ~500mAh/g (close to the theoretical limit), high rate capability with ~250 mAh/g retained at 10 A/g, andexcellent cycling stability at both low and high current rates by virtue of their advantageousnanosizing effect.
Full sodium-ion batteries were also constructed from coupling FeSe2 withNASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, and demonstrated impressive capacity and cycle ability.
In summary, we developed a high-temperature solution method to prepare FeSe2 NPs with anarrow size distribution and high yield.
When assessed as the anode material of sodium-ion batteries,it exhibited a large specific capacity close to the theoretical value, high rate capability with ~250mAh/g retained even at 10 A/g, and excellent cycling stability at both low and high current rates.
Thesuperior performance of FeSe2 NPs was attributed to the large surface area, short ionic diffusionlength and better stress accommodation associated with the ultra-small size.
In addition, wedemonstrated that FeSe2 NPs could be coupled with NVP to form full sodium-ion batteries with anaverage working voltage of ~2 V and large reversible capacity of ~500 mAh/g when normalized tothe mass of anode.
Our study here suggested the great potential of nanosized FeSe2 towardhigh-performance Na+ ion storage.
