The Na superionic conductor (NASICON)NaNbAlP3O12 compound was prepared by the conventionalsolid-state reaction method.
The formation of single-phasematerial was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies, and itwas found to be a hexagonal phase at room temperature.
The electrical conductivity was measured in the frequencyrange from 200 Hz to 5 MHz and temperatures between 573and 773 K using impedance spectroscopy technique.
The obtainedresults were analyzed by fitting the experimental data tothe equivalent circuit model.
The analysis of Nyquist plots hasrevealed the contribution of three electrically active regionscorresponding to the bulk mechanism, distribution of grainboundaries, and electrode processes.
Besides, the frequencydependence of the conductivity is interpreted in terms ofJonscher’s law.
Temperature dependence of the power lawexponent s strongly suggests that the non-overlapping smallpolaron tunneling (NSPT) model is the dominant transportprocess.
The variation of the imaginary part of the complexmodulus as a function of angular frequency at several temperaturesshows a double relaxation peak suggesting the presenceof grains and grain boundaries in the sample.
An analysis ofthe dielectric constants ε″ and loss tangent tan (δ) with frequencyshows a distribution of relaxation times.
