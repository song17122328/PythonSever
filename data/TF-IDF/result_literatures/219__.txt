Na3V2(PO4)3 with NASICON (sodium superionic conductor) structure, has been considered as a potential cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, sustainable phosphorus sources of phytic acid is adopted to synthesize carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 (Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1) nanoparticles. Phytic acid can chelate with VO2+ ions and in-situ transform into tightly coated carbon. As a result, the dispersivity and size-distribution of Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 particles are ideal, which will provid an enhanced conductivity and structure stability as cathode material for SIBs. For the rate performance, when the current increases from 0.05 A g−1 to 5.0 A g−1, a capacity of 70.7 mA h g−1 is maintained, corresponding to a capacity retention of 73.7 %. For the long-term cycling at current of 5.0 A g−1, there is only 0.0027 mA h g−1 capacity decay per cycle, giving a high capacity retention of 83.9 % after 5000 cycles. The high rate capability and cycling stability is attributed to the lower charge transfer resistance and higher diﬀusion coeﬃcient of sodium ion, proved by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

There is high demand of costand performance-eﬀective energy storage systems to address the rapid growth of electronics and clean energy exploration. Lithium ion batteries (LIBs), have achieved great commercial success due to their high energy and power densities. However, the large-scale energy storage with LIBs is restricted by the shortage of lithium resource [1–4]. Compared with LIBs, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) have gradually attracted our increased attention, due to the high abundance and wide distribution of sodium and similar physical and chemical properties to LIBs. Therefore, great eﬀorts have been taken to promote SIBs to become potential alternatives for LIBs [5–8]. So far, the development of SIBs is restricted by their lower operating voltage and energy/power densities. As is well-known, cathode material is the key factor to aﬀect the performance of SIBs. Currently, some cathode materials, such as layered metal oxides NaxMO2 (M = Mn, Ni, Co, etc) [9–12], ﬂuorides [13,14] and polyanions Na3M2(PO4)3 (M = V, Ti, Fe, etc) and NaMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, etc) [15–18], have been widely investigated. Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3 has been attracted our extensive attention due to its excellent thermal stability, ﬂat sodiation/ desodiation potential plateau (∼3.4 V vs. Na+/Na) and unique open framework with NASICON-type (sodium super ionic conductor) structure [19–22], which can oﬀer numerous vacant interstitial sites for Na+

However, the intrinsically low conductivity of Na3V2(PO4)3 always results to limited electrochemical kinetics, leading to ﬂat rate and cycling performance and low speciﬁc capacity. Generally, surface coating [23–26], metal ion doping [27–30] and nanostructure engineering [31], have been adopted to conquer the drawback of limited kinetics. As a result, construction of Na3V2(PO4)3/C nanostructures has been demonstrated as an eﬀective approach to improve the electronic conductivity and cycling stability, based on the fact of providing more active sites and shortening the ion/electron diﬀusion path. Jiang et al. synthesized carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 with uniform particle with the size of 1−2 μm, showing excellent ultralong cyclability [32]. When test at 5 C, the capacity is maintained at 78 mA h g−1 corresponding to capacity retentions of 68 % after 2000 cycles. Generally, in the Na3V2(PO4)3 synthesis process, NH4H2PO4 is mainly used as phosphorus sources, which is prone to produce toxic ammonia gas and pollute the environment [33–35]. Therefore, it is great signiﬁcance to ﬁnd environmentally benign, eﬀective, sustainable and abundant sources. Biomaterial systems, which can be used as carbon source or phosphorus sources, has been proved to be one of the most powerful routes to synthesize various novel functional materials [36–39]. Among a range of bio-based sustainable resources, phytic acid (PA), as a natural biological material, is also known as inositol hexaphosphate, which

The Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 was synthesized via a freeze-drying assisted high-temperature calcination process [40]. First, 6.0 mmol H2C2O4, 2.0 mmol V2O5, 1.4 mmol PA and 3.0 mmol Na2CO3 were dissolved in 35 ml of deionized water, and vigorously stirred for 30 min, forming a uniform green solution. Subsequently, 3.0 mmol ascorbic acid and 2.5 mg polyethylene glycol (PEG-4000) were added to the above solution under stirring for another 30 min to obtain a transparent blue solution. Finally, the blue solution was transferred to a 50 ml Teﬂon-lined autoclave and maintained in an oven at 180 °C for 40 h, forming a viscous suspension. After a freeze-drying process, ﬂuﬀy solid powder was obtained. In the Ar-H2 (5 % H2) atmosphere, the dried powder was heated at 350 ℃ for 4 h and then at 750 ℃ for 6 h with a heating rate of 5 ℃ min−1. After cooled to room temperature naturally, the black powder Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 was obtained.

For the control experiments, Na3V2(PO4)3/C-2 was prepared using a similar procedure to Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1, except for phosphorus source was changed to NH4H2PO4. While for Na3V2(PO4)3/C-3 the same raw materials and similar procedure was adopted, except for the drying method replaced by heating at 95 ℃.

The X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) data of the as-synthesized powder were analyzed using a Rigaku UItima IV X-Ray Diﬀractometer with CuKα (λ

In order to measure and compare the electrochemical performance of the three samples, working electrodes were ﬁrst prepared by mixing carbon black, polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) and as-prepared samples in N-methyl pyrrolidone with a weight ratio of 8:1:1, forming a slurry. The slurry was coated on Al foil, dried at 80 ℃, and then cut into 12 mm diameter plates, using as working electrodes. Coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in the Ar glove box, using sodium metal, glass microﬁber (Whatman, GF/A), and 1 mol L−1 NaClO4 was dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC) with 10 % (in volume) ﬂuoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as counter electrodes, separator and electrolyte, respectively. Neware-5 V10/20 mA battery test system (Shenzhen Xinwei) was used for the galvanostatic charge and discharge test. GITT was carried out by cycling a battery at 20 mA g-1 for 5 min and resting for 25 min between steps on a battery test system. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) curves at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 over a voltage range of 2.5–3.8 V. EIS measurements were performed on Gamry 30115 frequencies of 1 Hz to 100 kHz.

The preparation process of Na3V2(PO4)3-1 is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. PA is used as phosphorus source and chelated with VO2+, reduced from V2O5 by H2C2O4 and ascorbic acid [40]. In the presence of polyethylene glycol, a hydrothermal reaction was conducted to obtain a viscous suspension. Then it was instantaneously frozen in the assistance of liquid nitrogen, which can ﬁx the structure of the intermediates, ensuring the metal ions are connected with organic molecules. After drying and high temperature calcination, carbon coated nano-sized Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 is obtained with a NASICON structure.

In summary, in a freeze-drying assisted high-temperature calcination process, NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 nanoparticles were prepared using bio-PA as phosphorus sources, demonstrating an eﬀective carbon source and structure controllable chelators. As cathode materials for SIBs, Na3V2(PO4)3/C-1 has lower Rct, higher DNa, and smaller ΔV between the charge and discharge curves, proving its lower polarization and good electrochemical kinetics. At high current of 5.0 A g−1, it can maintain high capacity retention of 83.9 % after 5000 cycles, demonstrating that the success of PA in preparation of Na3V2(PO4)3/C composite cathode for SIBs and electrochemical performance enhancement. In general, this work provides us a strategy to design carbon-based phosphates and phosphides using PA as phosphorus sources.
