Besides topotactical Li insertion, Li deinsertion also is possible for the new potential electrode material Li3V(MoO4)3, in contrast to isostructural Li3Fe(MoO4)3. This new phase crystallizes in an orthorhombic NASICON-type structure with large channels along the crystallographic a-axis, which are half-filled by Li atoms. A reversible reduction of Li3V(MoO4)3 occurs at 2.1 V, with the formation of isostructural Li4V(MoO4)3, whereas an oxidation to Li2V(MoO4)3 is found at 3.7 V, preserving the space-group symmetry. The first charge/discharge cycle differs significantly from the following ones. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, Li extraction is associated with vanadium oxidation (V3þ w V4þ ) and Li intercalation is accompanied mainly by molybdenum reduction (Mo6þ w Mo5þ ). In situ synchrotron diffraction on a LixV(MoO4)3 cathode with x ≈ 3 during the first discharge/charge cycle revealed a monotonous increase of the lattice volume and of the lattice parameter a during Li insertion from x = 3 to x = 3.5, but a multiphase mechanism for 3.5 e x e 4. At x e 2.95, a monotonous decrease of the lattice volume was observed. The paramagnetic moments of LixV(MoO4)3 (x = 2, 3, 4) are smaller than the theoretical values, calculated for spin-only con, and V2þ tributions from V4þ , respectively, which might indicate the partially delocalized character of the V valence electrons.

Complex Li,V-containing phosphates with NASICON structure have been intensively studied for a long time as lithium storage materials, because of the presence of large channels in the structure, which are sufficient for good Liion mobility, and the ability of V ions to adopt different oxidation states from þ2 to þ5.1 The insertion/extraction of Li in such compounds is often topochemically between isostructural end-members. For example, lithium extraction from Li3V2(PO4)3 with LiV2(PO4)3 formation occurs at a potential of ∼3.8 V vs Li þ /Li and corresponds to the highest value for polyanionic frameworks with theoretical discharge capacity of ∼130 mA h/g.1 The complex molybdenum oxides Li2M2(MoO4)3 and Li3M(MoO4)3 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) are isostructural and attracted recently attention, insertion.

They crystallize also in a NASICON-type structure, which was first described for the Na,Co-containing molybdate with NaCo2.31(MoO4)3 stoichiometry.7 There are large channels along one crystallographic axis in the structure, which are occupied by either only Li atoms as in the case of Li3M(MoO4)3 or by Li and M atoms as for Li2M2(MoO4)3. The structural similarity of Li2M2(MoO4)3 and Li3M(MoO4)3 can be described as a heterovalent replacement Li2M2(MoO4)3 f Li2(Li,M)(MoO4)3 f Li3M(MoO4)3. The room-temperature ionic conductivity of Li3Cr(MoO4)3, with only Li ions in the channels, is higher than for the isostructural compound Li2Mg2(MoO4)3, despite the same ionic conductivities of both compounds at elevated temperatures.8 For M, a 3d-transition-metal Li deinsertion and Li insertion is accompanied by a M2þ T M3þ oxidation-reduction reaction. A detailed electrochemical investigation of Li intercalation into Li3Fe(MoO4)3 demonstrated a reversible process at 2.4 V with Li4Fe(MoO4)3 formation and the existence of Fe2þ .2 In situ synchrotron diffraction showed a complex Li intercalation mechanism with the formation of an intermediate phase.3 At lower voltages, an irreversible process with a reduction of Mo ions was observed. Li2Co2(MoO4)3 and Li2Ni2(MoO4)3 are promising candidates for high-voltage cathodes with an open-cell voltage of ca. 4.9 V vs þ /Li for Co5 and for Ni.6 Li2M2(MoO4)3 can also be vs Li obtained by Li intercalation into the ternary lithiumfree molybdates M2(MoO4)3 with sufficient space in the structure.

Reversible electrochemical intercalation/extraction was observed for LixFe2(MoO4)3 for 0 e x e 1.7. This range corresponds to changes of the Fe oxidation state from þ3 to þ2.15. The accompanied phase transition leads to a metastable Li2Fe2(MoO4)3 phase isostructural to the high-temperature modification of Fe2(MoO4)3, which transforms into the NASICON-type structure at elevated temperature.

Li insertion was also performed into Co2(MoO4)3: more than 2 Li atoms per formula unit can be intercalated at 2.6 V, corresponding to a reduction from Co3þ to Co2þ , and at 2.2 V, assigned to a reduction of Mo6þ . A detailed investigation of the crystal structures of the involved phases during insertion is still lacking.10 The reduction of Mo6þ in a NASICON-type structure seems to be irreversible in the most cases, perhaps caused by an instability of Mo5þ or Mo4þ in tetrahedral oxygen coordination.9,10 In contrast, the recently investigated Li4Mo5O17 phase11 with MoO6 octahedra only can insert eight Li ions reversibly and topotactically. In the Li-Ti-Mo-O system, a new compound with Ti4þ , Li3Ti0.75(MoO4)3 with the same NASICON-type structure and vacancies in (0,Li,Ti)O6-octahedra (4c site for Li and Ti), was recently prepared.12 The mixed occupation of oxygen octahedra by Li is rather surprising, considering the very different charges of both cations, and indicates a pronounced stability of this structure type against Li extraction/insertion and accompanied valence changes.

The LixVy(MoO4)3 system represents an interesting potential material for Li intercalation, because of the possibility for changes in the vanadium oxidation state from þ4 to þ2 in octahedral coordination. This allows the Mo6þ oxidation state to be preserved during Li insertion/deinsertion and, hereby, to avoid instabilities, which would result from lower oxidation states of Mo in tetrahedral coordination.

LixV(MoO4)3 (x = 3) powder was prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of Li2MoO4 (Alfa Aesar, 99%), MoO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%), and V2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) in an argon atmosphere or in evacuated and sealed silica tubes at 813 K for 30 h. Single crystals of Li3V(MoO4)3 for X-ray single crystal analysis were obtained from the synthesis of Li3V(MoO4)3 at 1023 K in argon. The lithium content in LixV(MoO4)3 was varied between x = 2 and x = 4 by two different methods: (1) a chemical reaction at ambient temperature under an argon atmosphere11,13 between Li3V(MoO4)3 powder and either nitronium hexafluorophosphate (NO2PF6) in an acetonitrile medium as an oxidizing agent or n-butyllithium (LiC4H9) in n-heptane as a reducing agent or (2) in electrochemical cells. After syntheses, Li2V(MoO4)3 and Li4V(MoO4)3 were washed with acetonitrile or n-heptane, respectively, to remove traces of unreacted agents and dried under vacuum at room temperature. All attemps to synthesize Li2V(MoO4)3 and Li4V(MoO4)3 in quartz tubes gave a multiphase mixture of complex Li,Moand Li,V-oxides. The amounts of lithium, vanadium, and molybdenum in all prepared LixV(MoO4)3 compounds were determined quantitatively by the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) method (IRIS Intrepid II XUV, Thermo Fisher) using a 3:1 mixture of HCl (37%, p.a. Fa. Merck) and HNO3 (65%, p.a. Fa. Merck) for dissolving the samples.

The crystal structure of Li3V(MoO4)3 was solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction using the Xcalibur system from Oxford Diffraction. The software packages SHELXS14 and SHELXL15 were used for structure solution and refinement as included in X-STEP32.16 A combined empirical absorption correction with frame scaling was applied, using the SCALE3 ABSPACK command in CrysalisRed.17 Phase analysis and determination of cell parameters of LixV(MoO4)3 at room temperature were performed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a STOE STADI P diffractometer (Mo-KR1 radiation, λ = 0.7093 A˚ ) in transmission mode. Phase analyses of LixV(MoO4)3 materials after electrochemical treatments were performed without any contact with air.

The thermal behavior of synthesized Li2V(MoO4)3, Li3V(MoO4)3 and Li4V(MoO4)3 compounds was investigated in a Model STA 449 apparatus (Netzsch, Selb, Germany), with respect to their phase reaction. Approximately 25 mg of powder was heated with the scan rate of 20 K/min in an alumina crucible from room temperature up to ∼1070 K in a flowing argon atmosphere.

Electrochemical studies on LixV(MoO4)3 cathode materials were performed with a multichannel potentiostatic-galvanostatic system VMP3 (PerkinElmer Instruments, Eden Prairie, MN) in standard Swageloktype cells with metallic lithium as the anode material. For the positive electrode, a mixture of LixV(MoO4)3, carbon black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) as a polymer binder in an 80:10:10 weight ratio was pressed onto 8-mm-diameter aluminum meshs and dried under vacuum at 100 °C. A 1 M solution of LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) (1:1 v/v) was used as an electrolyte. The cells were assembled in an argon-filled glovebox with H2O and O2 contents of <1 ppm.

In situ X-ray synchrotron diffraction measurements were performed at a synchrotron facility (HASYLAB/DESY, Hamburg, Germany, at beamline B2)18 in transmission mode,using the OBI on-site readable image-plate detector19 and a cell connected to a VMP multichannel galvanostat.20 Data were collected in steps of 0.004° over the 2θ range of 4°-55°; a wavelength of 0.65110(1) A˚ was determined from the positions of eight reflections from LaB6 reference material.

To characterize the starting material LixV(MoO4)3, a pattern was recorded before the electrochemical process was started. The cell was then successively charged and discharged in galvanostatic mode at a constant current, corresponding to the intercalation or deintercalation of one Li atom per formula unit over a period of 10 h (C/10). All diffraction patterns have been analyzed using the software package WinPLOTR.21 The sequential design of the in situ cell requires phase-specific sample shifts during Rietveld refinements.20 The aluminum foil, as the current collector on the cathode side, served as an internal standard during the measurements, and the refined lattice parameter of aluminum provided an independent control of the reliability of the obtained model parameters.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to as-prepared Li3V(MoO4)3 and to the products after electrochemical Li insertion or extraction. A PHI Model 5600 CI system with an Al KR 350 W monochromatized X-ray source and a hemispherical analyzer at a pass energy of 29 eV were used. Two cells with pellets of the same cathode mixture consisting of Li3V(MoO4)3, carbon black, and PVDF with a mass of ∼30 mg were charged and discharged with a C/10 rate to 4.9 V (x≈ 2) and 1.7 V (x = 4) and immediately disassembled. To remove LiPF6 from the surface, the pellets were washed with DMC and scraped. During XPS measurements, when necessary, surface charging was minimized by means of a low-energy electron flood gun. The system base pressure was ∼10 -9 mbar. The binding-energy scale was calibrated from minor carbon contaminations using the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.

Magnetic properties of LixV(MoO4)3 (x = 2, 3, and 4) have been studied with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) from Quantum Design. Measurements were performed in field-cooled and zero-field cooled mode in the temperature range of 1.8-350 K and with an external magnetic field strength of 500 G.

Browncolored single-phase samples of Li3V(MoO4)3 were obtained either in evacuated sealed silica tubes or in an argon flow at 813 K. At lower synthesis temperature (753-773 22 was detected as a second phase, K), triclinic Li4Mo5O17 and its amount decreased with increasing temperature. A powder diffraction pattern of Li3V(MoO4)3 is presented in Figure 1. All reflections can be explained based on the Pnma space group with lattice parameters a = 5.0785(2) A˚ , b = 10.4401(3) A˚ , c = 17.5144(5) A˚ , V = 928.63(5) A˚ 3, Z = 4 as a Li3Cr(MoO4)3 isotype.

Single-phase samples of Li4V(MoO4)3 with black color were prepared through the reaction of stoichiometric amounts (1:1) of Li3V(MoO4)3 and LiC4H9 solution in n-heptane during 24 h, and its composition was confirmed by chemical analysis. No additional reflections were detected in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Li4V(MoO4)3, and the crystal structure is well-described, based on the same space group as Li3V(MoO4)3 with the lattice parameters a = 5.0915(2) A˚ , b = 10.4497(3) A˚ , c = 17.5401(5) A˚ , V = 933.21(5) A˚ 3, and also Z = 4. The additionally inserted Li ions are clearly reflected by the expanded unit cell volume, but cannot be localized reliably during Rietveld refinement, because of the low scattering cross section of Li ions for X-rays. An excess of LiC4H9 and a longer reaction period led to a partial decomposition of Li3V(MoO4)3 into Li2MoO4 and an unknown phase with cubic VO-type structure. Yellow-brown Li2V(MoO4)3 was obtained without any impurity phase from the reaction between Li3V(MoO4)3 and NO2PF6 in a molar ratio of 1:1. An excess of NO2PF6 led also to a phase decomposition: an analysis of the reaction products revealed the presence of LixV(MoO4)3 and Li4Mo5O17. The lattice parameters of Li2V(MoO4)3 are significantly smaller than those of Li3V(MoO4)3: a = 5.0584(3) A˚ , b = 10.4330(4) A˚ , c = 17.4328(7) A˚ , V = 920.01(7) A˚ 3.

The differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves of LixV(MoO4)3 (x = 2, 3, and 4) show a decreasing of the thermal stability from x = 3 to x = 4 and x = 2 (see Figure 2). For Li3V(MoO4)3, the melting temperature, accompanied by an endothermic signal at 903 K, and the crystallization temperature at 877 K were measured. The two endothermic signals during the heating of Li4V(MoO4)3 may be interpreted as decomposition of the compound and the melting process, at ∼882 and 897 K, respectively. This was verified by XRD analysis of the Li4V(MoO4)3 sample, which was heated in argon up to 990 K during 2 h and cooled to room temperature. Afterward, the presence of Li2MoO4, together with an unknown phase, as major products and LixV(MoO4)3 as a minor phase was detected. A broad exothermic peak at ∼884 K corresponds to the crystallization of Li4V(MoO4)3. XRD analysis of Li3V(MoO4)3 after the same heat treatment revealed practically pure Li3V(MoO4)3. For Li2V(MoO4)3, prepared through the reaction of Li3V(MoO4)3 with NO2PF6, two endothermic signals during heating at 832 and 857 K also correspond to phase decomposition and melting. XRD analysis of Li2V(MoO4)3 after DTA measurements showed the presence of complex V,Moand Li,V-containing oxides as major phases.

According to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (see Table 1), Li3V(MoO4)3 is isostructural to NaCo2.31(MoO4)3.7 From a structural point of view, the composition Li3V(MoO4)3 can be better described as AB2C(MoO4)3 with A = V0.44Li0.56, B = V0.30Li0.70, and C = Li.

In the structure, there are two types of (Li,V)-octahedra: infinite chains of face-sharing AO6 along the [100] axis (metals on the 4c site) and networks of cornerand edge-sharing BO6 parallel to the (001) plane with a metal on the 8d site (see Figure 3; details regarding the position parameters of Li3V(MoO4)3 are given in Table 2). The isolated MoO4 tetrahedra connect networks and chains via corners into a pseudo-hexagonal framework with channels parallel to [100], which are occupied only by Li atoms. The average Li-O distances are 2.044(4) A˚ and 2.084(4) A˚ for mixed (Li,V)O6 octahedra and 2.175(9) A˚ for Li atoms in the channels (Figure 3) for LiO6 trigonal prisms. Li atoms in channels occupy only 4c positions, forming so-called “ordering” in the structure with halffilled channels.

Some reduction and oxidation processes were registered during cyclic voltammetry measurements of the electrochemical cell with Li3V(MoO4)3 cathode, cycled with a voltage sweep rate of 0.1 mV/s between 1.4 V and 4.9 V (see Figure 4). Different electrochemical behavior was observed during the first and following discharge cycles: a strong reduction peak was detected at ∼1.7 V in the first cycle, which has completely disappeared in the third one (Figure 4). For all cycles, three reproducible oxidationreduction processes, corresponding to the insertion and extraction of Li atoms, were observed. From two reduction peaks at 2.3-2.4 V and from two oxidation peaks at 2.3-2.5 V, one can conclude a two-step process of Li insertion/ deinsertion in Li3V(MoO4)3 with Li3þxV(MoO4)3 formation. Li deinsertion from Li3V(MoO4)3 forming Li3-xV(MoO4)3 is also reversible and occurs at 3.7 V.

Galvanostatic experiments with a C/10 rate showed that about two Li atoms can be reversibly inserted and deinserted in LixV(MoO4)3 between 1.5 and 4.5 V (see Figure 5a). The first charge is quite different from the next ones, having three pronounced plateaus at 2.2, 2.3, and 1.7 V, which are smoothed or disappear in the successive ones. XRD patterns from the cathode materials after the first cycle and after 30 cycles, respectively, are very similar and reveal, besides LixV(MoO4)3 (90% w/w), the presence of cubic “Li3.2Mo0.8O4” (6%) (a = 4.1675(5) A˚ , Fm3m) and trigonal Li2MoO4 (4% w/w) (a = 14.339(2) A˚ , c = 9.568(2) A˚ , R3). Therefore, the formation of “Li3.2Mo0.8O4” and Li2MoO4 seems to occur already primarily in the first cycle. Ex situ structure investigation of the Li3V(MoO4)3 cathode material after cell discharge down to 1.6 V and an immediate disassembling of the cell under an argon atmosphere in a glovebox confirmed the formation of “Li3.2Mo0.8O4” during the first discharge cycle (see Figure 6). The reflections of Li3.2Mo0.8O4 disappeared when the cell was discharged down to 1.5 V in the first cycle and left in open circuit voltage (OCV) mode for 12 h. The cell voltage increased up to 2.2 V, which corresponds to the initial voltage of Li4V(MoO4)3 cathode material, obtained through the reaction with n-LiC4H9. The actual composition of the “Li3.2Mo0.8O4”-like phase with a cubic rocksalt-type structure is not clear. According to the structural model,27 Li and Mo are randomly distributed on the same crystallographic site and have an octahedral coordination of O atoms. In the “Li3.2Mo0.8O4”-like phase, formed after the galvanostatic cycling, V atoms could also be partially included in the structure, which can reflect the slightly larger lattice parameter, in comparison with Li3.2Mo0.8O4 (a = 4.14 A˚ ).

The appearance of a second phase with a rocksalt-type structure and a cell parameter a = 4.15 A˚ was also detected after the reaction between Fe2(MoO4)3 and an excess of n-LiC4H9, leading to x > 2 in LixFe(MoO4)3:9 the authors proposed an existence of a solid solution between Fe1-δO and Li2MoO3. More-complicated behavior during cell discharge was registered for Li3Fe(MoO4)3:3 XRD data of Li3Fe(MoO4)3 cathode material discharged down to 1 V revealed a complete decomposition of the NASICONtype structure of Li3Fe(MoO4)3 into cubic Li2yMo(IV)Fe(II)2O2þ3y (a = 4.15 A˚ ) with a rocksalt-type structure and amorphous lithium molybdate Li8-2yMo(IV)3-yO10-3y, which transforms to Li2MoO4 after exposure to air.

Li8-2yMo(IV)3-yO10-3y should be responsible for reversible Li insertion/deinsertion during the cell cycling between 4 V and 1 V, that corresponds to the insertion of three Liions 2 at an average voltage of ∼2 V.

It was also shown2 that a test cell with isostructural Li3þxFe(MoO4)3 cathode material can be reversibly cycled in the voltage window of 3-1.6 V with a large plateau at 2.4 V, corresponding to the iron reduction Fe3þ w Fe2þ . Upon lithium insertion in the compositional range 0 e x e 1 two two-phase regions were detected between x = 0 and x = 0.75, and x = 0.75 and x = 1.0. The crystal structures of single-phase LixFe(MoO4)3 (x = 0.75, 1) are derived from the one of Li3Fe(MoO4)3 by completely filling the channels along the a-axis successively. In the case of Li3V(MoO4)3 the plateau at 1.7 V could correspond to the reduction of vanadium V3þ w V2þ as observed for example for the discharge of NASICONtype Li3V2(PO4)3 at 1.7 V,1 or to the reduction of molybdenum Mo6þ w Mo5þ . Although a small amount of a rocksalt-type phase appears during cell discharge, it does not seem to contribute significantly to electrochemical reduction, because this phase disappears or becomes amorphous during charging, while the NASICON-type LixV(MoO4)3 is still observed after 30 cycles over the voltage range from 4.8 V to 1.6 V.

The reflections from the Li3V(MoO4)3 cathode material after cycling are much broader in comparison with the pristine material, which indicates a smaller average crystallite size of 160 nm instead of several μm in pristine Li3V(MoO4)3. The capacity loss during cycling (Figure 5b) could be attributed to poorer electronic and ionic conductivity, because of a contact loss caused by the ongoing breaking of crystallites.

Two compositions, Li3V(MoO4)3 and Li4V(MoO4)3, were taken for detailed structural investigations upon Li insertion and deinsertion. The electrochemical cell with Li3V(MoO4)3 was first discharged down to 1.7 V with a C/10 rate, which corresponds to the insertion of one Li per formula unit and then charged up to 4.5 V, corresponding to a total lithium content of ∼2.6 (see Figure 7). The electrochemical cell with Li4V(MoO4)3 was charged up to 4.9 V with a C/10 rate, which led to a decrease in the lithium content down to x = 2.3 (see Figure 8). All observed reflections during Li insertion/extraction in the first cycle are wellexplained by the presence of LixV(MoO4)3, Li2MoO4, and “Li3.2Mo0.8O4”. The evolutions of cell volume and unit-cell parameters a and c with lithium content are very similar (Figure 7) and can be explained by the scheme of Li insertion/deinsertion into the channels along the a-axis within the LixV(MoO4)3 structure (see Figure 9).

A monotonous increase of the unit cell volume and the a and c lattice parameters was observed up to a lithium content of x = 3.5 per formula unit, confirming a topotactic single-phase mechanism for Li insertion. (See Figure 10.) Additional reflections from “Li3.2Mo0.8O4” appeared for higher lithium contents, while the lattice parameters of LixV(MoO4)3 did not change anymore significantly (see Figure 7). A multiphase mechanism is indicated, supported by the long plateau at 1.7 V (Figure 7, left): either the formation of structurally related phases LixV(MoO4)3 with very similar lattice parameters but a different distribution of lithium, as in the case of Li3Fe(MoO4)3,3 or the partial decomposition of LixV(MoO4)3 into a cubic Li,(V),Mo-oxide and Li2MoO4. It is rather improbable that Li2MoO4 intercalates Li atoms in the channels, because, according to the work in ref 28, a lithiation of Li2MoO4 was first observed at <1 V and it is not accompanied by the formation of a distinct plateau. The reflections of “Li3.2Mo0.8O4” disappeared again during the following Li deinsertion below x ≈ 3. A plateau in the unitcell volume versus lithium content was observed during the charge of a test cell with a cathode either from Li3V(MoO4)3 after discharge to x = 4 or from Li4V(MoO4)3 material obtained from the reaction with LiC4H9, which indicates a two-phase mechanism of lithium extraction in the region from x ≈ 4 down to x ≈ 3. These mechanisms are supported by the observed hysteresis between states 1 and 2 on one hand and states 2 and 3 on the other (see Figure 7, right). The first process is a topotactic Li insertion with a one-phase mechanism, but the Li extraction occurs via a two-phase mechanism.

Li insertion/deinsertion in LixV(MoO4)3 must affect interatomic distances and polyhedral distortions in Li,VO6 octahedra and MoO4 tetrahedra. The average interatomic distances and polyhedral distortions, defined as η = [d(M-O)max d(M-O)min]/d(M-O), are presented in Table 3 for four composition states, labeled 1-4 in Figure 7.

For the pristine composition Li3V(MoO4)3 (state 1), the smallest degrees of distortions are found and reflect the highest structural stability among all LixV(MoO4)3 compositions. Face-sharing Li,V(1)O6 octahedra are more rigid than Li,V(2)O6 octahedra (see Figure 3), connected via corners and edges only. During oxidation or reduction, the polyhedral distortions increase for all polyhedra. The oxidation is mainly due to the transition V3þ w V4þ , whereas two different processes can be discussed during reduction: V3þ w V2þ . During Li insertion from x ≈ 3 to x ≈ 4, the average interatomic distances increase for MoO4 tetrahedra to 1.87(1) A˚ from 1.837(7) A˚ for Mo(1)O4 and 1.852(9) A˚ for Mo(2)O4, which could mean a partial reduction of Mo(VI) to Mo(V). However, simultaneously, the average V,Li-O interatomic bond length becomes shorter. During the following Li extraction down to x ≈ 3, the polyhedra distortion decrease but do not reach their initial lowest values. The decrease of one V(2)-O bond down to 1.80(2) A˚ in Li2.65V(MoO4)3 might reflect a tendency of V ions to form a short vanadyl bond ηtypical for V4þ. For example, a bond length of ∼1.64 A˚ was typical for V4þ observed for the R-and β-polymorphs of Na4VO(PO4)2.26 The random distribution of Li ions on the 4c site in LixV(MoO4)3 probably disturbs a further decrease of the average (V,Li)-O bond and might be responsible for the lower capacity, in comparison with the theoretical value, corresponding to Li extraction down to x ≈ 2.

The changes of the electronic structure due to Li insertion and extraction were studied by “quasi in situ” XPS29 (see Figure 11a-c). Although the XPS method represents the electronic structure of the surface region only and is influenced by contaminations or surface effects, a presence of V3þ in LixV(MoO4)3 with x = 3, according to the V 2p and Mo 3d emission peak positions, can be concluded, in agreement with reference data in the literature.23 A shift of the V 2p peak (Figure 11a) toward higher energies for x = 2, as well as the appearance of an additional peak at a lower energy in the Mo3d subspectrum (Figure 11b) for x = 4, unambiguously correspond to an increase in the average V oxidation state after Li extraction and a decrease in the average Mo oxidation state after Li insertion. A slight shift of the V 2p peak toward smaller energies for x = 4 could indicate that a small amount of V ions can be assigned to a formal oxidation state lower than þ3. The Mo 3d peaks for x = 4 are somewhat broader, in comparison to those for x = 3 (Figure 11b), indicating a change of Mo-O bond strength during Li insertion. Although O 1s peaks could represent a superposition of oxygen contributions from LixV(MoO4)3 and traces of DMC, which was used for sample washing after electrochemical experiments, they became significantly broader and are shifted to higher energies from Li2V(MoO4)3 to Li4V(MoO4)3 (Figure 11c). It corresponds to a strengthening of a covalence Li-O bonding due to partial charge transfer from O ions to Li ions in the channels with an increasing degree of Li occupation on this site. The Mo 3d spectrum of Li3V(MoO4)3 after 20 charge/ discharge cycles between 1.4 V and 4.9 V (Figure 4),followed by a voltage relaxation for 12 h, to reach an equilibrium state, resembles the spectrum of pristine material Li3V(MoO4)3 and does not demonstrate a shoulder at ∼231 eV, excluding any presence of Mo in a lower oxidation state than þ6. This confirms the reversibility of the proposed Mo reduction during Li insertion.

According to the magnetic measurements, LixV(MoO4)3 (x = 2, 3, 4) compositions are paramagnetic, down to 1.9 K (see Figure 12). Li4V(MoO4)3 was prepared from Li3V(MoO4)3 through the reaction with n-LiC4H9, Li2V(MoO4)3 was obtained in the electrochemical test cell. The compositions were confirmed by ICP-OES. Paramagnetic moments and paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperatures (θ), calculated from fitting eq 1 to the observed data, are presented in Table 4. ð1Þ Slightly negative values for θ indicate weak antiferromagnetic interactions. With increasing lithium content, they become stronger and the paramagnetic moments larger. By assuming that V4þ (3d2) exist in Li2V(MoO4)3 and Li3V(MoO4)3, respectively, the experimental paramagnetic moments (Table 4) are smaller than the calculated “spin-only” values for a 3d1 electronic configuration (1.73 μB) and a high-spin 3d2 electronic configuration (2.83 μB). This could be a result of strong antiparallel spin-orbit couplings or an intermediate spin state for V3þ in Li3V(MoO4)3. It is known24 that, in þ3O6 octahedra, the orbital vanadium perovskites with V magnetic moment is strongly coupled to the spin and reduces the total moment by ∼1 μB. For Li4V(MoO4)3, V and Mo ions should contribute to the total paramagnetic moment. According to a very simple ionic model, based on V3þ and Mo contributions only, and using the experimental value from Li3V(MoO4)3 as an approximation for the V3þ paramagnetic moment, the effective paramagnetic moment of Mo is estimated by eq 2 and gives 1.50 μB. ðV3þÞ ð2Þ This value is smaller than the spin-only value for Mo5þ (1.73 μB) and in agreement with a partially reduced oxidation state, in comparison with Mo6þ . In contrast, the existence of V2þ pairs in Li4V(MoO4)3 with only V2þ would give a “spin-only” paramagnetic moment of ∼3.8 μB, which is too high.

Li3V(MoO4)3 is a suitable material for both Li insertion and extraction with preserving the underlying NASICON-type crystal structure. Li ions can be topotactically intercalated in Li3V(MoO4)3 forming “LixV(MoO4)3” with x ≈ 4 by a chemical route or in an electrochemical test cell. In the first discharge cycle, Li insertion at 1.7 V is accompanied by a partial decomposition of Li3V(MoO4)3 to trigonal Li2MoO4 and an unknown phase with a cubic rocksalt-type structure. It is rather improbable that Li2MoO4 participates in the electrochemical processes at this relatively high voltage. A multiphase insertion mechanism of Li in LixV(MoO4)3 from x = 3.5 to x = 4 could remain topotactical and be similar to that in Li3Fe(MoO4)3,3 including the formation of structurally related phases LixV(MoO4)3 with very similar lattice parameters but a different distribution of Li on initially vacant sites. Ex situ neutron diffraction data from partially lithiated Li3þxV(MoO4)3 materials are nessesary in combination with high resolution in situ synchrotron diffraction studies on Li3V(MoO4)3 after one complete cycle to reveal the details of this mechanism. In contrast to Li3Fe(MoO4)3, the Li insertion in Li3þxV(MoO4)3 is accompanied mostly by a reduction of Mo6þ ions, in agreement with the resulting paramagnetic moments.
