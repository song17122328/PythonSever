Solid electrolytes are functional materials in which ions migrate and carry a charge. Until recently, primarily monoor divalent ions have been well known as conductors in solids, and these kinds of solid electrolytes are used for various applications (e.g., lithium batteries for heart pacemakers, sensing devices). However, cations having a valence state higher than three have been considered to be extremely poor migrants because of their strong electrostatic interactions with the surrounding anions that comprise the framework of the structure.

In recent years, tungstates with trivalent cation species such as Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and Er3+–Lu3+, having the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure,[1–7] have firstly and directly proved to be trivalent ion conducting solid electrolytes. The Sc2(WO4)3-type structure contains a hexavalent tungsten ion (W6+), forming a WO4 2– unit. The oxide anions are strongly bonded to W6+, resulting in a lower electrostatic interaction between the trivalent cation and surrounding oxide anions. Furthermore, the structure has a large tunnel size appropriate for trivalent ion migration into the tungstate. However, W6+ is easily reduced, causing an appearance of electronic conduction that results in the electronic short circuit of solids. Therefore, solid electrolytes containing W6+ as one of the constituent ions are not practically suitable for commercial applications, especially in a reducing atmosphere.

In order to realize trivalent ion conducting solid electrolytes that are applicable in various atmospheres, higher valency ions, which are very difficult to reduce and lower the electrostatic interaction between the mobile trivalent cations and surrounding anions, are necessary as the constituent of practical electrolytes. In addition, the candidate solids must possess a large-size pathway for the mobile trivalent ions in the structure. Here, as a candidate, the Na+ superionic conductor (NASICON) type structure,[8] which contains Zr4+ and P5+ as the higher valency cations, was chosen. It has already been demonstrated that the Zr4+ and P5+ ion species stably hold tetraand pentavalent states and it is well known that they can only be reduced with great difficulty in a reducing atmosphere. In addition, the ion-migrating pathway in the NASICON-type structure is three dimensional, whereas that in the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure is two dimensional. The NASICON-type structure is more appropriate for ion migration compared to the Sc2(WO4)3-type structure, especially for polycrystalline solid electrolytes.

For monovalent Li+ ion conducting solid electrolytes with the NASICON-type structure, the most suitable lattice size has been clarified by Aono et al.,[9] and they report the detail of the relationship between the Li+ ion size and lattice volume of the Li+ superionic conductor (LISICON) with the NASICON-type structure. Among LiM2(PO4)3 (M = Ge, Ti, Hf) with the NASICON-type structure, the LiTi2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte has proved to have the best lattice size for Li+ ion conduction. An optimum ratio of conducting ion size to lattice volume for the NASICONtype structure, which is calculated from LiTi2(PO4)3, is ~2.33 ´ 10–3 (Fig. 1). In 1994, Talbi et al.[10] reported that Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 (Ln = rare earth metal) with the NASICON-type structure could be prepared by a sol-gel method. However, the ratio of the Ln3+ ion volume to the lattice

volume (R) in Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 is considerably larger than the optimum ratio mentioned above. The R ratios are approximately between 2.84 ´ 10–3 (Ln = Yb) and 4.39 ´ 10–3 (Ln = La), which are the cases of the smallest and largest rare earth ions in Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared by Talbi et al.[10] The R value of Ln1/3Zr2(PO4)3 linearly reduces as the triva-

In this communication, a new trivalent cationic conductor, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, whose R ratio (see Fig. 1) is extrapolated to be ~1.66 ´ 10–3, was prepared for the first time by a sol-gel method, and its trivalent Sc3+ conducting properties were investigated.

From the X-ray powder diffraction measurement, the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 prepared was found to possess the NASICON-type structure, and the R ratio of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte was calculated to be 1.97 ´ 10–3, as plotted (H) in Figure 1. This ratio is larger than the value extrapolated from the solid line relation for the rare-earths La–Yb. However, the value is still low compared to the most suitable R ratio of Li+ ion conduction in the NASICON-type structure, and Sc3+ is expected to be a suitable ionic species for migration into the structure.

Figure 2 compares temperature dependencies of the electrical conductivity for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 with those of Sc2(WO4)3 and Al2(WO4)3, which show the highest and lowest trivalent ion conductivity in the Sc2(WO4)3-type tungstate solid electrolyte series, respectively. Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 shows a conductivity comparable to the tungstate series, and the conductivity at 600  30)C is 1.06 ´ 10–5 S cm–1, which is 2.5 times higher than that of Al2(WO4)3 (s600  30)C = 4.27 ´ 10–6 S cm–1).

range between 10–12 and 105 Pa, indicating neither electron nor hole conduction in the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte. From measuring the time dependencies of the DC to AC conductivity ratio (sDC/sAC), an abrupt decrease in the ratio was observed in both helium (PHe = 4 Pa) and oxygen = 105 Pa) atmospheres, which explicitly indicates that (PO2 oxide anions are not the conducting species in Sc1/3Zr2 (PO4)3, as similarly demonstrated in our previous paper.[1] Also, there is no conductivity difference at 600  30)C between wet(3.1 vol.-%) and dry-air atmosphere, and the proton conduction is excluded for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3. The above-described great polarizing behavior observed in the time dependencies of the sDC/sAC ratio reached higher than 0.95 after 30 min, indicating a predominantly ion migration in the solid. From the results mentioned above, the main conducting species are limited to cation species only (i.e., Sc3+, Zr4+, or P5+).

For the purpose of identifying the conducting cation species in Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, DC electrolysis, which can directly determine the mobile species in solid electrolytes, was performed using bulk Pt as the blocking electrodes. (The decomposition voltage of the Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte was preliminarily investigated and was determined to be ~2 V.) By applying a DC voltage of 3 V (which is higher than the decomposition voltage) for 400 h at 700  30)C, the mobile cationic species should migrate successively from the anode toward the cathodic direction and segregate on the cathodic surface, which is in contact with the cathodic Pt electrode. After electrolysis, deposits were detected at only the cathodic surface. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photograph of one of these deposits is presented in Figure 3. From electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) using spot analysis, the Sc/(Sc + Zr + P) ratio in the deposit increased to become approximately 7.6 times higher than that in the bulk before electrolysis the electrical conductivity for Fig. 2.

The oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the conductivity for Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 were examined, and the conductivity was found to be constant in a wide oxygen pressure

In summary, a new solid electrolyte, Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3, was synthesized by a sol-gel method. The conducting ion species was clearly demonstrated to be the Sc3+ ion, and its trivalent ion conductivity was comparable to that of the Sc2(WO4)3-type tungstate solid electrolyte series. Because the present solid electrolyte is based on phosphate containing Zr4+ and P5+, which are extremely difficult to reduce in a variety of atmospheres, in addition to the mobile Sc3+ ion, the phosphate electrolyte can be applicable even in a reducing atmosphere where hexavalent tungsten ions are easily reduced. The above-mentioned properties of the Sc3+ ion conducting Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 solid electrolyte have greatly contributed to opening a new door for realizing practical applications of advanced materials such as rechargeable batteries and various types of chemical sensors.

Sc1/3Zr2(PO4)3 was prepared by a sol-gel method using high-purity Sc2O3 (99.9 %), ZrOCl2×8H2O (99.95 %), and NH4H2PO4 (99 %) as the starting materials. Sc2O3 and ZrOCl2×8H2O were separately dissolved in a 3 N HNO3 solution and mixed with each other afterwards. Then a NH4H2PO4 solution (3 %) was dropped into the mixed nitric acid solution. After white precipitation was obtained, the solution was heated at 75  30)C for 24 h, then water in the solution was vaporized by heating at 130  30)C for 8 h. The dried precipitate was heated at 300  30)C for 24 h, and the white powder obtained was pelletized and sintered at 850  30)C for 24 h. Pt electrodes were sputtered on both center surfaces of the sample pellet. The AC conductivity of the sample was measured by a complex impedance method using the Precision LCR meter (Hewlett Packard) in the frequency range between 20 Hz and 1 MHz at a temperature range of 350–600  30)C in air. The polarization behavior was investigated by measuring the time dependence of the sDC/sAC ratio, and the oxygen partial pressure dependencies of the electrical conductivity were measured at oxygen pressures between 10–12 and 105 Pa. Electrolysis of the sample pellet was performed by applying a DC voltage of 3 V at 750  30)C for 400 h for the purpose of identifying the conducting species, and the investigation of the cathodic surface of the sample after electrolysis was done by SEM (SEM, S-800, Hitachi) and EPMA (EPMA-1500, Shimadzu).
