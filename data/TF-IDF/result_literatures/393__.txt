A novel NASICON-type K0.24Na2.76Fe2(PO4)3 (K0.24NFP) is synthesized via  a simple solid-state reaction method. K-doped method can enlarge lattice distance and  restrain the structure dilapidation from Na3Fe2(PO4)3 to Na5Fe2(PO4)3. Comparison  with undoped-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NFP) sample (82.1mAh g-1), K0.24NFP electrode shows a  101.3 mAh g-1 discharge capacity at 10 mA g-1, which up to 97% of theoretical  capacity. As for rate capability performance, a high reversible capacity of 73.6 mAh  g -1 at 1000 mA g-1. The cycle stability performance measurement results indicate that  the discharge capacity of K0.24NFP electrode is up to 93.7 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at  100 mA g-1. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the  improvement of structural stability and the highest intercalation-deintercalation  kinetic of sodium-ions (DNa +  = 3.98×10-11) due to K-doped. Hence, the K-doped  iron-based phosphate (K0.24Na2.76Fe2(PO4)3) should be a potential cathode material in  sodium-ions batteries for scale energy storage.

In our this work, we report that K-doped K3xNa3(1-x)Fe2(PO4)3 (X=0, 0.02, 0.05,  0.08, 0.10) composites as cathode materials in SIBs. Especially, the optimized  K0.24Na2.76Fe2(PO4)3 (X=0.08) exhibits great improvement in electrochemical  performance as SIBs. According to the structural analysis and electrochemical  measurement results, the method of K-doped can clearly increase the Na+ diffusion  coefficient, stabilize the channels structure and improve the electrochemical  performance for SIBs.

In conclusion, the K0.24Na2.76Fe2(PO4)3 (K0.24NFP) is synthesized via a solid-state  reaction method. The as-prepared K0.24NFP is applied as a cathode material in SIBs.  The sodium-ion storage capability of K0.24NFP is prominently enhanced compared  with bare-Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The discharge specific capacity is up to 101.3 mAh g-1 after  50 cycles without any attenuation. When measured at 100 mA g-1, the long cycle  stability performance K0.24NFP shows a discharge capacity of 97 mAh g−1 and  maintains at 93.7 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles and the corresponding coulombic  efficiency is up to 100% during all of the cycles. In particular, it still keeps a  reversible specific discharge capacity of 73.6 mAh g -1 at 1000 mA g-1. The excellent  electrochemical performance of K0.24NFP electrode is due to its larger lattice space  and higher Na+  diffusion coefficient for Na+  insertion/deinsertion. This work also  sheds insight into a novel K-doped method to improve the electrochemical  performance of electrolyte materials for other energy storage devices like lithium-ion  batteries or supercapacitors.
