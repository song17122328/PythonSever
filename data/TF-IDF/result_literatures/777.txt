We here prepared polystyrene-derived carbon-coated Na3V2(PO4)3 composite (NVP/C) cathode materials via a solid-phase reaction using a mixture of NVP precursor and polystyrene (as the carbon source), followed by calcination at high temperatures.
Using this method, we were able to obtain active NVP materials with relatively high purity while allowing a uniform surfacecoating with carbon layers about 34nm thick.
This structure significantly prevented NVP particle growth even after calcination at high temperatures.
The NVP/C material calcined at 700Â°C exhibited the best charge dischargeperformance among the samples studied.
Recently, our group and other group have reported promising battery performances of carbon-coated LiFePO4 (LFP) active materials synthesized with polystyrene as the carbon source.
18),19)In addition to LFP, the effectiveness of the present synthesis technique was confirmed for NVP.
Thus, this polystyrene-derivedcarbon coating method developed here represents a promising technique to improve the electrochemical properties of NVPand/or to design new active materials.
