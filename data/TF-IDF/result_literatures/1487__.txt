The solid electrolyte Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 (where y = 0, 0.1) compounds were synthesized by a solid state reaction and studied by X-ray diffraction. At room temperature the compounds belong to orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pbcn) with four formula units in the unit cell. Elemental compositions and binding energies of Zr 3d, Sc 2p, Y 3d, P 2p, O 1s, and Li 1s core level at Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 and Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics’ surfaces have been determined by XPS. Impedance spectroscopy of the ceramics has been performed in the frequency range 10–3× 109 Hz in the temperature interval 300–600 K. The substitution of Sc by Zr and Y in the host compound Li3Sc2(PO4)3 leads to the increase of ionic conductivity of the new ceramics.

Recently, solid state ionics gains intensive development due to the applications of solid electrolytes, especially in the energy related ﬁeld and sensors. The compounds with fast Li ion transport are attractive materials for the development of high energy batteries [1,2] and sensitive CO2 sensors [3]. It is known that Li3Sc2(PO4)3 compound is Li conductor at room temperature [4,5]. This compound belongs to monoclinic symmetry (space group P21/n) and above temperature 573 K Li3Sc2(PO4)3 crystals belong to orthorhombic symmetry (␥-phase) [5]. At room and T = 600 K temperatures the values of ionic conductivity of Li3Sc2(PO4)3 ceramics were found approximately to be 10−5 S m−1 and 6× 10−1 S m−1, respectively. In ␥-phase at temperature T = 600 K the value of ionic conductivity of single crystal of the compound was found to be  2) = 3.0 S m−1 with its activation energy E = 0.38 eV [5]. High ionic conductivity of the above-mentioned NASICON-type structure solid electrolyte compounds stimulates further investigation and makes the materials promising for applications in the functional elements of solid state ionics. The partial substitution of Sc3+ by Ti4+, Zr4+, Fe3+, Al3+, Y3+ in the NASICON-type framework structure causes a drastic increase of the value of ionic conductivity ( 2)) [4–8].

In the present work we are going to investigate Li3Sc2(PO4)3 with partial substitution of Sc3+ by Zr4+ (with stoichiometric factor x) and a further partial substitution of Sc3+ by Y3+ (with stoichiometric factor y). The preparation conditions of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 (where y = 0, 0.1) powders and ceramics, the results of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the surface of the ceramics and results of the investigation of electrical properties of the ceramics in the frequency range 10–3× 109 Hz in the temperature range 300–600 K by impedance spectroscopy are presented in the paper.

Conventional solid state reaction procedure was employed to prepare Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 (where y = 0, 0.1) compounds.Required amounts of chemicals Li2CO3 (purity 99.999%), Sc2O3 (99.99%), NH4H2PO4 (extra pure), and ZrO2 (99.9%) were heated at temperature T = 723 K for 6 h. After heating the mixture was placed in ethyl alcohol and milled in a planetary mill for 12 h. The obtained powder was heated at 1173 K for 3 h. The procedure was repeated three times. After the last milling the powder with Y was heated at temperature T = 1473 K for 2 h and the powder without Y was heated at temperature T = 1573 K for 2 h too. Finally, the mixture was milled and dried at T = 393 K temperature for 24 h. The millings were carried out in ethyl alcohol.

The structure parameters were obtained using Brucker D8 Advance equipment at room temperature from the X-ray powder diffraction patterns in the region 2 4) = 6–80◦, step 0.02◦, time per step 2 s, Cu K␣1 radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). The lattice parameters were deduced by ﬁtting the XRD patterns with software TOPAS.

Ceramic samples were used for XPS and impedance measurements. The powder was uniaxially cold pressed at 300 MPa. The sintering of the samples was conducted in air at temperature T = 1483 K (samples with Y) and T = 1573 K (samples without Y) for 1 h. Chemical bonding states of the constituent elements of the surfaces of ceramics were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS was recorded by LAS-3000 (ISA-Riber) surface analysis equipment. The instrument was equipped with doublepass cylindrical mirror analyzer MAC2. The XPS was obtained by using Mg K␣ (h 5) = 1253.6 eV) radiation at an average of 10 scans with step size of 0.05 eV. Before the measurement the samples were kept in a preparation chamber (residual pressure 1.6× 10−6 Pa) of the experimental setup for 1 day. The residual pressure in the analyzer chamber was 1.3× 10−8 Pa. In order to extract the core-level shifts and relative intensities of these components, a curve-ﬁtting procedure was utilized. The ﬁtting of the core-level data was performed using a nonlinear ﬁtting procedure (software XPSPEAK 41). Platinum electrodes were prepared on sintered cylindrical samples by conductive Pt paste (GVENT Electronic Materials LTD) ﬁred at 1073 K. For the measurements of electrical impedance in the frequency range 10–2× 106 Hz vector voltmeter–amperemeter method was used. The network with the sample was affected by the narrow spectra radio pulse. Voltage and current of this network were measured by two channel computer oscilloscope TiePie Handyscope HS3. For ac current measuring the special current–voltage converter, allowing accurate vector current converting, was used. The accurate complex impedance ( ˜ 6) =  6) 4) − i 6) 4) 4)) of the sample was computed by computer from the time functions of signals, measured by both scope channels. The measurements in the frequency range 3× 105 to 3× 109 Hz were performed by Agilent Network Analyzer E5062A connected to coaxial line, the part of inner conductor of which was replaced by the sample. The impedance of the sample was calculated from transmission and reﬂection parameters of such network. The temperature measurements of the ceramics in the low and high frequency ranges were performed in the range 300–600 K by Digital Thermometer TMD90A. The temperature was controlled by a computer connected to dc power supply Mastech HY 30005.

Fig. 1. shows powder X-ray diffraction patterns of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 (where y = 0 or 0.1) prepared by solid state reaction.

The indexing of XRD patterns has shown that the main phase of both compounds belongs to orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pbcn (D14 2 h)). The lattice parameters, unit cell volume (V), density (dX-ray) and formula units in the lattice (Z) of the investigated compounds together with the data of Li3Sc2(PO4)3 [5,9] are presented in Table 1. The substitution of Sc by Zr in Li3Sc2(PO4)3 and Sc by Y in Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 compound causes increase of the unit cell volume and density of the Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3. The variations can be caused by the different values of ionic radii of Sc3+ and Y3+ ions. The ionic radii of Sc3+ and Y3+ are 0.745 Å and 0.9 Å, respectively [10]. A small amount (2–3 mass%) of LiZr2(PO4)3 and Zr2O(PO4)2 was detected as impurities and the peaks of this admixture are marked with asterisks in Fig. 1. 

The relative densities of Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 and Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics were found to be 70% and 86% of the theoretical density, respectively.

XPS spectra of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics are shown in

To exclude any effects on the values of binding energies due to charging of the sample during the XPS analysis, all data were corrected by a linear shift such that the peak maximum of C 1s binding energy of adventitious carbon corresponded to 284.6 eV. Zr 3d, Sc 2p, Y 3d, P 2p, O 1s, and Li 1s core level XP spectra were ﬁtted.

Zr 3d spectra of both ceramics show spin–orbit doublet of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 (Fig. 2a). Zr 3d spectra of the samples have been deconvoluted into two spin–orbit doublets. In the sample with y = 0.1 the peak at lower Zr 3d5/2 binding energy (182.7 eV) is associated with lower oxidation state (Zr3+) [11]. The peak at higher binding energy (183.1 eV) indicates more positively charged Zr species and can be associated with Zr4+ state [12–14]. The binding energy splitting between Zr d5/2 and Zr d3/2 is 2.5 eV. In the samples with y = 0 the peaks with lower and higher energies are at 182.3 eV and 182.7 eV, respectively. The ratio of Zr4+ and Zr3+ was determined by ﬁtting and estimating the area of each doublet and it corresponds to different amounts of Zr4+ and Zr3+ states. According to NIST database, the binding energy of Zr-PO4 is at 182.7 eV. It is reported [15] that in the zirconium phosphate self-assembled ﬁlms the binding energy of Zr 3d5/2 is at 183 eV and Zr atom is bonded with groups PO3. The same value of binding energy of Zr 3d5/2 XP spectra was found in the nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia electrode operated in phosphorus-containing syngas [16]. The analysis of XRD patterns has shown that Zr atom in ZrP2O7 compound is bonded with two PO3 groups and one oxygen atom [16]. It is possible, that during sintering of the ceramics with Y some Zr4+ ions were substituted by Y3+. The substitution causes the formation of the zirconium phosphate like ZrO(PO3)2 in the grains or grain boundaries of the ceramics.

Sc 2p core level spectra of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 with y = 0.1 ceramics are presented in Fig. 2b. The spectrum shows spin–orbit doublet of Sc 2p3/2 and Sc 2p1/2. Sc 2p spectrum of ceramics is deconvoluted into two spin–orbit doublets. Sc 2p3/2 peak at binding energy 402.4 eV and the peak at binding energy 402.3 eV (y = 0) are associated with Sc2+ state in the phosphate. Sc 2p3/2 peak at binding energy 403.1 eV (y = 0.1) and peak at binding energy 403.3 eV (y = 0) are associated with Sc3+ state [17,18]. The splitting between Sc 2p3/2 and Sc 2p1/2 spectra is 4.5 eV.

P 2p XP spectra were deconvoluted into two peaks (Fig. 2c)(y = 0) can be associated with PO43− group. The peaks at binding energies 132.7 eV (y = 0.1) and 132.4 eV 3− group. The peaks at bind(y = 0) can be associated with PO4 ing energies 133.3 eV (y = 0.1) and 133.2 eV (y = 0) are associated with (PO3)1− group. The different intensities of the peaks in the sample with y = 0 can ascribe the situation if Sc environment is not only phosphorus group but also oxygen atoms too.

Fig. 2d shows the ﬁtting pattern of O 1s core level XP spectra. O 1s spectrum of both ceramics is deconvoluted into three peaks. The binding energies of O 1s core level XPS do not depend on the change of stoichiometric factor y. The peak at binding energy 531.0 eV was attributed to the lattice oxygen at the normal sites in the structures. O 1s peaks at 532.3 eV and 530.3 eV are assigned to the chemisorbed oxygen and in hydroxyl environment (OH) as in [19]. The binding energy at 530.3 eV can be assigned to oxygen atoms’ bonds with metal atoms.

Li 1s core level XP spectra of the ceramics with y = 0.1 and y = 0 are shown in Fig. 2e. Li 1s signal is of very low intensity but it is clear peak centered at 55.4 eV (y = 0.1). Li 1s core level XP spectra of ceramics with y = 0 is deconvoluted into two peaks. One peak maximum is at lower binding energy 54.9 eV, other peak maximum is at higher binding energy 56.1 eV. It is reported [20] that for the Li0.8CoO4 composition single Li 1s peak has been observed at 55.4 eV but for Li rich compositions such as LiCoO4 and Li1.2CoO4 an intense peak is at 55.4 eV, a shoulder peak around 55.05 eV has also been observed. The authors concluded that Li ions occupy two different positions. The results of the NMR study of LiTi2−xZrx(PO4)3 composition have shown that Li ions occupy two different positions in the lattice too [21].

Fig. 2f shows Y 3d XP spectrum of Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics. The spectrum shows spin–orbit doublet of Y 3d5/2 and Y 3d3/2 as in [22]. Y 3d5/2 spectrum of the ceramics is deconvoluted into two spin–orbit doublets. Y 3d5/2 peak at binding energy 157.8 eV can be associated with Y3+ state and the peak at binding energy 158.6 eV can be associated with Y2+ state. The splitting energy is 1.85 eV. In Y2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 glasses the splitting energy is 1.73 eV [22]. The relative amounts of elements with different binding energies, spin–orbit doublets’ splitting energies of Zr 3d, Sc 2p, P 2p, Y 3d, and element compositions observed for investigated ceramics are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.

The presence of mixed valence states of Y, Sc, Zr atoms plays an important role in controlling the structure and electronic states of the oxygen deﬁcient ceramics [23].

The impedance spectroscopy investigation of the ionic conductivity in the wide frequency and in the broad temperature ranges allows one to separate charge carrier transport processes in grains and in grain boundaries of the ceramics. The characteristic frequency dependences of the real part of complex conductivity ( ˜ 2) =  2) 4) + i 2) 4) 4)) of Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3. Three dispersion regions have been found in  2) 4) spectra for the investigated samples. As it is generally observed in solid electrolyte ceramics [24–27], the high frequency part of the recorded spectra can be attributed to the relaxation processes in grains, while the intermediate frequency part corresponds to relaxation processes in grain-boundary. The electrode polarization process is observed at even lower frequencies showing the ionic blocking character at Pt electrodes. The processes are thermally activated and dispersion regions shift towards higher frequencies as temperature increases. The temperature dependences of total conductivity ( 2)t =1/ 6)b +  6)gb, where  6)b is speciﬁc electrical resistivity of the bulk and  6)gb is speciﬁc electrical resistivity of grain boundaries of the ceramics) and bulk ( 2)b = 1/ 6)b) conductivity of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics were derived from the complex plots of  6) 4) 4)( 6) 4)) and  2) 4) 4)( 2) 4)). In Fig. 4a and b, the typical complex resistivity and complex electrical conductivity plots of the Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramic sample at 400 K with the indication of bulk and total conductivities are shown.

The temperature dependences of  2)b and  2)t of the ceramic samples are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The activation energies of  2)b and  2)t were found from the slopes of Arrhenius plots. From the maxima of  6) 4) 4)(f) at different temperatures, the characteristic relaxation frequency (fb) of the ionic migration process in the grains was determined, as described previously in [28–31]. In Fig. 6, the frequency dependences of  6) 4) 4) at different temperatures of Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 compound are shown. fb is thermally activated and change according to Arrhenius law: fb = f0 exp where f0 is an attempt frequency related to the lattice vibrations, Ef is the activation energy of fb, k is the Boltzmann constant. The activation energies (Ef) were calculated from the slopes of the Arrhenius plots of fb. Fig. 7 shows the temperature dependences of fb of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 compounds.

Table 4 summarizes our experimental results of the investigation of  2)t,  2)b, their activation energies Et, Eb and activation energy of characteristic relaxation frequency Ef. A good agreement is found between the activation energy of the ionic migration process in the bulk, Eb, and the activation energy of the characteristic relaxation frequency, Ef. Ef correlates with the activation energy of the mobility of the charge carriers in the bulk thus it is shown that the major role in the temperature dependence of bulk conductivity is played by the Li+ ion mobility which increases as temperature increases. The partial substitution of Sc by Zr in Li3Sc2(PO4)3 compound causes an ionic conductivity increase of almost two orders of magnitude despite the fact, that the amount of lithium is smaller in Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 compound. The bulk conductivity of Li2.8Sc1.7Y0.1Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics was found to be slightly higher and the activation energy lower compared to Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics. The increase of the conductivity values is possibly caused by the increase of unit cell volume of the materials (Table 1). The temperature dependences of the dielectric permittivity (ε 4)) and dielectric losses (tan ı) were investigated at the frequency of 1 GHz. This frequency is higher than Maxwell relaxation frequency fM =  2)b/2 9)ε 4)ε0 (where ε0 = 8.85× 10−12 F/m is dielectric constant of the vacuum). The temperature dependences of ε 4) and tan ı of Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics are shown in Fig. 8. At 300 K the values of fM, ε 4) and tan ı of the Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 ceramics are summarized in Table 5. The increase of the values of ε 4) with temperature of the investigated compounds can be caused by contribution of the migration polarization of lithium ions, vibration of lattice and electronic polarization. The increase of tan ı with temperature is related to the contribution of conductivity in the investigated temperature region.

The solid electrolyte Li2.8Sc1.8−yYyZr0.2(PO4)3 (y = 0 or 0.1) compounds have been synthesized by solid state reaction. At room temperature they belong to orthorhombic symmetry (space group Pbcn) with four formula units in the lattice. The values of binding energies of Zr 3d, Sc 2p, P 2p core level XP spectra, splitting energies of Zr 3d5/2–Zr 3d3/2, Sc 2p3/2–Sc 2p1/2, P 2p3/2–P 2p1/2 spin–orbit doublets, and amount of the elements with different binding energies depend on stoichiometric factor y on the surface of the ceramics. The ﬁtting of Li 1s XPS patterns has shown that Li ions occupy two different positions in the compound with y = 0 and Li 1s peak is observed at binding energy 55.4 eV in the compound with y = 0.1. The electrical properties of the ceramic samples were investigated by complex impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range from 10 to 3× 109 Hz and in the temperature range from 300 to 600 K. Three relaxation dispersion regions of electrical properties were found and the processes are thermally activated. High frequency dispersion region may be attributed to the relaxation processes in bulk, while lower dispersion regions are related to the processes in grain boundaries and blocking Pt electrodes. The partial substitution of Sc3+ by Zr4+ in Li3Sc2(PO4)3 and Sc3+ by Y3+ in Li2.8Sc1.8Zr0.2(PO4)3 compound causes increase of the unit cell volume, theoretical density, the value of ionic conductivity and decrease of the corresponding activation energy of the investigated compounds.
