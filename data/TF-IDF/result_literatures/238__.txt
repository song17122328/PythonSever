Water-stable and high lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolytes have potential for application as the separator in aqueous lithium-air batteries and as the electrolyte in all-solid-state batteries. Herein we have systematically examined the electrical and mechanical properties of water-stable NASICON-type Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 (LAGTP; x = 0.25–0.55) sintered at 900–1000 °C. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1.58 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed for Li1.35Al0.35Ge0.2Ti1.45(PO4)3 sintered at 950 °C, the conductivity of which is the highest in the NASICON-type lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolytes reported previously. The high conductivity could be explained by the high grain boundary conductivity of 6.58 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The conductivity showed no eﬀect of aging after more than one month immersed in saturated LiCl aqueous solution. A 3-point bending strength of 110 N mm−2 was also recorded for Li1.35Al0.35Ge0.2Ti1.45(PO4)3 sintered at 950 °C.

The design of high energy and power density lithium rechargeable batteries over conventional lithium-ion batteries has drawn signiﬁcant attention recently [1–4]. Many types of novel lithium rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-air [5], lithium-sulfur [6], and all-solid-state batteries [7] have been designed and developed to date. A high lithiumion conductivity solid electrolyte with excellent mechanical properties is the key material for the design of aqueous lithium-air and all-solidstate batteries. Many types of solid electrolytes have been reported in the last few decades, such as NASICON-type Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 (LATP) [8], garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [9], perovskite-type La2/3-xLixTiO3 (LLTO) and Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 [12]. Among these, thio-LISICON type electrolytes exhibit the highest lithium-ion conductivity of more than 10−2 S cm−1 at room temperature; however, they are hydroscopic and unstable in the open atmosphere, which hinders their application in aqueous lithium-secondary batteries. In comparison, NASICON-type solid electrolytes possess a typical advantage of stability in the open air and LiCl saturated aqueous solution [13] and thus have potential application in aqueous lithium-air batteries and all-solid-state batteries. A typical NASICON-type LiM2(PO4)3 structure consists of [PO4] tetrahedral connected in a corner sharing arrangement with MO6 octahedral. This structure provides three interstitial sites for the distribution of lithium ions [14,15]. To facilitate lithium ion diﬀusion at these sites, a variety of methods were developed to tune the lithium site size and thus boost the bulk conductivity of the solid electrolyte. Aono et al. reported a partial substitution of trivalent cations (Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, In La Ac, and Y) for Ti4+ in LiTi2(PO4)3 and found the highest lithiumion conductivity of 7.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 [8]. Many researchers have since reported the conductivity of substituted LiTi2(PO4)3. For instance, Chen et al. recently reported Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 glass ceramics prepared by the sol-gel method with an improved lithium-ion conductivity of 8.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C [16]. Zhang et al. proposed that the electrical conductivity of Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 was enhanced by the partial substitution of Ge and Al of 1.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 was found for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 sintered at 900 °C.


Although the bulk conductivity was increased by cation-doping, the lithium-ion conduction at grain boundaries still remains as a bottleneck to meet the requirement of high lithium-ion conductivity for electrolyte applications. For example, Zhang et al. reported a severe aging eﬀect of the grain boundary conductivity for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 sintered at 900 °C, where the precursor powders were prepared by a sol-gel method [18]. Arbi et al. reported that Al at grain boundaries in LATP and Li1+xAlxGe2-x(PO4)3 (LAGP) would result in grain-boundary blocking responses [19]. Mariappan et al. systematically studied the grain boundary conductivity in LATP and determined that it could not be explained by the common Mott-Schottky-type space charge layer model [20].

There have been few reports on the mechanical strength of doped LiTi2(PO4)3. Kyono et al. recently presented a 3-point bending strength of only 50 N mm−1 for Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3 sintered at 900 °C [21]. The commercial Li1+x+yAlx(Ti,Ge) SiyP3-yO12 glass ceramic provided by the Ohara company possesses a high bending strength of 140 N mm−1; however, conductivity is only ca. total 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature.

We have therefore conducted a detailed examination of the impurity phases, bending strength, lithium-ion conductivity and the stability of Li1+xAlxGe0.2Ti1.8-x(PO4)3 sintered at 900–1000 °C as a function of x and the sintering temperature with an aim to obtain a high lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolyte with excellent mechanical properties. The highest lithium-ion conductivity of 1.58 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C was observed in Li1.35Al0.35Ge0.2Ti1.45(PO4)3 sintered at 950 °C and its mechanical strength was as high as 110 N mm−2. The high lithium-ion conductivity solid electrolyte was also stable in a saturated LiCl aqueous solution which can be applicable in aqueous lithium air batteries.

The relative densities of the sintered samples were estimated from the ratio of the densities observed from the weight and volume of the sintered body, and those calculated from the lattice constants. The electrical conductivities of the sintered pellets (ca. 7 mm diameter and ca. 0.55 mm thick) with gold sputtered electrodes (ca. 1 μm thick) were measured using an impedance phase analyzer (Solartron 1260) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with a bias voltage of 10 mV. The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of the sintered pellets were estimated from complex impedance plots using Zview software. Threepoint bending strengths were measured using a tensile tester (Shimadzu EZ-S 500N).

Almost all of the XRD patterns for LAGTP-x sintered at 800 °C were indexed as NASICON-type. Small amounts of GeO2, AlPO4, and LiTiOPO4 as impurity phases were observed; the contents of GeO2, AlPO4, and LiTiOPO4 in LAGTP-0.35 estimated by Rietveld reﬁnement were 0.45, 2.33, and 0.33 wt%, respectively. The relative densities of LAGTP-x sintered at 800 °C were low at less than 85%. For further densiﬁcation, the LAGTP-x powders sintered at 800 °C were pressed isostatically into pellets and further sintered at 900–1000 °C for 7 h. Fig. 2(a)–(c) showed the measured XRD patterns and Table 1 lists the lattice parameter and impurity phase contents for LAGTP-x as a function of x at diﬀerent sintering temperatures. The XRD patterns for LAGTP-x with x at 0.25 to 0.55 sintered at 900–1000 °C indicated NASICON-type structure with impurity phases of GeO2, AlPO4, and LiTiOPO4, in addition to some unknown impurity phases. Unknown impurity phases were observed only in the case of LAGTP-0.5 and LAGTP-0.55. The amount of LiTiOPO4 was less than 0.5 wt%, which is considerably less than the 6 wt% of LiTiOPO4 observed in LATP [23] and LATP-GeO2 [24] sintered at 950 °C. The amount of AlPO4 was less than the 1.9 wt% and 3.8 wt% in LATP prepared by the solid-state reaction [16] and sol-gel methods [23], respectively. Approximately 1–2 wt% GeO2 was precipitated from the LAGTP-x main phase, which corresponds to ca. 20–40% Ge in lattice sites. The decrease of the lattice parameters with an increase in x for samples sintered at 900 °C and 950 °C was explained by the precipitation of GeO2, because high ionic radius Ti4+ (0.0745 nm) was substituted for low ionic radius Ge4+ (0.067 nm) [25]. The LAGTP-x sintered at 1000 °C showed a high content of AlPO4. The crystal size calculated by Rietveld reﬁnement (Table 1) was ca. 150 nm, except for LAGTP-x sintered at 1000 °C and LAGTP-0.4 and 0.45 sintered at 950 °C, which had large crystal sizes greater than 300 nm.

Cross-sectional SEM images of LAGTP-x are shown in Fig. 3. To identify the typical grain sizes of LAGTP, the samples were immersed in 2 M HCl solution for 3 min to expose the grain boundaries [26]. The average grain sizes of LAGTP-x sintered at 900 °C.
