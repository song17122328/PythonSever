The structure of NaZr2(AsO4)3, which belongs to the Nasicon-type family, was solved by the Rietveld method in the R3c space group, from X-ray powder diffraction data. The hexagonal unit cell parameters are ah ¼ 9:1518ð2Þ A˚ and ch ¼ 23:1097ð4Þ A˚ . The structure is formed by a three-dimensional network of AsO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra sharing corners. Na atoms occupy totally the M1 site. Raman and infrared spectra were recorded and assignments of the As–O stretching and bending modes were made.
Nasicon-type materials have been extensively studied in context of various ﬁelds of solid state chemistry: solid electrolytes, electrode materials, low thermal expansion ceramics, etc. [1–9]. Their structure was initially described for NaA2(PO4)3 (A ¼ Ti, Zr, Ge) [1]. It consists of a three-dimensional (3D) network built up of PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with AO6 octahedra. Within the 3Dframework, two sites, usually labelled M1 and M2, are available for the alkali metal cations. The M1 site is an antiprism formed by the triangular faces of two AO6 octahedra along c-axis of the hexagonal cell. Thus, the network of NaA2(PO4)3 can be considered as made up of inﬁnite ribbons of composition (O3AO3M1(Na)O3AO3)1 connected by PO4 tetrahedra. The M2 sites are located between these ribbons in large cavities with a eight-fold coordination. The M1 and M2 sites may be completely empty as in NbTi(PO4)3 [10], partially occupied as in NaZr2(PO4)3 [1] and Na3CaTi(PO4)3 [11], or fully occupied as in Na5Ti(PO4)3 [12]. 
In contrast to the extensive studies of the Nasicon-type phosphates and silicates, only a few investigations have been reported for the arsenates analogues. To our knowledge only X-ray powder diffraction patterns have been reported for MTi2(AsO4)3 (M ¼ Li, Na, Ag, K), M0.5Ti2(AsO4)3 (M ¼ Mg, Ca, Sr) [13] and MeZr2(As1 xPxO4)3 (Me ¼ Na, K) [14]. The structures of KZr2(AsO4)3 [15] and Na3Sc2(AsO4)3 [16] have been determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction data. Structural [17,18], electrochemical [19] and vibrational [20,21] studies of A3M2(AsO4)3 (A ¼ Li, Na; M ¼ Al, Fe, In) have been reported. Recently we initiated a program on arsenate compounds in order to compare their properties to those of the phosphates. The present paper reports on the crystal structure and vibrational spectra of NaZr2(AsO4)3.
NaZr2(AsO4)3 arsenate powder was prepared from Na2CO3 dissolved in dilute nitric acid solution (I) and aqueous solutions of ZrOCl28H2O (II) and (NH4)H2AsO4 (III) in stoichiometric proportions. After addition of (III) in (I þ II) mixture at room temperature and slow evaporation at about 60 8C, the resulting powder was heated progressively at different temperatures, between 200 and 800 8C, with intermitting regrinding. The powder of NaZr2(AsO4)3 is white. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Philips PW 3040 (y y) diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA). The structure of NaZr2(AsO4)3 was reﬁned with the Rietveld method using the program Fullprof [22]. The experimental conditions are given in Table 1.
Raman spectra were recorded using a Dilor XY Raman microprobe. The crystalline samples were excited with the 514.5 nm line of an Argon ion laser (Coherent model Innova 300). The spectral  1, the laser output power was 110 mW and the integration time 60 s. Infrared resolution was 3 cm spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 113 v FTIR spectrometer as KBr pellets.
The arsenate NaZr2(AsO4)3 has been synthesised and characterized by mean of X-ray diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy. Its structure has been solved in R3c space group. It is formed by a 3D network of ZrO6 octahedra and AsO4 tetrahedra linked by corners. The sodium is at the centre of the antiprism located between tow ZrO6 octahedra. Assignments of internal modes of the AsO4 tetrahedra have been made. The number of the peaks observed, in Raman and infrared spectra, is in good agreement with that predicted by the factor group analysis of the R3c space group.
