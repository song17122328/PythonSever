In  this  paper  a  sensing  mechanism  of  Nasicon  electrocatalytic  sensor  in  nitrogen  dioxide  and  ammonia  is  investigated.  Both  gases  are  environmentally  hazardous  and  contain  nitrogen  atom  in  the  molecule.  However,  it  seems  that  their  sensing  mechanism  in  electrocatalytic  sensor  could  be  totally  different.  Namely,  the  maximum  sensitivity for each gas was obtained at different temperatures. Also, different auxiliary layers are formed for each  gas.    © 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Electrocatalytic sensors belong to family of electrochemical sensors with solid state electrolyte. Their  sensing mechanism is based on application of periodically changing voltage and acquisition of current  response. Obtained in this way current-voltage plot provides fingerprint information about ambient gases,  which interact with sensor surface due to electrical excitation. So far relatively simple sensor structures  have  been  investigated.  Mostly,  those  structures  consisted  different  types  of  electrolyte  and  metallic  electrodes. We have been investigating those sensors before and it seems that Nasicon electrolyte with 

platinum electrodes is very good structure for sensing mechanism investigation [1,2]. The structure shows  unique  response  to  different  gases.  So  far,  the  major  drawback  of  electrocatalytic  sensor  is  related  to  instability due to formation of chemical phases on the sensor surface, which covers and block triple phase  boundary. However, it was found that the sensors, which exposed and poisoned by nitrogen dioxide, can  be at any time refreshed by short time high temperature treatment [3]. In order to improve sensor stability  in different gases it is necessary to better understand the sensors sensing mechanism. This work aims to  investigate Nasicon electrocatalytic gas sensor sensing mechanism in nitrogen dioxide and ammonia. 

In  this  paper,  Nasicon  (Na2.8Zr2Si1.8P1.2O12)  sensors  with  platinum  electrodes  were  prepared  and  investigated. Namely, Nasicon powder was prepared by the conventional solid-state ball milling method  from the zirconium oxide, silicon oxide and trisodium phosphate. The components were mixed in ball  mill  and  annealed  at  900 113)C.  Obtained  in  this  way  powder  was  compacted  into  pellets  (~12 mm  in  diameter and 1 mm thick) by iso-axial pressing. The pellets were sintered in air for 2 hours at 1100 113)C.  Electrodes were made by coating both sides of the pellet with the platinum paste (ESL ElectroScience,  ESL 5542) and firing at 900 113)C (surface area of 0.5 cm2). Measurements were conducted in mixtures of  high purity gasses: nitrogen dioxide or ammonia and synthetic air, which were supplied with a constant  gas flow of 100 sccm maintained by mass flow controllers. The experiments were conducted in a tube  furnace,  which  temperature  was  controlled  with  accuracy  better  than  0.5 113)C.  The  measurements  were  performed using the electrochemical interface Solartron SI 1287. 

To obtain sensor sensitivity in nitrogen dioxide and ammonia, a triangular voltage excitation signal  with the amplitude of 5 V and sweep rate of 50 mV/s was applied to the sensor. The electrical current was  recorded  during  sensor  polarization.  On  the  current-voltage  plot  the  peaks  with  different  heights  (maximum  of  the  electric  current)  were  visible  for  different  concentrations  of  ammonia  and  nitrogen  dioxide. This information was used to obtain sensors sensitivity S at different temperatures (1):  

S=Imax (in 100 ppm of gas) / Imax (in synthetic air)    To  investigate  sensors  sensing  mechanisms  XRD  pattern  of  the  electrode  surface  was  investigated.  Namely, a freshly fabricated Nasicon sensor was exposed to 100 ppm of ammonia or nitrogen dioxide at  200 113)C or at 350 113)C. At those temperatures the maximum sensitivity was recorded for each gas. When the  temperature was stabilized the sensor was polarized (biased) with 1 V for 7 hours to form a sensing phase  on the surface of electrode. The same sensing phase is formed during normal sensor operation, i.e. when  the sensor is excited with triangular signal. On currentvoltage plot it is reflected by the appearance of  peaks due to electrochemical reaction of formation and decomposition of the phases. The surfaces of the  sensors were investigated using X-ray diffractometry in order to determine the composition of the formed  phase. XRD patterns were recorded with Cu K 302) radiation at room temperature using Philips X’Pert Pro  diffractometer. Qualitative phase analysis of diffraction pattern was carried out with ICDD PDF database. 

Nitrogen dioxide and ammonia contain nitrogen atom and both gases are environmentally hazardous.  However, it seems that sensing mechanism of electrocatalytic sensor is not the same. The sensitivity level  and the temperature of the maximum sensitivity are different (see Fig.1). Namely, for the nitrogen dioxide  the maximum sensitivity of 34 was obtained at about 175 113)C, while for ammonia of 10 at about 350 113)C. To  investigate sensors’ sensing mechanism, freshly fabricated sensor structures were polarized at different 

temperatures  in  100 ppm  of  nitrogen  dioxide  and  ammonia.  The  electrodes  of  the  sensors  were  investigated by XRD in order to determine phases, which were formed on the electrodes as the result of  sensor  electrical  excitation.  In  Fig.  2.  is  presented  XRD  pattern  of  the  sensor  exposed  to  100 ppm  of  nitrogen  dioxide  at  200 113)C  and  polarized  with  1 V  for  7  hours.  It  was  found  that  on  the  negatively  polarized electrode the chemical compound was formed (see Fig.2a), which does not exist on positively  polarized electrode. The chemical compound was determined to be sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite and it  is expected that this compound is formed and decomposed during normal sensor operation. Unfortunately,  sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite show nearly the same XRD pattern, so it is impossible to distinguish  between them. In Fig.2b is presented XRD pattern of the sensor exposed to100 ppm of NO2 for 7 hours at  200 113)C  and 350 113)C.  The peak  in  XRD related  to  NaNO2/NaNO3  layer  is  much  higher  at  200 113)C  than  at  350 113)C. The sensitivity of the sensor at 200 113)C is much higher than at 350 113)C, what is in agreement with the  hypothesis that the NaNO2 or NaNO3 is responsible for sensing mechanism of electrocatalytic sensors.  

Contrary  to  the  sensor  exposed  to  nitrogen  dioxide,  in  ammonia  the  surface  of  the  negative  (and 

possitive) sensor’s electrode is free from any traces of NaNO2/NaNO3 both at 200 113)C and at 350 113)C.

Instead,  small  traces  of  sodium  peroxide  were  detected  at  350 113)C  (see  Fig.3).  At  200 113)C  the  sodium  peroxide  is  not  detected,  but  at  the  same  time  the  sensitivity  of  the  sensor  is  lower  than  at  350 113)C.  Therefore, it can be concluded that sensing mechanism of electrocatalytic sensor is different in nitrogen  dioxide  and  ammonia.  Namely,  in  nitrogen  dioxide  the  sodium  nitrate/nitrite  is  formed  on  the  sensor  electrode, while in ammonia the sodium peroxide. 

In  this  paper  the  sensing  mechanism  of  electrocatalytic  Nasicon  sensor  in  nitrogen  dioxide  and  ammonia  was  investigated.  It  was  found  that  the  very  high  sensitivity  in  nitrogen  dioxide  at  200 113)C  is  related to sodium nitrate/nitrite formation, which at 350 113)C – much lower sensitivity in nitrogen dioxide  was  barely  detected.  In  case  of  the  sensor  exposed  to  ammonia,  formation  of  sodium  peroxide  was  detected. The amount of this phase is lower at 200 113)C than at 350 113)C, what is in agreement with sensitivity  level at those temperatures.
