In recent years, the  rechargeable lithium-ion battery is widely studied  as power equipment of mobile  electronic product and electrically driven vehicle [1]. Currently, the commercial  lithium-ion battery  exists safety issue due to leakage and combustibility. That  the  solid state electrolyte possesses higher  stability excellent mechanical properties and non-flammable can optimize safety issue. Hence many  solid  electrolyte  have  been  studied  such  as  monocrystal  Li3N,  sulfide-base  glasses,  LISICON,  NASICON [2].

1976,  Goodenough  designed  a  new  solid  electrolyte  formed  with  the  three-dimensional  network  structure and named Na super ionic conductor (NASICON) [3]. 

The NASICON-type structure consist  of  MO6  octahedra  and  PO4  tetrahedra  and  is  linked  with  corner  to  form  a  [Ti2  (PO4)3] rigid  three-dimensional skeleton. 

The two different sites for mobile lithium ions are A1 and A2, respectively.  The A1 sites are fully occupied by lithium ions and lie an elongated octahedral oxygen environment, but  the  A2  sites  are  completely  vacant  [4].  

Anon  [2][5]  has  reported  LiTi2(PO4)3  with  poor  ionic  conductivity and high porosity, if the Ti4+ sites are partially substituted by some trivalent M3+ (M=Al or  Sc) in the LiTi2(PO4)3 systems, the conductivity has effective enhancement and the maximum can reach  7.  Anon  [2][5]  has  reported  LiTi2(PO4)3  with  poor  ionic  conductivity and high porosity, if the Ti4+ sites are partially substituted by some trivalent M3+ (M=Al or  Sc) in the LiTi2(PO4)3 systems, the conductivity has effective enhancement and the maximum can reach  7.0×10-4  s/cm  at  298  k  for  Li1.0×10-4  s/cm  at  298  k  for  Li1.3Al0.3Al0.3Ti1.3Ti1.7(PO4)3.7(PO4)3.  The  Ti4+  partially  replaced  by  Al3++Li+  and  the  Li+  insertion onto the A2 sites are not effect for the Li+ mobility. The conductivity enhancement is mainly  attributed to the grain boundary but no correlation with bulk. So the grain boundary is main factors to  improve the conductivity in LiM2 (PO4)3 systems [6].

In general, the LATP precursor is synthesized by conventional melting-quenching [7][8], sol-gel [9]  or solid-state method. 1996, Fu reported LATP specimens obtained by using melting-quenching method,  the  maximum  conductivity  of  1. 1996, Fu reported LATP specimens obtained by using melting-quenching method,  the  maximum  conductivity  of  1.3×10-3  s/cm  was  measured  at  room  temperature  [7].  

The  LATP  nano-powder reported by Y. Yoon et al sintered at 900°C for 3 hours by using a sol-gel method has a  room temperature conductivity of 7. Yoon et al sintered at 900°C for 3 hours by using a sol-gel method has a  room temperature conductivity of 7.8×10-5s/cm [9]. However, the melting-quenching inevitably cause a  lose of  Lithium due to sintered pelleted need heating 1450°C [7]  and  the  sol-gel method need higher  cost coprecipitator [10].But  the solid-state is a  method  of  simple,  low cost  and suitable for massContentfromthisworkmaybeusedunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution3.But  the solid-state is a  method  of  simple,  low cost  and suitable for massContentfromthisworkmaybeusedunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution3.0licence.
