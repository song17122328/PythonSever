Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x arsenate phosphates have been prepared by a sol–gel process and characterized by X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy, and impedance spectroscopy. The results indicate the formation of a continuous series of solid solutions with the Sc2(WO4)3 structure (sp. gr. P21/n) in the composition range 0 < x < 3. The unit-cell parameters of the solid solutions increase linearly with composition, as a consequence of arsenic substitution for phosphorus, which has a smaller ionic radius. The number of observed stretching and bending bands of the and ions in the IR spectra of the solid solutions agrees with that predicted by factor group analysis for space group P21/n. The observed gradual shift of the absorption bands of the AsO4 tetrahedra to lower frequencies with increasing arsenic content on the tetrahedral site supports the X-ray diffraction evidence of the formation of substitutional solid solutions. The cation conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x with 0≤х≤ 1 has been shown to exceed the conductivity of the parent magnesium zirconium arsenate.

Materials with the Sc2(WO4)3 (SW) structure, analogs of NASICON solid ionic conductors, are known owing to the possibility of ion substitutions on all of their crystallographic sites, without changes in their structural basis [1, 2]. Targeted changes in the cation and anion compositions of such systems ensure the formation of chemically complex materials with tailored electrical, magnetic, thermophysical, optical, catalytic, and other properties [3]. One of the key properties of the materials with the SW structure is their ionic conductivity. It can be controlled owing to the flexibility of their structural framework and changes in the dimensions of conductive channels, which are determined by iso- and heterovalent substitutions for the framework-forming ions. Heterovalent substitutions that allow the SW structure to persist alter the occupancy of mobile ions on vacant sites in the crystal lattice. Partial substitutions of ions in lower oxidation states for structureforming cations lead to an increase in the concentration of mobile ions on extra-framework sites and a rise in ionic conductivity [4–6]. Substitutions of ions in higher charge states lead to a targeted formation of an increased cation vacancy concentration [7]. High cation mobility in compounds with the SW structure, in combination with their chemical and thermal stability, suggests that they are promising materials. Solid electrolytes based on ionic compounds with magnesium cation conductivity have attracted researchers' attention in the context of a possible transition from lithium ion batteries to magnesium ion batteries, which hold more promise because of their higher capacity due to the larger charge of the Mg2+ ion (with a small difference in molecular mass between their compounds), the higher abundance of magnesium in the Earth’s crust, and its low cost [8–10]. The Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphate and Mg0.9 + 0.5yZn0.4AlyZr1.6− y(PO4)3 (y = 0.4) and Mg0.5 + y(Zr1− yFey)2(PO4)3 (y = 0.4) phases of variable composition have the SW structure, monoclinic unit cells, and 773 K magnesium ion conductivity from 10–5 to 10–4 S/cm [11–13]. Heterovalent substitutions of smaller cations in lower oxidation states (iron and aluminum) for zir- conium in the composition of these phosphates lead to an increase in the concentration of magnesium ions and a decrease in the size of conduction channels. Halim et al. [14] assumed the size of the structural channels in Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 to be too large for Mg2+ migration and substituted Si4+ (r = 0.41 Å) for the framework-forming cation Zr4+ (r = 0.72 Å) in order to raise the ionic conductivity of the material. The highest electrical conductivity of the Mg0.5Si2(PO4)3 sample sintered at 1073 K was 1.83 × 10–5 S/cm. The effect of anion substitutions on the electrical conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 have not been studied previously. At the same time, in a study of LiZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x solid solutions with the SW structure, their lithium ion conductivity was observed to increase systematically when phosphorus was replaced by arsenic, having a larger ionic radius [15]. In view of this, it was of interest to examine the effect of the size of the conduction channels in Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 on its ionic conductivity. In connection with this, the purpose of this work was to examine the effect of P5+↔ As5+ isomorphous substitutions on the composition and temperature stability ranges, IR spectroscopic properties, and ionic conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3– x solid solutions.

Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x samples with x = 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 were prepared by a sol–gel process followed by heat treatment. To this end, appropriate ratios of aqueous MgCl2 and ZrOCl2 solutions were poured together at room temperature with constant stirring. Next, solutions containing appropriate amounts of orthophosphoric and arsenic acids were added while stirring. The resultant gel was dried at 363 K and heat-treated in air at 873 and 1073 K for 24 h at each temperature, with several intermediate grindings. The chemical composition and homogeneity of the samples were checked by X-ray microanalysis on a JEOL JSM-7600F field emission (Schottky cathode) scanning electron microscope (SEM). The micro scope was equipped with an Oxford Instruments X-Max 80 (Premium) energy dispersive spectrometer system for X-ray microanalysis, with a semiconductor silicon drift detector. The elemental composition of the samples was determined with an accuracy of 2 mol %. X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were obtained on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (CuKα radiation,λ = 1.54178 Å, angular range 2θ = 10°–50°, scan step of 0.02°, continuous scan rate of 1°/min). X-ray diffraction data were used to determine the phase composition of the materials in the sample preparation process after each isothermal firing step and to ascertain whether the synthesized compounds were phase-pure. Unit-cell parameters were determined using indexed X-ray diffraction patterns. IR spectra of the synthesized magnesium zirconium arsenate phosphates were measured at room temperature in the range 4000 to 400 cm–1 on a Bruker IFS 125HR Fourier transform IR spectrometer equipped with a single-reflection diamond attenuated total reflection (ATR) module. The spectral resolution was 2 cm–1. Ionic conductivity was measured at frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz and temperatures from 323 to 1033 K using an IPU-62 ac bridge. The samples had the form of pressed cylindrical pellets (R = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) with platinum contacts. The heating rate was 2 K/min. The conductivity was determined by extrapolating the semicircle representing the bulk component onto the real axis.

Single-phase polycrystalline Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3– xsamples, white in color, were obtained at 1073 K. Xray diffraction data indicated the formation of a continuous series of solid solutions with the SW structure throughout the concentration range (0 < x < 3). The position of the diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the solid solutions was found to vary gradually with composition (Fig. 1). The X-ray diffraction patterns were indexed using data for Ni0.5Zr2(PO4)3, a structural analog [16]. According to analysis of systematic absences in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples, the synthesized magnesium zirconium arsenate phosphates crystallize in space group P21/n. The unit-cell parameters of the continuous isomorphous Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− xsolid solutions, determined after indexing their X-ray powder diffraction patterns, are given in Table 1. According to the electron microscopy and electron probe X-ray microanalysis results, the samples were homogeneous and consisted of grains differing in shape. Analysis of micrographs of the samples led us to conclude that the grains ranged in size from 1 to 10μm. Their compositions corresponded to the intended x values to within the accuracy of the method. As an example, Fig. 2 shows a micrograph of the x = 1.5 sample. According to the electron probe X-ray 1microanalysis results, its chemical composition corresponded to the intended one, Mg0.5Zr2As1.5P1.5O12, to within the accuracy of the method. The Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x samples with x≥ 1 were thermally unstable above 1073 K. The observed decomposition of the solid solutions was caused by the presence of larger sized arsenic ions on framework sites of the SW structure, which led to steric mismatch between the extra-framework sites and the magnesium ions occupying them. Figure 3 shows IR spectra of the arsenate phosphates. The spectra of the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 (x = 0) and Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)3 (x = 3) end-members are characteristic of compounds with the SW structure and space group P21/n [17, 18]. In their monoclinic structure, the phosphorus or arsenic atoms occupy three positions of C1 symmetry (4e). According to selection rules, their IR spectrum can contain eight stretching bands (ν1: Au + Bu,ν3: 3Au + 3Bu) and ten bending bands (ν2: 2Au + 2Bu ,ν4: 3Au + 3Bu) of the or complex ion for each of the three independent positions. The stretching region of the 1phosphate ion (x = 0) contains seven peaks due toν3 asymmetric vibrations (1003–1215 cm–1) and four bands ofν1 symmetric vibrations (920–980 cm–1). The bending region of the phosphate ion contains six bands of medium intensity due toν4 asymmetric vibrations of the tetrahedra (550–680 cm–1) and four bands ofν2 symmetric vibrations of the tetrahedra (415–480 cm–1). The absorption bands of the arsenate ion (x = 3) are shifted to lower frequencies by 150–200 cm–1 relative to the bands of the phosphate ion, in accordance with the increase in the mass of the central ion. Stretching −3 4PO modes of the ion show up in the ranges 820– 1025 (ν3) and 775–810 cm–1 (ν1), and its bending modes are observed between 400 and 520 cm–1 (ν4). The IR spectra of the solid solutions show absorption bands of both the or ions present in their structure. Throughout the spectral range studied, the spectra of all intermediate compositions have broader bands in comparison with those of the endmembers of the solid solution series, suggesting that the tetrahedral site is occupied by phosphorus and arsenic atoms at random. The spectra well illustrate the decrease in the percentage of phosphate ions (stretching vibrations between 915 and 1215 cm–1) and the increase in the percentage of the arsenate component (stretching vibrations between 775 and 1020 cm–1) across the solid solution series. The gradual shift of the absorption bands of the AsO4 tetrahedra to lower frequencies (858 cm–1 at x = 1 and 843 cm–1 at x = 2) with increasing arsenic content on the tetrahedral site attests to the formation of a continuous series of Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x substitutional solid solutions, in agreement with the above X-ray diffraction results.

The ionic conductivity of the Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x solid solutions was measured in the temperature range 740–950 K (Fig. 4). Extrapolation of the impedance plots obtained at lower temperatures resulted in high uncertainty. The samples with 0≤х≤ 2 had nearly the highest conductivity: (1–3) × 10–5 S/cm at 900 K and (1–1.7) × 10–6 S/cm at 773 K. These values are comparable to the ionic conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 [11] but lower than that of Zn-, Al-, and Fe-doped magnesium zirconium phosphates [12, 13]. Note that there is a pronounced tendency for the ionic conductivity to decrease as the degree of arsenic substitution for phosphorus increases. The observed behavior is most likely due to an increase in the size of the conduction channels in the structure of the material. It is known that there is an optimal relationship between the sizes of the conduction channels and migrating ions [9]. It seems likely that the slightly smaller size and larger charge of magnesium ions in comparison with lithium ions result in a relationship opposite to that observed previously for LiZr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x materials [15]. The present results are consistent with the finding reported by Halim et al. [14] that the electrical conductivity of the material in question increases with decreasing conduction channel size.

Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x samples have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction and IR spectroscopy. The results indicate the formation of a continuous series of solid solutions with the SW structure. Their unit-cell parameters increase linearly as P5+ is replaced by As5+, a larger sized ion. P5+ substitution for As5+, a larger sized ion, leads to a decrease in the ionic conductivity of Mg0.5Zr2(AsO4)x(PO4)3− x. The reduction in ionic conductivity seems to be caused by the increase in the size of the conduction channels, which are too large for Mg2+ migration.
