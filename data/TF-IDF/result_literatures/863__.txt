A NASICON-type (Na ion super conductor) structured Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) solid electrolyte with high lithium ion conductivity was synthesized using a simple solution method with 85% H3PO4 solution.

In comparisonwith conventional solid-state reaction and sol-gel method, the pure LATP powders and dense LATP pelletswere obtained at a relatively lower temperature.

The LATP powders and the resultant pellets were characterizedby X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AC impedance spectroscopy.

The LATP pelletobtained at 800 °C for 12 h shows the highest total conductivity of 1.21 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperatureand the lowest activation energy of 0.26 eV.

These results imply that the LATP electrolytes obtained using thismethod can be considered as candidates for solid state electrolytes.

Recently, the rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBS) have beenwidely used as power sources for mobile electronic devices and considered as one of the best large-scale energy storage systems for use inelectric vehicles and electrical energy storage systems [1].

However,the safety issues resulting from the leakage and combustion of organicliquid electrolyte restrict the large-scale applications of LIBS.

To improvethe safety and stability of LIBS, the inflammable ceramic electrolyteswith high electrochemical safety have been studied extensively, suchas Perovskite-type [2], NASICON-type [3], Garnet-type [4], andsulfide-based glasses [5].

Among the above-mentioned solid state electrolytes, NASICON-typeceramics have attracted much attention due to their high excellentconductivity at room temperature as well as good stability underatmosphere, which have been considered as potential candidates forsolid state electrolytes [3].

The LiTi2(PO4)3 ceramic electrolyte withNASICON-type structure is composed of TiO6 octahedral and PO4tetrahedral which are linked by shared oxygen atoms to form athree-dimension (3D) network structure.

In this structure, if the Ti4+cation is partially substituted by some trivalent cations such as Al3+,Sc3+, Y3+ or La3+, the conductivity of LiTi2(PO4)3 will be appreciablyenhanced, which can be ascribed to the increase of lithium ion contentas well as the densification of the sample pellets.

Moreover, the Aldoped LiTi2(PO4)3 (LATP) compound possesses the maximumconductivity.

Currently, various synthetic methods have been employed toprepare the LATP samples, such as solid-state reaction [6,7], sol-gelmethod [8–13], co-precipitation method [14,15], melt-quenching [16],spray-drying [17] spark plasma sintering (SPS) [18,19] and hydrothermally synthesis [20].
Aono et al.

 prepared Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3(M = Al or Sc) with the maximum conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1by solid-state reaction, which is almost comparable to that of Li3N. G.B. Kunshina et al.

 [10] synthesized Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) by amodified sol-gel process.

The LATP pellet sintered at 1000 °C has thetotal conductivity as high as (3–4) × 10−4 S cm−1. L. Z. Huang et al.

[14] synthesized Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 ceramic powders by a coprecipitation method.

The bulk and total lithium ionic conductivity ofthe sintered pellet at 900 °C for 6 h are 2.19 × 10−3 and1.83 × 10−4 S cm−1.Fu [16] prepared Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 using aconventional melt-quenching method and an extremely high value of1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 was achieved for the calcined sample at a temperature as high as 1450 °C. K. M.Kim prepared [20] Li1+xAlxTi2 − x(PO4)3solid electrolytes by an effective hydrothermal reaction.

The higherionic conductivities (2.56 × 10−4-2.65 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) arealso shown for the LATP (x = 0.3) samples sintered at 900–950 °C.

Among the above-mentioned methods, the solid-state reaction suffersfrom forming the secondary phases and the melt-quenching processrequires higher sintering temperature [14].

The sol-gel method andco-precipitation method involve in the complexing agent orcoprecipitator, which results in higher production cost.

Therefore, it ismeaningful to explore a low-cost method for the preparation of LATPsamples.

The solution method is a simple and low-cost method, which has beensuccessfully applied to prepare anhydrous proton conductors [22–24].

Compared with the solid-state reaction and sol-gel method, low temperature is needed for the preparation of inorganic powders, and thus reduces the energy consumption and production cost.

To our knowledge,there were no reports on the preparation of LATP powders using the solution method.

 In this work, the NASICON-type Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 powdersand electrolyte pellets were prepared via the simple solution method.

Theeffects of preparation parameters such as excessive Li content, sinteringtemperature and holding time on the electrochemical properties ofLATP electrolytes were investigated.

This study will offer a simple and effective approach to prepare high conductivity LATP electrolytes for allsolid state LIBS.

In this work, the pure LATP solid electrolyte powders with rhombohedral NASICON-type structure were successfully prepared via a novelsolution method.

Then, the dense electrolyte pellets were obtained ata low sintering temperature.

The electrochemical properties of LATPelectrolyte were strongly dependent on the sintering temperature aswell as holding time.

The produced LATP electrolyte sintered at 800 °Cfor 12 h shows the highest total conductivity of 1.21 × 10−3 S cm−1 at25 °C and the lowest activate energy of 0.26 eV, which is attributableto its dense structure.

These results demonstrate that the solutionmethod is an effective approach to prepare high electrical conductivityLATP electrolytes at a lower sintering temperature.
