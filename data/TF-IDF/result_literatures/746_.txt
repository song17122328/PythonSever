A novel NASICON-type carbon-coated LiTi2(PO4)3 microflowers(LTP-F/C) as hybrid magnesiumâˆ’lithium-ion batteries (MLIBs)cathode is presented for the first time.
Benefiting from thesynergistic effect of NASICON structure, nanosheet-constructedhierarchical architecture, and uniform carbon coating of LTP-F/C,this hybrid MLIB exhibits extraordinary electrochemicalperformance: ultra-high cycling stability (capacity retention of 80%after 3000 cycles at 10 C) and outstanding rate capability (94 mA hg-1 at 20 C) under a high discharge voltage plateau of ~1.71 V (vsMg/Mg2+).
This hybrid battery system design is highly promisingfor large-scale energy storage applications.
In summary, a novel high-performance hybrid MLIB using NASICONtypehierarchical LTP-F/C microflowers as the cathode and dendrite free Mg metal as the anode has been successfully fabricated.
Combining the advantages of NASICON-type LTP and 3D carbon skeleton, the unique 3D hierarchical structure offers rapid Li+diffusion, and electron transport pathway, high electronic and ionicconductivity, and stable structure during lithiation/delithiation,leading to outstanding high-rate capability (94 mA h g-1 at 20 C) andultra-long life cycling stability (capacity retention of 80% after 3000cycles at 10 C with high average coulombic efficiency of 99.99%).
Moreover, this hybrid battery delivers an energy density up to 220Wh kg-1 with a power density of 0.22 kW kg-1, even the powerdensity is increased to 2.94 kW kg-1, the energy density still retains147 Wh kg-1, which is significantly better than that of Mg-ionbatteries based on Mo6S8 cathodes and the state-of-the-artelectrodes of hybrid MLIB systems with low cost stainless steelcurrent collector.
Our work demonstrates that the novel 3Dhierarchical LTP-F/C is a highly promising cathode of MLIBs forcommercial.
