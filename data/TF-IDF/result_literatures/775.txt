Fe2-xSnx(MoO4)3 samples were successfully synthesized by wet chemical route.
The analytical results of X-ray diffractions indicated that the additions of tin have not destroyed the lattice structure of Fe2-xSnx(MoO4)3, but increased the units cell volume.
Fe2-xSnx(MoO4)3 can be exhibited higher discharge /charge capacities and better cycle-stability than the pristine one.
At room temperature, the initial discharge capacity of Fe1.95Sn0.05(MoO4)3 is 83.12 mAh g-1 at a discharge rate of 0.5 C and remains 78.81 after 50 cycles.
The improved electrochemical properties can be explaining with the presence of tin in the lattice of Fe2(MoO4)3 by improved the structure stability and electrical conductivity.
