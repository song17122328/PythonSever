This article summarizes our research on solid electrolytes for rechargeable aqueous lithium-air batteries. Aqueous lithium-air batteries have potential application as a power source for electric vehicles, because of their high speciﬁc energy density. A water-stable lithium ion conducting solid electrolyte is the key material for lithium-air batteries to use lithium metal in aqueous circumstance. In this article, two types of lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes, NASICON-type Li1+xAxTi2−x−yGey(PO4)3 (A = Al, Fe) and garnet-type Li7−xLa3Zr2−xAxO12 (A = Nb, Ta) are introduced, and the conductivity behavior of these solid electrolytes by elemental substitution, their chemical stabilities in water and electrochemical stabilities with lithium metal are discussed. Lithium ion conductivities of 1.3 × 10−3 and 5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25°C were observed in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 and Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12, respectively. These solid electrolytes are unstable in water, but stable in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution. The former solid electrolyte is unstable in contact with lithium metal, while the latter electrolyte shows stability against lithium metal. © The Electrochemical Society of Japan, All rights reserved.

In 1996, Abraham and Jiang1 reported a novel rechargeable cell with lithium metal and air. The cell consisted of a lithium metal anode, a non-aqueous gel-type lithium conducting polymer electrolyte, and a carbon air electrode with a catalyst. The observed open circuit voltage of the cell was ca 3.0 V at room temperature. This cell was rechargeable and had good columbic efﬁciency. The calculated energy density of this system is 3458 Wh kg¹1 (including oxygen), which is approximately 8 times higher than that of a conventional lithium-ion battery. Lithium-air batteries are now attracting increased attention for application in electric vehicles.2 However, the non-aqueous system has some severe problems that must still be addressed, such as lithium corrosion by water from air, electrolyte In 2004, Visco et al.3 decomposition and high overpotentials. proposed an aqueous lithium-air battery using a water-stable NASICON-type solid electrolyte of Li1+x+yAlx(Ti,Ge)2¹xP3¹ySiyO12 (O-LATP), which was purchased from Ohara Ltd. Japan. The calculated speciﬁc energy density of the aqueous system was 1910 Wh kg¹1, because water is active materials as shown in the following cell reaction.

The key material for the aqueous lithium-air system is water-stable lithium conducting solid electrolyte. Various types of solid lithium ion conducting electrolytes have been reported, such as the layeredtype structure of Li3N,4 Li2S based glasses,5 perovoskite-type La2/3¹xLi3xTiO3 (LLTO),6 NASICON-type Li1+xAxTi2¹x(PO4)3 (A = Al, Fe, Sc, etc.) (LATP),7 and garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ).8 More recently Kanno and co-workers9 reported Li10GeP2S12 as a lithium super ion conductor with an extremely high lithium ion conductivity of 1.2 © 10¹2 S cm¹1 at room temperature. However, only two types of high lithium ion conductivity solids, LATP and LLZ, are presently known to be stable in an aqueous solution with a high concentration of lithium salt. In this article, the conductivity behavior and stability in aqueous solutions of the NASICONtype Li1+xAxTi2¹x¹yGey(PO4)3 and garnet-type Li7¹xLa3Zr1¹xMxO12 (M = Nb, Ta) electrolytes are investigated.

The NASICON (Na+ Super Ionic Conductor)-type solid ion conductors with three-dimensional conduction pathways10,11 were discovered in 1976 by Goodenough and co-workers. A series of the lithium ion conductors Li1+xAxTi2¹x(PO4)3 (A = Al, Cr, Ga, Fe, Sc, In, Y, and La) were reported by Aono et al.,7,12 of which the highest conductivity of 7 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C was reported for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3. Fu13 reported higher conductivity of 1.3 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 at room temperature for the Li1+xAlxTi2¹x(PO4)3 glass ceramic. Germanium-substituted identical Li1+xAlxGe2¹x(PO4)3 was also reported to have a high lithium ion conductivity at the highest electrical conductivity of 5.08 © room temperature; 10¹3 S cm¹1 at 27°C was obtained for the Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 glass ceramic after annealing the glass sheet at 850°C for 12 h.

The NASICON-type oxides are potential candidates for the protection layer due to their reasonable conductivities. Our target conductivity is higher than 10¹3 S cm¹1 at room temperature and the thickness of the electrolyte should be less than 200 µm. In the following chapters, we discuss the electrical conductivity and stability in aqueous solution for the Li1+xAxTi2¹x¹yGey(PO4)3 (A = Al, Fe) system prepared from a sol-gel precursor,15,16 and thin ﬁlm preparation of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 by tape-casting method is also introduced.

The effect of Ge substitution for Ti on the electrical conductivity was studied for the entire Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 system (x = 0– 1.6).15 The precursor of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 was prepared by the sol-gel method using citric acid. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 (x = 0–1.6) sintered at 900°C for 11 h indicated the NASICON-type structure without impurity phases. Figure 1 shows the change of the lattice constants with x in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 at room temperature, where the lattice constants were calculated in a hexagonal crystal system. The overall lattice constants of both a and c-axes were decreased by the substitution of Ti4+ with Ge4+, since Ge4+ has a smaller ionic radius (0.067 nm) the constants are obviously not proportional to the composition x and do not obey Vegard’s the compositions, Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 and Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6(PO4)3 have a different structural dependence upon x. As a consequence, two phases arise in the range around x = 0.3–1.2 between each solid (x = 0–0.3) and solution regions of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 (x = 1.2–1.6) at room temperature. This consideration is partly supported by the relative density proﬁle against the composition x. Sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 revealed two maxima at x = 0.2 and 1.2 in the density proﬁle. There is a miscibility gap existing between these two compositions and two-phasic region may occur.

Figure 2 shows the total electrical conductivities measured at 25°C of as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3 samples and those stored for one month, where the samples were sintered at 900°C for 11 h. When Ge4+ was substituted for Ti4+, the bulk conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 was enhanced by approximately three times, while the grain boundary conductivity was remarkably improved by one order. However, it showed a signiﬁcant aging effect, as revealed in Fig. 2(b) for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3, and this results in the decrease of the total conductivity with the aging period. As-sintered samples show the highest total conductivity of 2.25 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 at x = 0.2 and 25°C. After one month storage, a stable total conductivity of 1.29 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 was obtained, where the bulk and grain boundary conductivities were 2.35 © 10¹3 and 2.89 © 10¹3 S cm¹1, respectively. This bulk conductivity is higher than those in literatures, for example, 7 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 for Li1.5Al0.5Ti0.7Ge0.8(PO4)3 reported by Maddonadeo et al.17 The second conductivity peak was observed at x = 1.2 in Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6¹xGex(PO4)3. The total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities after storage of the same composition were 3.44 © 10¹4, 6.67 © 10¹4, and 7.65 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C, respectively. The total conductivity was higher than that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (1.77 © 10¹4 S cm¹1), but the bulk shows lower conductivity than that of the same (8.04 © 10¹4 S cm¹1).

The chemical stability of these NASICON oxides as a protection layer in highly alkaline circumstance must be examined, because the reaction product of aqueous lithium-air batteries is LiOH. The stability of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, and saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution at 50°C for one week was examined. The XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in these solutions revealed no apparent impurity phases. However, their impedance proﬁles change after immersion in these solutions as shown in Fig. 3. The grain boundary resistance of the sample immersed in distilled water increased drastically from 12.2 to 552 ³ cm2, while the bulk resistance increase remains within a negligible level. One possible explanation is an ion-exchange between Li+ in the ceramic and H+ in aqueous solution, as observed in La2/3¹xLi3xTiO3.

On the other hand, the samples immersed in saturated LiCl aqueous solution and in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution did not show signiﬁcant changes in the impedance responses. The conductivity was 1.66 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 at 25°C for as-sintered Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution for one week, which is comparable to 1.29 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 of the same sample after one week aging shown in Fig. 2(b). It can be concluded that Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 is stable in the saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution and is thus acceptable for use as the protective layer in a water-stable lithium electrode for aqueous lithium-air batteries.

The effect in the electrical conductivity on the substitution of Al3+ (0.0675 nm) by Fe3+ (0.0785 nm) with a larger ionic radius than Al3+ has been examined. The precursors of Li1.4Al0.4¹xFexTi1.6(PO4)3 were prepared by the sol-gel method using citric acid. XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.4¹xFexTi1.6(PO4)3 with x = 0.1–0.4 sintered at 1040°C for 7 h showed the NASICON-type structure, and the lattice parameter for the aand c-axes increased with x. The relative density for Li1.4Al0.4¹xFexTi1.6(PO4)3 increased with x from 90.8% for x = 0 to 93.6% for x = 0.25 by substitution of Fe for Al. The relative density of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 is comparable with that for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3.

Figure 4 shows the compositional dependence of the total, bulk, and grain boundary conductivities at 25°C for samples stored at room temperature for one month. Maximum conductivities are material contains transition metals such as iron. The electronic conductivity of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 was estimated using Hebb-Wagner method20 using LiCoO2/Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3/ Au cell, where LiCoO2 was used as the reversible electrode for lithium ions. Lithium metal is the ideal electrode for the purpose, but Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 is unstable in contact with it. A small direct current was passed through the cell and the steady-state cell voltage was measured as a function of the current density at 25°C. The resulting current-voltage curves do not completely obey the Hebb-Wagner equation. This is because the chemical potential of lithium ions in the LiCoO2 electrode does not remain constant. The electronic conductivities at 25°C were 2.5 © 10¹7 S cm¹1 at 0.4 V and 8.8 © 10¹7 S cm¹1 at 1.14 V estimated from the current and steady-state cell voltage. It was concluded that the contribution of electronic conductivity to the total conductivity is negligible.

The stability in aqueous solutions was examined for Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3. XRD patterns of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in distilled water, saturated LiCl aqueous solution, and saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution at 50°C for one week revealed no impurity phases and no changes in the intensity the impedance proﬁles ratio of the diffraction peaks. However, showed a change after immersion in these solutions as shown in Fig. 5. The grain boundary resistance of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in distilled water increased signiﬁcantly from 27 to 148 ³ cm2, and the bulk resistance also increased from 51 to 93 ³ cm2. However, the grain boundary and bulk resistance of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in saturated LiCl aqueous solution and saturated LiCl with saturated LiOH aqueous solution were signiﬁcantly decreased; the total conductivity of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 immersed in these solutions were increased from 1.19 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 to 3.44 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 and 4.35 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 in the ambient atmosphere at 25°C, respectively. A similar enhancement of conductivity by immersion in saturated LiCl aqueous solution was previously reported for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 by Takahashi et al.21 The enhancement was explained by the formation of LiCl·H2O at the grain boundaries. The conductivities of the samples were decreased, if stored for several hours in an argonﬁlled glove box (dew point of ca. ¹80°C), to the similar value as that for the pristine samples before the immersion. It was concluded that the high lithium ion conductivity Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 is obtained for x = 0.25, which are 1.01 © 10¹3, 1.8 © 10¹3 and 2.17 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 for total, bulk and grain boundary, respectively. The average ionic radius of Al3+ and Fe3+ in x = 0.25 is 0.0742 nm, which is close to the ionic radius of Ti4+ (0.0745 nm). The maximum conductivity at this composition, therefore, could be explained by the interaction between vacancies produced by the substitution of Al3+ and Fe3+ for Ti4+ and alleviation of lattice stress by the structural effect, as observed for Zr1¹xMxO2 (M = lanthanides).19 The bulk and grain boundary conductivities of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 are slightly lower than those of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3. The effect of aging on the electrical conductivity of Li1.4Al0.4¹xFexTi1.6(PO4)3 was not as severe as that observed for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3. The activation energy for the bulk and grain boundary conductivities of Li1.4Al0.15Fe0.25Ti1.6(PO4)3 were 17.0 and 43.9 kJ mol¹1, respectively, which were calculated from the temperature dependences in the range from 25 to 80°C. These activation energies are lower than 20.2 and 55.0 kJ mol¹1 for Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3, respectively. The contribution of electrons (and/or holes) to the conductivity of solid electrolytes should be considered, especially when a maintained in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution and acceptable for use as the protective layer in a water-stable lithium electrode for lithium-air batteries.

A calculation of energy density for lithium-air batteries showed that the weight of 100 µm thick solid electrolyte was approximately 50% of the total weight of components without a package.22 Therefore, the solid electrolyte as a lithium electrode protective layer should be thin enough, but resistant to water permeation. A tape-casting method is suitable for fabrication of a large-size thin sheet.23 A well-mixed slurry was tape-cast which consists of the ﬁne powder of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3, TiO2 (sintering additive), menhaden ﬁsh oil (dispersant), polyvinylphthalate (binder), and butylbenzylphthalate (plasticizer). After drying, the green sheet was sintered at 1060°C for 2 h. XRD patterns of the tape-cast Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 showed main peaks of the NASICON-type structure, TiO2 as sintering additives, and AlPO4. AlPO4 was found to solely occur from the starting Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 powder sintered at 1100°C for 6 h. The highest conductivities of 5.5 © 10¹3 and 7.7 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C were obtained for bulk and grain boundary of the tape-cast Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2, respectively.

The other important requirement for the protective layer is to prevent water permeation through the sheet. The water permeation test was carried out using an H-type cell with a saturated LiCl aqueous solution on one side and distilled water on the other side. A linear increase of the chloride ion concentration in the water side was observed for the tape-cast sheet. To suppress the water permeation, open pores were ﬁlled with epoxy resin in the sheet. Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2 with epoxy resin of about 1.5 wt% showed no chloride ion permeation detected even after storage for 17 days. The total conductivity of the epoxy-composite sheet at 25°C was 4 © 10¹4 S cm¹1, which is approximately half that of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2, but higher than that of the dense O-LATP glass ceramics plate (1 © 10¹4 S cm¹1). The bulk and grain boundary conductivity at 25°C were 2.3 © 10¹3 and 4.7 © 10¹4 S cm¹1, respectively. Figure 6 shows impedance proﬁles of the lithium-air full cell whose conﬁguration is described as Li/polymer electrolyte/Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2 with epoxy resin/ saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution/Pt, air.

The cell was stored at a certain period and 60°C, and the impedance proﬁles show two semicircles in high and low frequencies. The semicircle in the high frequency range corresponds to the resistance of the Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2 with epoxy resin and polymer electrolyte. One in the low frequency range corresponds to the interfacial resistance between lithium electrode and polymer electrolyte including charge transfer resistance. The semicircle at high frequency shows no change with time, while low frequency resistance increases slightly with the storage period of 20 days. A stable open-circuit voltage of 3.0 V at room temperature was observed for 20 days, which conﬁrms tape-cast Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2 with epoxy resin prevents water permeation and is stable in the aqueous solution as expected from each evaluation test. These results conﬁrmed that the tape-casting combined with resin inﬁltration can produce a large-size, stable and effective water-protective layer for a water-stable lithium electrode of lithium-air batteries.

The other candidate of the water-stable lithium conducting solid electrolyte is the garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZ). In 2007, Weppner and co-workers8 reported that the lithium excess garnet-type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 exhibits a high lithium ion conductivity of 2.44 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C, which is stable in molten lithium metal, and is not so sensitive to moisture. This compound is quite attractive as the protective layer of a water-stable lithium electrode for lithiumair batteries.

Ohta et al.26 reported that Nb-doped LLZ has a high ionic conductivity of 8 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C. However, there is some debate as to the stability of the Nb-doped LLZ in contact with metal. Li et al.27 reported the lithium ion conductivity of the Ta-doped LLZ series, Li7¹xLa3Zr2¹xTaxO12 (x = 0–1.0), sintered at 1140°C for 16 h, where the highest total conductivity of 1 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 at 25°C was observed for x = 0.6. This lithium ion conductivity is comparable to that of NASICON-type Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 solid lithium ion conductor.15 On the other hand, the electrochemical stability in contact with lithium metal, the chemical stability in aqueous solution, and the discharge/charge performance of the interface with lithium metal electrode have not yet been studied in detail. We have investigated these points for Nb and Ta doped LLZ as a potential protective layer which does not need an additional layer at the boundary with lithium metal.

Characterizations of the Nb-doped garnet oxides were conducted as follows. XRD patterns of LLZ-0.25Nb prepared at 1150°C using sol-gel precursors showed no impurity phases. The atomic molar ratio of Li/La/Zr/Nb/Al was 6.46/3.38/1.75/0.23/0.12, where the ratio was normalized to Zr at 1.75. Aluminum contamination comes from an alumina crucible used for the high temperature sintering. The Al content in Li7La3Zr2O12 is an important structure parameter and is dependent on the sintering temperature; LLZ sintered at 1180°C is reported to contain around 0.25 mol%28 and 0.23 mol%.29 Al-free Li7La3Zr2O12 does not show cubic phase at room temperature, while the tetragonal phase is reported stable.30 Matsui et al.31,32 conﬁrmed the phase transition of Al-free Li7La3Zr2O12 from tetragonal to cubic at 650°C by high temperature XRD analysis. Doping with aluminum is considered to stabilize the high room temperature.30,31,33,34 Similar temperature cubic phase at stabilization of the high temperature cubic phase of Li7La3Zr2O12 was also achieved by the substitution of Zr4+ with Ta5+ without presence of Al.35 This stabilization adds high lithium ion conductivity to Li7La3Zr2O12. Li6.75La3Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 (LLZ0.25Nb) in the series gives the highest electrical conductivity of 5.69 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C, which is slightly lower than the reported value by Ohta et al.

We examined the stability of LLZ-0.25Nb in contact with lithium metal.36 Figure 7 shows impedance proﬁles measured at 0°C for the Li/LLZ-0.25Nb/Li cell stored for various periods at room temperature. The impedance proﬁles show three components; the bulk (Rb), grain boundary (Rgb), and the interface (Ri) resistance which were estimated using the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7. The size of the spectra increased gradually with the storage time over 5 months. The change with storage time of each component Rb, Rgb, and Ri measured at 0°C is shown in Fig. 8. The data show that the increase of Rgb and Ri is remarkable, while Rb is unchanged during 5 months. The grain boundary conductivity of solely stored LLZ-0.25Nb at room temperature decreased from 1.3 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 to 4.8 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 after 3 months of storage, so that the increase of grain boundary resistance is due to an aging effect. The increase in Ri could be explained by a reduction of Nb5+ in contact with lithium, which result in formation of high resistance interlayer with lithium metal.


The Ta-doped garnet oxides are discussed and compared with the Nb-doped analogue. Li7¹xLa3Zr2¹xTaxO12 (x = 0–0.7) as nominal compositions were synthesized using sol-gel precursors at 1180°C for 36 h in an alumina crucible. X-ray diffraction peaks were assigned to the cubic garnet structure reported by Awaka et al.37 Dense LLZ-xTa pellets were sintered at 1180°C for 36 h using a mixture of ﬁne precursor powders with average particle sizes of 2.8 and 1.2 µm. The relative densities were 96.7% for LLZ-0.25Ta, 96.2% for LLZ-0.3Ta, and 96.0% for LLZ-0.7Ta. Water permeation tests using the H-type cell conﬁrmed that a pellet of LLZ-0.25Ta with the highest relative density prevented the permeation completely.

Figure 9(a) shows impedance proﬁles for Au/LLZ-xTa/Au symmetrical cells at 25°C. Estimated total and bulk conductivities as a function of x are summarized in Fig. 9(b). The highest bulk conductivity of 6.55 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C was observed for LLZ0.25Ta. Wang and Lai,38 and Li et al.27 reported the bulk conductivity of 9.6 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 for x = 0.3 and 1.0 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 for x = 0.6 in LLZ-xTa, respectively. The results have implications that bulk conductivity depends on concentration of Li+ and Al3+ ions in the lattice which changes by dopant concentration x and sintering temperature.

Li7¹xLa3Zr2¹xTaxO12 sample at x = 0.25 compared with those reported may be due to high aluminum content introduced by high temperature sintering using an alumina crucible. The impedance proﬁle of LLZ-0.25Ta stored in a glove box with silica gel showed no aging effect after 4 months.

Table 1 summarizes the atomic molar ratios of Ta, Nb and Al2O3 doped LLZs along with the bulk conductivities and lattice parameters, where the atomic ratios were normalized to Zr + Ta (or Nb) at 2.0. Fluctuation of the atomic ratios among those sintered samples was due to the difﬁculty in controlling the evaporation of lithium during the high temperature sintering and aluminum contamination from the alumina crucible through the mother powder. However, the data provides some interesting insights into the effect of lithium and aluminum content on the bulk conductivity. The maximum bulk conductivity was obtained for the sample with the lithium and aluminum content of 6.32 and 0.08, respectively. Aluminum doping introduces lithium vacancies enhancing lithium diffusion, but aluminum becomes an obstacle to lithium diffusion simultaneously. Both contents need controlled to have high electrical conductivity for the cubic LLZ.

The stability of LLZ-0.25Ta in an aqueous solution was examined. Galven et al.41 reported that a spontaneous Li+/H+ exchange reaction occurs in the garnet-type tetragonal Li7La3Sn2O12 in air, which leads to the formation of Li7¹xHxLa3Sn2O12. And sensitivity to moisture should be carefully considered regarding applicability of lithium garnet compounds. The pellets were immersed in distilled water, saturated LiOH aqueous solution, and saturated LiOH with 10 M LiCl aqueous solution for one week at room temperature. SEM images showed signiﬁcant changes in the surface morphology for the pellets immersed in distilled water, while no change was observed for the pellets immersed in saturated LiOH and saturated LiOH with 10 M LiCl aqueous solutions. We have conﬁrmed the Li+/H+ exchange reaction for LLZ-0.25Ta powder in distilled water by analysis of ion contents in the distilled water after immersion. Approximately, 2.0 Li+ in the nominal composition of Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 were exchanged by H+ after 40 days. On the contrary, the stability of LLZ-0.25Ta in the saturated LiOH with 10 M LiCl aqueous solution was conﬁrmed by impedance measurement of a cell having the following structure; Pt/aqueous solution/ LLZ-0.25Ta/aqueous solution/Pt. The cell was stored for one month at room temperature and no signiﬁcant change of the impedance proﬁle was observed. The stability when it is stored in air atmosphere was also examined. The surface of sintered LLZ-0.25Ta after several weeks was analyzed using electron microprobe analysis (EPMA). The result revealed carbon existing on the surface. This indicates that LLZ-0.25Ta, atmospheric water and CO2 react to produce Li2CO3.

Stability of the LLZ-0.25Ta solid electrolyte in contact with lithium metal is the other important requirement as a protective layer. A pouch-type Li/LLZ-0.25Ta/Li cell was stored in a dry box at room temperature and the cell impedance was measured at 0°C and 25°C with respect of the storage time. Figure 10 shows the impedance proﬁle measured at 0°C with two semicircles in different frequency ranges. The high frequency semicircle from 106 to 105 Hz is attributed to grain boundary resistance Rgb in LLZ-0.25Ta, because the Au/LLZ-0.25Ta/Au cell size semicircle in the same frequency range. The low frequency semicircle from 105 to 102 Hz can be attributed to interfacial resistance Ri, which consists of the resistance of the interlayer produced between lithium metal and LLZ-0.25Ta and a charge transfer resistance. Rgb showed no change with aging, in contrast to that of LLZ-0.25Nb.36 Ri decreased slightly after two weeks and then became constant for 3 months.

Lithium metal is the best anode candidate for high energy density batteries, because it not only shows the most basic potential, but has the highest gravimetric capacity of 3861 mAh g¹1. However, the formation of dendrites during lithium deposition limits the use of lithium metal as the anode in lithium batteries.42 Dendrite formation is not acceptable from a point of the safety and lifetime of lithium batteries. Suppression of dendrite formation is another important requirement for the solid electrolyte under high current densities. Monroe and Newman43 predicted that if a homogenous solid electrolyte with a modulus of 6 GPa was applied, the lithium dendrite problem would be solved. The modulus of ceramic materials is generally higher than 6 Gpa; therefore, no lithium dendrite formation would be expected between LLZ and lithium metal. There have been only a few reports on the electrochemical behavior of the interface between lithium and LLZ. Kotobuki et al.44 reported an abnormal increase in a voltage proﬁle of Li/LLZ/Li at 70 s during polarization at 50 µA cm¹2, in which LLZ was sintered at 1230°C for 36 h and shows electrical conductivity of 1.8 © 10¹4 S cm¹1.

The voltage polarizations of Li/LLZ-0.25Nb/Li and Li/LLZ0.25Ta/Li cells were measured under constant current densities of 0.1 and 0.5 mA cm¹2 and at 25°C. Figure 11 shows the results of Li/LLZ-0.25Nb/Li. At 0.1 mA cm¹2, the cell voltage kept a nearly constant value during 5800 s. Afterwards it continued to increase slightly to 0.018 V until 40 h and no signiﬁcant change was observed. On the other hand, at 0.5 mA cm¹2, the cell voltages suddenly dropped to zero after 280 s, which may be caused by shortcircuit due to dendrite growth. A Li/LLZ-0.25Nb/In unsymmetrical cell also showed no cell voltage drop even at 0.5 mA cm¹2 for 2 h, as shown in Fig. 11(c). The gradual increase of the cell voltage with the polarization period may be due to degradation of the contact between lithium metal and LLZ-0.25Nb by lithium depletion on the lithium electrode side. It is in consistency with the increase in cell impedance measured after the polarization experiment.

Figure 12 shows the cell voltage proﬁles of Li/LLZ-xTa/Li cells with the polarization at 0.5 mA cm¹2 at 25°C. Sudden drops in cell voltage after within a very short period were observed. One possible reason is short-circuit by dendrites, while the LLZ-xTa samples have high relative densities of 96.7–96.0%.40 It is not likely for dendrite to grow in sparse and discontinuous pores and ﬁnally penetrate through the pellet. However, short-circuit by dendrite was evidenced by a separate experiment that Li/LLZ-0.25Ta/LiClO4 in EC-DEC/ Li cell was polarized at 0.5 mA cm¹2 and the surface of LLZ-0.25Ta was visually inspected. Then several black dots appeared on the surface after 200 s of polarization and the sizes of these black dots were increased by further polarization. In Fig. 12, LLZ-0.25Ta with the highest relative density showed the shortest short-circuit time.

There is no clear dependence of the short-circuit time on the relative density of LLZ. These results imply that the dendrite and shortcircuit occur through different route through pellet other than pores. Lithium ion diffusion at the grain boundaries may be a key, because LLZ-0.25Ta with the high grain boundary conductivity of 2.51 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 had a shorter short-circuit time than LLZ-0.7Ta and LLZ-0.5 wt% Al2O3 with a lower grain boundary conductivity of 1.37 © 10¹3 S cm¹1 and 1.67 © 10¹3 S cm¹1, respectively. To reveal the mechanism of short-circuit through dense LLZ sintered pellet, role of ionic transport along grain boundaries of LLZ should be investigated in detail.

We have endeavored to develop water-stable lithium ion conductivity solid electrolytes for the protected lithium electrodes of aqueous lithium-air batteries. Two solid lithium ion conductors, the NASICON-type Li1+x(Al,Fe)x(Ti,Ge)2¹x(PO4)3 and the garnettype Li7¹xLa3Zr2¹xMxO12 (M = Nb, Ta) were examined. Both solid electrolytes are unstable in distilled water, but stable in saturated LiOH with saturated LiCl aqueous solution. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.4Ge0.2(PO4)3 electrolyte exhibits a high lithium ion conductivity of 10¹3 S cm¹1 at 25°C. A tape-cast NASICON-type thin sheet of Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3-3 wt% TiO2 impregnated with epoxy resin was resistant to water permeation and had an electrical conductivity of 4 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C. Since the NASICON-type solid electrolyte is found unstable in contact with lithium metal, an interlayer between lithium metal and the solid electrolyte, such as polymer electrolyte, is necessary.

For the garnet-type material, high lithium ion conductivities of 5.20 © 10¹4 and 6.13 © 10¹4 S cm¹1 at 25°C were observed for Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 and Li6.75La3Zr1.75Nb0.25O12, respectively. Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 is stable in contact with lithium metal, whereas Li6.75La3Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 seems unstable. Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 is an attractive candidate for the protective layer of a water-stable lithium electrode with no additional layers. However, further work on the optimization of lithium ion conductivity at the grain boundaries is necessary to solve the short-circuit issue by lithium dendrite at high current density.
