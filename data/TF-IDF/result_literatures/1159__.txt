We report a new discovery for enhancing Li ion transport at the surface of Li3V2(PO4)3 particles through super-ionic pathways built along an ionic conductor. The Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C composite has much higher initial discharge  capacity, superior rate-capability, and excellent cycling performance when compared with pristine Li3V2(PO4)3/C. This is  partly  due  to  the  occupation  of  vanadium  sites  by  Zr4+  ions  in  the  Li3V2(PO4)3  host  crystals  and  facile  Li  ion  migration  through  a  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  secondary  phase  that  forms  on  the  surface  of  the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3  particles.  Our  findings  about high Li ion transport and structure stabilization induced by Zr incorporation suggests a  breakthrough strategy for  achieving high-power Li rechargeable batteries using NASICON-structured cathode materials in combination with nanoarchitecture tailoring. 

Lithium  rechargeable  batteries  have  emerged  as  the  overwhelming  choice  for  portable  power  sources  in  the  modern world, due to their  high energy density and sustainable  chemical  architecture  after  long-term  repeated  use.1-3  However,  serious  concerns  are  now  being  raised  regarding  the  practicality  of  lithium  rechargeable  batteries  for  electric  vehicles,  electric  power  storage  systems,  smart  grids,  etc.  These  large-scale  appliances  need  tremendously  high  energy  density  and  excellent  thermal  stability at elevated temperatures, but the current lithium  rechargeable  battery  systems  cannot  totally  fulfill  all  of  these  requirements  because  of  the  limited  energy/power  density  of  the  current  cathode  materials,  which  are  typically layered-LiMO2(M ≡Co, Mn, Ni),4-6 spinel-LiMn2O4,710 and olivine-LiFePO4.11-14 

In  this  respect,  new  cathode  materials  such  as  Li2MPO4F,15,16 Li2MSiO4,17,18 and Li3M2(PO4)3 have attracted  substantial  attention  because  more  than  two  formula  units  of  Li-ions  can  possibly  deintercalate/intercalate  from/into  their  host  crystal  structure  with  a  moderate  operating  particular,  NASICON-type  Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) is favored among these materials due to  its  high  theoretical  capacity  (197 mA  h  g-1  when  all  three Li  atoms  are  reversibly  transferred)  and  average  redox  voltage (4.0 V vs. Li+/Li). However, several drawbacks still  exist that prevent the use of LVP as a commercial cathode  material,  including  its  poor  kinetic  properties  caused  by  its intrinsic low electronic (2 x 10-8 S cm-1) and  ionic (10-9  to  10-10  cm2  s-1)  conductivity.19,20  Approaches  such  as  conductive carbon coating,21,22 nano-tailoring,23-25 and heterogeneous atom doping26-29 have been attempted in order to  overcome the state-of-the-art problems of LVP, but these  traditional  strategies  have  not  proven  particularly  effective. New strategies are therefore required  so that breakthroughs  can  be  made  in  improving  the  electrochemical  properties of LVP.  

In this paper, we describe the use of a LVP/C composite  merged  with  a  NASICON-structured  LiZr2(PO4)3  phase,  which is evolved by incorporating Zr into LVP (Figure 1).  The  resulting  material  has  higher  discharge  capacity  and  greatly  improved  rate  capability  when  compared  with  pristine  LVP/C.  Since  the  electronic  conductivity  of  LVP  can be readily enhanced to the practical level by the simple  methods  including  carbon  coating,  the  critical  focus  should  be  now  on  improving  its  Li  ionic  conductivity.  Actually, this argument  can  be supported by a  recent  review pointing out that none of the particle size reduction  to  nano-scale,  amorphous  phase  formation,  and  surface coating  have  scarcely  made  a  breakthrough  in  ionic  conductivity  enhancement,  even  for  the  cathode  materials  having  3D  channels  for  Li  diffusion.30  Meanwhile,  the  LiZr2(PO4)3 engaged in NASICON structure has found the  use as a Li ionic conductor in solid electrolytes due to its  excellent  Li  ion  conductivity.31,32  Our  experiment  confirmed that if the proper amount of LiZr2(PO4)3 phase can  be  generated  on  the  surface  of  LVP  particles,  the  ionic  conductivity of LVP might be maximized with a minimal  decrease  in  the  electronic  conductivity.  In  addition,  the  structural stability of LVP at high voltage (> 4.3 V) could  be  also  improved  if  the  average  oxidation  number  of  the  centered  vanadium  in  LVP  is  decreased  below  +3  by  Zr4+  doping, because the repetitive transition between V4+ and  V5+  from  4.3  to  4.8  V  is  believed  to  seriously  deteriorate  the  crystal  structure  of  LVP  upon  cycling.  Finally,  Zrdoped  LVP/C  partially  composed  of  the  impregnated  LiZr2(PO4)3 with high ionic conductivity exhibited greatly  enhanced  cycling  stability  and  rate  capability  in  spite  of  its micro-scale particle size and relatively small amount of  incorporated carbon (< 1 wt%), providing a concrete solution for the limited kinetics of LVP.24  

Herein,  the  effects  of  Zr  doping  and  the  simultaneous  formation of NASICON-type LiZr2(PO4)3 on the structure  and  electrochemical  performance  of  LVP/C  composites  will be elucidated in details. 

First, stoichiometric amounts of  precursors  were  dispersed  in  a  deionized  (DI)  water/ethanol  mixture  containing  the  dissolved  sucrose  (3  wt  %  carbon).  This  mixture  was  stirred  for  6  h  and  then  dried  at  120  °C  in  a  conventional  oven  to  vaporize  the  mixing solvent. The final product, LVZrP/C, was obtained  by calcination at 750 °C for 10 h in a  mixed gas flow of 5  wt.%  H2+Ar.  The  actual  Li/V  and  Li/Zr  ratio  of  the  final  product was examined by the inductively coupled plasmaatomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Its morphology  was  observed  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM,  Philips,  XL30SFEG).  Various  phases  present  in  the  LVZrP/C  were  identified  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction  (XRD,  Rigaku  D/MAX-IIIC,  3  kW)  measurements  and  Rietveld  refinements  were  conducted  for  analyzing  XRD  patterns.  The  residual  carbon  content  and  the  electronic  conductivity  of  the  LVZrP/C  were  measured  with  an  element  analyzer  (EA, CE  Instruments, EA1110-FISONS)  and  4-point probe electrical measurement system, respectively. The V 2p core binding energy of this material was verified  by  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS,  Thermo,  MultiLab 2000). The XPS depth profile and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (TEM-EELS)/energy dispersive spectroscopy  (EDS)  analyses  were  commonly  conducted  to  confirm the atomic distribution of Zr  inside LVZrP particle. 

  The electrode was fabricated by adding a mixture of 75  wt.% of each active  material  and 17 wt.% acetylene black  to  N-methyl-2-pyrrolidene  (NMP)  solvent  containing  8  wt.% polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF). The resulting slurry  was  pasted  onto  an  Al  foil  current  collector  and  dried  at  120 °C for 6 h in a vacuum oven. After pressing, the dried  electrode was punched into a disc (1.3 cm diameter). The  electrochemical  properties  of  the  fabricated  electrodes  were evaluated using 2032 coin-type cells assembled in an  Ar-filled  glove  box.  Li-metal  foil  (Cyprus  Foote  Mineral,  99.98%, USA) was used as the counter electrode, and 1M  LiPF6  dissolved  in  1:1  (v/v)  ethylene  carbonate  (EC)  and  dimethyl carbonate (DMC) was adopted as the electrolyte.  The  charge/discharge  characteristics  of  the  assembled  cells (Loading level: 0.25 mg cm-2) were examined at 25 °C  using  a  battery  cycler  (WBCS3000S,  WonaTech).  For  the  first two cycles, the cells were  charged at a constant current density of 0.1 C to 4.3 V or 4.8 V (vs. Li+/Li) and were  held  continuously  at  a  constant  voltage  of  4.3  V  or  4.8  V  until the current density dropped below a capacity corresponding to 0.05 C. They were then discharged at a  constant current density of 0.1 C to 3.0 V. From the third cycle  onward,  the  cells  were  charged  and  discharged  galvanostatically in a potential range of 3.0-4.3 V or 3.0-4.8 V  (vs. Li+/Li). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were  carried  out  between  3.0  and  4.8  V  (vs.  Li+/Li)  at  a  scan  rate of 0.1 mV s-1. The activated two electrode cells (Working:  LVZrP/C,  Counter  &  Reference:  Li  metal)  were  subjected  to  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  after  the  first  two  cycles,  with  a  sinusoidal voltage  signal  (10  mV)  over  a  frequency  range  from  1000  kHz  to  100  mHz.  The  electrodes  were  washed  with  DMC  to  remove  residual  Li  salts  from  the  electrolyte  before  the  ex  situ  XRD analysis. 

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C  (LVZrP/C, x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) composites are shown in Figure  2. The XRD pattern for the pristine Li3V2(PO4)3/C (LVP/C)  coincides  with  that  for  the  reference  LVP19,  confirming  the  absence  of  any  secondary  phases.

  Figure  2.  (a)  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  for  the  Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C  (x  =  0,  0.05,  0.1)  composites  and  (b)  Rietveld  refinement  patterns  of  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3  using  X-ray  powder  diffraction  data.  Plus  marks  (+)  represent  the observed intensities, and the red solid line is calculated  result.  The  difference  plot  (blue)  is  shown  at  the  bottom.  Tick  marks  above  the  difference  plot  indicate  the  reflection positions (top: Li3V2(PO4)3, bottom: LiZr2(PO4)3)    additional  peaks,  which  well  match  to  a  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  al.33  Herein,  phase  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  seems  to  almost  exist  as  a  single  phase, but a little amount of the LiZr2(PO4)3-like phase is  also clearly observed. More minute survey revealed that as  more Zr is incorporated, the peak shifting to left side becomes  larger,  implying  that  the  unit  cell  of  LVP  crystals  expands somewhat as a result of Zr incorporation.34,35 This  observation  is  well  supported  by  Rietveld  refinement  results  for  the  XRD  patterns  of  LVZrP/C  (Table  1a).  The  amount  in  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3  and  Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3,  estimated  by  the  Rietveld  refinement,  was  ~4.15  and  ~4.48%,  respectively.  When  considering  very  small  discrepancy  between  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3  and  Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3  in  the  amount  of  LiZr2(PO4)3, the formation of LiZr2(PO4)3 by Zr incorporation seems to be dominant until the contents of  Table  1.  (a)  Lattice  parameters  of  the  Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C  (x  =  0,   

  Zr  reaches  0.05  prior  to  Zr  doping  on  bulk.  All  information  on  the  crystal  structure  of  LVZrP/C  involving  space group, lattice parameters, and the location of atom,  derived  from  the  Rietveld  refinement  are  tabulated  in  Table  S1  and  S2.  The  actual  Li/V  and  Li/Zr  ratio  of  LVZrP/C measured by the ICP-AES is given in Table 1b. 

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of  the LVZrP/C composites shown in Figure 3a demonstrates  that the V 2p XPS core peak is shifted to the right side as  a result of Zr incorporation, which indicates that the V 2p  core  level  of  the  Zr-containing  LVP/C  has  lower  binding  energy  for  electrons  than  that  of  pristine  LVP/C.  Herein,  the P 2p and O 1s XPS spectra for the pristine LVP/C (Figure  S1),  compensated  by  the  peak  binding  energy  for  the  measured  C  1s  XPS  spectra,  coincide  with  the  previously  referred  Li3V2(PO4)3/C,36  proving  that  both  the  V  2p  XPS  spectra  for  the  LVZrP/C  and  the  results  obtained  by  deconvoluting  their  V  2p  XPS  spectra  are  very  reliable.  Because the binding energy for electrons is closely linked to  the  oxidation  number  of  the  cation  of  interest,  the  shifting of the V 2p XPS core peak by Zr incorporation might  stem from the reduction in the average oxidation number  of vanadium (V). In details, the V 2p XPS core levels of all  LVPs with or without Zr4+ roughly match to that observed  in V2O3 (V3+, 517.4 eV),36 and the V2+/V3+ ratios obtained by  deconvoluting  their  XPS  peaks  proved  the  higher  V2+/V3+  ratio  for  Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C  than  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C,  which  corresponds  to  ~0.10  and  ~0.06,  respectively.  The  X-ray  Rietveld  refinement  results  also  support  this,  as  minor  in the interior of particle increases, in good agreement with  the  TEM-EELS/EDS  results  (Figure  S2).  Unlike  the  variation  in  Zr  content,  the  amount  of  V  is  lowest  at  the  surface and becomes almost constant from approximately 75  nm.  These  results  offer  novel  phase  separation  on  the  surface  of  NASICON-structured  transition  metal  phosphates caused by the inhomogeneity in chemical composition, which differs from the grain boundary segregation  that has been well understood, mostly observed at an internal interface in binary metallic alloys. We consider that  our  results  are  also  supported  by  a  previous  research  group who showed a LiFePO4 with high lithium bulk mobility  induced  by  a  fast  Li  ion-conducting  surface  phase  (Fe3+-containing  Li4P2O7-like  phase)  created  through  the  controlled off-stoichiometry.37 

Figure  4a  and  4b  show  the  initial  galvanostatic  (0.2  Crate)  voltage  profiles  of  the  LVZrP/C  composites,  in  the  range  of  3.0-4.8  and  3.0-4.3  V  (vs.  Li+/Li),  respectively.  Regardless  of  Zr  content  (x),  the  charge-discharge  curve  of the LVZrP/C agrees well with the previously described  charge-discharge  behavior  of  LVP/C,21  implying  that  the  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  phase  in  LVZrP  doesn’t  undergo  any  reduction  or  oxidation.  During  charging  to  4.8  V,  all  three  Li atoms look like being extracted from LVZrP/C, making  four  distinct  voltage  plateaus  appear  at  3.60,  3.68,  4.08,  and 4.52 V, as depicted in Figure 4a. Each voltage plateau  corresponds to the phase transition between two adjacent  single  phases  of  Li3-yV2-xZrx(PO4)3  (y  = 0, 0.5,  1.0,  2.0,  and  3).21,26  The  voltage  plateau  at  4.52  V, which  relates  to  the  phase transition between LiV2-xZrx(PO4)3 and V2-xZrx(PO4)3,  can be avoided if the upper limiting voltage is set to 4.3 V.  Differing  from  the  discharge  voltage  profile  of  LVZrP/C  charged  to  4.3  V,  the  profile  to  4.8  V  features  a  sloping  shape that covers a wide capacity range up to two mole of  Li  ions  followed  by  two  voltage  plateaus  near  3.6  V.  The  higher  initial  discharge  capacity  (162  and  118  mA  h  g-1,  charged  the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C compared with that (143 and 105 mA  h g-1) of the pristine LVP/C can probably be attributed to  not  only  the  doped  Zr  ions  but  also  the  ionic  channels  through LiZr2(PO4)3-like secondary phase that formed on  the  surface  of  LVP  particles,  as  described  by  the  TEMEELS/EDS and XPS analyses. 

The  similarity  between  LVP/C  and  LVZrP/C  in  the  average  particle  size  (1-2  μm)  and  distribution  (Figure  S4)  gives us more confidence that this capacity discrepancy is  not  induced  by  a  morphological  difference  but  primarily  associated with the change of crystal structure through Zr  incorporation. Herein, the doped Zr4+ decreases the average  oxidation  number  of  vanadium  in  LVP  crystals,  resultantly  increasing  both  charge  capacity  and  discharge  capacity  in  the  V3+  ↔  V4+  transition  region,  but  has  no  noticeable effect on the charge capacity during the V4+ ↔  V5+  transition  above  4.5  V  (Figure  4a).

  Figure 3. (a) V 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)  spectra for the Li3V2-xZrx (PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) composite  and  (b)  XPS  depth  profiles  of  Zr  and  V  in  the  Li3V2xZrx (PO4)3/C (x = 0.05, 0.1). 

The location where the LiZr2(PO4)3-like phase is formed  inside  LVZrP  particle  was  validated  by  electron  energyloss spectroscopy analysis and cross-checked with energy  dispersive  spectroscopy  (EDS)  for  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  and  Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C  as  described  in  Figure  S2.  Zr  ions  were  only found  on  the  surface  of  LVZrP  particles,  while  there was no trace of Zr ions in the bulk of LVZrP. Hence,  we  believe  that  the  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  secondary  phase  is  primarily  formed  near  the  surface  of  LVZrP  particles  in  great  agreement  with  the  previously  discussed  crystallographic analysis. In addition, from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  and its selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns  (Figure S3), we found that a single crystal LVP was formed  all  over  LVZrP  particle  while  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  phase  was  only  observed  between  bulk  LVZrP  and  surface  amorphous  carbon.  Further  evidence  for  the  existence  of  the  secondary phase on the surface of LVP could be provided  by  the  XPS  depth  profiles  of  Zr  and  V  in  Li3V2-xZrx  (PO4)3/C (x = 0.05, 0.1), as shown in Figure 3b. The Zr content  in  the  vicinity  of  LVZrP  particle  surface  is  relatively  high, but it gradually decreases as the sputter depth into 

  Figure 4. Electrochemical performance of the Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1) composites. (a) and (d) Initial galvanostatic (0.2 C, 1 C = 197 mA h g-1) voltage profiles and cycling performance of the Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C at a cut-off voltage of 34.8  V.  (b)  and  (e)  Initial  galvanostatic  (0.2  C,  1  C  =  133  mA  h  g-1)  voltage  profiles  and  cycling  performance  of  the  Li3V2xZrx(PO4)3/C at a cut-off voltage of 3-4.3 V. (c) Rate-capability for the Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C and (f) Discharge profiles of the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C at different discharge rates with a constant charge at 0.1 C.   

Hence,  the  enhanced  ionic  conductivity  of  LVP  provided  by  the  impregnated LiZr2(PO4)3 can be regarded as the most crucial  factor  for  the  improved  electrochemical  performance  of  LVZrP/C. 

Meanwhile,  Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C  displays  lower  initial  discharge  capacity  than  the  pristine  LVP/C  probably  due  to  the  overdose  of  Zr  content  responsible  for  the  abrupt  drop  of  electronic  conductivity  induced  by  the  presence  of  large  amount  of  the  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  ionic  conductor  (Table S3). The difference between targeted (3 wt %) and  actual (0.3-0.6 wt %) carbon content in LVZrP/C here can  be  attributed  to  the  loss  of  carbons  through  the  carbothermal reaction at 750 °C to calcine LVP. Taking large  size  of  LVZrP  particles  on  microscale  and  its  extremely  low  residual  carbon  content  into  account,  the  high  discharge  capacity  of  the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  is  even  more  remarkable. 

These  observations  well  explain  the  rate-capability  results  of  the  LVZrP/C  composites  shown  in  Figure  4c.  At  the  low  current  density  of  0.1  and  0.2  C,  the  discharge  capacity degradation of the LVZrP/C seems to have nothing  to  do  with  Zr  incorporation.  However,  the  capacity  loss  at  the  high  current  densities  above  0.5  C  is  significantly suppressed by Zr incorporation, indicative of facile Li+  ion  insertion/extraction  into/out  of  the  LVZrP  particles. The superior rate-capability of the Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C  to  the  pristine  LVP/C  demonstrates  that  the  ratedetermining  step  of  discharge  reaction  is  not  electron  conduction  on  the  LVP  surface  but  Li  ion  transport  through  the  elecrode/electrolyte  interface,  which  clearly  verifies the important role of the impregnated LiZr2(PO4)3.  two  voltage  plateaus  of  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  at  the  end  of  discharge  (near  3.6  V)  vanish  with  an  increase  in  the  applied  current  density.  Despite  enhancement,  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  just  delivers  a  discharge  capacity  of  74 mA h g-1 at the high current density of 10 C. However,  we are convinced that if a valid nanostructure with kinetic superiority is established with a proper size control for  LVZrP/C composites, their rate-capability  can be maximized for the commercialization.  

The  cycling  performances  of  the  LVZrP/C  composites,  measured in the range of 3.0-4.8 and 3.0-4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li),  are  given  in  Figure  4d  and  4e.  In  addition,  Figure  S5  exhibits the galvanostatic (0.2 C, 1 C = 197 mA h g-1) voltage  profiles  of  the  LVZrP/C  measured  after  1st,  10th,  20th,  30th,  40th, and 50th cycles. After 50 cycles between 3.0 and 4.8 V,  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  exhibits  a  high  discharge  capacity  of  138  mA  h  g-1,  corresponding  to  85.4  %  of  its  initial  discharge  capacity  (162  mA  h  g-1).  In  contrast,  the  pristine  LVP/C  the discharge capacities of 112 and 107 mA h g-1 corresponding  to 78.8 and 82.7 % of their initial discharge capacities (143  and 130 mA h g-1). Interestingly, Li3V1.9Zr0.1(PO4)3/C as well  as  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  also  shows  better  capacity  retention  than  the  pristine  LVP/C,  which  implies  that  the  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  phase  can  yield  some  positive  effects  on  the structural stability of LVP host crystals, thereby mitigating  the  cyclic  degradation  of  LVP/C.  The  ex-situ  XRD  patterns  of  LVP/C  and  LVZrP/C  composites  in  Figure  S6  show  that  all  samples  retain  their  original  crystal  structure even after 50 cycles, regardless of the amount of the  impregnated  LiZr2(PO4)3.  In  particular,  the  mass  fraction  of  LVP  and  LiZr2(PO4)3  in  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  was  ~95.5  and  ~4.5%,  respectively  (Table  S4).  Because  the  contents  of LiZr2(PO4)3 are significantly increased after cycling, the  Zr4+  ions  may  tend  to  thoroughly  occupy  the  site  of  V  to  generate LiZr2(PO4)3 during cycling. This novel phenomenon, not reported for other cathode material systems such  as  LiFePO4/Fe2P,38,39  Li2FeSiO4/Li2SiO3,17  etc.,  mainly  results from the structural analogy between NASICON-type  LVP and LiZr2(PO4)3. When cycled between 3.0 and 4.3 V,  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  exhibits  incomparably  superb  cyclic  retention coming up to 99% of the initial capacity after 50  cycles.  It  should  be  noted  that  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  proposed in the present study displayed comparable or better  electrochemical performances in comparison with Co, Mn,  Cr, or Sc doped LVP reported in literatures.35,40-42 

The electrochemical reactions and their kinetics during  the  initial  charge-discharge  process  were  identified  for  the LVZrP/C composites by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and   electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  measurements as shown in Figure 5. Regardless of the  amount of  incorporated Zr, LVZrP/C composites commonly displays  four  anodic  current  peaks  and  three  cathodic  current  peaks  and  the  peak  potential  difference  between  each  redox  reaction  was  diminished  by  Zr4+  doping.  This  feature strongly agrees with the results derived from the initial charge-discharge profiles in Figure 4a, which indicated that the voltage deviation from the equilibrium potential is lower for Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C than for the others. 

The  superior  kinetic  properties  of  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  can  be  further  understood  by  EIS  analysis  showing  all  sorts  of  resistances  linked  to  charge  transfer  at  electrode/electrolyte interface or inside electrode. As a result,  the  charge  transfer  resistance  (Rct,LVP)  of  Li3V2(PO4)3  decreased from 641.4 to 439.4 Ω cm2 with an increase in Zr  content.  However, the  Rct,LVP  rather  increased  to  567.9  Ω  cm2  when  the  amount  of  Zr  (x)  exceeded  its  optimum  value (x = 0.05), as shown in Table S5. In our EIS spectra,  the charge transfer resistance estimated from the semicircle  in  high-middle  frequency  region  is  attributed  to  the  mixed  Li  ionic  and  electronic  conduction  through  the  interface.

(a)  Cyclic  voltammograms  for  the  first  cycle  after cell formation and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra of the Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C (x = 0, 0.05,  0.1) composites measured (b) before cycling and (c) after  cell formation.    charge transfer resistance of LVP/C by Zr incorporation is  associated  with  a  facile  Li  ion  migration  through  it  because  the  electronic  conductivity  of  LVP/C  is  decreased  by the increase of Zr content due to the formation of the  ionic conducting LiZr2(PO4)3 as already explained. Hence,  the  reason  why  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  has  the  lowest  resistance  may  come  from  its  optimum  LiZr2(PO4)3.  Even  though  Zr-containing  LVP/C  (Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C)  is  favorably  influenced  by  Zr4+  doping  as  well  as  the  formation  of  a  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  secondary  phase,  Zr  should  be  optimally  incorporated  for  the  minimum  expense  in  terms of theoretical capacity loss, electronic conductivity  drop, and structural collapse. 

We  believe  that  these  findings  including  high  Li  ion  transport and structure stabilization induced by Zr incorporation suggests a totally brand-new strategy for achieving high-power Li rechargeable batteries using NASICONstructured  cathode  materials  in  combination  with  nanoarchitecture  tailoring,  thereby  solving  general  issues  in  NASICON-structured  phosphates  applicable  to  electric  vehicles and energy storage systems for renewable energy  in the field of energy storage and conversion materials, as  well  as  it  lays  a  fundamental  ground  for  tailoring  lattice  structure  of  materials  for  various  energy  devices  such  as  capacitors, lithium rechargeable batteries, solar cells, and  etc.  as  well  as  diverse  semiconducting  devices  based  on  metal oxides.    

In summary, we succeeded in  realizing Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C  (x  =  0.05,  0.1)  composites  that  are  merged  with  a  NASICON-LiZr2(PO4)3  phase  by  Zr  incorporation  into  Li3V2(PO4)3, and investigated their electrochemical behaviors  when  the  Zr  content  is  varied.  Rietveld  refinement  results  for  the  XRD  patterns,  TEM-EELS/EDS,  and  XPS  depth profiles for the Li3V2-xZrx(PO4)3/C confirmed that a  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  secondary  phase  was  formed  locally  on  the surface of Li3V2(PO4)3 particles by the incorporated Zr  ions and simultaneously the excess Zr ions were doped on  the vanadium sites in Li3V2(PO4)3 crystals. The high initial  discharge  capacity  and  superior  rate-capability  of  the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  was  attributed  to  the  facile  Li  ion  conduction  through  super-ionic  channels  built  along  the  LiZr2(PO4)3-like  ionic  conductors.  In  addition,  the  improved  cycling  performance  of  the  Li3V1.95Zr0.05(PO4)3/C  resulted  from  the  enhanced  structural  stability  imparted  by  doped  Zr  ions  and/or  the  generated  secondary  phase.  Thus,  the  high  Li  ion  transport  channel  and  structure  stabilization  induced  by  Zr  incorporation  may  indicate  a  promising  method  for  achieving  high-power  Li  rechargeable  batteries  using  NASICON-structured  cathode  materials.
