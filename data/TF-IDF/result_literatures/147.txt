Electrical energy storage (EES) exploiting secondary battery technologies is ideal for large-scale energy storage needs due to the rapid growth in proliferation of renewable energy sources and the emerging markets of grid-scale battery applications. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a more sustainable EES option alternative to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), have attracted intensive interests over the past decade, because of the natural abundance, evenly geographical-distributed Na-source, significantly low cost and environmentally benign. Polyanionic compounds offer an appealing combination of rich structural diversity, superior ionic conductivity, high structural and thermal stability and convenient storage/handling, making them competitive and attractive candidate electrode materials for next generation energy storage systems. In this review, recent advancements made regarding polyanion-type electrodes used for SIBs are summarized, elaborating their intrinsic structure characteristics, electrochemical properties and corresponding sodium-storage mechanisms. Furthermore, we highlight the recent achievements in the lab-scale Na-ion full-cells prototypes that consist of polyanion-type compounds as one or both working electrodes. Last but not least, challenges and outlooks on further optimization of the structure and the electrochemical performance of polyanion-type electrode materials for SIBs are also presented to provide some insights to facilitate the practical realization of sodium-ion technologies.
Due to the economic and environmental vulnerability of fossil fuels combustion, effectively exploiting renewable, sustainable and clean energy sources becomes especially urgent to address the worldwide shortage of resources and global warming concerns. In order to curb the renewable energy sources intermittency and obtain stable and continuous generation of electricity for power grids operations, developing performance- and cost-effective energy storage systems is of the prime necessity[1]. In the past decades, electrical energy storage (EES) exploiting secondary battery technologies revealed to be one of the most feasible options due to their high energy round-trip efficiency, versatile power and suitable energy characteristics to meet various grid functions and scalable productions[2,3]. Particularly, successful commercialization of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in 1990 is a great milestone, which not only catalyzes unprecedented applications of electronics information industry, but also offers new opportunities for better integration and penetration of renewable energy sources[4]. Intrinsic flexibility of battery storage technologies coupled to renewable electricity sources will usher in revolutions of our electric infrastructure systems even entire ecology-economy model of modern civilization[5]. It is called Smart Grid ( Figure 1 ), which works as an enabling engine to transform the current energy industry into a new era of reliability, availability and efficiency that will contribute to our economic and environmental health[6].
Apparently, the ultimate success of the Smart Grid is inseparable from the effectiveness of large-scale energy storage. Nowadays, LIBs are ubiquitous in the sector of small-scale consumer electronics and gradually increasing the market share in battery electric vehicles. LIBs have the ability to respond quickly to match the rapid growth in renewable energy sources, due to the high energy density and stable cycling properties of the already commercialized designs and the potentials of different shape and size. Y et, facing the steep price rise and resource constraints from the scarcity and non-uniform distribution of lithium resource, LIBs are believed to be not the best choice for stationary, large-scale EES applications and, in addition, there are growing concerns on adverse ecological hazards upon disposal toxic elements[7]. The challenges and demands outlined above have motivated the researches to pursue various alternative battery chemistries (termed as “post-LIBs”), featuring as low cost, widespread availability and environmentally friendly, to replace LIBs especially in applications unrestricted by high gravimetric and/or volumetric energy density[8].
 Given the abundance of sodium-based resources and the similar performance characteristics with LIBs, room-temperature sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise to meet large-scale EES demands[9,10]. Comparing with Li, however, the large ionic size of Na (1.02 Å vs 0.76 Å) and its low standard electrochemical potential versus SHE (~ 2.71 V vs Na +/Na and 3.04 V vs Li +/Li) as a consequence of sluggish redox kinetics, huge volume variations and low redox potentials, resulted in less favorable power and energy densities of SIBs and thus limiting their further applications for grid-scale energy storage[11-13]. Tremendous efforts have been geared to explore suitable electrode materials for SIBs to match the performance and characteristics of modern LIBs[14-18].
 A large variety of compounds have been unveiled with considerable sodium-storage capacities for SIBs. Layered metal oxides[19-23], polyanion compounds[21,24,25], and metal hexacyanometalates[26-30] have been extensively investigated as cathode materials, while hard carbon[31-34], metal alloys[35-38] and transition-metal chalcogenides[39-42] have been studied as anode materials. However, most of them suffer from poor cycling performance owing to the structural instability during Na-ions insertion/extraction processes. For example, layered transition-metal oxides possess high theoretical capacity, but undergo very complicated multiphase transitions during Na-(de)intercalation reactions, leading to rapid structural degradation of the host materials[43,44]. In addition, Prussian blue analogues synthesized by conventional coprecipitation method always contain a certain amount of lattice defects and coordinate water, resulting in a huge loss of active sites and causing a severe problem with electrolyte[45,46]. In the case of anode materials, huge volumetric change, such as 400%-490% volume expansion from Sn or P reacting with Na to form Na3.75 Sn or Na3P , results in the pulverization of the active materials and rapid deteriorations of cycling performances[47-49].
 his problem can be circumvented by implementing polyanion-type electrode materials with open framework providing pronounced structural stability. Polyanionic compounds have become the last two decades the subject of very attractive research since the discovery of electrochemical active LiFePO4[16,21,75]. Polyanionic framework materials possess versatile and adjustable structures, built on polyanionic groups [(XO4)mn-: X = B, C, S, P , Si, As, Mo, W, V , or Ti, etc.] strongly covalent-bonded with [(MO x)n-: M = transition-metal][76]. The “mixed-polyanionic units” can also be realized by designing the join with other anions, such as [Y -, e.g. F-, OH -, O 2-, N 3-, etc.], [X 2Om: e.g. PO4-P2O7, SO4-S2O3, etc.] and [(XO4)mn-, e.g. PO4-CO 3, PO4-SO4, PO4-NO 3, etc.][14,77]. Figure 2 shows the crystal structures of the representative polyanionic compounds, and the corresponding crystal structural parameters are summarized in Table 1 . Polyanion-type electrode materials are particularly attractive and widely considered as futuristic Na-host electrodes due to the following considerations: (1) Robust covalent-bonded framework provides high structural and thermal stability, essential for extensive cycling life and safety issues. (2) A large interstitial space generated from the open network structure of interconnected conduction pathways lead to fast ionic conduction and low volumetric expansion during Na-ions sodiation/desodiation processes. (3) Rich structural diversity allows the monitoring of the given M n+ /M (n-1)+ redox couples, and achieves higher values of redox potentials than that of layer oxides through the inductive effects introduced by Goodenough[78]. However, the “weight penalty” from the presence of polyanion units and no direct -M-O-M- electronic delocalization result in quite poor intrinsic electronic conductivity in this class of material. To compact this issue, coating with various conductive materials, constructing special micro/nano structures, as well as lattice doping are effective strategies to achieve high electrochemical performance of polyanion-type electrode materials.
In this review, the recent research progress and prospective future in the broad class of polyanion-type electrode materials for SIBs are summarized. A detail account of various sodium-based polyanionic compounds is given, focusing especially on intrinsic structural features, sodium-storage mechanisms, and electrochemical performance. We highlight the descriptions of the most promising sodium-ion full-cells proposed so far on the use of polyanion-type electrodes, and the various architectures and strategies to enhance the electrochemical performances with regard to full-cell characteristics and electrochemistry considerations. In addition, some of the practical challenges and future prospects toward the commercialization of polyanion-type compounds for SIBs are also included. The polyanion-type compounds are proposed to be potential systems for large-scale energy storage applications.
Since olivine-type LiFePO4 gains great commercial success in LIBs because of its low cost and high energy density, the sodium counterpart, NaFePO4 is one of the earliest and most widely studied polyanionic compounds as cathode material for SIBs. Two main types of structures of NaFePO4: olivine and maricite, have thus far been reported to be Na insertion hosts for rechargeable batteries.
Olivine NaFePO4 (Figure 2a) crystallizes into an orthorhombic structure (space group of Pnma ), in which the Na and Fe atoms occupy half of the octahedral sites, while the P atoms are confined into the one-eighth of the tetrahedral sites in a distorted hexagonal-close-packed oxygen lattice[79,80]. Due to the different sizes of ionic radii and the charges between Na and Fe cations, two crystallographically distinct octahedral sites (FeO 6 octahedra and NaO 6 octahedra) locate in the olivine NaFePO4 phase. The FeO 6 units, linked to each other by corner sharing, form linear 1D zigzag chains parallel to c-axis, while the NaO 6 octahedra are ordered as liner chains along [010] direction through edge sharing. Phosphate ions, PO4 tetrahedra, share one edge and four corners with each FeO 6 octahedra, constructing the main framework structure of olivine-type NaFePO4. In the olivine NaFePO4 phase, the edge-shared NaO 6 octahedra provide one-dimensional (1D) sodium-ion migration channels along the b-axis with a low diffusion barrier. The energy of Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple can be relatively stabilized by the polyanionic framework structure through the inductive effect, leading to a decent voltage plateaus (~2.8 V vs Na +/Na) and high theoretical capacity (154 mAh g -1) of iron-based cathode materials based on the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple[81].
Unlike LiFePO4, the olivine-type NaFePO4 is the metastable polymorph of NaFePO4 that undergoes irreversible phase transition to form thermodynamically stable maricite phase over 480 °C[86]. Therefore, conventional solid-phase transition reaction under high temperature are no longer suitable for the synthesis of olivine-type NaFePO4, which is commonly obtained by chemical/electrochemical ion-exchange from olivine-type LiFePO4.[86-88] Approximately one mole of Na + ions are involved in the reversible redox reaction process in olivine-type NaFePO4 based on the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple. Oh et al. firstly studied the electrochemical performance of the olivine-type NaFePO4 material prepared through electrochemical Li-Na ion-exchange strategy, which delivered a high reversible capacity of 125 mAh g-1 and an average potential of ≈2.8 V versus Na/Na +, indicating a promising candidate as an electrode material for large-scale energy storage applications[89]. Since a large volumetric mismatch between the two end phases of NaFePO4 and FePO4 (difference in unit volume of 17.58%), a stage transformation process happens to buffer the mechanical strain. The olivine-NaFePO4 electrode was often characterized by two separate charge plateaus by a voltage drop and one discharge plateau ( Figure 3 a). The asymmetric Na ion insertion/deinsertion into/from olivine NaFePO4 electrode was reported under different mechanisms. Moreau and Casas-Cabanas et al. revealed the existence of a stable intermediate phase with the composition of Na2/3 FePO4 (a sodium ion ordered phase) during sodium-ion intercalation/deintercalation process[50,81,90,91]. Olivine-type NaFePO4 transformed into the intermediate Na2/3 FePO4 phase through a solid solution domain, which followed subsequently a two-phase transformation reaction process to form olivine-FePO4. The presence of a Na2/3 FePO4 intermediate phase during the Na ion deintercalation process was first observed by Cao’s group though conventional electrochemical techniques, corroborating an identical two-step phase transition reaction both upon sodium insertion and extraction processes (Figure 3b)[82]. Y amada and co-workers determined the composition-temperature phase diagram of olivine Na xFePO4 (0 < x < 1) though Mössbauer spectroscop and high-temperature in situ X-ray diffraction[83]. In the range of 0 < x < 2/3, Na xFePO4 was found to be in a two-phase region, while Na xFePO4 (2/3 < x < 1) was in the solid-solution phase. The intermediate phase Na2/3 FePO4 exists to buffer the large volume expansion during the redox reaction. (Figure 3c). A detailed combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction study has allowed to elucidation of the co-existence of two intermediate structures with compositions of Na2/3 FePO4 and Na 5/6 FePO4[92]. Sodium ordering and electron mobility as well as the variation of local magnetic environments in olivine-type NaFePO4 have also been investigated (Figure 3d)[84,93,94].
In contrast, the thermodynamically favored maricite-NaFePO4 is usually regarded as electrochemically inactive due to the blocked ionic pathways. In the maricite-NaFePO4 lattice, as shown in Figure 2b, 1D chain structure built up by edge-shared FeO 6 octahedra are abridged to PO4 tetrahedra by corner sharing manner. Sodium cation, occupying the large tetrahedral sites, are thus isolated by PO4 tetrahedra throughout the lattice, resulting in “closed” framework with limited transmission channels for the Na + diffusion. Until 2015, Kang et al. reported the pioneering discovery that maricite-type NaFePO4 can function as the cathode material for SIBs[85]. Quantum mechanics calculations combined with electrochemical experiments revealed all Na ions can be extracted from nanosized maricite-NaFePO4, delivering a capacity of 142 mAh g −1 at 0.05 C and good cycling stability (Figure 3e). The analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) showed that the first desodiation for maricite-NaFePO4 induced the maricite-FePO4 transformed into amorphous FePO4, which significantly enhanced Na mobility in the transformed phase with small hopping activation barrier (Figure 3f). The understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism and the outstanding electrochemical performance have raised great interests of particle nanosizing engineering of maricite-NaFePO4 and researching on amorphous NaFePO4.[95-103]
 NASICON (Na +-Super-Ionic-Conductor) structure was first identified from the typical solid electrolyte Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 ≤x≤3) material used for high temperature Na-S batteries[78,104]. Indebted to the pioneering work of Delmas and co-workers in 1988[105], NASICON-based materials have been intensively investigated as ideal insertion hosts for alkali ions owing to the pronounced structural stability and the fast-ionic conductivity. Na3V2(PO4)3, as the most representative compound of this family, is widely considered to be a promising cathode candidate for SIBs. The thermodynamically stable phase of Na3V2(PO4)3 is rhombohedral structure with space group of R [106], which is different to the monoclinic phase of its lithium counterpart Li 3V2(PO4)3[107]. In Na3V2(PO4)3 framework, each VO 6 octahedra share corners with three PO4 tetrahedra to establish a “lantern” structural unit of [V 2(PO4)3]3- polyanion (Figure 2c). All the lantern units align into [V 2(PO4)3]∞ ribbons along c-axis and the neighboring [V 2(PO4)3]∞ ribbons are interconnected by PO4 tetrahedra along a-axis, creating a three-dimensional (3D) open covalent framework with large interstitial space facilitating sodium ion transport. It should be noted that there are two kinds of crystallographic sites to accommodate sodium ions in Na3V2(PO4)3 framework, namely Na(1) sites with Wyckoff position 6b and Na(2) sites with Wyckoff position 18e, according to two different oxygen environments. Na(1) ions possess six-fold oxygen coordination and are located between two adjacent [V 2(PO4)3] units in c-axis direction, while the Na(2) ions have eight-fold coordination and situated between two PO4 tetrahedrons with the same c-ordinate level as P atoms. The corresponding occupations of the Na(1) and Na(2) sites are 1 and 2/3, respectively, implying numerous vacancies lie in this NASICON framework offering facile channels for sodium ions diffusion.
Electrochemical properties of NASICON Na3V2(PO4)3 were firstly investigated by Uebou et al. in 2002[113]. As the cathode material for SIBs, Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits a flat operation potential of 3.4 V vs. Na +/Na ( Figure 4 a) and a high theoretical capacity of 117.6 mAh g -1 (gravimetric energy density of 401 Wh kg -1). Two Na cations can be reversibly insert/extract into/from Na3V2(PO4)3 based on the V 3+ /V 4+ redox couple[114]. The sodium storage mechanism and structure evolution of Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode were investigated by in-situ XRD (Figure 4b) and spherical-aberration-corrected annular-bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ABF-STEM) (Figure 4c), whose results revealed a typical two-phase transition reaction from the Na3V2(PO4)3 to NaV 2(PO4)3 phases with a small volume variation of 8.26%[109,110]. During the electrochemical reaction process, only Na ions located at Na(2) sites can be reversibly extracted whereas Na(1) ions is immobile due to the relatively weaker Na(2)-O bonding. The sodium-ion migration pathways were carefully examined by first-principles calculations[111,115]. By evaluating the activation energies for possible mechanisms towards Na3V2(PO4)3, two pathways along x and y directions and one possible curved route were proposed for ion diffusion,confirming the 3D transport characteristics of NASICON NaV 2(PO4)3. (Figure 4d)[111]. As shown in Figure 4e, Ohno et al. introduced for the first time a polaron-Na vacancy complex model using the hybrid density function Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) method, revealing the intra-layer pathway from Na(1) sites to Na(2) sites passing though the hexagonal bottleneck composed of VO 6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra is preferred due to the lower migration barrier energy[112].
Inspired by the success of lithium iron(II) pyrophosphate (Li 2FeP2O7) as a cathode material for LIBs[116,117], Na-based pyrophosphates arose as attractive intercalation hosts for SIBs over the last few years[118]. The most studied pyrophosphates contain single-sodium metal pyrophosphates NaMP2O7 (M = Fe, V , Ti)[55,56,119-121], two-sodium metal pyrophosphates Na2MP2O7 (M = Fe, Co, Mn)[58,122-125], and the mixed pyrophosphates Na 4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni)[66,126-129]. Pyrophosphates, easily obtained from the thermal decomposition of phosphates with oxygen evolution, show thermodynamically stability by far exceeding those of the layered oxides and being comparable to those of other polyanion compounds[14]. The high intrinsic stability is benefited from the stable pyrophosphate P2O74- anions, representing an added value to safety for large-scale economic sodium-ion batteries applications.
The study of Na-based pyrophosphate system started with the unveiling of the single-sodium metal pyrophosphate NaFeP2O7 as early as 1982[119]. NaFeP2O7 crystallizes as monoclinic crystals with P21/c space group, which can be categorized into two different types of crystal structures due to the irreversible phase transition at different temperatures: -type and -type. The crystal structure of NaFeP2O7- was identified as the isostructural to KAlP2O7, firstly reported by Calvo et al[130]. In the NaFeP2O7- host framework (Figure 2d), the P2O74- polyanion, consisting of a pair of corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra in a nearly staggered configuration, is propagated parallel to the ab plane by the two-fold screw axes. Each FeO 6 octahedra corner shares oxygen atoms contributed from three layers of P2O74- group, forming the basic network for the entire structure. It makes an open 1D channel along c-axis direction for Na + migration, hence offering possibility for applications as an insertion-type electrode material. Moreover, NaFeP2O7-, the thermodynamically unstable phase, undergoes an irreversible phase transition into its polymorph NaFeP2O7- when temperature is above 750 . Its crystal structure is closely related to the -type structure with distorted hcp oxygen lattice (Figure 2e). NaFeP2O7- can be described as a cage structure built up by alternately stacking two sorts of layers parallel to [001] direction: layers of the FeO 6 octahedra with composition of FeO 3 and layers of pyro P2O74- groups[119]. Each P2O74- group shares four corners with one octahedra layer and the other two with another octahedra layer, resulting in the host structural unit [FeP2O11 ] of this compound. This framework delimits elongated cages where two Na ions are enclosed. Nevertheless, it also provides paths along the [001] direction for Na + migration, indicating the possibility for Na (de)intercalation reaction activity.
Apart from NaFeP2O7, other alternatives have also been developed to achieve high electrochemical activities for SIBs, such as NaTiP2O7 and NaVP2O7 [55,56,121,135] Two forms of sodium titanium diphosphate are unveiled : α-NaTiP2O7 (closely related to the structure of β-cristobalite) and β-NaTiP2O7 (isostructural to NaFeP2O7-). The presence of open tunnels in the host lattice is considered to be available for Na + mobility. Interestingly, in KAlP2O7-type NaVP2O7 compound ( β-NaVP2O7), reversible Na + insertion/extraction corresponding to partial V3+ /4+ redox activity at around 3.4 V vs. Na/Na + was observed for the first time by Okada et al[121]. Despite the theoretical capacity of 108 mAh g -1, it only delivered an initial capacity of 38 mAh g -1 at 0.05 C within the electrochemical window of 2.5-4.0 V[122]. The limited Na + reaction activity of NaVP2O7 is not merely attributed to the sluggish ionic diffusion kinetics, but also to high intrinsic resistance induced by Na-extraction from the initial framework lattice, which restricts the two-phase transition kinetics between NaVP2O7 (P21/c) and Na 1-xVP2O7 (P21) symmetries. V ery recently, Drozhzhin et al. introduced a carbon-coated NaVP2O7 electrode material fabricated via the hydrothermal-assisted post-calcination method[131]. It achieved a reversible capacity as high as 104 mAh g -1 at the current density of 0.1 C with the average operating potential of 3.9 V vs. Na/Na +, and outstanding rate performance of 90 mAh g -1 capacity retention even at a high rate of 20 C ( Figure 5 a). DFT calculations suggested that the low migration energy barrier of 0.25 eV for Na hop from site to site was account for its high-rate performance (Figures 5b and 5c).
Two-sodium metal pyrophosphates can be classified into three distinct polymorphs owing to the possible tetrahedral (MO4) or octahedral (MO 6) coordination of the metal (M):. Figures 2f-2h show the polymorphism, take a sample of Na2CoP2O7, exhibiting their layered and three-dimensional structure with tunnels accommodating Na atoms. So, one could be expected effective Na-ion transport in two-sodium metal pyrophosphates leading to good electrochemical performance.
Orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7 possess a layered structure with slabs of [CoP2O7]∞ interconnected by oxygen-linked Co and P tetrahedral parallel to [001] direction, stacked with alternating Na layers (Figure 2f). The cobalt species are arranged in tetrahedra fashion with oxygen atoms from four surrounding P2O7 units, while Na atoms enjoy a distorted octahedral configuration with six oxygen atoms around them. This structure generates two distinct organizations of Co and Na channels, in which four Na channels surround one each Co channel when viewing from the [010] projection, indicating 1D pathways for Na-ion migration in orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7. Contrary to that, the triclinic Na2CoP2O7 has a three-dimensional framework consisting of [CoP2O7]∞ units built by CoO 6 octahedra corner-sharing PO4 tetrahedra arranging in staggered manner (Figure 2g). It results in the formation of tunnels running along [001] direction where Na atoms distribute, making a promising situation favorable for Na + diffusion. Moreover, in the case of tetragonal Na2CoP2O7, the layer-like nature is quite evident shown in Figure 2h. Co atoms adopt a tetrahedral coordination geometry, and the isolated CoO4 tetrahedra
corner-shares four oxygens from bridging P2O7 groups to form a continuous [[CoP2O7]∞]2- sheets in the ab plane. The Na + cations in a NaO 8 quadrangular prismatic coordination geometry are sandwiched between the [[CoP2O7]∞]2- layers, not only maintaining the charge neutrality but also keeping the structural stability from any bending or collapsing.
In the family of pyrophosphates, Na2FeP2O7 was the first compound ever reported as the possible cathode material for SIBs[59]. It was found to be the isostructural to Na2CoP2O7- with a triclinic framework, providing 3D diffusing channels along [100], [ -110] and [01 -1][58]. As the transition metal changes from Co to Fe, slight variations in the lattice parameters can be observed (Table 1). Furthermore, triclinic Na2FeP2O7 (P1) shows excellent thermal stability and transforms into monoclinic P21/c symmetry by further heating up to 560 with no oxygen evolution or structural rupture, indicating a safe electrode candidate for practical SIBs applications[137]. One mole of Na ion can be reversibly inserted/extracted for each formula unit of triclinic-Na2FeP2O7 based on the Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox reaction, resulting in a theoretical capacity of 97 mAh g -1. Typical galvanostatic voltage-capacity curves of triclinic-Na2FeP2O7 in a Na-cell is shown in Figure 5d. Na2FeP2O7 showed a reversible capacity of ~ 84 mAh g -1 while exhibiting two distinct plateaus in the total potential range of 2.0-4.5 V vs. Na/Na +, with large overpotentials[132]. Based on the quasi-equilibrium measurements and DFT calculations, it demonstrated that Na2FeP2O7 underwent a single-phased transition reaction at ~ 2.5 V , while a series of consecutive two-phase reaction in the voltage range of 3-3.25 V . The Na-ion diffusion properties in all crystallographic directions in Na2FeP2O7 were also considered, as depicted in Figures 5e and 5f. The resulted migration energies for Na + diffusion along the three axes in Na2FeP2O7 were all lower than 0.49 eV , indicating the high Na + mobility rooted in the 3D pyrophosphate Na2FeP2O7 framework.
To date, a variety of polymorphs and analogues of Na2MP2O7 have been investigated, including Na2CoP2O7[134,138], Na2MnP2O7[60], Na2CuP2O7[139,140], and Na2ZnP2O7[63,141], Na2MnP2O7, as the isostructural to Na2FeP2O7, was discovered in 1998[60]. The possibility for realizing the reversible redox activity of Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ makes this compound attractive for cathode material for SIBs. At a rate of 0.05 C, a reversible capacity of ~ 90 mAh g -1 (theoretical capacity of 97.5 mAh g -1) in the voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V ( vs. Na/Na +) and a high operating potential at ~3.8 V were obtained (Figure 5g). Na2MnP2O7 exhibited good rate capability (69% capacity retention with the current rate increasing from 0.05 C to 1 C) and cycling performance (96% of the initial capacity retained after 30 cycles at 0.05 C)[133]. According to the DFT results and detailed atomic structural analysis, the enhanced kinetics of Na2MnP2O7, superior to that of the Li-counterpart Li 2MnP2O7 and being comparable to that of the Na2FeP2O7, was mainly due to the locally flexible accommodation of Jahn-Teller distortions aided by the corner-sharing crystal structure in triclinic Na2MnP2O7. It was proven that a small degree of atomic rearrangement in the positions of metal and oxygen atoms as well as resultant changes in their bond lengths between the sodiation and desodiation states lower the energy barriers of electron conduction and phase boundary migration. 3D Na-ion channels with low migration barrier of 0.58 eV were consisted with the good electrochemical behavior observed for triclinic Na2MnP2O7 (Figures 5h and 5i)[122]. In order to further improve the rate capability of the Na2MnP2O7, mix metal pyrophosphates, such as Na2Mn 0.5 Fe 0.5 P2O7[142] and Na2Mn0.5 Zn 0.5 P2O7[143], were developed though lattice substitution of Mn with other metals. Later, to further increase the energy density of Na2MP2O7, the redox center was shifted from Mn to Co. Orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7 achieved a reversible capacity of 90 mAh g -1 at 20/C with an average potential of 3 V involving Co 3+ /Co 2+ redox reaction[144]. Kim et al. demonstrated a 4.3 V triclinic Na2CoP2O7 (rose form) cathode material for SIBs, which can be easily realized by simple introduction of sodium deficiencies to its stoichiometric polymorph (orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7, blue form)[134]. In the voltage profiles shown in Figure 5j, an average voltage of only 3.0 V was observed in blue-Na2CoP2O7. In remarkable contrast, rose-Na2CoP2O7 exhibited a significant increase in energy density of more than 40% compared to the blue polymorph (344 vs. 240 Wh kg -1). It showed stable cycling behavior with two voltage plateaus, one relatively low voltage plateau at ~3.95 V and two high voltage plateaus at 4.33 and 4.43 V , respectively. Figure 5k describes the refined sodium-deficient crystal structure of the obtained rose-Na2CoP2O7 polymorph with comparison of the hypothetical rose-Na2CoP2O7 phase without sodium defects. Such nonstoichiometric-driven control of polymorphism may pave a way for developing high-performance electrode materials for both LIBs and SIBs applications.
 Similarly, a unique framework structure providing robust structural stability during the electrochemical reaction process, the mixed pyrophosphates Na 4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni, Mg) as a fascinating new class of polyanion materials are of considerable current research interests[126]. After the pioneering work of Goodenough et al[145,146], the mixed polyanion groups of phosphate PO43- and pyrophosphate P2O74- can be stabilized in the Na system (not found in Li system), which show promising electrochemical properties for both LIBs and SIBs[66,68].
Considering the electrode material design for large-scale electrical energy storage, the earth-abounded and low-cost Na-Fe-P-O system seems to be very attractive. Iron-based Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7, as the first compound ever reported in this class, was proven to be one of promising candidates for cathode materials for both LIBs and SIBs[66,147] The neutron diffraction results confirmed the crystal structure of Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 is isostructural to Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Co, Mn, Ni) with space group of P2 a[66,68]. As shown in Figure 2i, the structure of Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7 can be described as a 3D network of [Fe 3P2O13 ]∞ layers parallel to the bc plane built by FeO 6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. Each FeO 6 octahedron shares one edge and four corners with each other, and PO4 tetrahedron shares one edge and two corners with FeO 6 octahedra, forming the infinite [Fe 3P2O13 ]∞ layer. The diphosphate P2O7 groups bridging-connect the [Fe 3P2O13 ]∞ layer along a axis, generating large 1D Na-diffusion channels along the [010] direction. Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7 exhibited stable and fast electrochemical activity in sodium batteries, delivering nearly 82% of the theoretical capacity (129 mAh g -1) at ~ 3.2 V (vs. Na/Na +) under the rate of 0.05 C in the first cycle with relatively stable cycle retention, competitive with other cathode materials for SIBs ( Figure 6 a)[147]. By using a combination of electrochemical experiments and first-principles calculations,Kang et al. clarified that the (de)sodiation of the Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode was governed mainly via a single-phase reaction based on one electron Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple with an exceptionally small volume change of less than 4% during the electrochemical cycling (Figure 6b). Furthermore, to better understand the sodium storage mechanism in the class of the mixed phosphates Na 4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Co, Mn, Ni), a combination of atomistic energy minimization, molecular dynamics (MD) and DFT simulations was brought out to examine key issues including intrinsic defects, Na-diffusion mechanisms and voltage trends[126]. Firstly, the results of atomistic energy minimization demonstrated that the most energetically favorable type of intrinsic defect was predicted to be the Na/M anti-site pair for all compositions. Secondly, long-scale MD simulations suggested Na atoms tend to diffuse across 3D migration pathways with relatively high Na +-diffusion coefficients and low activation barriers that were comparable to those of the Li-ion cathodes. Finally, DFT method predicted that doping Ni in the Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7 could lead to an increased value of the operation voltage.
Following the study of Na 4Fe 3(PO4)2P2O7, Na 4Co 3(PO4)2P2O7 has also shown its electrochemical activity for SIBs[128]. Reversible capacity of Na 4Co 3(PO4)2P2O7 reached ~ 95 mAh g -1 (around 50% of its theoretical capacity of 170 mAh g -1) at 0.2 C between 3.0 V and 4.7 V , corresponding to 2.2 Na + cations reversibly (de)intercalation into/from the Na 4Co 3(PO4)2P2O7 electrode. V ery recently, the structure evolution in Na 4Co 3(PO4)2P2O7 upon electrochemical cycling was carefully examined by Cabanas’s group[148]. Coupling operando X-ray diffraction and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements demonstrated Na 4Co 3(PO4)2P2O7 proceeded a complex reaction mechanism consisting four consecutive biphasic reactions followed by a single-phase process at the end of charge. The incomplete Na + intercalation in the first cycle was found to be beneficial for the transport kinetics and cycling stability, owing to that it effectively avoided a huge increasement in the values of charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) for the following cycle.
Introduction of electronegative fluorine F - anions into sodium-based phosphates produces a new class of host structures and compositions, namely, fluorophosphates, since it alerts the charge balance or the dimensionality of the structure in relation to phosphates. The fluorophosphates saga started with the first demonstration of Na2VPO4F by Barker et al. in 2003[149], which triggered the exploration of various fluorophosphates serving as the electrode materials for SIBs and extended fluorophosphates chemistry to other transition metals. The presence of high ionic F - in anion sublattice structure with strong bond covalency stabilizes the antibonding Mn+1 /M n+ state though strong inductive effect, thereby increasing the redox voltage. Fluorophosphates with chemical composition of Na2MPO4F (M = V , Fe, Mn, Ni) and Na3V2O2(PO4)2F3-X (0 ≤ X ≤ 1) have been widely regarded as attractive candidates for SIBs.
Na2VPO4F, one of the earlies fluorophosphate-type electrode materials for SIBs, can be crystallizes into two polymorphs: high-temperature tetragonal symmetry with I4 /mmm space group and low-temperature monoclinic phase with space group of C2 /c[69]. The tetragonal-Na2VPO4F demonstrates facile sodium-ion diffusion through an extended 3D framework built up from [VO4F2] octahedra connected with [PO4] tetrahedra producing cavities where Na + ions statistically distributed. Tetragonal-Na2VPO4F has a high theoretical capacity of 143 mAh g -1 based on the V4+ /V 3+ redox reaction, according to reversible (de)insertion of one Na + per Na2VPO4F formula unit. Employing the highly ionic bands and inductive effect from both PO43- and F -, it leads to a high operating plateau of around 3.7 V in a Na-ion full-cell assembled with commercially available hard carbon as the anode[149]. The exciting results provoked numerous research interests in the scientific community[150-154]. Zhou et al. reported another polymorph Na2VPO4F with C2 /c symmetry[155]. The monoclinic-Na2VPO4F synthesized by one-step soft template method delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 133 mAh g -1 at 0.1 C with a flat voltage plateau at ~3.3 V vs. Na/Na +, and excellent high rate cycling stability (capacity retention of 81% and 77% of 10000 cycles at 10 C and 20 C, respectively). It should be mentioned that the clear clarifications of the crystal structure of monoclinic-Na2VPO4F is yet to be reported.
 Na2FePO4F is considered to be an excellent candidate of low-cost and environmentally friendly ion-based positive electrode materials that operates on Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox. Na2FePO4F crystallizes into orthorhombic structure with Pbcn space group, isostructural to Na2FePO4OH[70]. Compare to the V-based fluorophosphates Na2VPO4F, Na2FePO4F has 2D layered framework composed by [FePO4F] infinite slabs stacking with sodium ions in the interlayer (Figure 2g). The Fe 2O7F2 bi-octahedra units, consisting of face-sharing FeO4F2 octahedral subunits abridged with F atoms, are corner-sharing with PO4 tetrahedral, forming the layer-like unit along the a-c directions. There are two different crystallogical sodium sites to accommodate sodium ions. Nazar et al. in 2007 used Na2FePO4F directly as the cathode material in a Li-ion cell, demonstrating the extraction possibility of sodium ions with solid-solution-like electrochemical behavior in Na2FePO4F[158]. The sodium-storage performance of Na2FePO4F in a Na-ion cell was first reported by Recham et al., exhibiting a reversible capacity of 120 mAh g -1 (theoretical capacity of 124 mAh g -1) in the first cycle[159]. V arious modification methods were applied to improve the electrochemical performance in Na2FePO4F for SIBs[160-166]. The sodium mobility in Na2FePO4F lattice was demonstrated to be 2D pathways along a-c planes with a similar low activation energy[167]. In operando XRD analysis was performed to investigate the structure evolution of Na2FePO4F during Na-ions insertion/extraction process, indicating two two-phase reaction behavior between three structures corresponding to the Na2FePO4F ↔ Na 1.5 FePO4F ↔ Na 1FePO4F phase transition process ( Figures 7 a and 7b)[156]. According to the ex situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance ( 23 Na ssNMR) and DFT calculation results, the intermediate phase Na 1.5 FePO4F adopted the P21/c space group, while both the starting Na2FePO4F and ending Na 1FePO4F adopt Pbcn space group (Figures 7c and 7d)[157]. Furthermore, it was proven that Na ions at Na2 sites were electrochemically active while those on Na1 sites are immobile upon electrochemical cycling.
For most interesting composition in terms of energy density, vanadium-based fluorophosphates with general formula Na3V2O2-2x (PO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) have received significant attention as alternatives to traditional layered mental oxides as positive electrodes for both LIBs and SIBs[168-172]. Depending on x, the oxidation state of vanadium (between +3 and +4) varies with concomitant changes of the crystal/electronic structure as well as the electrochemical behavior of the materials. Of particular interests are the two extreme members: Na3V2(PO4)2F3, where x = 1; and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F, where x = 0.
Replacing one-third of PO43- anion from Na3V2(PO4)3 by three F -1 anions, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 crystallizes in rhombohedral NASICON structure with P4-/mnm space group, which was determined from the single-crystal XRD in 1999 by Le Meins et al.[71]. Although Croguennec and his co-works argued Na3V2(PO4)2F3 a subtle orthorhombic distortion in Amam space group by using high angular resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction[173], most literatures report Na3V2(PO4)2F3 adopting P4-/mnm space group. Figure 2k displays the crystal structure of rhombohedral Na3V2(PO4)2F3, with a 3D framework that is built up with [V 2O8F3] bi-octahedra abridged by [PO4] tetrahedral via O atoms that leads to the formation of large channels along a and b-axes with Na located in the tunnel sites. Two distinct crystallogical Na sties exist in this open framework with an occupancy ratio of 2:1, namely Na1 sites (fully occupied) and Na2 sites (half occupied). Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was first reported as an alkali ion insertion host material by Barker et al. in 2006, exhibiting a specific capacity of ~120 mAh g -1 at a high average voltage plateau of 4.1 V vs. Li/Li + in a Li-ion cell[174,175]. The Na-ion (de)intercalating properties of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 was first demonstrated by Kang et al., with a decent theoretical capacity of 192 mAh g -1 calculated for (de)intercalation of three Na ions per formula unit[176]. In spite of this, until now, only the reversible extraction of 2 Na + has been experimentally achieved in a Na-ion cell, corresponding to the theoretical energy density as high as ~507 Wh kg -1, which is comparable to those of the commercial LiFePO4 (~580 Wh kg -1) and LiMn 2O4 (~480 Wh kg -1)[174,175,177]. Furthermore, it is worth to note that the chemically desodiated phase shows high thermally stability up to 550, implying the excellent safety characteristic of this electrode compound.
 V arious in and ex situ techniques including XRD, synchrotron XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) as well as ssNMR were employed to investigate the sodium storage mechanism in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Figure 8 a displays a typical voltage-composition profile of Na3V2(PO4)2F3, showing two main voltage domains ataround 3.7 and 4.2 V vs. Na/Na +. High angular resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction results (Figure 8b) revealed a complicated phase transformations sequence. It was found that three biphasic reactions involving two distinct intermediate phases Na2.4 V2(PO4)2F3 and Na2.2 V2(PO4)2F3 formed in the lower voltage region, subsequently a wide solid-solution process of composition Na xV2(PO4)2F3 (1.3 ≤ x ≤ 1.8) with I4 /mmm symmetry was observed. The end-member NaV 2(PO4)2F3 belonging to Cmc 2 space group and two dissimilar vanadium environments (a V3+ -V5+ couple in every bioctahedron), is finally attained through another biphasic transition reaction (Figure 8c). The local structural and dynamical evolutions during cycling in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 were further investigated by detailed in situ XRD and high-resolution 23 Na and 31 P ssNMR, revealing Na ions were removed non-selectively from Na1 and Na2 sites at least at the beginning of charge (Figures 8d and 8e)[179]. By utilizing DFT simulations, ion reorganization during electrochemical cycling was proposed to be involved. Different designed Na-ion pathways along three axes exhibiting low activation energies demonstrated the 3D characteristics in Na3V2(PO4)2F3 for Na + migration feasibilities (Figure 8f).
Recently, Na3V2O2(PO4)2F with lower F content becomes to be a new fashion electrode material for SIBs. With the substitution of O 2- for F -, Na3V2O2(PO4)2F equips with higher and single oxidation state (+4) for vanadium. Furthermore, low F content provides weaker inductive effect and electronegativity as well as lower attraction interaction between Na(2)-F, which could facilitate Na-ions diffusion in the lattice and lower the electrochemical polarization[181,182]. As suggested by Baudrin’s[72] iand Massa’s group[183], Na3V2O2(PO4)2F crystallized to tetragonal framework with I4 /mnm symmetry. After that, Tsirlin et al. proposed another Na3V2O2(PO4)2F polymorph with P4mnm space group as the room-temperature phase[73]. Na3V2O2(PO4)2F has similar framework with Na3V2(PO4)2F3, as shown in Figure 2l, excepting one O in Na3V2O2(PO4)2F replacing one F in Na3V2(PO4)2F3. Sauvage et al. in 2006 first demonstrated the feasibility of Na-ion extraction in Na3V2O2(PO4)2F for SIBs[72]. Two step voltage plateaus found at 3.6 and 4.0 V were clear characteristics of two bi-phasic transition reactions. Deep studies on the reaction mechanisms and structural evolutions of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F electrode during used in a Na-ion cell were proceeded by in situ synchrotron XRD combined X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES)[184]. A complex reaction mechanism including both solid-solution and two-phase behavior during charge and discharge was proposed.
It should be noted that the multi-electron transfer behavior based on the various vanadium redox reactions can be easily realized by tuning the F contents in Na3V2O2-2x (PO4)2F1+2x . Park et al. for the first time successfully synthesized a series of the isostructural Na3V2O2-2x (PO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) compounds via a solid-state reaction and demonstrated all compositions in this family showing potentials as high-perform cathode materials for SIBs[185]. The combination of various redox reaction transitions (V3+ /V 4+ or V4+ /V 5+ ), Na +-Na + ordering and F/O distribution resulted in distinct voltage-composition curves, according to the Na (de)intercalation mechanisms for Na3V2O2-2x (PO4)2F1+2x family ( Figure 9 a). As one of them, Na3V2O1.6 (PO4)2F1.4 exhibited high energy density of approximately 600 Wh kg -1, attributed to a redox reaction of 1.2 electrons transfer (Figure 9b)[186]. As shown in Figure 9c, such high energy density exceeds that of any other reported cathodes for SIBs. Encouragingly, according to the DFT calculations, the energy density can be further improved to 758 Wh kg -1 with the replacement of O 2- with Cl - to form Na3V2Cl 2(PO4)2F due to its extraordinary theoretical capacity of 188 mAh g -1 (Figure 9d)[188].
Benefited from the inductive effect of the polyanionic groups in polyanion-type materials, higher operation potential can be realized by substituting phosphate PO43- unit by SO42- group owing to their higher electronegativity. Sulfates are also considering to be promising polyanionic cathode materials taking advantages of the economic Na-Fe-S-O elemental constitution. Alluaudite-type Na3Fe 2(SO4)2 is of particularly interests, first reported by Y amada’s group for SIBs applications[189,190], which possesses a 3D framework structure forming by edge-sharing Fe 2O10 dimers in turn bridged with SO4 units. Highest-ever operating potential at 3.8 V (vs. Na/Na +) based on the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ redox couple was initially found among all known Fe-based oxides and oxyanionic insertion compounds. Thus, the theoretical energy density by full utilization of inherent Na-ions of Na3Fe 2(SO4)2 can reach extremely high value of 540 Wh kg -1, even higher than those of LiMn 2O4 (430 Wh kg -1) and LiFePO4 (500 Wh kg -1), indicating promising applications for SIBs competitive with state-of-the-art LIBs. Definite efforts to further improve the electrochemical performance though structural engineering and/or surface modification have been extensively done[191-194]. For example, freestanding and flexible Na2+2x Fe 2−x (SO4)3@porous carbon nanofiber hybrid films demonstrated a capacity of 97 mAh g -1 at 1 C and superior cycling stability without observable capacity fading after 500 cycles[191]. High-rate performance of Na2+2x Fe 2−x (SO4)3@rGO was achieved with a high capacity of 78 mAh g -1 at 60 C and 80.8% of capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 30 C[193].
 Due to the environmental sustainability, low cost and possibility of multiple electrons reaction per unit formula, transition metals orthosilicates, Na2MSiO4 (M = Fe, Co, Mn), are also considering as promising cathode materials for SIB applications. As the first reported material of this class used for sodium-storage, Na2CoSiO4 showed promise as a suitable operation potential of 3.3 V ( vs. Na/Na +) with a reversible capacity of 100 mAh g -1 at current rate of 5 mA g -1[195]. Corning-sharing alternate cobalt and silicate tetrahedral units built up the main skeleton of the crystalline structure, with sodium atoms stuffed into the tetrahedral vacant-sites. Two polymorphs, corresponding to monoclinic Si/Co ordered Pc and orthorhombic Co/Si disordered Pbca space groups, were identified. Na + diffusion in Na2CoSiO4 favors 3D network of pathways with low activation barriers, which suggest fast Na + insertion kinetics. Monoclinic-structured Na2CoSiO4 with Pn space group was also experimentally obtained by Rangasamy et al. though a facile solvothermal method[196]. Regardless of the enhanced electrochemical properties with incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, redox reaction mechanisms and the corresponding structural evolution process are still unknown and require more research efforts.
Manganese-based Na2MnSiO4, first reported as a precursor to prepare Li 2MnSiO4 though ion-exchange, can crystallized into monoclinic Pn structure and possesses polyanionic framework constituted by corner-sharing MnO4 and SiO4 tetrahedra[197]. More than one mole of Na ions intercalation per Na2MnSiO4 molecule was first realized in Na2MnSiO4/C/rGo composite with particle size of 30-40 nm[198]. Due to intrinsic electronical insulation nature of silicates, however, the high initial discharge capacity of 182 mAh g -1 was hardly maintained during the following tens of cycles. Law et al. reported the highest-ever reversible capacity of 210 mAh g -1 of Na2MnSiO4 electrode among the polyanion-type compounds, as achieved via the interdependent effect of both the structural features of Na2MnSiO4 and the optimized electrolyte and additive mixture[199]. Mn 2+ /Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ was demonstrated as the active redox species during the charge/discharge process, involving 1.5 electrons transferring reaction. The electrolyte additive of vinylene carbonate (VC) could form a meta-stable passivation film on the surface of Na2MnSiO4 electrode to reduce manganese dissolution, leading to the good electrochemical reversibility. Zhang et al. demonstrated similar ion diffusion mechanism in Na2MnSiO4 and Li 2MnSiO4 whatever the migratory ions choice of Na + or Li + based on the first-principles calculations. It was noted that faster Na + diffusion rate in Na2MnSiO4 than that of Li + in Li analog was identified, which was ascribed to the wider diffusion channels in Na2MnSiO4 than that of in Li 2MnSiO4 [200].
Similar to Li 2FeSiO4 as the cathode material for LIB applications, Na2FeSiO4 has also caused extensive attentions as novel electrode material for SIBs, because of the possibility of multi-electrons exchange with high theoretical capacity. Na2FeSiO4 was first obtained through electrochemical Li-Na ion-exchanged from the Li counterpart, which showed a capacity as high as 330 mAh g -1 (calculated based on Li 2FeSiO4) in the voltage range of 1.2-4.5 V[201]. A new cubic polymorph of Na2FeSiO4 with F4-3m space group, first synthesized by Y ang’s group though a sol-gel method, delivered a reversible capacity of 106 mAh g -1 within 1.5-4.0 V in a Na-ion cell[202].
This material demonstrated no appreciable cell volume change during the electrochemical reaction process due to its robust structural stability, as verified by the combination of ex-situ XRD and first-principles calculations. Better electrochemical results were gained for the carbon coated Na2FeSiO4 with particle size of 20-50 nm[203]. Na2FeSiO4/C delivered a high discharge capacity of 181 mAh g-1 at a current rate of 27.6 mA g -1 with a stable cycling performance of 88% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Despite the satisfactory reversible capacity, the energy density of this kind of material is not supposed to be exceptionally high resulting from the relatively low operation plateau at ~1.9 V corresponded to the Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox reaction.
Compared to the crystalline electrodes, materials with amorphous structure are likely to provide improved structural stability and redox kinetic performance, owing to the less lattice limitation during Na + insertion/extraction and more facile diffusion paths in disordered structure[204]. However, exploring suitable amorphous electrode materials for sodium-ion storage is still facing an arduous challenge. Of particular interest is amorphous FePO4 material, which promises a high theoretical capacity of 175 mAh g -1. Shiratsuchi et al. first revealed the feasibility of Li and Na storage in both amorphous and crystalline FePO4 using Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ redox reaction[205]. Besides, amorphous FePO4 was demonstrated as potential host for various charge carrier ions including cations like monovalent cations Li +/Na +/K +, divalent cations Mg 2+ /Zn 2+ or trivalent cations Al 3+ . A combination of ex situ studies revealed the existence of a reversible disordered-to-ordered transformation induced by the electrochemical insertion/extraction, which appeared to contribute to the impressive sodium and potassium storage performance of amorphous FePO4[206]. Challenges of low electronic conductivity and sluggish ionic diffusion of amorphous FePO4 are being address with various strategies such as conductive materials incorporation, nanoengineering and morphology control[207-211]. Meanwhile, the detailed redox reaction mechanisms are still unclear, further research efforts need to be conducted to study the reaction characteristics using more sophisticated and convincing characteristic techniques.
As another typical representative NASICON-type compound, NaTi 2(PO4)3, has attracted board attention as the anode material for SIBs due to its attractive sodium-ion storage performance. As shown in Figure 10 a, rhombohedral NaTi 2(PO4)3 is characterized with R -3 c space group, exhibiting a 3D open framework via NASICON structure. Two TiO 6 octahedra interconnected with three PO4 tetrahedra by corner-sharing all the oxygen atoms to form the strongly bonded “lantern” structural units [Ti 2(PO4)3], leading to large interstitial positions for sodium ions. Two crystallographic sites to accommodate sodium ions: Na1 sites with 6-fold coordination located between every two TiO 6 octahedra along c-axis, fully occupied; Na2 sites with 8-fold coordination with an occupancy of 2/3; corresponding to 6 b (0,0,0) and 18 e (x,0,1/4) Wyckoff position, respectively. At low Na contents in the lattice, sodium-ions could preferably occupy the Na1 sites; while during the electrochemical (de)intercalation of Na + ions in NaTi 2(PO4)3, sodium-ions actually occupy the octahedra Na2 sites[213]. Delmas et al. first introduced the feasibility of alkali-ion storage properties in A Ti 2(PO4)3 (A=Li or Na)[214-216]. NaTi 2(PO4)3 presents a well-defined redox plateau at ~2.1 V ( vs. Na/Na +) with two Na +-ions reversible insertion/extraction through a two-phasic transition between NaTi 2(PO4)3 and Na3Ti 2(PO4)3, delivering theoretical capacity of 133 mAh g -1. Most titanium-based NASICON-type materials operate on the Ti 4+ /Ti 3+ redox reaction, however, Senguttucvan et al. proved the possibility of developing electrode material based on the Ti 3+ /Ti 2+ redox couple[212]. Triclinic Na3Ti 2(PO4)3 not only can be oxidized into Na 1Ti 2(PO4)3, but also can be reduced to Na 4Ti 2(PO4)3, both being rhombohedral structure, exhibiting two distinct redox plateaus at ~2.1 and ~0.4 V ( vs. Na/Na +), respectively (Figure 10b). Enlarging the electrochemical window to the range of 0-3 V , the theoretical capacity achieved as high as 200 mAh g -1. The report showed two step redox reactions are expressed in Equations (1) and (2).
Compared to other anode materials for SIBs, such as hard carbon, transition-metal oxides and chalcogenides, one of the highlights of NaTi 2(PO4)3 is being used as the electrode material for aqueous SIBs[217-219]. Park et al. in 2011 first reported the electrochemical properties of NaTi 2(PO4)3 anode for rechargeable aqueous SIBs assembled with Zn, delivering a high capacity of 123 mAh g -1, and exhibiting good cycling stability and rate performance[220]. NaTi 2(PO4)3 in aqueous systems shows fast ion diffusion, slight volume variation, low cost and environmental friendliness, all of which contribute to its potential commercialization. Though pioneering works have demonstrated various advantages of NaTi 2(PO4)3 in the field of aqueous and non-aqueous SIBs, the practical applications NaTi 2(PO4)3 are still limited by its poor rate capacity due to the low intrinsic electrical conductivity commonly in phosphates.
More interestingly, Na3V2(PO4)3 can serve as both cathode and anode material for SIBs, due to the unique structural feature of being capable of accepting a wide range of Na contents in the host framework. V ariable valences in vanadium endows a series of redox couples: V 5+ /V 4+ , V 4+ /V 3+ , and V 3+ /V 2+ , which allows multi-electrons transfer in vanadium-based material. The redox reactions of V 5+ /V 4+ and V 4+ /V 3+ result in high voltage plateaus, while the potential of V 3+ /V 2+ is relatively low that can be used for the cathodic process. Okada’s and Yamada’s group in 2010 introduced Na3V2(PO4)3 as the symmetrical electrode for a full Na-ion cell with ionic liquid electrolyte[221]. Jian et al. first reported the carbon coated Na3V2(PO4)3 electrode exhibited two flat potential plateaus at 3.4 V and 1.6 V vs. Na/Na + in organic electrolyte system, corresponding to the V 4+ /V 3+ and V 3+ /V 2+ redox couples, respectively[213]. Focusing on the cathodic process in the electrochemical window of 1.0-3.0 V , Na3V2(PO4)3 as an anode delivered a specific capacity of 93 mAh g -1, corresponding to one more Na + cation inserted into the Na3V2(PO4)3 lattice to form Na 4V2(PO4)3. During a deep sodiation process by decreasing the voltage to 0.01 V , however, a new low-voltage plateau at ~0.3 V was shown up, indicating the fifth Na +-ion insertion into the Na3V2(PO4)3 lattice[222]. CV curves and the typical charge-discharge profiles are shown in Figures 11 a and 11b. Two well-defined redox couples for the cathodic reactions enabled Na3V2(PO4)3 anode delivering a specific capacity of ~ 150 mAh g -1 (including the capacity contributions from the carbonaceous material, and the theoretical capacity is 117.6 mAh g -1), indicating Na3V2(PO4)3 is a promising anode material for SIBs.
Jiao and his co-workers first reported NASICON-type NaZr 2(PO4)3 synthesized by a solid-phase method and demonstrated the possibility of Na +-ion-storage behavior of NaZr 2(PO4)3 for SIBs[223]. Similar to NaTi 2(PO4)3, the NaZr 2(PO4)3 framework consists of [Zr 2(PO4)3] lanterns built by ZrO 6 octahedra corner-sharing with PO4 tetrahedra, and the Na +-ions distributed in the holes between ZrO 6 octahedra along the c-axis. Like other NASICON-type compounds, the 3D open and highly covalent-bonded structure leads to high Na +-ionic conductivity and strong structural stability. NaZr 2(PO4)3 delivered a discharge capacity of ~ 150 mAh g -1 at 20 mA g -1, attributed to approximately 2.8 mol Na ions reversibly inserted/extracted per NaZr 2(PO4)3 formula unit during the charge-discharge process, demonstrating the relevance of NaZr 2(PO4)3 as anode material for SIBs with fast redox kinetics and stable cycling performance (Figure 11c).
 Furthermore, other polyanion-type materials with low redox potentials, such as Na2VTi(PO4)3[224-226], Na3VTi(PO4)3 [227] and Na3MnTi(PO4)3[228-230] are worthy of mention. NASICON-structured Na2VTi(PO4)3 was introduced by Mason et al. and its electrochemical properties were evaluated in aqueous Na-ion batteries firstly[225]. Unfortunately, the working voltage and specific capacity were unsatisfied due to the redox limitation in aqueous system with only one Na +-ion per formula unit transport. Following that, Wang et al. demonstrated sodium-storage behavior in organic electrolyte system of carbon-coated Na2VTi(PO4)3 synthesized by a sol-gel method[224]. As displayed in Figure 11d, a stable specific capacity of ~150 mAh g -1 was achieved between 1.5 and 4.5 V ( vs. Na/Na +) at the current rate of 0.1 C. The initial discharging profile was featured by three step phase transition processes at 3.4, 2.1 and 1.6 V , owing to the stepwise reduction reaction of V 4+ /V 3+ , Ti 4+ / Ti 3+ , and V3+ /V 2+ redox couples, respectively. The low redox potential allows Na2VTi(PO4)3 being capable of serving as both anode and cathode material for SIBs.
By combining analysis of the crystal structure, electrochemical properties and the sodium-storage mechanisms, polyanion-type compounds have been considered as the potential high-performance electrode materials for SIBs because they are capable of providing stable structure during long cycling and fast Na + migration. Serving as cathode materials, they exhibit excellent cycling stability and relatively high operation potential. In the meantime, the major problem coming from the huge volume expansion haunted the anode materials, which can be feasibly solved by implementing the polyanion-type anodes owing to the negligible volume exchange during (de)insertion of Na +-ions. Polyanion-type materials offer good choices of cathode or anode materials for fabrication of Na-ion full-cells (NIFCs). In the next section, a brief summary about NIFCs constructed by polyanionic compounds as cathode or/and anode will be collected and analyzed, and some of the achievements are summarized in Table 2 .
NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) is famous of its fantastic electrochemical properties, thermal and structural stability, and relatively high voltage plateau ( ∼3.4 V) for sodium-ion half-cells. To further explore the feasibility for practical applications of NVP cathodes, a wide variety of anode materials (e.g. carbonaceous materials, alloys, metal oxides, metal sulfides, etc.) matching with NVP were investigated in NIFCs. Particularly, hard carbon materials are promising anode materials due to low cost, easy preparation, superior conductivity and so on. For example, Ren et al.[232] reported a NIFC assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 nanocomposite (NVP-NP) as cathode and poorly-graphitized hard carbon (HC) as anode ( Figures 12 a-c). The NVP-NP//HC full-cell displayed high average voltage of 3.3 V and the specific gravimetric energy reached up to 350 Wh kg -1 based on the mass of cathode (258 Wh kg -1 based on the mass of both cathode and anode). Moreover, good cycling performance was obtained with a specific capacity of 60 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.5 C, corresponding to 0.43% capacity decay per cycle. To further improve the electrochemical performance, Cao et al.[240] presented a new NIFC configuration, using graphene encapsulated NVP nanoflakes arrays (NVP-NFs) as the cathode and 3D graphene-like material as the anode (Figure 12d). The NVP-NFs//3D graphene cages full-cell delivered high specific capacity of 109.2 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g -1 with an average operating potential of 2.7 V (Figure 12e), and maintained a good cycling stability (77.1% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.1 A g −1).
In addition to carbonaceous materials, alloys-based anodes for SIBs are attracting more and more attention because of their high theoretical capacity, such as Sb delivering a high theoretical capacity of 660 mAh g −1, and low potential relative to Na. Y ang et al.[243] successfully assembled a NIFC coupling double-walled Sb@amorphous TiO 2−x nanotubes anode with NVP-C cathode, which showed outstanding electrochemical performance. It presented a capacity of 310 mAh g −1 (based on the mass of anode) at 6.6 A g −1 with an average working voltage of 2.5 V , and delivered energy density of 151 W h kg −1 at 21 W kg −1, even 61 W h kg −1 at 1.83 kW kg −1. Moreover, a graphene-scaffolded NVP microspheres//Sb-C full-cell delivered a high energy density of 242 Wh kg −1 (based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 0.1 C, and showed excellent rate performance (power density of 4.56 kW kg -1 at high rate of 20 C)[247].
It should be noted that the insertion of Na + into alloy-based anodes causes large volume expansion, which leads to the pulverization of electrode materials and rapid deteriorations of anodic performances. Considering this, metal oxides have emerged as potential candidates of SIBs anodes. A novel NVP//Nb 2O5 NIFC showed a favorable electrochemical properties with a stable capacity of 105 mAh g -1 after 500 cycles at 10 C (based on the weight of anode) between 1.2 and 3.5 V[256]. Besides, mesoporous Nb 2O5 nanosheets as an anode material for SIBs was scalably fabricated via a simple nanocasting approach, and then applied for the NIFC. The designed NVP//mesoporous Nb 2O5 nanosheets NIFC displayed a relatively high reversible capacity of 244 mAh g -1 at 50 mA g -1 and nice high-rate capability [257]. In addition, titanium dioxide (TiO 2) possesses combined merits of good chemical stability, negligible strain during electrochemical cycling, low cost and environment friendly and thus has been extensively studied recently for SIBs applications. Gregorio et al.[255] demonstrated a high-energy NIFC consisting of TiO 2 anode coupling with a NVP cathode. The NVP//TiO 2 NIFC delivered an average potential voltage at 2.0 V with reversible capacity of 220 mAh g −1, featuring the energy density as high as 440 Wh kg -1.
Among various anode materials for SIBs, transition metal sulfides/selenides have emerged as promising candidates because of earth abundant, low cost and high theoretical capacities. High-performance Fe 3S4 nanosheet anode coupling with NVP@C@rGO cathode (NVP@C@rGO//Fe 3S4 NIFC) exhibited highly reversible capacity of ~305 mAh g −1 (based on the weight of anode) at current density of 100 mA g −1 with an average output voltage of about 1.7 V[259]. With comparison of hard carbon as the anode material assembled NVP@C@rGO//HC NIFC, NVP@C@rGO//Fe 3S4 NIFC showed higher reversible capacity and much better rate capability, indicating more superior potential of NVP@C@rGO//Fe 3S4 NIFC for practical applications. FeSe 2 microspheres assembled by numerous nanooctahedra used as the anode material was paired with NVP cathode[272]. High discharge capacity of 366 mAh g −1 (based on the anode mass) at 1 A g −1 was achieved for the NVP//FeSe 2 NIFC with an output voltage of about 1.7 V . It also demonstrated good cycling stability, remaining 81.4% of capacity retention after 200 cycles. Many creative strategies were explored to further improve the electronic conductivities of the transition metal chalcogenides, such as carbon coating, surface engineering and lattice doping. Mai’s group[262] fabricated ultrafine CoS nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon nanorods (denoted as 7-CoS/C) via in-situ carbonization and sulfidation of Co-metal organic frameworks (Co-MOF). After coupled with NVP , the NVP//7-CoS/C NIFC delivered high reversible capacity of 368 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 (based on the mass of 7-CoS/C) ( Figure 13 a). After 100 cycles, the discharge capacity maintained 352 mAh g −1 with the capacity retention of 95.6%, exhibiting excellent cycling performance (Figure 13b). Peng et al.[261] developed a NIFC based on CoS@rGO hybrid anode and electrospun NVP@C cathode, displaying initial charge/discharge capacities of 498 and 381 mAh g −1 (based on the mass of anode) and delivering the energy density of 92 Wh kg -1. A NiS-Ni freestanding anode matching with NVP cathode, the NVP//NiS-Ni NIFC showed excellent cycling performance with charge and discharge capacities of 172.8 and 163.5 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.05 A g -1[263]. Furthermore, Niu et al.[271] assembled NVP/C cathode with MoSe 2-covered N,P-doped carbon nanosheet (MoSe 2/N,P-rGO) anode, which showed a capacity of 276 mAh g −1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g -1, corresponding to a capacity retention of 80%. The NVP/C//MoSe 2/N,P-rGO NIFC demonstrated high rate capability (Figure 13c) and high energy density (113.6 Wh kg −1total at 0.1 kW kg −1, even 57.6 Wh kg −1total still achieved at 1.68 kW kg −1) (Figure 13d).
Based on the above results, it is not hard to find that the energy density of NIFCs based on metal oxides and metal sulfides/selenides is strongly limited by their high operation voltage and huge initial capacity irreversibility, therefore further hindering their practical applications for large-scale energy storage.
Compared with Na3V2(PO4)3, fluorophosphates Na3V2(PO4)2F3/Na3V2O2(PO4)2F show higher redox potentials for de-/sodiation owing to the lattice adoption of electronegative atoms of F[307] and therefore improve the energy density of the NIFCs mentioned above. Okada et. al.[283] confirmed the feasibility of Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode in a NIFC configuration using SnS/G+C as the anode. The Na3V2(PO4)2F3//SnS/G+C NIFC showed good electrochemical performance with high initial charge/discharge capacities of 504/319 mAh g -1 and high output potential over 2.5 V . Furthermore, Liu et. al.[285] synthesized the Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C//red P@C NIFC, which delivered an initial reversible capacity of 847.8 mA h g -1 based on the mass of anode red P@C at 1 A g -1 and showed a high average output voltage of ~ 3.65 V . An outstanding energy density was achieved as high as 161.8 Wh kg -1 (Figure 14 a) based on the total mass of the battery. After 100 cycles, the reversible capacity remained 698.2 mAh g -1 at 1000 mA g -1, showing a high capacity retention (82.3%) with high CE above 99% (Figure 14b). Wang et al.[281] presented that Na3V2(PO4)2F3/C//rice husk-derived hard carbons (RHHCs) NIFC exhibited a stable capacity of 258 mAh g-1  after the activation cycles and an average output voltage of 3.4 V at 25 mA g -1 between 1.6 and 4.3 V . It also demonstrated good rate capability with a high specific capacity of 173 mAh g -1 even at 100 mA g -1 and remarkable cycling stability with a 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The energy density of this NIFC based on the total mass of cathode and anode active materials was calculated to be 185 Wh kg -1. Moreover, Wang et al.[308] reported a NIFC consisting of amorphous selenium coated on 3D reduced graphene oxide (3DSG) as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)2O2F as the cathode (Figure 14c), which delivered a high energy density of up to 313 Wh kg -1 at a power density of 51 W kg -1 and showed an outstanding rate performance owing to the fast electrochemical reaction kinetics of both cathode and anode in the whole current density range from 0.02 tO4 A g -1 (Figure 14d). Wu et al.[284] presented a NIFC configuration consisting of double transition metal selenide Ni 1.5 CoSe 5 nanoaggregates in 3D N-doped carbon network (abbreviated as Ni 1.5 CoSe 5@NC@rGO) anode with Na3V2(PO4)2O2F, which delivered a high energy density of up to 294 Wh kg -1 at 49.8 W kg -1 and capacity retention of above 94.4% after 35 cycles at 0.5 A g -1.
Due to the suitable theoretical capacity (133 mAh g-1), high Na + ion conductivity, negligible volume change during cycling, as well as safety, low cost and environmental benignity characteristics, NASICON-type NaTi 2(PO4)3 (NTP) with a sodium insertion reaction mechanism has attracted much attention as anode for SIBs. The electrochemical studies of NTP served as the anodes in NIFCs systems were widely conducted in last few years. Han’s [287] group presented a NIFC consisting of high-quality Ni 0.3 Co 0.7 [Fe(CN) 6] Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) (HQ-NiCoFe) as the cathode and NTP as the anode, which showed high initial discharge capacity of 125.6 mAh g -1 at a current density of 15 mA g -1 (calculated on the mass of HQ-NiCoFe electrode) and excellent rate performance (the specific capacities remained nearly 90 and 60 mAh g −1 at 750 and 1500 mA g −1, respectively). Meanwhile, the NIFC showed good cyclability without noticeable capacity fading over 300 cycles under a current density of 150 mA g −1.The nickel hexacyanoferrate//F-doped NaTi 2(PO4)3/C NIFC[288] also demonstrated exciting electrochemical behaviors, exhibiting suitable discharge capacities of ∼116 mAh g −1 at a current density of 66.5 mA g −1, outstanding rate capability (remained high reversible capacity of 96.98 mAh g −1 even at a current density of 1330 mA g −1) and stable cycling performance (maintained ∼70% capacity retention ).
 Compared with non aqueous SIBs, aqueous SIBs also have attracted much attention due to lower cost and lower toxicity. Chen et al.[289] fabricated an aqueous sodium-ion full-cell (ANIFC) constructed by NTP anode, silver cathode, and 1 M NaCl solution as an aqueous electrolyte in an open environment. The obtained ANIFC exhibited a reversible capacity of 37.4 mAh g -1 at current density of 1000 mA g -1 and maintained excellent cycling stability for 200 cycles without obvious capacity decay. The NaTi 2(PO4)3//Na 0.66 [Mn 0.66 Ti 0.34 ]O 2 ANIFC, reported by Hu et al.[291], demonstrated an outstanding reversible capacity of ~76 mAh g -1 at a current rate of 2 C with an average operating voltage of 1.2 V , which is the highest-ever among all reported positive electrodes for aqueous SIBs till then. Furthermore, the full-cell exhibited excellent rate performance with high specific capacity of ~54 mAh g -1 at 10 C and stable cycling behaviors over 300 cycles with capacity retention of 89% at a current rate of 2 C.
The symmetric NIFCs, using the same active materials for both the cathode and anode, are very attractive and promising from commercial application point of view, processing several important merits in terms of capable of buffering large volume expansion, tolerance of cell overcharge to some extent, cost saving and simplify the manufacturing process. As illustrated in part 2.1.2 and part 2.2.2, NVP shows unique structural characteristics of being capable of both cathode and anode materials owing to the versatility of vanadium redox couples. At the beginning of the study on NVP , one more Na + ion was found to be reversibly inserted/extracted into/from the NVP lattice, exhibiting a voltage plateau at around 1.6 V vs Na +/Na based on the redox couple of V 3+ /V 2+ . The electrochemical performance of the symmetric NVP//NVP NIFC was firstly evaluated by Mai’s group[309]. As expected from the respective of 1.6 V and 3.4 V , the combination of NVP/AC as both anode and cathode gave rise to a NIFC operating around 1.75 V . Moreover, the symmetric NVP//NVP NIFC exhibited a long cycle life with approximately 80% of capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. According to the calculation on the basis of the cathode, the specific energy of this symmetric NVP//NVP NIFC achieved as high as 185.5 Wh kg -1, and remarkably, it could deliver a specific power of ~ 5000 W kg -1.
The demonstrated symmetric NVP//NVP NIFC performance provides great opportunities to outclass other competitor systems for operating in the fields of energy storage and transition, and thus triggers intensive research interests in this battery system. Zhang et al.[298] employed Na3V2(PO4)3/elastic carbon foam (NVP/ECF) to construct a symmetric full-cell with a discharge capacity of 107.8 mAh g -1 at voltage plateau at 1.79 V , corresponding to the energy density of 162 Wh kg -1 based on the total mass of the electrodes. To further improve the electrochemical performance, Yu's group[297] constructed the symmetric NIFC using 3D tricontinuous NVP:rGO-CNT material, delivering a high rate capability with reversible capacity of ≈90 mA h g-1 at 10 C.
However, the intercalation of the fourth Na +-ion strongly limits on the capacity utilization of the NVP anode and the working voltage window of the symmetric NIFC. Encouragingly, the fifth Na +-ion insertion into the NVP lattice produced a lower redox potential at ~ 0.3 V , doubling the theoretical capacity of the NVP anode to 117.6 mAh g-1. Zhao et al. [310] firstly reported a symmetric NIFC with Ca-doped Na3V1.95 Ca 0.05 (PO4)3@C as both electrodes exhibiting a high output voltage over 3 V (Figures 15 a and 15b). Though controlling of the electrochemical window of 1-4 V , the low sodiation voltage potential could be fully utilized and therefore greatly enhanced the energy density of the battery. The Na3V1.95 Ca 0.05 (PO4)3@C// Na3V1.95 Ca 0.05 (PO4)3@C NIFC delivered a high gravimetric energy of 166 Wh kg -1 at 0.5 C (based on the total weights of both cathode and anode), and maintained 73% of energy density at high rate of 20 C. Moreover, benefited from the stable lattice structure owing to Ca-doping, the symmetric NIFC manifested outstanding rate performance (Figure 15c) and very high cycling stability (0.02% capacity decay per cycle for 2000 cycles at 10 C, Figure 15d), outputting all of the NVP-based and metal oxides-based electrodes symmetric NIFCs.
On the other hand, Noguchi et al.[292] assembled an all solid-state Na-ion symmetrical battery with NVP as the electrodes and Na3Zr 2Si 2PO 12 (NASICON) as the solid electrolyte. The fabricated symmetric battery examined at room-temperature offered a relatively flat discharge voltage of 1.8 V and 80% of the discharge capacity for the equivalent liquid symmetric cell. Furthermore, all solid-state NVP|Na3Zr 2Si 2PO 12 |NVP NIFC operated at high temperature (200 °C) demonstrated high electrochemical reversibility, showing 85% of the theoretical capacity at C/10 at 1.8 V , with an overall energy density of 1.87 10 -3 Wh cm -2 and a capacity of 1.04 mAh cm -2[293].
To further explore the practical applications of NASICON-type full-cells, different materials as cathode and anode were assembled to obtain high-performance and high-energy Na-ion full batteries. For example, Mai’s group [299] reported a full-cell consisting of three-dimensional Na3V2(PO4)3 nanofiber as cathode and NaTi 2(PO4)3 as anode, which showed outstanding cycling stability (96.9% capacity retention over 300 cycles at 5 C) and superior rate capability (80 mAh g -1 at 50 C). More importantly, the energy density reached up to 90 Wh kg -1 at a power density as high as 6 kW kg −1, which is ascribed to 3D nanofiber network structure providing multi-channel ionic diffusion pathway, continuous electronic conduction, and improved structural integrity. A full-cell consisting of NaTi 2(PO4)3@C as the anode and Na3V2(PO4)3@carbon on carbon cloth as the cathode was reported by Cao’ group.[301] This full-cell showed outstanding sodium storage performance, such as the initial discharge capacity is 104.7 mAh g -1 based on the cathode mass, with an initial Coulombic efficiency as high as 90.2% with the voltage window in the range of 0.7-2.4 V at 1 C. Furthermore, even at an ultrahigh rate of 50 C, the power density (based on the mass of NVP@C) is as high as 8.4 kW kg -1 with an energy density of 94 Wh kg −1. In particular, it exhibited an energy density as high as of 396 Wh kg -1 at power density as high as 97 kW kg -1 with high mass loading of NVP@C-CC electrode. Y u et al.[302] presented a full-cell of NaTi 2(PO4)3/carbon nanotube fabrics (NTP/CNFs) as anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3/ carbon nanotube fabrics (NVP/CNFs) as cathode, which exhibited a potential plateau around 1.3 V with a discharge capacity of 126 mAh g -1, more importantly, it showed a capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles at 1 C, even at a high current rate of 20 C, it still maintained, a reversible capacity of greater than 90 m h g -1, corresponded to a capacity retention of 74.5%, with high coulombic efficiency after cycling 4000 times, which is attributed to the novel morphology and stable structure of the electrodes. Moreover, Liu et al.[303] assembled the Na3V2(PO4)2F3-single walled carbon nanotube(cathode) //NaTi 2(PO4)3-multi walled carbon nanotube(anode) aqueous full-cell, which can deliver a high energy density of 150 Wh kg -1 in 17 M NaClO4 electrolyte. More importantly, the full-cell showed the voltage of 1.92 V , which is one of the highest voltages obtained by using intercalation anode and cathode materials in aqueous electrolyte for aqueous rechargeable sodium-ion batteries.
Ambient-temperature SIBs are considered as one of the most promising electrochemical power sources for grid-scale energy storage applications due to their competitive cost, sustainable Na-resources supply and relatively high energy density. The studies on Na-ion intercalation electrochemistry began at 1980s, and the last decade of concerted efforts in the Na-ion battery technologies and relevant material science have borne fruit. Advanced electrode materials with high capacity, excellent rate capability and stable cycling performance are still the bottlenecks for boosting the practical realization of sodium-ion technologies. Among various electrode materials proposed for SIBs system, sodium-based polyanionic compounds, such as phosphates, pyrophosphates, fluorophosphates, orthosilicates, sulfates and so on have attracted intense research attention. 
This review focuses on the recent research progress with polyanionic compounds for room-temperature SIBs. It points out that this novel class of electrode materials is capable of providing robust structural framework that favors promising Na + mobility and electrochemical activity. They offer a myriad of crystal structures, owing to the size/type effect of the transition metal and great adaptability of various kinds of polyanion units. It makes an easy way to design and optimize new structures and new material chemistries by tuning the M n+ /M (n-1)+ redox couples or selecting of anionic groups. In this contribution, a high specific energy can be possibly realized by lowering the energy level of 3 d band of the transition metal though cationic doping or anionic substitution. On the other hand, excellent reversibility and fast Na-ionic diffusion in polyanion-type electrode materials have been demonstrated over long cycling tests, which are benefited from the stable and open framework structure of this class of materials.
Among them, Na3V2(PO4)3/C and NaTi 2(PO4)3/C stand out as the most viable system (cathode and anode, respectively) showing remarkable cycling performance with almost 100% capacity retention after cycling more than 1000 cycles. In pursuing of advanced cathode materials with high voltage potential and high specific capacity, recently intensive research enthusiasms were turned to the mixed polyanion cathode systems. By modulating the compositions of the polyanionic groups, such as F/O ratios in Na3V2O2-2x (PO4)2F1+2x (0 ≤ x ≤ 1), redox potentials can be improved by the inductive effect. Comparatively close value in energy density to the mature electrodes for LIBs was obtained in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F fluorophosphate, attributed to the high theoretical capacity of 130 mAh g -1 based on the V 4+ /V 3+ redox reaction at high operating plateau of around 3.6 and 4.0 V vs. Na/Na+, respectively. In addition, optimizing the composition makes the multiple electrons redox reaction feasibly realized so as to compensate the capacity loss caused by the large molecular weights of polyanion units. Owing to the achievement of 1.2 electrons transfer, the energy density of 600 Wh kg -1 in Na3V2O1.6 (PO4)2F1.4 was successfully obtained. What’s more, mixed phosphates Na 4M3(PO4)2P2O7 theoretically reach three electrons redox reactions and deliver high-voltage operating over 4.5 V , indicating the promising prospects for application in SIBs.
Before practical application, a full-cell perspective is an essential bridge set up between the sodium-ion half-cell and the commercial battery. Most recent advances of various prototypes of sodium-ion full-cells built with polyanion-type electrode materials and the electrochemistry development are reviewed. The working potentials and specific capacities of representative sodium-ion full-cells are summarized in Figure 16 . As can be seen, most systems exhibit the voltages distributed in a wide range of 1.5-3.5 V , and their energy density range from 150 Wh kg -1 to 250 Wh kg -1 (based on the total weights of cathode and anode), indicating potential applications of high energy density SIBs. It is noteworthy that, the practice capacities of some of the polyanion-type electrodes far lower than those of their theoretical values, implying there is plenty of room for enhancement of the reversible capacities of these polyanionic materials.
In order to highlight the correspondences between chemistries and electrochemical features of various cathode materials for SIBs, a considerable number of recent reports proposing sodium-ion full-cell set-ups are thoroughly collected and the most significant contributions are specifically sorted. A 3D plot illustrates the average voltage, specific capacity, as well as the energy density of SIFC prototypes in Figure 17 . Three important types of positive electrode materials, including layered metal oxides (green diamond), polyanion compounds (orange ball) and Prussian blue analogues (blue cube) are compared[232,234,243,245,247,248,253,271,279,281,285,304,311-326]. Particularly, the collected energy densities normalization has been made according to the total mass of anode and cathode. Ultimately, high specific capacity was mostly observed in SIFC assemblies constructed by layered metal oxides while the polyanion-type compounds can attain a desirably high working potential. A wide range of operating potential and capacity can be obtained by the material families of Prussian blue analogues. The achievable energy densities among the different cathode materials are encouraging, in the range of 100-200 Wh kg -1, proving industry competition actual strength to LIBs. Notably, some cases among the ones taken in consideration in this review, the polyanionic compound//hard carbon SIFCs, both operation voltage and energy density are considerably higher than those of the average. However, the practical challenges of advanced cathode materials are typically associated with high specific energy, excellent cycling stability, high rate performance, and good safety. The fundamental difficulties lie in the reversible sodiation/desodiation required for the high-capacity transitional-metal oxides are their insufficient cycling stability, which is related to the complicated multiphase transition reactions and corresponding large structural stress that are inevitable and intrinsic characteristics of a layered-type cathode. In addition, the air-stability is still one of the key issues for layered oxide cathodes, thus moisture-free process during the material and battery preparation is needed. Owing to the zeolitic water molecules and numerous defects in the host lattice of Prussian blue analogues, their cycling life is also relatively short and stability remains remain problematic. With respect to the cycling performance, polyanion-type cathode materials hold promise. They are generally less susceptible to the lattice variation associated with Na insertion/extraction owing to the nature of the open crystal framework. Many reports have already demonstrated the excellent cycling stability of over several thousands of cycles. Nevertheless, the presence of heavy polyanionic species depresses the energy density of polyanion-based materials. The modifications to reduce the weight of the polyanionic groups and exploration of new crystal structures are highly required.
 Despite the achievements obtained from the current designed polyanion-based compounds, the practical applications of polyanion-based compounds are still severely hindered by their poor rate capability owing to its intrinsic low electronic conductivity. The electrochemical activity of the polyanionic systems can be greatly improved by the well-known strategies including surface engineering with carbon or other conductive compounds, designing and optimizing micro-/nanostructures, modulating the compositions with concentration-gradient regulation or lattice doping. Rational combinations of different modification methods are necessary for the development of advanced electrode materials and maximization of the overall electrochemical performance of the whole battery. Therefore, in order to accelerate the practical applications of polyanion materials, some issues should be properly addressed such as (1) exploring and optimizing suitable Na + ion intercalation structures providing high working voltage and reversible capacity by the means of computational simulations and material chemistry; (2) succeeding high specific capacity with high Coulombic efficiency under high power density though rational strategies of electrode modification; (3) controlling the structural and microstructural parameters and increasing the active material loading which may lead to high energy/volume energy density. (4) developing safe electrolytes to match the high-operating potentials of cathode materials. Besides efforts on the fundamental research, continuous, incremental improvements on engineering work should be overlooked, as a crucial step to industrial-scale production of SIBs. Polyanion-type materials as cathode or anode provide new opportunities for achieving high-energy and cost-effective SIBs for large-scale energy storage applications.
