Super ionic conductors (e.g. A3M2(XO4)3, A=Li, Na) have received attention in applied research due to theirinteresting electrochemical property and inherently high ionic conductivity [1].
However, structural and compatibilityrequirements for fast ion transport is stringent and it plays a crucial role.
In A3M2(XO4)3, a suitable cage formation in thecrystal framework due to corner sharing arrangement of XO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra creates voids that acts ashost/guest site for cation transport.
In this work, we report Nasicon structure Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NFP) prepared via sol-gel routemediated by citric acid.
Structural analysis confirmed that NFP sample belongs to monoclinic crystal structure having Ccspace group (S.G.No 9) with lattice parameters, a=15.106 Å, b=8.722 Å, c=8.775 Å and β=124.96°.
Electrical propertiesof the prepared sample have been studied by AC impedance spectroscopy technique.
The AC conductivity results indicatedtypical signature of ionically conducting system.
In this report, we have studied the formation and electrical properties of a super ionic conductor Na3Fe2(PO4)3 asa function of temperature.
The impedance spectra indicates that the material exhibits electrical transport governed bybulk and grain boundary contribution at very low temperature (≥75oC).
This phenomena is established from theasymmetric semi-circular arc and equivalent circuit modelling.
The DC conductivity of the material was also studiedwhich reveals that the conduction process is a thermally activated process.
The DC conductivity when plotted againsttemperature gives a typical Arrhenius nature of electrical conduction.
The activation energy of the material is 0.51 eVwhich establish the super ionic behavior of the prepared sample.
