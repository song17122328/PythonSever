The  NASICON  (Na1  +  xZr2SixP3     xO12)  is  a  well  known  solid  electrolyte  material  with  high  ionic  conductivity.  The  ion  conductivity  can  be improved  by  modifying  the  structure.  The  NASICON  powders  with  different  compositions  (by  varying  x)  have  been  prepared  by  sol–gel  method. The  structural  and  conductivity  measurements  have  been  done  by  XRD,  complex  plane  impedance  analysis  and  electrochemical  cell  method.  The results  indicate  that  the  ac  conductivity  and  Na+ ion  selectivity  are  higher  for  x  =  2.05  as  compared  to  other  compositions.  The  enhancement  of  Na+ ion  conductivity  for  x  =  2.05  has  been  attributed  to  modiﬁcations  in  the  orientations  of  tetrahedral  structures  which  lead  to  change  in  the  bottleneck size.  The  results  have  been  conﬁrmed  by  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD). #   2011  Elsevier  Ltd  and  Techna  Group  S.r.l.  All  rights  reserved.

For  the  last  30  years,  NASICON  (Na1  +  xZr2SixP3     xO12) material  (acronym  for  Na  SuperIonic  CONductors)  has  been used  for  gas  sensing,  Na+ based  batteries  and  ion  selective electrodes  because  of  its  high  ionic  conductivity  as  compared  to other  solid  electrolyte  materials  such  as  sodium  beta  alumina, cubic  stabilized  zirconium  [1–3].  The  high  value  of  ionic conductivity  of  this  group  of  compounds  is  an  effect  of  both, high  ion  charge  carrier  concentration  and  high  mobility.  The high  concentration  and  high  mobility  of  charge  carriers  of  these solid  electrolytes  are  due  to  the  crystal  structure  of  these compounds.  The  structures  of  these  compounds  consist  of  the two  kinds  of  ions,  one  constituting  the  immobile  space  crystal lattice  and  the  other,  easy  moving  inside  this  lattice  and establishing  the  molten  sub  lattice.  In  general,  NASICON  has three  dimensional  frameworks  for  Na+ migration  [2,4,8].  The mobile  ions  are  generally  small  size  cations,  so  such  type  of conductors  are  called  cation  conductors.  The  basic  structure  of NASICON  material  two  ZrO6 octahedra  are  separated  by  three  (Si,P)O4 tetrahedra  with  which

they  share  corner  oxygen  atoms  and  two  types  of  Na  sites  (Na1 and  Na2).  The  Na1  site  is  located  between  two  octahedra  along the  c  axis  and  other  site  Na2  is  at  midway  of  two  Na1  sites  along the  a  axis  [5,6,9].  The  two  sodium  sites,  Na1  and  Na2,  inside the  channels,  are  connected  through  triangular  bottlenecks  of oxygen  atoms.  The  bottleneck  between  both  sites  for  the rhombohedral  symmetry  is  formed  of  three  oxygen  atoms whose  centres  make  up  an  isosceles  triangle  (Fig.  1).  High  ionic conductivity,  due  to  movement  of  sodium  ions,  depends  upon the  size  of  bottleneck,  activation  energy  required  for  the movement  of  ions  and  lattice  parameters  whose  value  can  be modiﬁed  by  changing  compositions  [10].  The  bottleneck  size  is related  to  the  variation  in  the  lattice  parameters  a  and  c.  By changing  x,  Si  is  partially  substituting  P  which  in  turn  modiﬁes the  orientation  of  the  tetrahedral.  Several  researchers  have studied  relation  between  composition,  structure  and electrical  conductivity  for  different  NASICON  type  materials prepared  by  ceramic  routes  [3,7].  The  conventional  ceramic routes  require  high  sintering  to volatilization  of  Na  and  P  whereas  NASICON  powders prepared  by  sol–gel  method  require  lower  temperature  and the  obtained  materials  are  more  dense  and  homogeneous. Therefore,  in  the  present  work,  we  have  synthesized  nano  grain powders  of  NASICON  (Na1  +  xZr2SixP3     xO12)  compounds  of (x  =  1.0), different  compositions

Na3.05Zr2Si2.05P0.95O12 (x  =  2.05)  and  Na1.1Zr2P2.89Si0.11O12 (x  =  0.1)  prepared  by  sol–gel  method  and  studied  the  effect  of  x on  the  structural  properties,  ac  conductivity  and  Na+ selectivity in  these  hot  pressed  sintered  pellets.

The  powders  of  NASICON  (Na1  +  xZr2SixP3     xO12)  with x  =  0.1,  1.0,  2.05,  were  prepared  using  a  mixed  inorganic– organic  sol–gel  synthesis  which  the  preliminary formation  of  a  xerogel  [11].  A  measured  volume  of  zirconium n-propoxide  solution  (Zr(OC3H2)4)  was  mixed  with  distilled water.  This  solution  was  then  mixed  with  aqueous  solution  of NaOH  and  SiO2 powders  in  appropriate  ratio.  The  solution  was stirred  for  30  min.  The  calculated  amount  of  aqueous NH4H2PO4 was  added  to  previous  solution  and  kept  for precipitation.  The  ﬁnal  precipitate  was  dried  at  150  8C  and  then sintered  at  1000  8C  for  3  h.  The  sintered  powder  was  then pressed  in  the  form  of  pellets  by  applying  11  MPa  pressure.  The pellets  were  again  sintered  at  1000  8C  for  3  h.  In  our  study,  to prepare  NASICON  powder  with  various  compositions  of  x,  the proper  proportion  of  NaOH,  NH4H2PO4 and  SiO2 were  mixed as  needed  in  order  to  achieve  the  proper  ratio  of  Na:Si:P  in NASICON.

The  structural  characterization  of  powders  was  carried  out by  XRD.  The  XRD  patterns  were  recorded  at  room  temperature by  using  Philips  XPERT-PRO  diffractrometer  system  (2u  range was  taken  from  108  to  808)  using  Cu  Ka  radiation  having  a wavelength  of  1.5406  A˚ .  The  elemental  analysis  was  done  by Energy  Dispersive  X-ray  (EDX)  technique.  The  carbon  coated samples  were  used  to  minimise  the  charging  problem  during EDX  analysis.  The  performance  of  NASICON,  sodium  ion based  sensors,  with  different  compositions  of  constituent  was studied  and  compared  using  an  electrochemical  cell  method  in

which  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  were  used.  The  cell  is  represented by Ag=AgCl=½ref  NaCl=NASICON=½?  NaCl=AgCl=Ag

where  [ref]  is  the  concentration  of  the  reference  NaCl  solution, which  was  kept  constant  and  equal  to  0.1  M  and  [?]  stands  for unknown  Na+ concentration  that  was  to  be  measured.  A  schematic  diagram  is  given  in  Fig.  2.  The  Ag/AgCl  electrodes  were made  electrochemically  by  forming  an  AgCl  layer  around  a silver  wire  dipped  in  HCl  liquid  electrolyte.  The  emf  readings, across  electrodes,  were  taken  by  using  solutions  of  different molarities.  The  impedance  spectroscopy  (complex  plane  analysis)  was  used  to  evaluate  the  ac  conductivity.  The  measurements  were  carried  out  at  room  temperature  in  the  frequency range  10  Hz  to  100  kHz  by  using  HIOKI  3522-50  LCR  meter. Silver  electrodes  were  painted  on  both  the  surfaces  of  dense pellets  and  sintered  at  450  8C  for  2  h  to  get  good  electrical contact.

To  measure  ac  conductivity,  impedance  spectroscopy  (LCR meter)  has  been  used.  Silver  electrodes  were  painted  on  both sides  of  the  samples  and  sintered  at  450  8C  for  3  h.  It  has  been ensured  that  area  of  the  electrode  is  the  effective  area  of  sample only  and  hence  reducing  air  capacitance.  Ac  conductivity  is given  by  [13,14] sac ¼  vj0j00 where  v  is  the  angular  frequency,  v  =  2pf,  j0 is  the  permittivity of  the  free  space,  j00 is  the  imaginary  part  of  dielectric  constant as j00 ¼  j00 tan  d

The  elemental  analysis  of  all  the  samples  has  been  carried out  by  EDX  analysis.  The  EDX  spectra  show  the  presence  of Na,  Zr,  Si,  and  P  along  with  O  and  C  as  given  in  Fig.  3.  The XRD  for  NASICON  compounds  with  different compositions  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  Most  of  the  intense  peaks observed  in  the  pattern  well  match  to  the  peaks  in  standard JCPDS  ﬁles  of  NASICON  with  corresponding  compositions. The  average  particle  size  calculated  by  using  Debye–Scherrer formula  has  been  found  to  be  20  nm  in  each  case.  Table  1  shows the  the  NASICON  for different  compositions  (calculated  from  XRD  data  by  using Xpowder  ver.2004.04.70  PRO  software).  As  x  increases  lattice parameters,  a  and  c,  show  increasing  trend.  Since  the  bottleneck size  depends  on  lattice  parameters  and  unit  volume,  therefore, the  maximum  increase  in  the  bottleneck  size  is  for  x  =  2.05  as compared  to  other  compositions.

From  electrochemical  cell  method, 

the  emf  values  for different  NASICON  compositions  have  been  measured.  By changing  the  molarity  of  the  solutions  (M  =  0.1,  0.5,  1.0,  1.5), corresponding  induced  emf  values  have  been  measured  after stabilizing  both  reference  and  the  measured  solutions.  The  emf readings  were  taken  at  least  5  min  after  immersion  of  the  Ag/ AgCl  electrodes  in  the  solutions.  The  emf  values  have  been measured  at  room  temperature  for  NASICON  of  different compositions  and  plotted  against  molarity  of  different  solutions as  shown  in  Fig.  5.  It  has  been  found  that  for  x  =  2.05,  the  emf value  is  higher  than  that  of  other  compositions  when  measured with  solutions  of  different  molarities.  It  means  that  Na+ is  more selective  for  x  =  2.05.  The  Na+ concentration  in  the  unknown solution  can  be  determined  by  using  Nernst  equation  given below.

By  Nernst  equation,  the  emf  of  the  cell  is  given  by

where  R  is  the  gas  constant,  F  is  faraday  constant.  Superscripts ref  and  ?  denote  the  values  [Na+]  (sodium  ion  concentration) and  g  (mean  ionic  activity  coefﬁcient)  at  two  sides  of  the  cell.

By  knowing  the  value  of  emf,  concentration  of  reference solution  and  mean  ionic  activity  coefﬁcient  of  NaCl  [12],  the unknown  Na+ concentration  has  been  calculated  for  all  three compositions.  Table  2  shows  that  the  sodium  ion  concentration is  higher  for  the  sample  having  x  =  2.05  at  room  temperature.

Complex  plane  impedance  analysis  is  a  well-known  and for technique,  which  has long  been  used powerful

investigating  dielectric  and  semiconducting  materials.  To analyze  and  interpret  the  experimental  data,  complex  plane analysis  is  the  representation  of  the  electrical  properties. Fig.  6  shows  the  Nyquist  plot  for  these  three  compounds  at room  temperature  in  the  frequency  range  10  Hz  to  100  kHz. The  semicircles  observed  in  the  graphs  are  not  starting  from the  origin  which  means  that  there  is  a  ﬁnite  resistance  (Rs)  in series  with  parallel  combination  of  Rp and  Cp.  This combination  of  R  and  C  is  the  equivalent  circuit  representation  of  the  sample  (Fig.  7).  The  semicircle  can  be  represented by  a  parallel  RC  element  and  the  equivalent  circuit  consists of  a  series  of  array  of  parallel  RC  elements  attached  with  a series  resistance  with  constant  phase  element.  Series resistance  corresponds  to  grain  resistance  whereas  grain boundary  resistance  is  represented  by  a  resistance  which  is attached  in  parallel  to  a  capacitor.  The  value  of  both  types  of resistances  depends  upon  the  structure  of  the  compounds.  Ac conductivity  for  different  compositions  has  been  calculated with  the  help  of  Eq.  (2.7)  at  10  kHz  and  results  are  given  in Table  3.  The  conductivity  has  been  found  to  be  higher  for  the composition  with  x  =  2.05.

(about  20  nm)  of NASICON  of  different  compositions  have  been  synthesized. Complex  plane  impedance  analysis  reveals  that  ac  conductivity is  higher  for  x  =  2.05  as  compared  to  other  compositions.  Using electrochemical  cell  method,  It  has  been  found  that  the  emf produced  is  higher  for  the  pellet  having  x  =  2.05  as  compared  to other  composition  which  indicate  higher  Na+ selectivity  for  this pellet.  XRD  data  conﬁrms  that  by  increasing  x  up  to  2.05,  there is  an  increase  in  the  values  of  lattice  parameters  and  unit  cell volume  which  modiﬁes  tetrahedral the  a  and  c structures  and  hence  bottleneck  size.  Since  to  be  maximum  for  x  =  2.05, (bottleneck  size)  therefore,  more  conduction  crossectional  area  is  available  for sodium  ion  migration  as  compared  to  other  compositions.
