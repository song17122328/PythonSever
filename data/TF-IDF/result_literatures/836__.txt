In  particular,  the  hybrid  Ca0.  In  particular,  the  hybrid  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3@carbonexhibits remarkable rate performance with a discharge capacity of nearly 45 mA h g-1at a current density of 20 A g-1, which is attributed to the pseudocapacitive effect.

The forced shift of our society towards renewable energy sources, such as wind andsolar, has fueled a global momentum to develop advanced energy storage technologies.

In  spite  of  the  commercial  success  of  Li-ion  batteries  (LIBs)  as  the  leading  storagedevices,  the  increasing  utilization  of  lithium  is  facing  a  possible  penalty  insustainability  due  to  the  limited  availability  of  Li  resources.

In  the  recent  years,Na-ion  batteries  (NIBs)  particularly  those  operating  at  ambient  temperature  areconsidered  as  the  viable  alternatives  for  large-scale  storage  purposes  because  Na  isearth  abundant  and  accessible  across  the  world.1-4  Moreover,  NIBs  share  a  similar“rocking-chair” mechanism with LIBs in addition to a suitable redox potential, whichmeans  the  existing  materials  of  choice  for  LIBs  could  be  implemented  in  NIBsAmong various electrode materials of interest, NASICON structured compoundswith Na+ ion superionic conducting properties are particularly attractive because theirrobust  three-dimensional  frameworks  provide  long-term  structural  stability,  longcycling  life  and  enhanced  safety.

Application  of  these  materials,  however,  aresusceptible  to  problems  such  as  the  insulating  nature,  leading  to  seriously  lowercapacities  than  the  theoretical  value.To  overcome  this  disadvantage,  strategies  thathave  been  deployed  so  far  include  particle  size  reduction  and  compositing  withcarbonaceous  materials.

For  example, NASICON-structured  NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP)  is awidely  studied  negative  electrode  running  at  a  safe  voltage  of  2.

For  example, NASICON-structured  NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP)  is awidely  studied  negative  electrode  running  at  a  safe  voltage  of  2.1  V,  however,  barematerial could  only  deliver  a limited capacity  of  about  90 mA h g-1  and a poor  ratecapability.8 Jiang et al., proposed to coat NTP nanoparticles with double carbon layers,enabling  a  high-rate  performance  at  50  C.9  Other  forms  of  carbons  such  as  porouscarbon,10  CMK-3,11  and  reduced  graphene  oxides12  have  been  also  applied  as  thecompositing agent to enhance the electron/ion transfer, and thus improve the surfacearea  of  electrolyte  to  soak  in  and  buffer  the  volume  fluctuation  during  cyclingMoreover,  pseudocapacitance  is  known  as  an  effective  approach  to  realizehigh-rate  performance  in  both  capacitors  and  batteries.

 Different  from  theabsorption  mechanism  in  electrochemical  double  layer  capacitor,  pseudocapacitivecharge  storage  is  mainly  governed  by  surface  or  near-surface  reversible  redoxreactions,  which  brings  in  better  balanced  power  and  energy  densities.Manytransition  metal  nanoparticles,  such  as  Nb2O5,16  RuO2,17  TiO218and  etc.

The  pseudocapacitive  effect  to  Na-ion  storage  isparticularly noteworthy. 

For instance, Na3(VO0. For instance, Na3(VO0.5)2(PO4)2F2@grahene nanocomposite,which have greatly encouraged the design of high-rate materials with NASICON-typestructure  by  exploiting  intercalation  pseudocacacitance,  exhibits  ultrafast  Na-storageperformance (77 mA h g-1 at 50 C-rate) and long-term cycling stability (73% capacityretention after 1000 cycles).

In  this  work,  we  reported  the  synthesis  of  a  novel  NASICON-structuredcompound  Ca0.19In  this  work,  we  reported  the  synthesis  of  a  novel  NASICON-structuredcompound  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3@carbon  (CTP@C)  and  its  sodium  storage  performancebetween 3.5Ti2(PO4)3@carbon  (CTP@C)  and  its  sodium  storage  performancebetween 3.0 and 0.0 and 0.01 V.Besides the high reversible capacity and good cycle stability,the  nanocomposite  demonstrates  superior  high-rate  capability  with  no  obviouscapacity loss as the current density increased from 6 to 20 A g-1, which is attributableto the dominated pseudocapacitive effect.The strong insight obtained from this studycould  be  beneficial  to  the  design  of  novel  electrode  materials  for  the  rechargeableNIBs in future.

Analyticalpure  CaCO3,  (CH3CH3CHO)4Ti,  NH4H2PO4  were  chosen  as  the  starting  materials,which  were  firstly  dissolved  in  the  deionized  water  according  to  the  stoichiometricratio of 1: 4: 6.Analyticalpure  CaCO3,  (CH3CH3CHO)4Ti,  NH4H2PO4  were  chosen  as  the  starting  materials,which  were  firstly  dissolved  in  the  deionized  water  according  to  the  stoichiometricratio of 1: 4: 6. To prepare the precursor, 0. To prepare the precursor, 0.02 M aqueous citric acid was dropped intothe solution until the ratio of calcium: citric acid equals to 0.02 M aqueous citric acid was dropped intothe solution until the ratio of calcium: citric acid equals to 0.5: 1.5: 1.After evaporated at80  oC,  the  gel  was  obtained  after  being  heated  in  oven  at  120  oC  for  12  h.Finally,CTP@C  nanocomposite  was  acquired  after  two-step  heat  treatments  under  nitrogenatmosphere: at 350oC for 5 h and then 800 oC for 12 h with inter-mediate grinding.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CTP@C nanocomposite was recorded usinga RigaKu D/max-2550 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation.

And Rietveld refinementwas  conducted  to  confirm  the  phase  purity.Its  morphology  was  examined  using  afield  emission  scanning  electron  microscope  (FESEM,  JEOL  JSM-6700F)  andtransmission  electron  microscope  (TEM,  FEI  Tecnai  G2  F20  S-TWIN).

Ramanspectroscopy was employed to examine the degree of graphitization by a Renishaw inVia  Raman  microscope  with  Ar-ion  laser  excitation  (λ=  514.Ramanspectroscopy was employed to examine the degree of graphitization by a Renishaw inVia  Raman  microscope  with  Ar-ion  laser  excitation  (λ=  514.5  nm).

The  content  ofcarbon  was  estimated  using  a  Mettler-Toledo  CHN  analyzer.Nitrogenadsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a MicromeriticsASAP 2010 instrument.Specific surface area calculations were made using theBrunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  method.

The  pore-size  distribution  (PSD)curves  were  calculated  from  the  isotherm  using  the  Barrett-Joyner-HalendaElectrochemical  experiments  were  performed  using  2032-type  coin  cells  withsodium foil as the counter electrode.The electrodes were prepared by coating a slurry,in  which  the  CTP@C  active  materials,  Super  P  conductive  and  polyvinylidenefluoride  (PVDF)  binders  dissolved  in  Nmethylpyrrolidone  (NMP)  were  mixed  in  aweight ratio of 7: 2: 1, on a copper foil current conductor.

These electrode films weredried  in  a  vacuum  oven  at  120  oC  for  10  h.After  dividing  the  electrode  film  intosquare parts of 0.After  dividing  the  electrode  film  intosquare parts of 0.8*0.8*0.8 cm2, coin cells were assembled in a glove box.The separatorsof the cells were glass fiber filter (Whatman GF/C).The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4dissolved in a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1: 1v/v) and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC).Galvanostatic charge–discharge cyclingwas  then  performed  on  a  Land-2001A  (Wuhan,  China)  automatic  battery  tester.

The crystal structure of the as-prepared CTP@C material was studied first by thepowder X-ray diffraction (XRD).As displayed in Figure 1a, all the diffraction peakscould be indexed assuming a rhombohedral symmetry, with space group  ܴ3.As displayed in Figure 1a, all the diffraction peakscould be indexed assuming a rhombohedral symmetry, with space group  ܴ3.Rietveldrefinement  indicates  the  monophasic  nature  with  refined  lattice  parameters,  a(b)  =8.Rietveldrefinement  indicates  the  monophasic  nature  with  refined  lattice  parameters,  a(b)  =8.4868  Å  and  c  =  21.4868  Å  and  c  =  21.9149  Å,  consistent  with  previously  reported  values.

Ascompared with the crystal structure between NTP (Figure 1b) and CTP (Figure 1c),both compounds are constructed by the lantern-like units sequenced along c-axis andeach unit is composed by four [TiO6] octahedra and two [PO4] tetrahedra by sharingcorners. The key difference lies in the crystallographic sites for Na+ ions.NTP hoststwo  such  sites,  while  Ca2+  ions  occupy  3a  site  exclusively  leaving  more  vacant  3bsites.From a structural point of view, CTP is able to accommodate more Na+ ions andtherefore possesses a higher theoretical capacity.

Moreover,  the  compositing  carbon  was  qualitatively  acknowledged  by  theRaman spectrum.As illustrated in Figure 2a, two broad peaks were situated at ~1355and  ~1582  cm-1,  corresponding  to  the  D  and  G  bands  of  carbon,  respectively.Therelative  intensity  ratio  of  ID/IG  was  larger  than  1,  further  confirming  the  amorphousnature of carbon.Besides, a small peak is visible at around 1000 cm-1, which can beassigned to the stretching vibrations of the phosphate (PO4)3-.A quantitative analysisbased  on  CHN  measurements  shows  that  the  amount  of  carbon  is  ca.  7.  7.2%.

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  measurements  (Figure  2b)  reveal  a  surface  area  ofFigure  1.Brunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  measurements  (Figure  2b)  reveal  a  surface  area  ofFigure  1.(a)  Rietveld  refinement  of  CTP@C  based  on  the  powder  XRD;  Theschematic crystal structures of NaTi2(PO4)3 (b) and Ca0.(a)  Rietveld  refinement  of  CTP@C  based  on  the  powder  XRD;  Theschematic crystal structures of NaTi2(PO4)3 (b) and Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (c);Figure  2.5Ti2(PO4)3 (c);Figure  2.(a)  Raman  spectrum  of  the  CTP@C  nanocomposite;  (b)  Nitrogenadsorption-desorption  isotherms  and  pore  distributions  (inset)  of  the  CTP@CThe  morphological  characteristics  of  the  as-prepared  CTP@C  hybrid  wereexamined  by  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM)  and  transmission  electronmicroscopy  (TEM).

As  seen  in  Figure  3a,  CTP@C  exhibits  varied  particle  sizesranging  from  50  to  100  nm  with  agglomeration.The  corresponding  TEM  image(Figure  3b)  shows  that  the  agglomerated  CTP  nanoparticles  are  embedded  in  theamorphous  carbon  matrix.Moreover, a  dense  carbon  layer  about  6  nm  thick can  beobserved on the surface of CTP particles (Figure 3c).Inside of the nanoparticles, theinterplanar spacings of 0.Inside of the nanoparticles, theinterplanar spacings of 0.36 nm and 0.36 nm and 0.44 nm correspond to the (113) and (104) planes,respectively.In addition, elemental mappings (Figure 3d-i) indicate that all elementsare  uniformly  distributed  within  the  composite  material.Therefore,  the  optimalarchitecture  with  carbon  coated  CTP  particles  confined  in  amorphous  carbonframework  could  greatly  accelerate  electron  transport  and  shorten  the  transportpathway  of  sodium  ions,  thus  overcome  the  disadvantage  of  its  low  electronicconductivity and facilitate fast Na+ storage performance.

Morphology  of  the  Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3@carbon  hybrid:  SEM  image  (a);  TEMimage (b); HRTEM image (c); HAADF-TEM images (d) and mapping of Ca (e), TiThe electrochemical properties were examined in a coin-type cell with metallicsodium as the counter electrode.Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles were testedat a current density of 20 mA g-1 between 3.Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles were testedat a current density of 20 mA g-1 between 3.0 and 0.0 and 0.01 V.As shown in Figure 4a, theinitial  discharge  and  charge  capacities  reached  464  and  235  mA  h  g-1,  respectively.

The  Coulombic  efficiency  is  only  51%,  and  this  could  be  attributed  to  thedecomposition  of  electrolyte  forming  a  solid  electrolyte  interface  (SEI)  layer.22,23However,  in  the  subsequent  cycles,  the  Coulombic efficiency  becomes  much  higherand stabilized, maintaining a value above 95%.From the 2nd cycle, both charge anddischarge  curves  exhibit  two  pairs  of  plateaus  at  around  2.From the 2nd cycle, both charge anddischarge  curves  exhibit  two  pairs  of  plateaus  at  around  2.1  V  and  0.1  V  and  0.4  Vcorresponding to the stepwise oxidation from Ti4+ to Ti3+ and Ti3+ to Ti2+, respectively.

These  observations  are  consistent  with  the  previous  studies  on  NTP24,  25  andNa3Ti2(PO4)3.

These  observations  are  consistent  with  the  previous  studies  on  NTP24,  25  andNa3Ti2(PO4)3.

 Importantly, the charge and discharge profiles were analogous to eachother from  the  2nd cycle,  indicative  of  a  reversible Na+  ion  storage  process.Cyclingstability tests demonstrate that the electrode withstands 30 cycles with a high capacityretention of nearly 99% (Figure S1).A stable discharge capacity was acquired as 264mA h g-1, corresponding to nearly 4 Na+ ions insertion/extraction.

This value is higherthan  the  discharge  capacity  of  NTP  (~208  mA  h  g-1)  operated  in  the  same  voltage,8suggesting that nearly one more Na+ ions are inserted into the CTP lattice since morevacancies are available the 3b sites.Furthermore, CTP@C demonstrates better cycleperformance  in  comparison  with  CTP  without  carbon  coating  (Figure  S2)  owing  tothe  improved  electronic  conductivity  after  compositing  with  amorphous  carbon.

As far  as  we  are  concerned,  CTP@C  hybrid  delivers  the  highest  capacity  among  thestate-of-the-art titanium-based negative electrodes for NIBs.27-30Next,  we  measured  the  rate  capabilities  with  the  current  density  ranging  from0.27-30Next,  we  measured  the  rate  capabilities  with  the  current  density  ranging  from0.02 to 2 A g-1.02 to 2 A g-1.The high specific capacity was acquired as 92 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1, asdepicted in  Figure  4b. When the current density returns to 0. When the current density returns to 0.02 A g-1, the dischargecapacity  recovers  to  236  mA  h  g-1,  demonstrating  an  excellent  rate  capability,  alsosuperior  to  that  of  pure  CTP  (Figure  S3).The  voltage-capacity  profiles  at  variouscurrent rates were also recorded in Figure S4 with reasonable increased polarization.

Note that the two working plateaus (2.Note that the two working plateaus (2.1 and 0.1 and 0.4 V) are gradually weakened as the raterises,  possibly  due  to  the  pseudocapactance  contribution.

To  further  reinforce  thisphenomenon, the tested current densities were extended.As shown in Figure 4c, thedischarge  capacity  remained  stable  at  about  50  mA  h  g-1  as  the  current  densitiesincreased from 6 to 20 A g-1, indicative of the significant pseudocapacitive effect.

Toexclude  the  contribution  of  amorphous  carbon  on  the  rate  performance,  itscharge-discharge  profiles,  cycle  performance  and  rate  capability  were  recorded  andpresented in  Figure  S5 to  S7, respectively.At the low current density of 20 mA g-1,amorphous carbon contributed about 10 mA h g-1 to the total reversible capacity (264mA  h  g-1),  because  it  accounts  only  7.

At the low current density of 20 mA g-1,amorphous carbon contributed about 10 mA h g-1 to the total reversible capacity (264mA  h  g-1),  because  it  accounts  only  7.2%  by  weight.When  the  current  density  wasincreased  to  2  A  g-1,  the  electrode  can  hardly  show  reversibility.Thus,  it  could  beconcluded that the superior rate performance of CTP@C hybrid electrode is a result ofthe pseudocapacitive effect of CTP other than the amorphous carbon.Moreover, thelong-term cycle stability was recorded at a current density of 2 A g-1, as displayed inFigure  4d.After  1000  cycles,  a  high  discharge  capacity  of  94  mA  h  g-1  can  beretained  with  capacity  retention  of  75.

After  1000  cycles,  a  high  discharge  capacity  of  94  mA  h  g-1  can  beretained  with  capacity  retention  of  75.7%.To  explain  the  possible  reason  for  theremarkable  cycle  stability,  XRD  pattern  and  SEM  image  of  the  working  electrodeafter  1000  cycles  was  recorded as  shown in  Figure  S8 and  Figure  S9, respectively.

Compared  to  the  pristine  electrode,  there  are  no  obvious  changes  in  the  diffractionpeaks, indicative of an excellent reversibility of the NASICON-type structure.Besides,the  working  electrode  after  1000  cycles  shows  agglomerated  particles  with  the  sizeranging from 50 to 100 nm, similar with its morphology before cycling.In terms ofthe  excellent  rate  capability  and  long-term  cycle  stability,  the  CTP@C  hybridelectrode demonstrated great potential as the negative electrode for high-rate NIBs.

 There are two couples of redox peaks located at around 2. There are two couples of redox peaks located at around 2.1 and 0.1 and 0.4 V, inagreement  with  the  two  working  plateaus  in  the  voltage-capacity  curves.Generally,the storage charge involves two important components: faradic contribution includingdiffusion-controlled reaction and pseudocapacitance, and non-faradaic contribution ofdouble layer capacitance.

According to Dunn and co-workers, the measured current (i)and the scanning rate (v) obey the following equation:31where a and b are variable positive numbers.And the  b-value can be determined bythe  slope  of  the  log(v)-log(i)  plots.  If  the  b-value  is  0.  If  the  b-value  is  0.5,  it  means  an  idealdiffusion-controlled behavior.Otherwise, it represents a capacitive process for a valueof 1.

Otherwise, it represents a capacitive process for a valueof 1.0.0.As in  Figure  5b, the b-values for the four strong peaks are much larger than0.As in  Figure  5b, the b-values for the four strong peaks are much larger than0.5, suggesting a strong contribution from the capacitive effect.Quantitatively, thesetwo components can be discriminated by evaluating the current response (i) at a fixedpotential (V) via the equation:where  k1v  and  k2v1/2  originates  from  the  capacitive  and  diffusion-controlled  effect,respectively.The value of k1(V) and k2(V) can be determined from the slope and they-axis  intercept  point  for  i(V)/v1/2  as  a  linear  function  of  v1/2,  respectively,  at  eachfixed potential.

Figure S10 shows the typical voltage profile for the capacitive current(shaded  region)  in  comparison  with  the  total  current  of  CTP@C  electrode  at  a  scanrate of 0.Figure S10 shows the typical voltage profile for the capacitive current(shaded  region)  in  comparison  with  the  total  current  of  CTP@C  electrode  at  a  scanrate of 0.1 mV s-1, as an example, of which the capacitive contribution is ca. 79. 79.4%.

The  normalized  results  (Figure  5c)  indicated  that  the  capacitance  effect  played  agrowing role as the increasing in the scanning rate, and finally reached a high value of~99% at 1 mV s-1.

The  normalized  results  (Figure  5c)  indicated  that  the  capacitance  effect  played  agrowing role as the increasing in the scanning rate, and finally reached a high value of~99% at 1 mV s-1.

Moreover, the specific capacitance was evaluated to be 942~1198µF  cm-2  (or  453~578  F  g-1),  much  larger  than  the  typical  double-layer  capacitance(10-50  µF  cm-2),31  suggesting  the  capacitive  current  was  dominated  by  thepseudocapative  effect.It  is  well  known  that  amorphous  carbon  can  also  deliverspecific capacitance of 100~150 F g-1.It  is  well  known  that  amorphous  carbon  can  also  deliverspecific capacitance of 100~150 F g-1. 32,33 Owing to the low carbon content of ca. 7. 7.2wt% in CTP@C, the contribution to the capacitance from carbon is estimated as 7~11F  g-1.2wt% in CTP@C, the contribution to the capacitance from carbon is estimated as 7~11F  g-1.

These  values  are  much  lower  than  that  of  CTP@C  nanocomposite,  alsoconfirming the pseudocapacitive effect of CTP@C hybri.
