Solid solutions of double orthophosphates of zirconium and rare earth lanthanum and ytterbium (La0.33Zr2(PO4)3–Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3) that belong to the NASICON (NZP) structural type are synthesized and studied by IR spectroscopy. The factor-group analysis of P–O vibrations in phosphates with 3P (La0.33Zr2(PO4)3) and 3P c (Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3) space groups allows us to assign the intermediate representatives of this series to two different space groups by their IR spectra, which is difficult to perform based on powder X-ray diffraction results. A morphotropic transition 3P  3P  is found to occur near the La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 composition.

Orthophosphates of zirconium and lanthanides with a general formula of R0.33Zr2(PO4)3 belong to the family of mixed-framework compounds with the NASICON NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) structure [1]. They are of interest because they possess a complex of functional characteristics that include high thermal, chemical and radiation stability, ionic conductivity [2-6], low coefficients of thermal expansion [7, 8], and luminescent properties [7, 9-11]. The structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 ( 3R c space group, Z = 6) [1] represents a framework of vertex-sharing ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The base of the mixed framework is the [Zr2(PO4)3]㼿 fragment formed by two ZrO6 octahedra linked by three bridging PO4 tetrahedra (Fig. 1). These structure-forming fragments make columns extended along the 3 axis. The 㼿1 (6b) sites with a distorted octahedral coordination are located in the columns between Zr octahedra. In orthophosphates of zirconium and alkaline elements (MIZr2(PO4)3), these sites are fully occupied by the alkali atoms. In phosphates of zirconium and alkaline earth elements II 0.5(M Zr2(PO4)3), they are orderly occupied, by layers. Hence, the space group reduces to 3R ; alkaline earth atoms fill 3b sites (0 0 1/2); 3a sites (0 0 0) remain vacant [12]. Phosphates of zirconium and lanthanides (R0.33Zr2(PO4)3) were identified by powder X-ray diffraction in the 3R space group [3]. However, the IR spectra of these compounds were different from the spectra of II 0.5M Zr2(PO4)3 phases with the 3R space group in a substantially larger number of bands, especially in the region of stretching vibrations. Based on the factorgroup analysis carried out for the vibrations of a complex [PO4]3– ion in R0.33Zr2(PO4)3 compounds, the space group of these phosphates was assumed to be 3P c [13]. Rietveld refinement of the structures of rare earth phases (R = Ce, Eu, Yb) performed later confirmed this assumption [14]. Lanthanide atoms are ordered in 2b (0 0 0) sites; R-translation disappears (Fig. 1a). The IR spectrum of La0.33Zr2(PO4)3 was distinguished by much lower definition of bands as compared to the spectra of other rare earth phosphates [13]. Its structure was solved in the 3P space group [15]. Lanthanum atoms completely occupy 1a (0 0 0) sites, 0.82 La atoms occupy 1b (0 0 1/2) sites, and the rest 0.18 partially occupy 2d sites (1/3 2/3 0.667) (Fig. 1b). The ionic conductivity is known to increase in some solid solutions of NZP-phases [16-18]. In the work, we synthesized a series of LaxYb0.33–xZr2(PO4)3 phosphates with different La/Yb ratios (x = 0, 1/18, 1/9, 1/6, 2/9, 5/18, 1/3) and studied them by IR spectroscopy to determine the solid solution composition, at which a morphotropic transition occurs that can induce an increase in the ionic conductivity. It seems hardly possible to do this using powder X-ray diffraction because of the extreme similarity of the structures. IR spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the short-range order in the structure, helps to solve this problem despite the similarity of spectral patterns of the compounds in question.

The precipitation method was used for the synthesis. Phosphoric acid solution was added to the solutions of metal salts followed by heat treatment at 80㼿C, 600㼿C, and 800㼿㼿 respectively. Each heat treatment lasted for 24 h and was alternated with thorough intermediate grinding in an agate mortar. The obtained compounds represented fine white or slightly colored powders. The absorption spectra of samples prepared as finely dispersed films on the KBr substrate were measured on an IR Fourier FSP-1201 spectrometer in a frequency range of 1800 cm–1 to 400 cm–1.

In the IR spectrum of the isolated [㼿㼿4]3– ion with regular tetrahedral symmetry Td the occurrence of four bands is possible: fully symmetric vibration A1 (㼿1 stretching symmetric vibration of the P–O bond), degenerate vibration E (㼿2 bending stretching vibration of P–O), and two triply degenerate vibrations F2 (㼿3 stretching asymmetric and 㼿4 bending asymmetric vibrations of P–O). Out of them only vibrations F2 (㼿3 and㼿4) are active in the IR region. Using a partition method for the complex ion vibrations in the crystal to divide them into internal and external ones, we performed a factorgroup analysis of the vibrations of the orthophosphate ion in compounds with 3P and 3P c space groups. In the structure of La0.33Zr2(PO4)3 with the 3P space group (C3i factor-group), phosphorus atoms occupy three independent sites 18f with C1 symmetry (1); in the structure of Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 with the 3P c space group (D3d factor-group), these are two sites 6f with C2 symmetry and 12g with C1 symmetry. Here the 㼿1 (A) vibration becomes active and degeneration of 㼿2 (2㼿),㼿3, and 㼿4 (3A or A + 2B for C1 and C2 respectively) vibrations completely disappears. Table 1 presents the transition from site symmetry group representations to the factor-group representations of C3i ( 3 )P and D3d ( 3 )P c space groups of the crystals. In centrosymmetric crystals, the alternative prohibition on the internal vibrations of a complex ion is preserved: the vibrations symmetric with respect to the center of inversion (g-vibrations) are active in the Raman spectra and inactive in the IR spectra. Fully-symmetric vibrations 㼿1 are also prohibited. Thus, the factor-group analysis predicts the appearance of 6 bands of 㼿1 (3Au + 3Eu), 12 bands of 㼿2 (6Au + 6Eu), 18 bands of 㼿3 and 㼿4 (9Au + 9Eu) vibrations in the IR spectra of La0.33Zr2(PO4)3 (3 P sites with C1 symmetry). In the IR spectrum of Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 (one P site with 㼿1 symmetry and one with C2 symmetry), the selection rules allow 4 bands of 㼿1 (A2u + 3Eu), 8 bands of 㼿2 (2A2u + 6Eu), 14 bands of 㼿3 and 㼿4 (5A2u + 9Eu) vibrations.

Fig. 2 displays the IR spectra of solid solutions in the La0.33Zr2(PO4)3–Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 system; Table 2 summarizes the vibrational frequencies of 3 4PO㼿 ions in these phases. Bands in the region of 1280 cm–1 to 1020 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching 㼿symmetric vibrations 㼿3, and bands in the region of 980 cm–1 to 915 cm–1 correspond to the stretching symmetric vibrations 㼿1 of the 3 4PO㼿 ion. The position of a low intensity high frequency band of 㼿3 vibrations at 1250 cm–1 or the 1270 cm–1 shoulder, non characteristic of phosphates, is explained by analogy with other NZP-phases [19] by a contribution to the P–O vibration from a part of the electron density of a small and highly charged zirconium cation that polarizes the P–O bond. The 645 cm–1-430 cm–1 IR region of the spectrum belongs to the bending vibrations of the 3 4PO㼿 ion: 640 cm–1550 cm–1 bands correspond to 㼿symmetric㼿4, and the band at 㼿440 cm–1 corresponds to symmetric 㼿2 vibrations. In the spectrum of the Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 compound with the 3P c space group, the bands are somewhat better resolved as compared to the spectrum of La0.33Zr2(PO4)3. In the spectrum of Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 ( 3P c space group) in the region of stretching vibrations, a splitting of the band at 㼿1100 cm–1 is observed along with the presence of a shoulder at 1075 cm–1 and a narrow intense 916 cm–1 band of 㼿1 vibrations; a high frequency band is observed at 1250 cm–1 (Fig. 2, 1). In the spectrum of La0.33Zr2(PO4)3 with the 3P space group, this spectral region is characterized by the absence of shoulders and splitting of the bands of 㼿3 vibrations. At the same time, a new 1150 cm–1 band appears in the spectrum (Fig. 2, 4). The 1026 cm–1 band of㼿3 vibrations shifts to high frequencies and transforms into a shoulder at 1037 cm–1. The 1250 cm–1 band disappears, but a 1276 cm–1 shoulder arises. In the region of stretching symmetric vibrations (㼿1), significant differences are observed: the main band of vibrations shifts by 20 cm–1 to high frequencies (916 cm–1㼿936 cm–1). It also becomes more diffuse and splits into two maxima: 947 cm–1 and 936 cm–1. Some differences can be also seen in the region of bending vibrations: a 㼿550 cm–1 shoulder corresponding to 㼿4 vibrations disappears. Thus, the spectra of these similar structures, in which a large number of overlapping bands is observed, demonstrate apparent differences. Referring to the IR spectra of phosphates with intermediate compositions, it is possible to note that the spectrum of La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 phosphate is similar to the spectrum of Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3: band splitting of 㼿3 vibrations is less pronounced than in the spectrum of Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3; the 1240 cm–1 shoulder is present; the positions of 㼿1 and 㼿4 vibrational bands are 917 cm–1 and 548 cm–1 respectively (Fig. 2, 2). The IR spectra of other solid solutions are almost identical to the spectrum of the lanthanum sample (Fig. 2, 3). Based on the analysis of the presented IR spectra, we assumed the phosphate of the La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 composition to be characterized by the 3P c space group and the other phases with intermediate compositions to belong to the 3P space group. Thus, in the La0.33Zr2(PO4)3–Yb0.33Zr2(PO4)3 system most of the intermediate phases crystallize in the 3P space group, characteristic of the last lanthanide member in this series. The 3P 㼿 3P c morphotropic transition occurs near the La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 composition. At present, we are studying the ionic conductivity in the phosphates of this series. It is possible to expect the maximum value of the ionic conductivity to be observed near the La1/18Yb5/18Zr2(PO4)3 composition, the morphotropic transition point.
