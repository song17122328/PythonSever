An all-solid-state silver battery made from a single material is reported. NASICON-type Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 functioned as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. High rate capability at 298 K and low temperature operation (233 K) were possible due to its high electrical conductivity and low interfacial resistance with the concept of a single-phase battery. The redox reactions of Ag/Ag+ (anode) and Cr3+/Cr4+ (cathode) were confirmed from X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The operating voltage of the battery in this study was higher than that for a silver battery using an AgI solid electrolyte because of the high redox potential of the cathode and the wider potential window of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 than that of AgI. Therefore, Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3-based single-phase battery is a promising new concept to obtain a high voltage silver-ion battery, high-rate capability and low temperature operation.

All-solid-state batteries are attracting much interest because of their high safety and energy density. In particular, lithium-ion batteries have been the main target for a solid-state cell because of their high voltage and capacity. Many solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity have been investigated, including LiSICON,1 NASICON,2,3 perovskite,4 garnet,5 and sulfide-based materials.6 However, a large interfacial resistance is observed between the electrolyte and electrode in all-solid-state batteries.7-9 Oxide-based materials exhibit particularly large interfacial resistance because of side reactions after high temperature sintering to achieve a suitable contact between the electrolyte and electrode. Therefore, the interfacial structure is very important in addition to the ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte to be released from the limited rate capability of the battery. A battery made from a single material is one of the best choices because side reactions do not occur during preparation. Han et al. demonstrated a proof-of-concept for a single-material battery using Li10GeP2S12 as the electrolyte, anode, and cathode to eliminate interfacial resistance between the electrodes and electrolyte.10 The NASICON (Na Super Ionic CONductor)-type materials are well-known as promising candidates for electrolyte and electrode.11-14 We have recently reported NASICON-type single-phase all-solid-state batteries that are made from a single material using Na3V2-xZrx(PO4)3,15 Li3V2-xAlx(PO4)3,16 and Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3.17 In the single-phase battery, a single material can function as the anode, cathode, and electrolyte. One of the most important advantages of a single-phase battery is low interfacial resistance because of the ideal interface achieved between the electrolyte and electrode. Therefore, a single-phase battery is a promising new concept to achieve high-rate, oxide-based all-solid-state batteries. Among the single-phase batteries, Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 exhibited superior rate capability because of the high electrical conductivity and low interfacial resistance. Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 showed an electrical (mainly ionic) conductivity of 2×10−4 S cm−1 at 298 K, and functioned well as a battery based on the redox reactions of Ti4+/Ti3+ (anode) and Cr3+/Cr4+ (cathode).17 However, among all of the ionic conductors, the highest ionic conductivity is observed in the silver-ion conductor, AgI.18,19 Therefore, an all-solid-state silver battery is also a candidate battery for high rate capability. Although silver is an expensive material, silver oxide batteries have been widely used for clock, hearing aid and camera because of its excellent characteristics. Therefore, high performance all-solid-state silver batteries will be applied for that kind of small-sized devices. However, the most serious issue with the silver battery is the narrow potential window of the solid electrolyte. AgI typically decomposes at 0.7 V; therefore, the active material is thermodynamically limited and the maximum cell voltage must be lower than 0.7 V when AgI (and or related materials) are used as a solid electrolyte.20-24 Other types of silver battery materials with a wide potential window are necessary to construct a high voltage cell. Some of the NASICON-type silver-ion conductors exhibit high silver-ion conductivity25-28 and are expected to exhibit even wider potential windows than AgI. Herein, we report a single-phase all-solid-state silver battery using Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 as the cathode, anode, and electrolyte.

From the reported values, the cathode potential of Cr3+/Cr4+ in Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 is 4.75 V vs. Li/Li+. Therefore, it is roughly assumed that the cathode potential of Cr3+/Cr4+ in Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 is ca. 0.91 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Figure 1 (b) shows an SEM image of the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 pellet, in which some pores are evident. The measured porosity based on the Archimedes principle was 93%, which is not so high when compared with a typical solid electrolyte. Figure 2 (a) shows impedance plots for the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell obtained at 298 K. The inset shows the entire plots obtained between 100 kHz and 10 Hz. The observed impedance plots appeared to be typical for a solid electrolyte attached with blocking electrodes. Figure 2 (b) shows the electrical conductivity of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 sintered at 1373 K in air. The measured conductivity at 298 K was 5×10−5 S cm−1, which is lower than the electrical conductivity of Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3, a lithium-ion conductor used for a single-phase battery.13 However, the conductivity is similar to that eported for NASICON-type silver ionic conductors.24 The electrical conductivity of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 was measured between 423 K and 233 K. At the very low temperature of 233 K, the conductivity was still 2×10−6 S cm−1. The activation energy of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 was 0.29 eV, which is slightly higher than that of Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 (0.25 eV). Figure 3 (a) shows the cyclic voltammogram for the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 with the scan rate of 3 mVs−1. Because this material can be symmetrical electrodes, we operated with the voltage range between −2 V and +2 V. The peak charge current was observed at 1.5 V and the peak discharge current was observed at 0.7 V. In the opposite operation (between 0 V and −2 V), larger peak current was observed. This may be due to the improved contact between electrolyte region and electrode region. Figure 3 (b) shows the charge-discharge profiles for the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 with 0.1 mA cm−2 at 298 K. Even though the current density was high, the cell was operated successfully. In this measurement, we terminated charge at 10 μAh. By considering the weight of a pellet, its capacity is calculated to be 0.06 mAh/g(cell). This value will be improved by using thin film cell. Figure 3 (c) shows the cycling properties of the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 cell with 0.1 mA cm−2 at 298 K. The cell showed stable operation for 50 cycles. The operating voltage of the cell was ca. 0.9 V. The anode potential was limited by the high oxidation potential of silver, so the cell voltage was not so high. However, this is much higher than other reported solid-state silver batteries; the super ionic conductor AgI has a narrow potential window. Therefore, the cathode potential in a silver battery is limited by the potential window of the electrolyte. To confirm the effect of the solid electrolyte, the electrochemical performance of another cell using AgI as a solid electrolyte was measured at 433 K (Figure 3 (d)). The all-solid-state cell with AgI as the solid electrolyte (Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 based composite anode/AgI solid electrolyte/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 based composite cathode) did not operate because AgI was decomposed at 0.7 V. This clearly shows that the single-phase cell using Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 has a wider potential window than AgI, which results in a higher operating voltage. Silver-ion conductors generally exhibit the highest ionic conductivities among all of the ionic conductor, including lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and fluoride-ion conductors. However, one of the most serious issues in the silver-ion battery is the very low cell voltage. Therefore, Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 is a promising material to obtain a high voltage silver-ion battery. Figure 4 (a) shows charge-discharge profiles for the single-phase all-solid-state cell using Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 at 233 K. Although the current density was decreased to 1.5 μA cm−2 because of the decreased electrical conductivity, a reasonable charge-discharge profile was obtained and the operating voltage was around 0.9 V. Figure 4 (b) shows the cycling properties of the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 cell at 233 K and 1.5 μA cm−2. The discharge capacity was gradually increased and the cell operated for 50 cycles. To confirm the mechanism for the redox reaction at the anode, SEM-EDX was performed after charging. For clear observation, the cell was charged for 120 μAh prior to measurement. Figure 5 (a) shows EDX mapping results for the cross section of the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell (around anode) after charging for 120 μAh with 0.1 mA cm−2 and 298 K. A large amount of silver was clearly observed on the surface of the anode. Figure 5 (b) shows XRD patterns of the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell observed from the anode surface, before and after charging for 120 μAh. Metallic silver was clearly formed on the anode. Table S1 shows the atomic percentage at the surface of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 before and after charging for 120 μAh. A large amount of silver was confirmed in the anode, and a small amount of silver was confirmed at the cathode. Therefore, it is clearly observed that silver-ions were conducted during the charging process. Figure S1 shows an SEM image and EDX mapping results for the anode surface of the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell after charging for 120 μAh. All of the anode surface was not covered with silver. Figure S2 shows an expanded SEM image and EDX mapping results for anode surface after charging for 120 μAh, where curly silver particles with diameters of a few micrometers were formed. The deposited silver pushed away the Pt current collector. This would cause the insufficient contact. Figure S3 shows the SEM image and EDX mapping results for a cross section of the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell (anode side) after the second charge (The total charge capacity is 20 μAh). On the surface of the anode side, deposited silvers were isolated. This was much different from the deposited silver layer of Figure 5 (a) with the deep charging state (120 μAh). The isolated silver makes insufficient contact and resistance of the cell. This may be one of the reasons for the low columbic efficiency in the first several cycles. Figure S4 shows the SEM image and EDX mapping results for a cross section of the Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell (cathode side) after charging for 120 μAh. The distribution of the Ag is not so different from other elements. However, this result is much different from the case of anode side (Figure 5 (a)). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to examine the oxidation states of chromium in the charged state. Figure 6 shows XPS spectra for the cathode side of the Pt/Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell before and after charging for 120 μAh. After charge, the peak value of Cr 2p3/2 was shifted to higher energy at the cathode, which indicates that the oxidation state of chromium was increased. The observed spectra was consistent with the reported binding energy (Cr 2p3/2 for Cr3+ and Cr4+ are 577.6 eV and 579.2 eV, respectively).29 This result suggests that the cathode reaction in Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 is the oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr4+. A single-phase battery conducts not only ion but also electron.17 In order to evaluate self-discharge characteristic of the Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3, open-circuit voltage (OCV) of Pt/Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3/Pt cell was measured after the initial charge for 10 μAh at 0.1 mAcm−2 and 298 K (Figure S5). The cell voltage was maintained at over 0.8 V for approximately 2 h. Therefore, the self-discharge rate for this cell was not so fast. However, it is faster than the case of the Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3.17

In summary, a single-phase all-solid-state silver battery was developed using NASICON-type Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3. The material exhibited high electrical conductivity and functioned well as a cathode and anode, based on the redox activity of Cr3+/Cr4+ and Ag+/Ag, respectively. As with the Li1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3-based lithium-ion battery, high rate capability (0.1 mA cm−2 at 298 K) and with a silver battery using AgI as a solid electrolyte, a higher cell voltage was observed because of the high redox potential of the cathode and the wider potential window of Ag1.5Cr0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3.
