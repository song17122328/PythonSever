High-resolution powder neutron diffraction data (HRPD, ISIS Facility, U.K.) were collected on (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 between 4 and 300 K. In the range 175-180 K, a ferroelastic first-order phase transition from the rhombohedral R3hc NASICON structure to a monoclinic distorted one was discovered. Rietveld structure refinements were performed at 300 K (a ) 8.74848(3), c ) 23.7598(1) Å) and 4.5 K (space group C2/c or Cc, a ) 15.0663(1), b ) 8.7878(1), c ) 9.3611(1) Å,  226) ) 122.498(1) 176) ). At RT, the hydronium ion H3O+ is pyramidal disordered over two inversion-related configurations. At LT, H3O+ becomes nearly planar, with two H atoms ordered and hydrogen-bonded to neighboring oxygens, and the third H atom disordered over two close positions with 2/3 and 1/3 statistical occupancies. Relations with the structural features of hydronium in other structures and the nature of order-disorder are discussed. An atomistic mechanism for proton conductivity is proposed.
NASICON-type compounds are important materials for solidstate ionic conductivity; they can show a quite variable chemical composition summarized as AxM2(XO4)3, where X (P, S, and Si) has tetrahedral oxygen coordination, M is a (mostly transition) metal atom octahedrally coordinated, and A is usually a monovalent cation.1 The NASICON structure, rhombohedral R3hc, can be derived from that of corundum Al2O3 by substitution of aluminum by M and of oxygen by tetrahedral groups XO4.2 A three-dimensional network of coordination MO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra sharing corners ensues. Large cavities are present around Wyckoff positions 6(b) at 0,0,0 with site symmetry 3h (M¢ sites), which correspond to the empty octahedral sites in the hexagonal Al layers of corundum, and which are occupied by A+ cations in NASICON phases. 
When A is an alkali atom, a large ionic conductivity is very often observed; this has been ascribed to the presence of a number of sites suitable for hosting A+ cations along the pathway connecting adjacent M¢ cavities: cf. the cases of LiZr2(PO4)3 above 50  176) C and Na3Zr2(SiO4)2PO4 above 170  176) C;2-4 at RT, such compounds are stable in triclinic C1h and monoclinic C2/c modifications, respectively.
The H-substituted NASICON was synthesized,5 and it was given the formula (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 on the basis of a powder neutron diffraction study at 15 K which showed the presence of a hydronium ion H3O+ on the M¢ site, with each of the three H atoms disordered over two centrosymmetrical positions.6 An appreciable protonic conductivity was measured,5,7 raising a number of questions about the detailed mechanisms of proton mobility in hydronium ion compounds. In particular, the claimed extensive disorder of H atoms at 15 K appeared somehow puzzling, and let us suspect that some kind of order-disorder phase transition should occur, perhaps at even lower temperature. The hypothesis of a transformation related to an umbrellalike inversion of the H3O+ pyramid, similarly to NH3, seemed to be particularly interesting. We therefore decided to undertake a very careful, high-resolution powder neutron diffraction study of (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 at variable temperature down to 4 K, to clarify such open questions.
(H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 was prepared by ion exchange of LiZr2(PO4)3 in 8 N solution of HCl at 80  176) C for 4 days. The lithium compound had been synthesized by solid-state reaction of Li2CO3, ZrO2, and NH4H2PO4 at 1200  176) C.8,9 X-ray diffractometry (Cu KR radiation) proved the ion exchange reaction to be complete, with no residual presence of the lithium phase, and confirmed the pattern indexing according to the rhombohedral space group R3hc.
Neutron diffraction data were collected on the time-of-flight high-resolution powder diffractometer (HRPD) at the ISIS spallation pulsed source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (U.K.). The 2 cm3 sample was contained in a vanadium can sealed with indium at room pressure, to prevent a possible dehydration under vacuum. Measurements were carried out below room temperature in a liquid He cryostat, and at 300 K without cryostat. All intensity profiles were recorded in the dhkl range 0.69-2.4 Å (4226 data) by use of the backscattering counter bank at 2ı)168.3 176) , with maximum resolution of ¢d/d  25) 4  2) 10-4. Accurate data for structure refinement (12 h) were collected at 300 and 4.5 K (Figure 1); at intermediate temperatures, shorter times (2 h) were used. Rietveld refinements were carried out by the GSAS computer package.10 
The RT structure (R phase) was Rietveld-refined on the basis of the R3hc ideal NASICON configuration, with the OW oxygen atom of hydronium on the 3h site at 0,0,0 and H in general position with a fractional occupancy of 1/2, according to the structural model proposed by Rudolf et al.6 and shown in Figure 3. Convergence was attained, with isotropic thermal factors, at Rp ) 0.0240, wRp ) 0.0276 and R(/F/2) ) 0.0855 (Table 1). A peculiar feature of the results is the high Uiso value of OW, indicating either a real large thermal motion of the whole hydronium ion inside the M¢ cavity of the NASICON framework or possibly the preference of OW for a position slightly displaced from the 3-fold axis with a locally lowered symmetry. To detect the largest components of the OW atomic displacement, the structure was refined with anisotropic thermal factors for all atoms but H, yielding U11 ) U22 ) 7.6(2) and U33 ) 3.9(3) 10-2 Å2; thus, a preferential displacement of OW within the (001) plane is observed. 
An isotropic refinement was then attempted with OW slightly off the 3h site and fractional occupancy 1/6. Convergence was obtained with a marginal improvement of the above R indexes, and with a shift of 0.31 Å of OW from the high symmetry site, which is hardly larger than the square root of U11; Uiso(OW) lowered to 3.0(8) 10-2 Å2. 
A difference Fourier map revealed immediately the hydronium oxygen atom OW disordered over two centrosymmetrical positions close to the inversion center at 1/4 1/4 0 and the H1 and H2 hydrogen atoms bonded to OW and hydrogen-bonded to the O4 and O5 oxygen atoms of neighboring phosphate groups. Then, after least-squares refinement, a subsequent difference map showed two further negative peaks close to OW, which could be interpreted as alternative positions of the third missing hydrogen atom. Thus, two further H atoms were included in the refinement, with their o.f.’s constrained to sum to 0.5. The occupancies and thermal factors of H3 and H3¢ were refined alternatively till convergence: the H3 position turned out to be definitely more populated than the other one, with a ratio 2:1. As the distances of H3 and H3¢ to OW were slightly short (about 0.90 Å), a soft constraint was introduced in the refinement, corresponding to a O-H distance of 0.96 Å. 
The final isotropic cycle converged to Rp ) 0.0130, wRp ) 0.0156, and R(/F/2) ) 0.0580, and the refined parameters are reported in Table 1.
The disorder of the whole hydronium ion over two close centrosymmetrically related sites in the C2/c structure of (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 raises some problems. Clearly, at 4.5 K, a static rather than dynamical character of the disorder is more likely. Therefore, the C2/c structural model implies a domain structure with the hydronium ion locally ordered in one of two equivalent positions slightly off the center of symmetry at 1/4 1/4 0. Each one of the two configurations corresponds to either enantiomorph of a noncentrosymmetrical structural model whose space group must be a subgroup of C2/c. Out of the three possibilities Cc, C2, and C1, the complex triclinic case C1 was excluded. 
In Table 2, the P-O and Zr-O interatomic distances are reported for the two polymorphs of (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3. A slight increase of distortion of both the PO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra is observed in the LT R¢ ¢ with respect to the RT R phase.
Hydrogenated NASICON (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3, a material of interest for solid-state proton conductivity, has been studied by high-resolution powder neutron diffraction from room-temperature down to 4.5 K. A rhombohedral-to-monoclinic structural transition has been discovered at about 177 K, at variance with previous literature results. This transition corresponds to an ordering of the hydronium ion H3O+ and to a change of its configuration from pyramidal to flat. One of the three H atoms is statistically distributed over two sites, probably linked by a proton tunneling dynamics, in the low-temperature phase. The hydrogen bonding system of H3O+ should be the basis for a plausible Grotthus-type mechanism of proton mobility in the crystal, with an intermediate step involving a thermally activated proton hopping between O atoms of the same PO4 tetrahedron.
This quite flat geometry of the hydronium ion is consistent with an sp2-type hybridization of the OW orbitals and should be compared to other results obtained by neutron diffraction on H3O+-containing crystals. Two recent ND studies on deuterated zeolites (HSAPO-3413 and zeolite X14) will be considered in this respect. In the first one, O-D distances are 0.91, 0.95, and 1.14 Å and D-O-D angles 99, 127, and 130 176) . The second D3O+ ion is constrained by 3-fold axis symmetry, similarly to what happens in (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 at room temperature; O-D is 1.13 Å, and D-O-D is 88 176) . Such configurations resemble closely those found in the LT and RT structures of (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3, respectively. It seems therefore to be confirmed that the hydronium ion has two possible configurations: the first is flat, nearly planar, and is typical of ions unconstrained by symmetry; the second one approaches a pyramid with right angles and is observed for ions lying on a 3-fold symmetry axis. 
As a most important consequence, the possible umbrella-like inversion of the pyramidal hydronium ion is clearly supported. Indeed a flat configuration of H3O+, which would be the nonequilibrium intermediate stage of the process, appears to be stable by itself in definite crystal-chemical environments, so that the activation barrier for inversion could be moderate and the process be favored.
The traditional classification of H+ transport mechanisms in solid-state proton conductors is based on the four models of classical hopping by thermal activation, quantum-mechanical tunneling, hydrogen bonding (Grotthustype), and vehicular diffusion.15,16 In the present case of (H3O)Zr2(PO4)3 NASICON, taking also into account the results of this structural study, the last mechanism can be surely discarded. A vehicular mobility involves the diffusion-like transport of a whole H2O or H3O+ unit, which usually occurs where large channels or wide interlayer regions are present in the structure, and this is not the case for NASICON.
