Abstract: Symmetric sodium ion batteries possess the promising features such as low cost, easy-manufacturing process, and facile recycling post-process, which are suitable for the application of large-scale stationary energy storage. Herein, we proposed a symmetric sodium ion battery based on dual-electron reactions of NASICON structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 material. The Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode can deliver a stable capacity up to 160 mAh g-1 with the Coulombic efficiency of 97 % at 0.1 C by utilizing the redox reactions of Ti3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+. It is the first time to investigate the symmetric sodium-ion full-cell using Na3MnTi(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode in the organic electrolyte, demonstrating the excellent reversibility and cycling performance with the voltage plateaus about 1.4 V and 1.9 V. The full-cell exhibits a reversible capacity of 75 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and an energy density of 52 Wh kg-1. In addition, both ex-situ XRD analysis and the first-principle calculations are employed to investigate the sodiation mechanism and structural evolution. The current research provides a feasible strategy for the symmetric sodium-ion batteries to achieve high energy density.
With the consumption of oil and natural gas, the energy conversion from renewable energies of wind, solar, geothermal, etc. into that we used for the utilization are critical due to the characteristics of clean and pollution-free.1-4 Except for energy conversion, the storage will be the other challenge. Considerable efforts have been devoting to develop the energy storage devices, such as the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).5-8 Nowadays, the LIBs are the most popular technology for energy storage and commercialized widely in various portable electronic devices, electric vehicles etc.9-14 However, LIBs are undergoing the shortage of deficient lithium resources, causing a high cost. The sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) will be the emerging candidate as the substitution of LIBs owing to sufficient raw resources, safety and low cost.1519 Recently, NASICON (Na super ionic conductor) structure materials are the hot research topic owing to the stable host structure, plenty of sodium-insertion interstices and fast Na+ ion diffusion. The NASICON-structured polyanionic phosphates with a formula of AxMM’(PO4)3 (A= Li, Na, K, etc.; M, M’= transition metal element) possess a robust three-dimensional framework of MO6 and M’O6 octahedral corner-sharing with PO4 tetrahedra, which delivers excellent cyclability.20-25 Furthermore, the strong inductive effect of the phosphates endows the multi-electron redox reaction and higher operating potential versus Na+/Na, compared with those of layered oxides.26-27 Na3V2(PO4)3 is a typical NASICON-structured polyanionic phosphates and demonstrates two voltage plateaus at 1.6 V and 3.3 V vs. Na+/Na, which corresponds to the redox pairs of V2+/3+ and V3+/4+, respectively, resulting in the dual-electron transfer.28-29 So far, other kinds of phosphates have been synthesized via cation substitution partially or fully to develop more than two-electron redox reactions and excellent sodium storage performance, including Na2VTi(PO4)3, Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3, Na3MnTi(PO4)3, Na3FeV(PO4)3 and Na2CrTi(PO4)3.26, 30-33
To date, the design of symmetric SIBs with the same electrode materials is progressively attractive when compared with that of asymmetric batteries, owing to less influence of matching design between cathode and anode materials, easy-manufacturing process, facile recycling post-process, and low manufacturing cost.34-37 In addition, the symmetric SIBs based on the same intercalation-type compound are able to lower the bulk expansion of electrode materials during Na+ insertion/extraction because one electrode shrinkages while the other electrode may expand, and vice versa.38 At present, limited by the energy density, symmetric SIBs could be applied in storage power station, low-end electronic consumption and low-speed electric vehicle field. NASICON-structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has been reported recently and its electrochemical performance is once studied in the aqueous system.36 However, the operating voltage is limited owing to the potential window of water splitting with merely one Na+ per formula extraction/insertion.39 Up till now, the symmetric sodium ion battery in organic electrolyte with dual-electron transfer hasn’t be reported yet.
 In this work, Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode, prepared by a typical sol-gel method, delivers a reversible capacity of 160 mAh g-1 with coulombic efficiency of 97% under the voltage window from 1.5 V to 4.5 V vs. Na+/Na at 0.1 C. It is the first time to utilize the distinct of redox couples of Ti3+/4+ and Mn3+/4+ to investigate the dual-electron reactions of the symmetric sodium-ion full-cell using Na3MnTi(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode. The symmetric full-cell demonstrates excellent reversibility and cycling performance, and exhibits the reversible capacity of 75 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C with the energy density of 52 Wh kg-1 and 60.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C. Moreover, theoretical investigation can be used to predict the voltage plateaus theoretically and estimate the configuration for Na+ site candidate under different occupation rates. Both ex-situ XRD analysis and the first-principle calculations are applied for studying the sodiation mechanism and structural evolution, indicating solid solution and two-phase reactions during Na+ extraction/insertion. The proposed strategy is feasible for developing the symmetric SIBs with high energy density.
The carbon coated Na3MnTi(PO4)3 was prepared by a sol-gel method. 3 mmol NaC2H3O2, 1 mmol MnC4H6O44H2O, 3 mmol NH4H2PO4 and 3 mmol C6H8O7H2O were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water to get Solution A. 1 mmol titanium isopropoxide (C12H28O4Ti, Aladdin, 99.9%) was dissolved in 20 mL absolute ethanol to obtain the transparent Solution B. Solution B was added into Solution A dropwise. The final solution was sealed and stirred in a water bath at 80 ℃ for 2 h, and then uncovered until the moisture is completely evaporated to give a lightyellow precursor. The precursor was further kept in an oven and successively grounded into powder. Finally, the precursor was sintered at 650 ℃ for 12 h under agron atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 ℃·min-1 to obtain the Na3MnTi(PO4)3 nanocomposite. The molar ratio of citric acid and transition metal (Ti and Mn) equaled to 3:2, and the citric acid was used as both chelating agent and carbon source.
 The crystal structure of c was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Bruker D8 Advance with Cu/Kα radiation, λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA). Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was employed to confirm the carbon content of materials. Raman measurements (RM) were performed on LabRAM HR Evolution with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. The morphology and elements distribution were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta 250 FEG). Energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) of a selected area was tested to analyze the chemical composition. The images of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) were obtained using JEM-2100HR. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out by Solartron analytical 1470E workstation. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) was performed under different charged/discharged states in the frequency range from 1 mHz to 100 kHz.
To study the electrochemical performances of the as-prepared Na3MnTi(PO4)3, coin-type half cells were assembled with sodium foil in a glove box filled with argon (H2O < 0.5 ppm, O2 < 0.5 ppm). Na3MnTi(PO4)3 active materials, super P conductive and polyvinylidene fluoride binders with a weight ratio of 7:2:1 were dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to obtain homogeneous slurries. The slurries were coated on an aluminium foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 120℃ overnight to remove the solvent. The electrode film was then cut into a 12 mm-diameter disk. The electrode loading mass was in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 mg cm-2. Glass fibre (Whatman GF/C) was used as the separator. 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in a solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 v/v) with 5 vol% addition of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance was tested on a Land battery analyzer within the cut-voltage range of 1.5-4.3 V (vs. Na/Na+). Specially, without pre-treatment processes, the symmetric battery with the same cathode and anode materials was directly assembled with the pristine Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode. The battery was cathode limited and the capacity balance was controlled with the cathode/anode mass ratio of 1/1.25 (The charge specific capacity of the cathode was around 100 mA g-1 and the discharge specific capacity of the anode was around 80 mA g-1. Herein, the ratio of 100/80 was 1.25/1). The opencell voltage of symmetric full cell was approximately 0 V. 1 C corresponds to 117 mA g-1.
 The atomic structure for the supercell of NaxMnTi(PO4)3 is shown in Fig. 1a. The PO4 tetrahedron and MnO6 (and TiO6) octahedron share the oxygen atom at the corner. All the possible sites are fully occupied for Na ions. To distinguish the sites of atoms, five groups are classified as colored in Fig. 1b, depending on the symmetry and thermal stability of sodium ions. The calculation results were qualitatively displayed in Table SI.40-43 Site-I is the most favorable location to occupy and site-V is the worst stable. During the insertion/extraction process, Na ions at site-I will be immobilized to maintain the framework stability due to the most favorable energy, and Na ions at site-II, site-III, site-IV and site-V are able to be inserted/extracted for electrochemical energy storage.44 In our experiments, the occupation of site-V is not considered due to the worst priority in the investigation.
In the discharging process from Na1MnTi(PO4)3 to Na4MnTi(PO4)3, three voltage plateaus are displayed at 4.0 V, 3.5 V and 2.1 V vs. Na+/Na. Starting from the configuration Na1MnTi(PO4)3 (x = 1), the occupation will follow the theoretical order, i.e. site-II, site-III and then site-IV in sequence. Three ideal plateaus can be obtained as shown the black dotted line (Cal.-I) in Fig. 1c. When the current group is fully occupied, Na ions will go to the next group.
However, there are still partially deviations on voltage plateaus and their width between the calculation and experimental results as shown the blue solid line (Exp.). The main reasons can be given as follows: (1) The calculated group of sites is not fully occupied at voltage plateaus in practical experiments. When Na ions start to occupy a new site with different on-site energy, the voltage will shift to the next plateau like the plateau c-d for site-III and the plateau e-f for site-IV. (2) In the practical discharge process, the voltage moves from one plateau to another one gradually, i.e. the ranges of b-c and d-e. It is contrary to the ideal calculated case in which the voltage jumps from one plateau to another discontinuously. With the intermedia region, Na ions would occupy sites with different on-site energies, while the experimental values are the dynamic average of them.
To further analyze the voltage evolution, the experimental value of x for each plateau is selected for re-simulation. The updated result, see the red dotted line (Cal.-II), fit better the trend of experimental results. It is worth to point out that the calculated voltage value strongly depends on the value of x and the corresponding configurations. At this stage, it is relatively easy to estimate the configurations at two ends such as Points a, b, e and f. Nevertheless, the calculated voltage of c’-d’ plateau is still far below from the experimental one, which requires substantial detailed study to give the accurate atomic structures of Point c and d. Theoretical studies do not only predict the voltage plateaus, but also provide valuable clues to qualitatively understand the mechanism of charge/discharge process in NaxMnTi(PO4)3.
The crystal structure analysis and characterizations of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 are demonstrated in Fig. 2. Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows the successful preparation of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 by a facile sol-gel method in Fig. 2a. The pattern can be indexed to rhombohedral structure with lattice parameters of a = 8.73352 Å and c = 21.84703 Å and a reliable result of R = 4.32%, exhibiting little discrepancy to that of Na3V2(PO4)3.45 Na3MnTi(PO4)3 possesses a typical rhombohedral NASICON-type structure with space group R-3c.46 The detailed structural information including lattice parameters and site occupancy factor is listed in Table S2 (Supporting Information). The carbon amount of 11.59 % is confirmed by the TG analysis (Fig. 2b). A slight increase in weight around 500°C is attributed to the oxidation of low-valence-state metal species during the combustion of carbon. Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 2c) is utilized to qualitatively study the degree of graphitization in Na3MnTi(PO4)3. The G-band and D-band of carbon materials are located at 1594.7 cm-1 and 1348.3 cm-1, respectively. The ratio of IG/ID = 1.14 (the intensity ratio of 2394/2090) indicates the existence of amorphous carbon in the pristine Na3MnTi(PO4)3.26, 46
The morphology of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is obtained by SEM as shown in Fig. 2d. Na3MnTi(PO4)3 has a wide range of particle size from few nanometers to micrometer. The matching of different particle sizes is beneficial to the physical contact between particles, resulting in high density. TEM analysis is conducted to further confirm the composition of the amorphous carbon and Na3MnTi(PO4)3. As shown in Fig. 2e, Na3MnTi(PO4)3 particles are embedded in an amorphous carbon matrix. The high-resolution HRTEM (Fig. 2f) manifests that the surface of well-crystallized Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is coated by a thin layer of uniform amorphous carbon with ~3 nm thickness from the pyrolysis of critic acid. The observed lattice fringe of 0.442 nm is consistent with the interplanar spacing plane (104). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) in Fig. 2g is employed to further explore the structure of Na3MnTi(PO4)3, which exhibits (024), (104) and (300) planes for the rhombohedral structure. These agree with XRD results. Element mapping in Fig. 2h and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) in Fig. 2i of selected area are tested to analyze the chemical composition. The homogeneous element distribution of Na, Mn, Ti, P and O can be observed as displayed. Based on the EDS results, no other elements are detected and the atomic ratio of Na: Mn: Ti is equal to 3.5: 1.06: 1. The amorphous carbon layer on surface of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 particles will promote the electron transfer owing to the low electrical conductivity of NASICON-structured phosphates.23, 31, 47
The electrochemical performance of as-prepared Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is evaluated by assembling CR2032-type half-cell with sodium counter. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests are carried out to investigate the redox activities of Na3MnTi(PO4)3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the initial three CV cycles are recorded with scan rate of 0.1 mV s-1 between 4.3 and 1.5 V. Three pairs of redox couples are located at around 2.04/2.22 V, 3.46/3.66 V, and 3.99/4.10 V, respectively, which also correspond a three-step transition of the Na+ extraction/insertion due to the redox reactions of Ti3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) is tested to understand the difference in different voltage condition. As represented in Fig. S1 and Table S3 (Supporting Information), according to the equivalent circuit, the charge transfer resistances (Rct) do not change a lot at different charged/discharged states, which can attribute to the physical properties of carbon-coated NASICON-structure, particularly the better conductivity. The evolution processes are further analyzed in detail using ex-situ XRD with different charge/discharge states between 4.3 V and 1.5 V, as shown in Fig. S2 (Supporting Information). The whole Na+ extraction or insertion process refers to two-phase evolution and solid solution reactions (single-phase evolution).46, 48 As depicted in Fig. 3b, in the first charge process, two plateaus are displayed, corresponding to dual-electron reactions. This low capacity may be attributed to the high initial open-circuit voltage up to 2.6-2.8 V. Afterwards, in the following charge cycles, three charge voltage plateaus are located at 2.1 V, 3.5 V, and 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na, which are consistent with three oxidation couples of Ti3+ to Ti4+, Mn2+ to Mn3+ and Mn3+ to Mn4+, respectively. Na3MnTi(PO4)3 delivers an initial charge specific capacity of 137.2 mAh g-1, and the initial discharge specific capacity is 170.3 mAh g-1. In the subsequent cycles, a stable discharge specific capacity of 160 mAh g-1 can be obtained with a coulombic efficiency (CE) of 97 %, indicating the superior reversible stability. The results are consistent well with the voltage plateaus in Fig. 3a. The rate capability in Fig. 3c demonstrates the reversible capacities of 169.4, 135.4, 115.7, 104.7, 95.3, and 86.0 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 to 5 C, respectively. The corresponding charge and discharge profiles are shown in Fig. S3 (Supporting Information), and all curves exhibit three voltage plateaus. Both the highest voltage plateau and capacity decay with the rate increases, possibly resulting from the polarization. When the rate returns to 0.1 C, the discharge capacity of 138.5 mAh g-1 is obtained with capacity retention of 82% and ~100 % CE, indicating the excellent rate capability. Longterm stability is demonstrated in Fig. 3d. The discharge capacity of 107.9 mAh g-1 is delivered at 5 C with capacity retention of 76.2% after 360 cycles. Fig. S4 (Supporting Information) displays the corresponding charge and discharge profiles at different cycles.
To get insight into the kinetic behaviors, CV tests with different scanning rates from 0.1 to 0.5 mV s-1 are conducted, as shown in Fig. 3e. The peak current rises with the increasing scan rate, in which the linear relationship between the peak currents (Ip) and the square root of the scanning rate (v1/2) is plotted to estimate the diffusion coefficient in Fig. 3f using the following equation:
where , n, A, and v are the peak current, the number of exchanged electrons per formula Ip CNa during the reactions, the effective reaction area (1.13 ), Na+ concentration in the electrode cm2 and scan rate, respectively. During the anodic scan, values for peak 1, peak 2 and peak DNa + 3 are 3.86 10-11 cm2 s-1, 3.14 10-11 cm2 s-1, 7.66 10-11 cm2 s-1, respectively. During  cathodic scan, values for peak 4, peak 5 and peak 6 are 1.00×10-11 cm2 s-1, 1.59×10-11 cm2 s-1, 2.44×10-10 cm2 s-1, respectively. Peak 3 and peak 6 show the largest values in × DNa + anodic and cathodic scans, indicating that the structural evolution of Na2MnTi(PO4)3 ↔ Na1MnTi(PO4)3 is the most favorable with the fastest ions diffusion when compared with other two evolution processes. The results agree well with the Na+ insertion/extraction energy results in DFT calculation, which indicates that the site-I and site-II are the most favorable sites for sodium ions to diffuse, relating to the configuration Na1MnTi(PO4)3 and Na2MnTi(PO4)3 (Table S1, Supporting Information).
Sodium-ion storage can be defined as two processes: diffusion reactions of Faradic contribution and redox process of pseudocapacitance. The effect of the pseudocapacitance for the battery reaction system can be explored by the following equations:
where a, b are adjustable parameters, is the peak current and v is the scan rate. For a Ip pesudocapacitance-controlled process, the b-value is close to or above 1, while for the electrochemical diffusion-dominated process, the b-value is around 0.5. In Fig. S5 (Supporting Information), all b-values are above 0.5, indicating the coexistent behaviors of diffusion and pesudocapacitance within the Na3MnTi(PO4)3 electrode. It should be noted that the pseudocapacitance reaction is conducive to the rate capability and cycling performance.
The charge/discharge voltage plots and voltage matchup of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 half-cell within different voltage regions are shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b. The Ti3+/4+ redox pair at 2.1 V and Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+ pairs at 3.5 V and 4.0 V indicate that Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is able to serve as both anode and cathode materials. For cathode part, it exhibits the extraction/ insertion of two Na+ (A ↔ B = Na3MnTi(PO4)3 ↔ Na1MnTi(PO4)3), and delivers an initial charge capacity of 125.6 mAh g-1 with a stable charge capacity of about 100 mAh g-1. As for anode part, it relates to the reversible one Na+ insertion into Na3MnTi(PO4)3, leading to the phase of Na4MnTi(PO4)3 (C) at 2.1 V with an initial discharge capacity of 87.4 mAh g-1 and a stable discharge capacity of about 80 mAh g-1.
Benefiting from the potential difference between Mn3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Ti3+/4+ redox pairs, a symmetric battery based on the dual-electron reactions is constructed with Na3MnTi(PO4)3║ NaClO4 (1 M) ║Na3MnTi(PO4)3. The schematic illustration of symmetric SIBs is demonstrated in Fig. 4a. There is no pre-treatment for both cathode and anode electrodes during the fabrication of symmetric battery. Fig. 4b illustrates the respective reactions and evolution of cathode (A ↔ B) and an anode (A ↔ C) during the charge/discharge process. Herein, the reactions of cathode and anode during charging ↔ discharging process can be identified as follows:
 Cyclic voltammogram curves (Fig. 4e) exhibit two pairs obvious redox peaks at ~1.4 and ~1.9 V, confirming the dual-electron redox reactions for the Na3MnTi(PO4)3 symmetric battery, which are consistent with the voltage gaps in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b. The low voltage plateau is derived from the voltage gap of 2.1 V (Ti3+/4+) and 3.5 V (Mn2+/3+), and the high voltage plateau of ~1.9 V is dominantly originated from the contribution of 2.1 V (Ti3+/4+) and Mn3+/4+ (4.0 V), which is relatively high when compared to the reported values in various types of symmetric batteries with the NASCION-structured material (Table S4, Supporting Information). The first two charge-discharge profiles and the corresponding cycling performance at 1 C are illustrated in Fig. 4f, Fig. 4g and Fig. S6 (Supporting Information), which deliver an initial are in discharge capacity of 60.4 mAh g-1 and a capacity retention of 54.5% after 100 cycles. The cycling stability at 1 C are not very satisfied, which is mainly attributed to the polarization and slight low Columbic efficiency. The capacity-voltage profiles of Na3MnTi(PO4)3 symmetric battery at 0.1 C are shown in Fig. S7 (Supporting Information). The initial charge and discharge capacities are 116.3 mAh g-1 and 72.9 mAh g-1, respectively. The energy density is 52 Wh kg-1. Except the first cycle, the subsequence neighbor cycles can be overlapped well, indicating the excellent reversibility. Fig. S8 (Supporting Information) demonstrates the charge/discharge curves at different rates. The discharge capacities of 76.1, 67.0, 58.9, 51.7, 44.4 and 34.5 mAh g-1 can be obtained of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 C, respectively. The promising performance is mainly attributed to the symmetric nature, abating the volume expansion of electrodes during the sodiation/desodiation process. Besides, the characters of fast electron and ionic conductivity of carbon-coated NASICON-structured materials strongly generate a positive impact on sodium storage performance. Furthermore, based on the transition metal multi-valence status, the NASICON-structured symmetric batteries with higher energy density could be achieved by matching higher and lower transition metal redox couples.
 A NASICON-structured Na3MnTi(PO4)3 is prepared through a facile sol-gel method and displays a stable capacity of 160 mAh g-1 with a coulombic efficiency of 97% at 0.1 C. The three voltage plateaus of 2.1 V, 3.5 V, 4.0 V vs. Na+/Na correspond to the redox pairs of Ti3+/4+, Mn2+/3+ and Mn3+/4+, respectively. By utilizing the voltage difference between three redox pairs, the current symmetric sodium-ion full-cell with Na3MnTi(PO4)3 as both cathode and anode achieves the dual-electron reactions and the high operating voltage, leading in a high energy density. It exhibits a stable discharge capacity of about 75 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 60.4 mAh g-1 at 1 C, indicating the good reversibility and cycling performance. The operating voltage of 1.9 V and an improved energy density of 52 Wh kg-1 are obtained. Moreover, the cooperation between experimental and DFT investigations do not only provide better understanding on the sodiation mechanism, but also show the potential pathway of designing the voltage plateaus by tuning the occupation of carriers. Our research highlights the prospect of NASICON-structured symmetric batteries based on multi-electron reactions to improve sodium storage performance for high energy density.
