Samples of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound with pure NASICON-phase were prepared by  sol  gel  method  and  characterized  by  X-ray  diffraction,  Fourier  transform  infrared  analysis,  differential  scanning  calorimetry,  scanning  electron  microscopy,  energy  dispersive  X-ray,  impedance  spectroscopy,  magnesium  transference  number  measurement  and  linear  sweep  voltammetry  technique.  The  compound  consisted  of  the  monoclinic  crystalline  phase  with  a  space group of P21/n (Z = 4). The sample sintered at 750oC showed the highest total conductivity  of 1.0 × 10-6 S cm-1 at ambient temperature and 7.1 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 500 oC. Ionic transference  number  corresponding  to  Mg2+  ion  transport  determined  by  means  of  Bruce  and  Vincent  technique  was  found  to  be  0.69.  Linear  sweep  voltammetry  result  showed  that  the  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound was electrochemically stable up to 2.50 V versus Mg/Mg2+ electrode.  These results indicated suitability o  f the compound to be used for development of solid state electrolytes for magnesium batteries.

Extensive  research  on  secondary  batteries  has  been  undertaken  in  order  to  improve  their  electrochemical performance, especially for lithium ion battery.  Researchers found that allsolid-state lithium ion batteries have several advantages; high cell voltage, high power, high  energy density and long cycle life [1,2]. However, the main disadvantage of Li-ion batteries  is that they require careful attention in aspect of safety.  Overcharging, overheating or shortcircuiting may result in fire or explosion [3,4].  Therefore, it is urgent to find new types of  batteries  with  greater  safety  and  lower  cost  to  meet  the  demand  of  gradually  expanding  market.  

Magnesium batteries have been considered as one such potential alternative to lithium  batteries.  In fact, magnesium is in the diagonal position of lithium in the periodic table of the  elements. As such, it has similar physical and chemical properties as lithium.  It is a low cost,  light  and  abundant  element,  environmentally  benign  and  relatively  easy  to  handle  [5].   Electrochemically, magnesium has a high theoretical specific charge capacity (2205 A h kg-1)  and high theoretical energy density (3.8 A h cm-3) making it possible candidate for battery  application [6].  

NASICON (Natrium Super Ionic Conductor) compound is one of potential candidates  to  be  used  for  development  of  solid  electrolytes  in  magnesium  batteries.  This  is  because  NASICON structure has large enough interstitial void to uptake guest species, high structural  stability based on 3D framework and is a promising host for Mg2+ transport. The capability of  charge carrier transport in the compound is the main criteria to be an electrolyte in the battery  systems.  NASICON  structure  was  discovered  in  1976  by  Hong  and  Goodenough  [7].  The  crystal structure of NASICON is based on the covalent skeleton [Zr2(PO4)3]constituted of  ZrO6  octahedra  which  share  all  their  corners  with  PO4  polyhedra  to  form  3-dimension  network structure, space group R3c [8,9]. There are two types of cation sites, M1 and M2, in  the  structure.  The  size  of  conduction  channels  (bottlenecks)  in  the  structure,  where  conducting cations move from one site to another, depends on the nature of skeleton ions and  the  carrier  concentration  at  both  types  of  sites  (M1  and  M2)  [8,9].  Padma  Kumar  and  Yashonath (2001) have improvised the NASICON-type structure by introduction of lithium  analogous NASICON with general formula LiZr2P3O12 [10].  However, the conductivity of  this system was lower than the former since the NASICON skeleton was too large for the Li+  to migrate.  The suitable tunnel size for Li+ migration is expected to be obtained by reducing  the lattice size of the NASICON type structure by substitution of Zr4+ (0.79 Å) using smaller ion.  The size of  migration  channels in LiM2(PO4)3, M = Ti4+, Hf4+, Sn4+, Ge4+ have been  reported to be more suitable for the lithium ion migration.  The highest conductivity at room  temperature was observed for the Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 compound with a value of 3 × 10-3 S  cm-1.  The substitution of Ti4+ with Al3+ cations reduced unit cell structure of the NASICON  and consequently enhanced the ionic conductivity.  However, this NASICON-type material is  unstable with Li metal due to facile Ti4+ reduction [11]. 

The modification of the NASICON structure was continued by the replacement of Li+  with Mg2+ ion. The replacement of Li+ ions with Mg2+ ions process has been reported to be  successful  since  the  ion  radius  different  between    Li+  (0.69  Å)  and    Mg2+  ion  (0.65  Å)  is  below 15%, which does not exceed the solubility limit for atomic radii differences in solid  solution [12]. The Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 compound synthesized by sol-gel method has been studied  as cathode materials for magnesium cells [13].  However, study of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 for use as  ceramic electrolytes has never been reported in the literature.  

In  this  study,  a  simple  sol  gel  method  was  employed  to  synthesize  NASICON  structured  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3.  The  compound  was  characterized  for  possible  development  of  ceramic  electrolytes  in  magnesium  batteries.  The  structural,  thermal,  electrical  and  electrochemical  properties  of  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  were  investigated  using  x-ray  diffraction  (XRD), different scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), differential  scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray  (EDX),  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS),  magnesium  transference  number  measurement  and  linear sweep voltammetry (LSV).     2.0    2.1    For  sample  preparation,  magnesium  acetate  tetrahydrate  ((CH3COO)2Mg·4H2O),  zirconium  (IV) acetate hydroxide (C6H10O7Zr) and ammonium phosphate monobasic (NH4H2PO4 ) were  used as the starting materials. The molar ratio of Mg:Zr:P was fixed according stoichiometric  ratio 0.5:2:3. Magnesium acetate and ammonium phosphate were first dissolved in deionized  water and then mixed under magnetic stirring. The solution was continuously stirred until a  homogeneous solution was obtained. C6H10O7Zr, which was earlier dissolved in nitric acid,  was  added  to  this  homogeneous  solution.  After  stirring  for  one  hour  the  solution  was  vaporized for about 4 hours under magnetic stirring at 75 oC. The resulting wet gel was dried in an oven at 150 oC for 24 hours to give a powder phase. The obtained powder was heated at  400  oC for 4 hours to remove ammonium and acetate groups and later sintered at different  temperatures (700 oC, 750 oC, 800 oC, 850 oC) for 3 hours.     2.2    XRD  patterns  of  the  powder  samples  were  recorded  using  X-ray  Diffraction  spectrometer  (PANalytical-X’pert3) with Cu-K D radiation of wavelength of 1.5406 Å in 2T range from 10  to 70o at the rate of 0.016o in step width. The patterns were analyzed using High score plus  software. FTIR was carried out to confirm the structure of the studied ceramic samples. FTIR  spectra were recorded at room temperature using a Perkin Elmer Frontier Spectrometer with  resolution 2 cm-1. Thermal behavior of the precursor and sintered samples was analyzed by  differential  scanning  calorimmetry  using  Setaram  Evo  Labsys  thermal  analyser  in  argon  atmosphere at a constant heating rate 10 K min-1 in the temperature range from 25 to 1400 oC.  The morphology of the sample powders were analyzed by SEM and EDX which were carried  out using Zeiss Evo MA10 scanning electron microscope attached with Oxford Aztec X-Act  EDX spectrometer. The particle size information was obtained using FRITCH-Analysette 22  NanoTec  laser  particle  sizer.  The  conductivities  were  determined  by  ac  impedance  spectroscopy using Solatron 1260 impedance analyzer over a frequency range from 1 to 106  Hz with applied voltage of 200 mV. All measurements were done in temperature range 25500 oC. 

Magnesium  transference  number  measurement  was  done  using  Bruce  and  Vincent  method  in  order  to  determine  the  actual  type  of  charge  carriers.  This  method  requires  characterization of cell before and after polarization (after reaching the steady state) by using  combination of EIS and DC polarization technique. For this measurement, the sample was  sandwiched  between  magnesium  metal  electrodes  which  were  used  as  non-blocking  2+)  electrodes that only allow Mg2+ ions to transfer. The magnesium transference number (ĲMg was calculated using the equation [12,14-15].

In this equation, Io is initial current (t = 0), Iss is the steady state current, Ro and Rss are  the  initial  resistances  of  the  passive  layer  before  polarization  and  resistance  of  the  passive layer after polarization respectively, and  ' V is the applied voltage bias ( ' V = 0.22 V). The  electrochemical stability was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry using Wonatech ZIVE  MP2 multichannel electrochemical workstation.               3.0   Result and Discussion       3.1    Coupled DSC-TGA was carried out in order to determine suitable calcination temperature of  the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 precursor. This enables the authors to optimize the calcination’s condition  of the compound. DSC and TGA curves for the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 precursor are shown in Figure  1(a). From the figure, it is noticed that there are three main weight losses in the TGA curve.  The  first  loss  is  between  70  oC  and  120  oC,  with  a  total  weight  loss  of  3.4  %,  due  to  the  evaporation of water. This is supported by the DSC curve which shows an endothermic peak  in this temperature range. The second weight loss is of about 11.1 % in the range from 210 to  292 oC which is attributed to the decomposition of ammonium and acetate groups [13]. This  phenomenon  is  confirmed  by  the  disappearance  of  sharp  exothermic  curve  at  temperature  range between 200 oC to 300 oC in the DSC curve for sample heated at 400 oC illustrated in  Fig. 1(b). 

The third weight loss is of about 4.6 % in the temperature range from 294 to 650 oC.  This loss is attributed of the chemical reaction during the formation of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3. This  is  supported  by  the  DSC  curve  which  shows  a  weak  and  broad  exothermic  peak  in  this  temperature  range.  The  plateau  at  temperature  range  650  to  1000  oC  suggests  that  all  chemical reactions in the sample have completed.     3.2    Presented in Fig. 2 are X-ray diffractograms of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 precursor samples sintered at  different temperatures. As can be observed in the figure, sintering of sample at 600 oC did not  successfully  produce  pure  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  due  to  incomplete  chemical  reaction  which  is  in  agreement with the result in Fig. 1(a). However, the diffractograms for the samples sintered  at 700, 750 and 800 oC show peaks attributed only to Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 [16]. This demonstrates  that pure Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 has been obtained. Higher sintering temperature of 850 oC resulted in  the  diffraction  peaks  at  2   =  26.50o  and  37.83o  suggesting  the  existence  of  ZrP2O7  impurity. 

All  pure  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  peaks  are  sharp  and  well  defined,  indicating  that  the  compound  is  generally  well  crystallized.  The  pure  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compound  produced  is  found to be single phase in nature, crystallizing in monoclinic structure with a space group of:  P21/n (Z = 4). The lattice constants are a = 12.427 Å, b = 8.945 Å, c = 8.8405 Å and ȕ =  90.47o. Those values are consistent with those reported in [16].    3.3    FTIR spectra for pure Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 samples sintered at temperature 700, 750 and 800 oC in  the spectral region from 550 to 1400 cmí1 are depicted in Fig. 3. The three different sintering  temperatures did  not produce any  considerable change in  transmission peak  positions. The  vibrational  and  stretching  modes  are  the  same  in  all  samples.  The  bands  associated  with  3 anions  are  found  to  be  active  in  this  compound.  The  vibrational  or  stretching  of  PO4 absorption bands in the region of 1280–1020 cm-1 are assigned to the asymmetric stretching  vibrations and bands in the region of 980–915 cm-1 correspond to the symmetric stretching  3ions. Stretching vibration of P-O-P can be seen in the region 700-758  vibrations of the PO4 cm-1. Meanwhile, bands in the 670–550 cm-1 range are assigned to the bending vibrations of  the ion [17-22]. 

In the present study, all the characteristic bands for PO4 vibration are in agreement  with those observed for Li-based NASICON (Li(Zr,Ti)2(PO4)3). This indicates that the anion  ring has not been distorted upon switching Li+ with Mg2+ in the NASICON structure.    3.4    The cross-sectional SEM micrographs of pure Mg0.5Zr2 (PO4)3 pellets sintered at temperatures  of 700, 750 and 800  oC are displayed in Fig. 4. The pellet sintered at 800  oC showed good  grain contact. This can be correlated to the result of particle size analyses, Fig. 5. From the  results, it can be inferred that the formation of good grain contact in the pellet sintered at 800  oC is due to the presence of small sized particles which can form contacts easily. The average  particle size of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 sintered at 700 and 750 oC are 120 and 92.5 μm, respectively.  Meanwhile, the average particle size decreases in the sample sintered at 800 oC at 89.1 μm. 

The  EDX  analyses  of  the  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  samples  sintered  at  different  sintering  temperatures are shown in Fig. 6. All samples showed the presence of Mg, Zr, P, and O2.  From  the  atomic  percentage  data  in  Fig.  6,  the  atomic  ratios  of  all  samples  have  been  calculated and listed in Table 1. The chemical compositions of the prepared samples are very  close to the designed compositions confirming the formation of Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compounds. 


Fig. 7 depicts the DSC curve of the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound heated from 30 to 1400 oC and  cooled back to 800 oC.  There are two dominant peaks in the DSC curve during the process.  The first endothermic peak at temperature of 1165 oC represents the melting temperature of  the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound. The second sharp exothermic peak during the cooling process  observed at temperature of 1101 oC is due to crystallization process of the melted compound  confirming that the melting temperature is 1165  oC. It is also clearly seen that there are no  phase transitions occurred in the compound up to 850 oC.    3.6    The  D.C.  conductivity  of  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compound  has  been  determined  form  the  total  conductivity, (ʍt) (bulk conductivity, ʍb + grain boundary conductivity, ıgb) calculated from  equation [15]. In this equation, d is the sample thickness, A is the cross-sectional area of sample, Rb is the bulk resistance and Rgb is the grain boundary resistance.  The Cole-Cole plots of the pure sample at room temperature and 500 oC are shown in Fig. 8.  The  figure  shows  that  when  temperature  increases,  the  total  resistance  (Rt)  shifts  towards  lower  value  indicating  increase  in  conductivity.  The  D.C.  conductivity  for  pure  samples  sintered at 700, 750 and 800  oC at room temperature and 500  oC are shown in Fig. 9. The  sample sintered at 750 oC showed the highest conductivity at all temperatures (1 × 10-6 S cm1)  followed by  samples  sintered  at  800  oC  and  700  oC.  The  conductivity  of  the  compound obtained  in  this  study  is  still  low.  To  obtain  higher  conductivities,  modifications  on  this  compound  need  to  be  done.  The  modifications  may  enhance  conductivity  values  upto  two  orders of magnitude as reported earlier by the authors [15,23].  

The plots of temperature dependence of total conductivity for all samples are depicted  in  Fig.  10.  The  conductivity  plots  of  the  three  samples  are  linear  and  fit  the  Arrhenius  equation as expressed by, where A is the pre-exponential factor, EĮ is the activation energy for conduction and k is the  Boltzman constant. The conductivity of all samples increases with temperature. However, the    180  oC  (1000/T  =  2.20  K-1)  which  is  in  log  ı-1000/T  plots  show  a  discontinuity  at    agreement  with  the  results  reported  by  Ivanovic  and  Bykov  [24].  The  change  in  slope  ı1000/T  plots  may  due  to  the  transition  of  ion  from  M1  site  to  M2  site  that  influenced  the  conductivity at even the slightest change in ion arrangement. The activation energy for the  highest conducting sample extracted from the Arrhenius plot is 0.0977 eV. The low value of  activation energy indicates high mobility of ions in the sample.    3.7  Magnesium Transference Number    Fig. 11(a) and 11(b) present the plot of current versus time and impedance plots before and  after  polarization,  respectively  for  the  Mg/electrolyte/Mg  cell  fabricated  using  the  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 sample sintered at 750 oC. Under a dc polarization of 0.27 V, the current in  the cell exhibited only a small decay with time. The initial, Io and final steady, Iss currents and  the impedance responses of the cells prior, Ro and after, Rss polarization for the cell are listed  in  Table  2.  Using  the  data,  the  Mg2+  transference  number  was  calculated  and  the  value  is  found to be 0.69. This value shows that the majority charge carriers in the electrolyte sample  are Mg2+ ions.     3.8    The  electrochemical  stability  window  of  the  ceramic  electrolyte  was  evaluated  by  linear  sweep  voltammetry.  Fig.  12  illustrates  linear  sweep  voltammogram  of  the  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  sample sintered at 750 oC. From the figure, the magnitude of current is fairly low below 2.50 V and the current starts to increase at potentials beyond this limit due to decomposition of the  electrolyte.  This  suggests  a  voltage  stability  window  in  the  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  compound  at  ambient temperature is up to 2.5 V.    4.0 Conclusions 

Pure  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  samples  were  successfully  prepared  by  sol-gel  method  followed  by  sintering at 700-800 oC. The XRD, FTIR, and EDX analyses confirmed the formation of the  compound. The DSC/TGA analyses predicted the chemical reaction in the sample completed  at 650 oC and no phase transitions were observed up to 850 oC. The melting temperature of  the Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3 compound was found to be 1165 oC. The SEM showed that the grain size  decreased with increase of sintering temperature and was in agreement with the particle size  distribution  data.  The  highest  conductivity  values  obtained  for  this  compound  were  in  the  order of 10-6 S cm-1 at room temperature and 10-5 S cm-1 at 500 oC, respectively. The value of  magnesium transference number was 0.69 confirming that it was Mg2+ conducting compound.  The compound showed reasonably wide stable voltage window; up to 2.5 V vs. Mg/Mg+ at  ambient  temperature.  These  suggest  that  Mg0.5Zr2(PO4)3  could  be  further  explored  as  electrolytes by enhancing the conductivity and ion transport in the structure. It can be done by  partial (single or multiple) elemental substitutions.
