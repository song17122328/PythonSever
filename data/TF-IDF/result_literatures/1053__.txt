Phase  relations  in  the  subsolidus  region  of  the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  system  were studied by X 2)ray powder diffraction analysis, differential thermal analysis, and vibrational spectroscopy. Two phases  were  synthesized:  variable 2)composition  phase  Na1 – xMg1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3  (0  ≤  x  ≤  0.5),  with  a NASICON structure (space group R3c) and ternary molybdate NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5 crystallizing in the tri 2) clinic system (space group P1). The high conductivity of Na1 – xMg1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 makes this variable 2) composition phase a promising solid electrolyte with sodium ionic conduction.

Oxide  phases  with  a  NASICON  structure  are widely  used  functional  materials  with  high  chemical and  thermal  stability.  These  phases  are  promising  as solid electrolytes because of their high ionic conduc 2) tivity, efficiency, and environmental safety [1–4]. The development of alternative energy sources determines the  increasing  demand  for  new  materials  with  ionic conduction. New phases with a NASICON structure have long been sought in phosphate, molybdate, sul 2) fate, silicate, and arsenate systems. They are used for producing luminophores, sensing and optical devices, membranes, and catalysts. A specific feature of phases with a NASICON structure is a rhombohedral frame 2) work {[R2(EO4)]p–}3∞ consisting of RO6 octahedra and EO4 tetrahedra. Small 2)size alkali metal atoms occupy voids in skeletons and determine high ionic conduc 2) tivity of the phases [1–9].

The possibility of varying the cationic composition within a single structural type enables one to perform the directed synthesis of variable 2)composition phases M1  –  хA1  –  хR1  +  х(MoO4)3,  which  are  isostructural  to NASICON.  This  structure  of  the  rhombohedral phases is topologically identical to that of corundum: A(R) atoms are at threefold axes and MoO4 groups are at twofold axes. The vacant parts of octahedral and tet 2) rahedral  voids  merge  into  a  three 2)dimensional  net 2) work  of  channels,  which  are  filled  with  alkali  metal cations [3]. One necessary condition for the formation of a NASICON structure is that the size of doubly and triply charged cations should be 0.06–0.9 Å, which is satisfied by Mg2+ and Sc3+ cations; another is that the size of the additional Na+ cation within the skeleton voids should be not too large.

The purpose of this work was to study phase equilibria the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  system, determine the conditions for the synthesis of the variable 2) composition  phase  Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3,  which is  on NaMgSc(MoO4)3,  and  also  investigate  the  tempera 2) ture  dependences  of  conductivity,  permittivity,  and loss tangent.

The  interaction in  the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3  system  was  studied  by  solid 2)phase  reac 2) tions within the temperature range 450–800°C.

The  initial  components  for  studying  the  system and were  molybdates  Na2MoO4,  MgMoO4,  Sc2(MoO4)3,  which  were  preliminarily  obtained  by solid 2)phase synthesis from Na2CO3, MgO, Sc(NO3)3 ⋅ 6H2O, and MoO3 within the temperature range 400– 600°C  with  numerous  intermediate  grindings  every 20–30 h. The annealing time at each temperature was 120–150  h.  After  the  annealing,  the  samples  were slowly cooled together with the furnace. Nonequilib 2) rium samples were annealed additionally, and equilib 2) rium was considered to be reached if the phase compo 2) sition  of  the  samples  remained  unchanged  after  two consecutive  annealings.  The  synthesis  products  were identified by X 2)ray powder diffraction analysis with an Enraf Nonius FR 2)552 Guinier camera (CuKα radia 2) tion, internal standard Ge). The X 2)ray powder diffrac 2) tion patterns were processed using the Rentgen soft 2) ware.

The  vibrational  spectra  of  polycrystalline  samples of Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 were recorded with a Bruker  FT 2)IR  spectrometer  and  a  Specord  M 2)80 spectrometer (1.06 2)nm near IR laser source for excita 2) tion, backscattering geometry, resolution 3–5 cm–1).

The samples were prepared as Nujol mulls on polyeth 2) ylene plates or KBr pellets. Molybdenum isotope sub 2) stituted  samples  were  obtained  using  oxides  92MoO3 and 100MoO3.

Differential  thermal  analysis  was  performed  with an  OD 2)103  derivatograph  (MOM,  Hungary)  at  a heating rate of 10 deg/min and a sample weight of 0.3– 0.4 g.

The  temperature  dependences  of  conductivity  σ, permittivity  ε, and loss tangent tanδ were studied by the Vest–Tallan polarization technique [6] on tightly compacted (relative density 95–97%) ceramic pellets 10 mm in diameter and 1–1.5 mm in thickness with platinum  electrodes.  The  electrodes  were  applied  by firing a platinum paste. The electrophysical properties were  measured  with  an  E8 2)4  alternating 2)current bridge with an R 2)5025 capacitor box, which widened the  loss  tangent  measurement  range  (determination accuracy ±5%). The direct current was measured with an E6 2)13A teraohmmeter at a given voltage of 30–50 mV. The electronic and ionic transference numbers te and ti,  respectively,  were  determined  by  the  Vest–Tallan polarization  technique  using  a  circuit  with  ion 2)irre 2) versible electrodes [6]; ti was calculated as ti = 1 – te was found as the ratio of the electronic conductivity mea 2) sured at direct current (0.09 V/cm) to the total con 2) ductivity measured at alternating current.

The  sample  temperatures  in  the  electrophysical studies  were  measured  with  a  chromel–alumel  ther 2) mocouple using a V7 2)21A voltmeter with an accuracy of ±2°С.

The reproducibility of the measurement results was controlled while heating and cooling within the tem 2) perature range 20–600°С.

The  interaction  in  the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3 system was investigated by the method of intersecting sections. Initially, the phase compositions were  studied  at  the  points  of  intersection  of  sections originating at the points of neutral and binary molyb 2) dates  forming  in  the  boundary  binary  systems Na2MoO4–MgMoO4,  Na2MoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3,  and MgMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3. Then, the determined quasi 2) binary sections were analyzed, which allowed is to per 2) form triangulation of the system (Fig. 1). The formation of  a  new  ternary  molybdate,  NaMgSc(MoO4)3,  was detected  in  the  sections  MgMoO4–NaSc(MoO4)2  and Na2 + 2xMg1 – x(MoO4)2–Sc2(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2, at 550–600°C. In the plane of the triangle Na2MoO4– MgMoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3  and  along  section NaMgSc(MoO4)3–Sc2(MoO4)3, the variable 2)compo 2) sition phase Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3, 0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5, forms, which is an omission solid solution based on the ternary molybdate NaMgSc(MoO4)3. In the system at 600–650°С, ternary molybdate NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5 was identified  in  the  section  NaSc(MoO4)2–MgMoO4 (ratio 1 : 3). Single 2)phase samples of the solid solution Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  with  a  NASICON  struc 2)  Z = 6) were obtained at 680°C ture (space group R  by  annealing  for  140–160  h,  and  ternary  molybdate NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5 crystallizing in the triclinic system (space group P   Z = 2) was synthesized as a single 2) phase  product  at  700°C  by  annealing  for  200  h. NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5 has the following unit cell parame 2) ters: a = 6.949(2) Å, b = 17.588(5) Å, c = 6.859(1) Å, α = 87.82(2)°, β = 101.45(2)°, and γ = 92.38(2)°.

NaMgSc(MoO4)3  and  NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5  melt incongruently at 895 and 960°C, respectively, without polymorphic transformations.

The X 2)ray powder diffraction analysis showed that Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 crystallizes in the trigonal system  and  ternary  molybdate Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 [2]. The large width (0 ≤ х  ≤  0.5)  of  the  crystallization  field  of  solid  solutions with a NASICON structure is due to the possibility of  isomorphic  substitutions  in  octahedra.  Octahe 2) dral positions (M) occupied randomly by Mg and Sc atoms  are  characterized  by  an  excess  of  scandium (at х > 0) and a deficiency of magnesium. Sodium atoms  in  skeleton  voids  do  not  distort  the  lattice symmetry  and  are  also  deficient.  Such  features  of the  Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  structure  and  the cation distribution cause an increase in the contribution of Sc–O bands to the total electrostatic balance of the structure. To maintain the balance of the structure, Na–O bonds should be weakened. This is done by providing a sodium deficiency in skeleton voids and increasing the sodium ion size, which results in an increase in the unit to NaMg3In(MoO4)5 [4], the crystal structure of which is a three 2)dimensional skeleton comprising МоО4 tetra 2) hedra  and  Mg(In)O6  octahedra.  In  the  skeleton, closed voids are filled with sodium atoms. A specific feature of this structure is fragments consisting of four octahedra forming a plane quadrilateral and of dou 2) ble 2)edge sharing octahedra.

The  structure  of  Na1  –  хMg1  –  хSc1  +  х(MoO4)3  is topologically  identical  to  that  of  corundum.  Mg(Sc) atoms are randomly distributed over two sets of crys 2) tallographic  positions  in  octahedral  coordination  to oxygen  at  threefold  axes  (symmetry  С3);  and  МоО4 groups, at twofold axes (С2). The vacant parts of octa 2) hedral  and  tetrahedral  voids  merge  into  a  three 2) dimensional  network  of  channels,  which  are  filled with sodium cations (sodium cation position symme 2) try С3i). The presence of isolated distorted tetrahedral anionic   groups in the structure enables one to make a comparative analysis of the internal vibrations of isolated   groups and the external vibrations, i.e.,  the  vibrations  of  the  cationic  sublattices  and МоО4 tetrahedra as a whole [9]. The bands of  4 ,− vibrations exhibit an isotopic shift on the 92Mo–100Mo substitution (Tables 2, 3).

Because  of  the  relatively  low  symmetry  of  МоО4 tetrahedra, the degeneracy of doubly and triply degener 2) ate vibrations may be removed and the components of the breathing vibration may be active in the IR spectra.

To  the  internal  vibrations  of  MoO4  groups,  the bands  at  986–769  cm–1  (stretching  vibrations)  and 408–310  cm–1  (bending  vibrations)  were  assigned, which  have  a  strong  shift  on  molybdenum  isotopic substitution  and  are  within  the  spectral  range  that  is characteristic of vibration frequencies of МоО4 tetra 2) hedra [9].

The frequencies of the stretch 2) ing vibrations of MoO4 groups increase by 20–25 cm–1 with increasing  х, which is likely to be caused by an increase in the energy of Mg–O and Sc–O bonds dur 2) ing the formation of a large number of vacancies in the cation  sublattice.  Partial  substitution  of  Ni2+  cations for  Mg2+  cations  does  not  lead  to  the  emergence  of new absorption bands, which could emerge in the case of an ordered cation distribution in the NASICON struc 2) ture. The random cation distribution does not influences the spectrum as a whole, but causes relative broadening of lines; in addition, the distortion of MoO4 tetrahedra reduces and the splitting of the triply degenerate stretch 2) ing vibration into components decreases. The lines in the Raman spectrum below 300 cm–1 (263–269 cm–1) were assigned  to  the  vibrations  of  Mg2+  and  Sc3+  cations. The band at 193 cm–1 was attributed to the vibration of scandium cations. The low 2)frequency groups of lines in the Raman spectrum at 112–88 cm–1 were assigned to  the  vibrations  of  magnesium  ions,  because  the vibrations  of  sodium  ions  are  inactive  in  the  Raman spectrum. In the IR absorption spectra, to the vibra 2) tions of sodium ions, the bands below 160 cm–1 can be attributed.

The  breathing  vibrations  of  molybdate  groups occupying  two  sets  of  crystallographic  positions turned out to be degenerate, probably, because of the similarity of geometric and dynamic characteristics of

Above 300°С, in the conductivity versus tempera 2) ture curves, there is a kink and the conduction activa 2) tion energy increases, which is likely to be related to the  transition  from  extrinsic  to  intrinsic  conduction. Within the extrinsic conduction range, the activation energy is 1.03–1.08 eV, and within the intrinsic con 2) duction  range,  it  is  2.02–2.36  eV.  The  conductivity 10–2  Ω–1 cm–1, which is characteristic of the sodium phase Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 with a NASICON structure, is due to quite a large size of skeleton voids,which significantly reduce the steric hindrances in the Na+ transfer [7, 8].

There is a correlation between the change in σ and the unit cell volume of the variable 2)composition phase.

The  permittivity  ε  and  the  loss  tangent  tanδ  vary exponentially with temperature (Fig. 3). The absence of extrema in the permittivity and loss tangent curves indicates the absence of phase transitions in and ferro 2) electric properties of Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3.

The  high  ionic  conductivity  of  the  variable 2)com 2) position phase makes Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 a promising solid electrolyte with sodium ionic conduc 2) tion.
