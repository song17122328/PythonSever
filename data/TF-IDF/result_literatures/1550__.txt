Li 1 + x Ti 2 – x Ga x ( PO 4 ) 3 ( x = 0–0.2) NASICON double phosphates are prepared and studied by hightemperature X-ray diffraction, 7 Li NMR spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and calorimetry. Doping with Ga 3+ cations increases cation mobility in LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 . Ion conductivity, NMR spectroscopy, and calorimetry data imply the occurrence of a phase transition in LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 and in products of partial gallium-for-titanium substitution.

The high cation mobility and thermal stability of NASICON double phosphates allow us to regard them as potential materials for use in electrochemical devices. The LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 structure is built of two TiO 6 octahedra linked via shared oxygen atoms with three PO 4 tetrahedra [1, 2]. Lithium cations can occupy two types of interstices: M1 interstices are in the inversion center and surrounded by six oxygen atoms, and M2 interstices are on the third-order rotation axis and formed by eight oxygen atoms [3]. The alternation of these two types of interstices along the conduction channels forms a three-dimensional network over which rapid ion transport occurs. Paris et al. [4] studied cation mobility in LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 using 7 Li NMR and impedance spectroscopy. Heterovalent doping is a known and popular strategy for improving ion conductivity. We used this strategy for modifying LiZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 (a NASICON structure). For example, Zr 4+ was in part replaced by Y 3+ , In 3+ , or Sc 3+ , i.e., by cations with close ionic radii and charges differing by unity [5]. The incorporation of tervalent cations was found to stimulate the transition of LiZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 structure from triclinic to rhombohedral and increase low-temperature cation mobility. It is of interest to apply the same strategy to structurally allied lithium titanium phosphate LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 . The literature concerning doped LiTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 is not rich. We can mention that Best et al. [6] substituted aluminum for part of the titanium ions. However, varying the dopant cation size often provides better conducting properties and better understanding of the nature of ion conduction. Here, we prepare Li 1 + x Ti 2 – x Ga x ( PO 4 ) 3 lithium titanium phosphates and study their cation mobility. EXPERIMENTAL Test materials were synthesized by ceramic technology by the reaction (1) All reagents were carefully ground with a mortar and pestle and sintered in platinum crucibles at 870 K for 4 h. Then, the sinter was again ground to homogeneity and compacted into disks to improve particle–particle interactions, after which heating was continued at 1300 K for another 10 h. Electron micrographs were obtained with a Leo Supra 50 VP microscope; the accelerating voltage was 5 kV . Element distribution was studied by electron probe microanalysis using a JSM-840A Jeol scanning electron microscope equipped with a PGT IMIX electron probe microanalysis attachment. X-ray powder diffraction was measured on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (Cu K α radiation) equipped with a high-temperature attachment at temperatures from 293 to 973 K in ≈ 100 -K steps and 2-min preexposure at each temperature. The Rigaku Application Data Processing program package was used for spectral data processing and qualitative analysis. Conductivity was measured in cylinder-shaped disks ( R = 5 mm, h = 2 mm) with platinum electrodes within 298–873 K using an IPU-62 ac bridge at frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz. Conductivity was found by extrapolation of bulk conductance semicircles to the resistance axis. For differential thermal analysis, a Netzsch STA 409 PC Luxx synchronous thermal analyzer was used; the heating rate was 5 K/min. Wide-line 7 Li NMR spectra were recorded within 80–320 K at 34 MHz on a Tesla BS-567A spectrometer modified for recording wide lines.

Electron microscopy shows that all samples are polydisperse crystalline materials consisting of relatively fine crystallites with sizes of ~1 µ m and large aggregates with sizes of 15–17 µ m. Electron probe microanalysis shows homogeneous distributions of titanium, phosphorus, and gallium in the test materials. The percentages of these elements correspond to the asbatch composition. Undoped LiTi 2 ( PO 4)3 is a single phase and crystallizes in hexagonal crystal system as probed by X-ray powder diffraction. Partial (~10%) substitution of Ga3+ for Ti4+ in the LiTi2(PO4)3 structure does not affect the phase composition of the resulting materials. Where the substitution level is 20%, however, an impurity phase appears, provisionally, LiGa(PO3)4. The unit cell parameter c of the LiTi2(PO4)3 structure increases lin early (Fig. 1) in the course of doping, whereas the parameter a changes less prominently. Heating to 973 K does not change the phase state of LiTi2(PO4)3 (Fig. 2). Some lines change their positions, whereas others almost do not shift. For example, reflections 012 and 104 shift toward small angles, whereas the reflection 110 does not shift. Similar evolution is observed in other angle ranges. The parameter Ò increases from 20.864(5) to 21.287(9) Å upon heating, whereas the parameter ‡ changes as little as from 8.519(1) to 8.523(2) Å. Thus, the thermal expansion coefficient is (6.96 ± 0.12) × 10–7 ä–1 along axis ‡ and (3.00 ± 0.04) × × 10–5 ä–1 along axis Ò. Low values of thermal expansion coefficients for NASICON structures are known from the literature [7]. Earlier [8] we established a similar temperature dependence of unit cell parameters in NASICON zirconium hydrogen phosphate H3OZr2(PO4)3 [8]. 7Li NMR spectra are an important source of cation mobility data (Fig. 3). The spectrum of LiTi2(PO4)3 at 118 K is a resolved triplet with the quadrupole splitting constant ëQ = 9.9 kHz. Heating to 183 K induces a weak increase in ëQ; during further heating, however, the constant increases monotonically (Fig. 4). Temperature elevation above 183 K increases cation mobility in the structure; Li+ cations leave M1 positions and in part enter M2 positions. According to Paris et al. [4], quadrupole splitting in less symmetrical M2 sites is far stronger. However, the spectrum is averaged because of the high lithium mobility; as a result, the average quadrupole splitting constant ëQ increases with temperature elevation.

The Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound relationship [9] is useful to estimate the correlation time τc of lithium ion diffusion. This is the relationship between the hopping frequency and the 7Li NMR line width: (2) Here, ∆H1/2 is the line width at half-height at a particular temperature, Hz; ∆Hr.l. is the 7Li NMR line width for a rigid lattice, Hz; and α is a constant function of line shape. The correlation time is defined by τc = 1/νc. (3) On the whole, the correlation time versus temperature relationship (Fig. 5) looks logical. Gallium(III) doping of LiTi2(PO4)3 decreases the correlation time. Defect generation upon gallium(III) doping of LiTi2(PO4)3 can be described by the quasi-chemical reaction (4) where “*” and “'”, respectively, denote the positive and negative charges of ions relative to the charge of the relevant lattice site. When gallium is doped, excess lithium is incorporated into interstices for charge balance. The correlation time for Li1.1Ti1.9Ga0.1(PO4)3 is smaller than for LiTi2(PO4)3. Therefore, Li+ interstitials in LiTi2(PO4)3 have sufficiently high mobility. Above 300 K, τc for Li1.1Ti1.9Ga0.1(PO4)3 varies only within the measurement error. Furthermore, additional spectral broadening can appear on account of averaging lines νc α∆H1/2/ π/2( ) ∆H1/2/∆Hr.l.( )2[ ]tan{ }.= Li3Ga2 PO4( )3/LiTi2 PO4( )3 = LiLi 2Lii* 2GaTi' 3PO4 P O4( ),++ + from M1 and M2 positions [10]; therefore, relationship (2) is not quite adequate. A considerable change in correlation time within a rather narrow temperature range can arise from phase transitions. We carried out a calorimetric study to verify this suggestion. Heating of undoped LiTi2(PO4)3 gives rise to a broad peak with two maxima near 260 and 270 K and an overall exotherm of ≈0.8 J/g and a less prominent peak with ≈0.1 J/g within 290–310 K (Fig. 6, curve ‡). As a rule, phase transitions have far greater heats; in the case at hand, however, we are dealing merely with a very weak structural alterations with lithium redistribution between two sites. In Li1.1Ti1.9Ga0.1(PO4)3, two exotherms are observed; the first is considerably shifted toward low temperatures. The heats measured during the first heating are also insignificant (Fig. 6, curve b). Moreover, upon the second heating (Fig. 6, curve c), these peaks become progressively prominent and slightly shift in temperature. Most likely, the observed transition is considerably extended in time. We observed a similar scenario for potassium magnesium molybdate [11]. As a result of the strong humidity dependence of the low-temperature conductivity of the test materials, conductivity was measured within 393–923 K (Fig. 7). Conductivity increases as the gallium percentage increases from 1 to 5% because of the appearance of extra Li+ interstitials according to Eq. (4). However, the increase in conductivity in response to compositional alterations is nonlinear because of defect association. The activation energy of conduction changes only weakly; its value is 60–70 kJ/mol depending on the sample. In summary, we have determined that dopant Ga3+ increases cation mobility in LiTi2(PO4)3. Ion conductivity, 7Li NMR spectroscopy, and calorimetry data together imply the occurrence of a phase transition in LiTi2(PO4)3 and in products of partial gallium-for-titanium heterovalent substitution.
