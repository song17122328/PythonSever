The monoclinic phase ( P21/n) was formed for 0 V x V 0.6 and the NASICON-type rhombohedral phase (R3¯c) was obtained for the region 0.8 V x V 1.2 in the Li3   2xCr2   xTax(PO4)3 system. The activation energy for Li+ migration was ca. 0.45 eV for the monoclinic structure and ca. 0.36 eV for the rhombohedral structure. The maximum conductivity of 8.4  10   1 at 298 K was obtained for x = 0.8 of the Li3   2xCr2   xTax(PO4)3 system. The conductivity of LiCrTa(PO4)3 was enhanced about three to five times by the addition of the lithium salt due to the improvement of the sinterablity. The maximum conductivity was 2.4  10   1 at 298 K for LiCrTa(PO4)3 – 0.2Li3BO3.
Solid electrolytes have been investigated for applications such as batteries and gas sensors. Especially, a lithium battery is the most promising one due to its high energy density and very high voltage (about 3.0 V). The solid electrolyte having a high Li+ ionic conductivity at room temperature is a promising material for this purpose [1]. Up to now, the highest Li+ ionic conducting solids are the Li3N single crystal and glasses based on Li2S [2 – 7]. However, these high Li+ conducting electrolytes are not oxide-based materials and the most serious problem is the instability in air and the deliquescence in air. The oxide electrolytes are stable in a humid condition, however, it is commonly accepted that high Li+ ionic conducting oxide materials cannot be obtained because of the high Li+ – O bonding energy.
NASICON (Na1 + xZr2P3   xSixO12) was designed by Goodenough et al. [8,9] in order to obtain a three-dimensional isotropic crystal. For the NASICON structure of NaZr2(PO4)3, the [Zr2(PO4)3] skeleton is composed of both ZrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, which are linked by their corners to form a three-dimensional rhombohedral network structure having the space group R3¯c. We have investigated the Li+ ionic conductivity for LiTi2(PO4)3-based materials, which also possess the NASICON-type structure [10 – 15]. Although LiTi2(PO4)3 itself shows low conductivity and low sinterability, these values were significantly improved by IIITi2   x(PO4)3, M = Al, Sc, an increase in x for the Li1 + xMx Y, etc. system [10 – 12] and by an increase in y for the LiTi2(PO4)3 + y(Li3PO4, Li3BO3, etc.) system [13]. Furthermore, the conductivity was significantly enhanced by an excess amount of lithium, i.e., an increase in y for the LiM2(PO4)3 + yLi2O, M(IV) = Ge, Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr systems [14]. 
In the case of these NASICON-type Li+ ionic conductors, we have proved that LiTi2(PO4)3-based electrolytes have a minimum activation energy (about 0.30 eV) for Li+ migration, i.e., a suitable tunnel size for Li+ migration in the skeleton (lattice volume of 1.310 nm3) [15]. The conductivity for the Ti-based system (7.0  10   1 at 298 K) is comparable to that of the highest Li+ conducting materials such as the Li3N single crystal and Li2S-based glasses. The activation energy for Li+ migration was increased and the conductivity decreased for LiM2(PO4)3 when a smaller Ge4 + (0.054 nm) or larger Hf4 + (0.071 nm) and Zr4 + (0.072 nm) was used as the tetravalent M4 + cation instead of the Ti4 + ion the Ti4 + ion in the (0.0605 nm) [15 – 18]. However, LiTi2(PO4)3 electrolyte is easily reduced to Ti3 + by the Li metal used as the electrode [19]. 
Based on these results, we considered that the NASICON-type structure having similar lattice parameters with LiTi2(PO4)3 can be synthesized by the combination of the tri-M3 + and hepta-M5 + valent cations. Up to now, the crystal structure of several materials of AMIIIMV(PO4)3 (A = Li or Na) have been reported [20,21]. However, the electrical properties have not reported for any of these materials.
In this study, we mainly investigated the crystal structure and the electrical properties of the Li3   2xCr2   xTax(PO4)3 system.
A stoichiometric amounts of mixture of Li2CO3 (99.9%), IIIO3 (M = Al, Cr, or Ga) (99.9%), MV M2 2O5 (M = Ta or Nb) (99.9%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (>99%) were mixed in an agate mortar and then heated at 1173 K for 2 h in a platinum crucible. For this first heating process, the temperature was held at 573 K for 12 h for the decomposition of (NH4)2HPO4. The mixed material was ground into a fine powder using a ball mill for 2 h in a wet process with methanol. The dried powder was reheated at 1173 K for 2 h and then ground again using the ball mill method for another 2 h. The proper amount of 3 wt.% PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) solution was added to the dried powder as a binder. The mixture was pressed into a pellet (13 mm diameter and ca. 1 mm thickness) at a pressure of 1 108 Pa. The pellets were sintered at 1073 – 1373 K for 2 h in air. The heating rate fixed to 2 K/min. The sintering temperature was chosen in such a way that high conductivity pellets were obtained. 
The surfaces of the sintered pellet were polished with an emery paper and then Au paste as electrodes was painted on both surfaces for the conductivity measurement.
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Cu-Ka radiation, Rint 2000, Rigaku, sweep rate = 2j/min. 40 kV, 20 mA) analysis was used to study the phases present in the decomposition products. The electrical conductivity was measured by the complex impedance method (100 Hz – 15 MHz) using a Model 4194A impedance analyzer from the Hewlett-Packard. The pellet was heated to 773 K in dried flowing air to eliminate the adsorbed water and then the conductivity measurements were carried out in the same atmosphere. The porosity (open porosity) of the sintered pellets was measured by Archimedes’ method.
We confirmed the phases and the crystal structure for the various combinations of the triand heptavalent cations which have a similar ionic radius as the Ti4 + ion. Table 1 shows the XRD results and electrical properties for the LiMIIIMV(PO4)3, MIIIMV = CrTa, AlTa, CrNb, AlNb, and GaNb samples. The single phase of the rhombohedral structure (R3¯c, Z = 6) was only obtained for the sample of LiCrTa(PO4)3 in all the examined samples. The highest conductivity and the lowest activation energy for the Li+ ion migration were obtained for this MIIIMV = CrTa sample. For MIIIMV = AlTa, the reason for the mixed phase would be a large difference in the ionic radius of Al3 + (0.0535 nm) and Ta5 + (0.064 nm) compared with that of Cr3 + (0.0615 nm) and Ta5 +. On the other hand, a single phase could not form for the MV = Nb containing samples of MIIIMV = CrNb, AlNb, and GaNb, since the stable NbOPO4 would be easily formed for the MV = Nb containing samples. 
The lattice parameters for LiCrTa(PO4)3 were a = 0.855 nm, c = 2.153 nm, V = 1.362 nm3, whose values were larger than those for LiTi2(PO4)3 (a = 0.851 nm c = 2.086 nm, V = 1.310 nm3), since the average of ionic radius for Cr3 +and Ta5 + (0.06275 nm) was larger than the ionic radius of the Ti4 + ion (0.0605 nm). Based on the crystal structure and the electrical properties, we decided to study the LiCrTa(PO4)3-based materials.
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns for the Li3   2xCr2   xTax(PO4)3 system sintered at 1373 K. The lattice parameters are shown in Table 2. In the case of R3¯c, the lattice parameters are shown as a hexagonal unit. The monoclinic single phase (space group: P21/n, Z = 4) was obtained for the Li3Cr2(PO4)3 (x = 0 – 0.4) sample [22,23]. The single phase of the NASICON-type rhombohedral structure was formed for x = 1.0 and 1.2. For x = 0.8, although peaks of the monoclinic phase having a very low intensity were observed in the XRD pattern, it can be regarded as almost a single phase. The mixture of two crystal structures was obtained for Li1.8Cr1.4Ta0.6(PO4)3 (x = 0.6). The lattice constants increased with an increase in the x value for both crystal structures because of the Ta5 + radius larger than that of the Cr3 + ion.
In our previous work, the conductivity was significantly enhanced by the improvement of the sinterability when an alkali salt such as Li3PO4 and Li3BO3 is added to the NASICON-type LiTi2(PO4)3 or NaZr2(PO4)3 [13,29]. The suitable amount of additive was about 20 mol% for LiTi2(PO4)3 or NaZr2(PO4)3 [13,29]. We prepared LiCrTa(PO4)3 – 0.2Li3PO4 and LiCrTa(PO4)3 – 0.2Li3BO3 samples to improve the sinterablity. Fig. 4 shows the rT – 1/T relationship for LiCrTa(PO4)3 and the lithium salt added samples. The two semicircles for the complex impedance plot were obtained for the lithium salt added samples as shown in Fig. 4. The capacitance of first semicircle was 4 pF   1 which seems to be an appropriate value for the bulk cm component of the solid electrolyte [25]. The value was 240   1 for the second semicircle. Table 3 shows the XRD pF cm results and the electrical properties. Although the monoclinic phase was detected for both samples, the main phase was the rhombohedral NASICON-type structure. 
The lattice constants were hardly changed by the addition of lithium salts. The lithium salts were not detect in the XRD pattern. Fig. 5 shows SEM photos for LiCrTa(PO4)3 (a) and the lithium salt added samples (b, c). The LiCrTa(PO4)3 sample was very porous (porosity = 25.5%). The crystals grew and closely contacted with each other by the addition of lithium salts (porosity < 5%). The added lithium salts acted as a flux for the crystal growth. The conductivities for the Li3PO4 and Li3BO3 added samples were 1.5 10   5 S   1 at 298 K, respectively. These values were higher by cm about 3 – 5 times compared with that for LiCrTa(PO4)3 without lithium salts. This enhancement is attributed to the improvement in the sinterability. 
In our previous study, the conductivity at room temperature was greatly enhanced (100 – 10 000 times) by the addition of a lithium salt for LiM2(PO4)3, M = Ge, Ti, or Hf, because the activation energy of the grain boundary for the Li+ ionic migration decreased due to the addition of te lithium salts in these samples [13,17,18]. However, the activation energy of the grain boundary for the lithium salt added samples was almost same as that of the total conductivity for LiCrTa(PO4)3 as shown in Table 3. The electrical properties of the total conductivity for LiCrTa(PO4)3 without a Li salt would agree with those of the grain boundary because of the poor sinterability as shown by the complex impedance plot in Fig. 2 and the SEM observations in Fig. 5. The reason for the small enhancement in the conductivity for the LiCrTa(PO4)3based materials ascribed to the fact that the activation energy for the grain boundary for LiCrTa(PO4)3 was only slightly changed by the addition of the lithium salt. 
On the other hand, the activation energy of the bulk component for the lithium migration was determined to ca. 0.36 eV. This value was very close to the activation energy of the grain boundary component. In addition, the activation energy of 0.36 eV of the bulk for LiCrTa(PO4)3 was higher than 0.30 eV for LiTi2(PO4)3 having a suitable lattice size in the NASICONtype structure, since the larger lattice parameters and the utilization of two cations (Cr3 + and Ta5 +) would affect the ionic migration in the NASICON-type structure.
We tried to prepare the various Li+ ionic conductors of the LiMIIIMV (PO4)3, MIIIMV = CrTa, AlTa, CrNb, AlNb, GaNb. The single phase of the rhombohedral structure (R3¯c) having a high conductivity was obtained only for the MIIIMV = CrTa sample. The monoclinic phase ( P21/n) was formed for x V 0.6 and the NASICON-type rhombohedral phase (R3¯c) was obtained in the range 0.8 V x1.2 for the Li3   2xCr2   xTax(PO4)3 system. The activation energy for the Li+ migration was ca.0.45 eV for the monoclinic structure and decreased to ca. 0.36 eV for rhombohedral structure. The maximum conductivity of 8.4  10   6 S   1 at 298 K was obtained for x = 0.8. The conductivity cm and the sinterability for the sintered pellets were improved by the addition of the lithium salt. For these samples, we determined that the activation energy of the bulk component for LiCrTa(PO4)3 was ca. 0.36 eV which was higher than that of LiTi2(PO4)3. The maximum conductivity was 2.4 10   1 at 298 K for LiCrTa(PO4)3 – 0.2Li3BO3.
