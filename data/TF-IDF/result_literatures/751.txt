Aluminum has long been regarded as a promising anode for energy storage due to itshigh energy density and low cost, but its application is hindered by the inability of cathodes toprovide reversible Al3+ insertion.
In contrast, we report the use of Al as cathode allows arechargeable high-energy battery.
The battery comprises a molten sodium anolyte and a molten NaAl2Cl7 catholyte, separated by a NaSICON solid Na+ electrolyte.
It is operated at 200 Â°C toovercome the ceramic separator kinetics and to keep sodium and NaAl2Cl7 in the molten state.
Due to the simple composition and trivalence of Al, the sodium anolyte and NaAl2Cl7 catholyte togethershows a high energy density of 366 Wh kg-1 although its voltage is only about 1.55 V and only 60%of the capacity can be realized.
The high energy density, low-cost and internal safety make this newcell chemistry applicable to the large scale energy storage market.
In summary, we demonstrate here that molten NaAl2Cl7 can serve as a catholyte and can deliver ahigh capacity of 296.4 mAh g-1 at 60% depth of discharge; a 1.55 V discharge voltage, which ishigher than expected from aqueous solution potential data, can be obtained with the molten saltmedium.
By using NaAl2Cl7 as catholyte and molten sodium as anolyte, we show a high energyefficiency Na-Al prototype battery of which we can find no previous record.
Although the capacityfades undesirably in the present cell, its high energy density, low cost, high safety and replenishablereserves making the Na-Al battery particularly promising in the grid-storage market.
The optimumworking temperature, catholyte composition, and battery configuration need to be further researched.
