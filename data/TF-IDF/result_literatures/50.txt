Development of high performance and cost-effective electrode materials is the main challenge for commercialization of sodium ion battery. Here, we suggest a substantial iron-doped sodium vanadium fluorophosphate and sodium vanadium phosphate composite as a promising cathode. Iron substitution enhances ionic diffusivity and lowers a bandgap, and, thus, improves sodium storage performance. The origin of the enhanced performance is investigated employing in-situ x-ray diffraction, ex-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, density functional theory calculation, and electrochemical characterization. Moreover, we demonstrate its full cell configuration with earth-abundant elements-based copper sulfide anode. The suggested cathode and sodium ion battery full cell exhibits well-balanced sodium storage performance in energy density, c-rate capability, cyclic stability, and low cost. The low cost and high performance of the full cell make it attractive choice for energy storage system and high power applications to support lithium ion battery.
Lithium-ion battery (LIB) has been employed to various applications such as electronic devices, electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage system (ESS) since its first commercialization in 1990s. However, high prices of the raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel, has roused a necessity for a development of an alternative for LIB. In such a context, sodium-ion battery (SIB) has been suggested owing to its inherent low cost. To develop a high performance SIB, various promising electrode materials have been explored. In terms of anodes, P, graphite, hard carbon, Sn, Bi, FeSx, and CuxS have been suggested 1-9. Especially, graphite, Sn, Bi, and CuxS show exceptional cyclic stability in ether-based electrolyte without the materials optimization 5-10. For cathode materials, Na super ion conductor (NASICON) type materials, such as sodium vanadium fluorophosphates (Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF)) and sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)) have been intensively studied due to their stable cyclability and high discharge voltages (~ 3.9 V for NVPF, ~ 3.8 V for NVOPF, and ~ 3.4 V for NVP) 11-13. However, the pure NASICON type materials rarely exhibits their theoretical capcity owing to relative low ionic diffusivity and electronic conductivity 14-16. Furthermore, the NASICON type materials include high content of expensive vanadium, which makes them economically less competitive. Therefore, we perform replacement of V in NVPF/NVP composite with inexpensive transition metals to improve its sodium storage performance and economic competiveness.  We find an optimal substituting element and substitution quantity. Furthermore, we investigate an origin of the performance improvement utilizing in-situ XRD, ex-situ XPS, electrochemical characterization, and DFT calculation. Finally, we realize a full-cell configuration of the improved NVPF/NVP composite and bulk CuS as an economically reasonable high performance SIB.
Six transition metals, such as Fe, Cr, Mn, Ti, Cu, and Zn, are considered to replace V in NVPF/NVP composite owing to their earth-abundances and low costs (Table S1). The transition metal doped-samples are labelled as NVPF/NVP (M x %, M = doped transition metals, x % = content of the transition metals in atomic percent). 
Among the candidates, we discover that Fe is the most proper substitutional element to enhance the electrochemical performance, simultaneously with cost reduction of raw materials.  Fe substitutes 8.9 % of V in NVPF/NVP with improved sodium storage capacity, while, in the other transition metals cases, more than 3.6 % of substitutions into the material induce performance degradations (Figure 1a). Here, content of the doped elements are obtained by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis. Undoped NVPF/NVP and Fe-doped NVPF/NVP composites are characterized utilizing Rietveld refinement and TEM (Figure 1b,c, Figure S1 and S2). The Rietveld analysis confirms the co-existence of two major phases, NVPF and NVP phases. With Fe content of 4.9 %, the two phases exist in the composite. With more Fe content, a minor phase of Na5V0.91Fe0.09(PO4)2F2 appears, which is isostructural with the previously reported Li5V(PO4)2F2 17. The detailed lattice parameters and crystal structures are presented in Table 1 and Figure S3.   NVPF/NVP cathodes, substituted with various contents of Fe, are charged and discharged at current densities of 0.5 C to 10 C(1 C = 128 mAh g-1, Figure 2). All NVPF/NVPs show three main plateaus; i) the first plateau at ~ 4.2 V, ii) second plateau at ~ 3.7 V, iii) and third plateau at ~ 3.4 V (Figure 2a). Here, undoped NVPF/NVP shows slightly sloping discharge voltage plateaus compared to Fe-doped NVPF/NVPs (Fe 4.9 %, 8.9 %). It implies that NVPF phase in undoped NVPF/NVP is partially oxidized 18. With Fe content of 4.9%, the average discharge voltage retains well above 3.7 V at 0.5 C (Figure 2b). However, upon further increase of Fe content over 4.9%, average discharge voltage starts to decrease due to reduced Na3V2-xFex(PO4)2F3 amount (Figure S4), which lowers a portion of the first (~ 4.2 V) and second (~ 3.7 V) plateaus. In addition, a clear new plateau appears at ~ 2.5 V from Fe content of 8.9 %, which is induced by Fe-doped NVP phase 19. Nevertheless, Fe-doped NVPF/NVP reaches the best Na storage performance at Fe content of 8.9 %. Although NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) has a slightly lowered average discharge voltage of ~ 3.67 V, it has the highest capacity of ~ 118 mAh g-1 to deliver the highest energy density of ~ 433 Wh kg-1 (5th cycle, 0.5 C, Figure 2b). 
Considering the highest energy density, Fe content of 8.9 % is the most optimal amount. With Fe contents of 11.5% and 14.9%, they show energy densities of 421 Wh kg-1 and 403 Wh kg-1, still higher than before Fe-doping.Fe substitution also enhances a c-rate capability of the cathode (Figure 2c). After 2000 cycles at 10 C, NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %), NVPF/NVPF (Fe 4.9 %), and undoped NVPF/NVP retain 98.5 mAhg-1, 97 mAh g-1, and 87 mAh g-1, respectively (Figure 2d).
NVPF/NVP (8.9 %) exhibits well-balanced performance in capacity, average discharge voltage, C-rate capability, and capacity retention, thus highly competitive to previously reported NVPFs and NVOPFs. To assess the performance of NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %), it is compared to recently reported similar cathodes 14-16,20-23 (Table 2). Ti and Y doped NVPF/NVP and Mn-doped NVPF exhibits high capacities of ~ 122 mAh g-1. However, Ti-doped NVPF shows a relative poor capacity retention rate of ~ 77% at 1C after just 200 cycles. For Y-doped and Mn-doped NVPFs, although they presents high cyclic stabilities at 1 C, they exhibits relative poor c-rate capabilities with 87 mAh/g at 10 C and 60 mAh g-1 at 10 C. Furthermore, doping amounts of Ti, Y, and Mn are limited to 5%, 2.5%, and 2.5 %, respectively. Ru-doped NVOPF shows a relative low average discharge voltage.
NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9%) is also highly competitive to recently reported NVPF and NVOPFs with specific morphology or combined with rGO or other carbon materials 21-23. NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9%) exhibits superior capacity retentions of over 90% after 2000 cycles at high current density. Although C-rate capability of NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9%) is slightly lower than the optimized NVPF/rGO composite, considering the higher capacity retention and raw cost reduction with 8.9% Fe, it is one of the most well-optimized V-based NASICON cathodes.The electrochemical performance improvement in Fe-doped NVPF/NVPs should be related to crystallographic phase evolution during sodiation, valence changes of the transition metals, Na diffusivity, and electronic conductivity. Therefore, we investigate those factors employing in-situ XRD, ex-situ XPS, electrochemical characterization, and density functional theory (DFT).The enhanced performance of Fe-doped NVPF/NVP can be related to the crystal structural evolution and corresponding volume change in Na migration path, which affects a migration barrier 24. The migration tunnel volume should be related to the volumes of the unit cells. In order to investigate crystal structural evolutions during the cell operations, in-situ transmission x-ray diffraction (XRD) is utilized and correlated with the charge and discharge profiles (Figure 3). 
In NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %), unlike from undoped NVPF, a and c axes relative discretely change upon phase transitions of Na2V1.82Fe0.18(PO4)2F3 → Na3V1.82Fe0.18(PO4)2F3 (iv → v) and Na2V1.82Fe0.18(PO4)2F3 ↔ NaV1.82Fe0.18(PO4)2F3 (ii → iii and iv → v) (Figure 3, Figure S5 and S6) 25 indicating tendency of biphasic reaction. However, it presents the similar volume variation to undoped NVPF/NVP during the operation. Thus, considering the Na migration through rectangular shape tunnel consisting of 4 O atoms (Figure S7a) 26, we believe that it would induce a negligible migration barrier change. On the other hand, clearly distinctive crystallographic behaviour is observed in Na3V1.82Fe0.18(PO4)3. It indicates that Fe-doped NVP contributes to a capacity above 3.4 V, which is quite distinguishable in that undoped NVP makes a capacity contribution with a single plateau at ~ 3.4 V. Furthermore, the intermediate phase of Na1 + αV2 - xFex(PO4)3 play a role as a buffer phase for efficient stress accommodation by reducing misfit strains upon the phase transitions. It could facilitate Na diffusion compared to the case of the one step reaction. 
Considering two Na migration paths in NVP (Figure S7b,c), the larger average volume would induce a relative lower Na migration barrier to enhance a Na diffusivity. For the minor phase, Na5V0.91Fe0.09(PO4)2F2, with tracking of (004) plane, it makes a capacity contribution between 2.0 V and ~ 3.7 V.
Partially oxidized state of NVPF phase is implied in undoped NVPF/NVP with the slightly sloping plateaus in discharge profile. The oxidation of NVPF phase forms inherent V4+. Thus, ex-situ XPS analysis is conducted to confirm it and correlate it with the electrochemical performance. As a result, indeed, co-existence of V3+ and V4+ is presented in V2p spectrum in undoped NVPF/NVP (Figure 4a). As charged to 3.9 V and 4.45 V, co-existence of V3+, V4+, and V5+ is confirmed, which indicates a co-contribution of V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+ redox pairs for the two plateaus at ~3.7 V and ~ 4.2 V. However, in charged state to 3.9 V, V3+ accounts for about a half area of the total spectrum, and, even in fully charged state, V3+ still remains unreacted, which supports relative low capacity of undoped NVPF/NVP. On the other hand, NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) shows highly symmetric V2p spectrum with V3+, which is converted to highly symmetric V4+ with complete oxidation of V3+ (Figure 4b). Besides V, Fe3+ also contributes to capacity with being oxidized into Fe4+ (Figure S8).
 On the basis of the fully evolved V3+/V4+ redox pair, NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) shows significantly improved sodium storage performance compared to undoped NVPF/NVP. Unreacted V3+ engenders remaining Na in the crystal structure, which could hinder sodium migration due to a higher Na defect formation energy 27. Therefore, we expect higher sodium diffusivities in Fe-doped NVPF/NVPs (Fe 4.9 %, 8.9 %).
 In order to measure the diffusion coefficients of NVPF/NVPs (Fe 0 %, 4.9 %, and 8.9 %), cyclic voltammetry is utilized (Figure 5a,b,c). The diffusion coefficients corresponding to the three main plateaus at ~ 4.2 V, ~ 3.7 V, and ~ 3.4 V are considered. The corresponding current peaks are labelled as Na1, Na2, and Na3, respectively. The linear relationship between ip and v allows to employ Randles-Sevcik equation to obtain the Na ion diffusion coefficients (Figure 5d and Figure S9):
Here, ip, n, A, D, and v are a current peak, number of electron during the reaction (here, n = 2), effective contact area (~ 1.54 cm2), Na ion diffusion coefficient, and voltage scan rate. For C, concentration of Na+ in the electrode, 0.0227 mol cm-3 for Na1 and Na2, and 0.0276 mol cm-3 for Na3 are used on the basis of Na density in NVPF and NVP. As a result, indeed, NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) shows much improved Na ion diffusion coefficients at the all three plateaus. Especially, significant improvement of Na ion diffusion coefficient in Na1 + αV1.82Fe0.18(PO4)3 at the third plateaus would be owing to the small volume variation with the buffer phase of Na1 + αV1.82Fe0.18(PO4)3. Another crucial kinetic property is an electronic conductivity. The electronic conductivity is closely related to a band gap of the material. Therefore, in order to examine the band gap change upon Fe substitution into NVPF, density functional theory (DFT) is conducted (Figure 6). As a result, Fe substitution forms new energy levels below the existing conduction band. In consequence, the band gap of pristine NVPF at Γ point substantially decreases from 2.193 eV to 1.464 eV upon 12.5 % Fe substitution. The same trend in NVP was also reported 28. Fe substitution into NVPF/NVP evidently improves Na diffusivity and electronic conductivity. The improvements significantly affect an operation at a higher current density. Unlike an operation at low current density (i.e. 0.5 C), NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) presents the higher capacity contributions than NVPF/NVP (Fe 4.9 %) from all the three plateaus at a higher current density of 10 C (Figure S10).
To realize an economically reasonable high performance SIB, full cell configuration of the developed NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9%) is examined in combination with bulk CuS, attractive anode material with high theoretical capacity (~ 560 mAh g-1), high conductivity (~ 103 S/cm) 7,29, and low cost. Furthermore, as we previously reported 7, CuS exhibits a high practical capacity of ~ 440 mAh g-1 at 1 C and high capacity retention upon a long-term operation without any optimization in terms of size, morphology, and surface coating. It is a huge advantage for commercialization. Despite the advantages of CuS, its application to full cell has not been reported yet. 
 The developed NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %)-CuS full cell is charged and discharged between 0 V to 4.25 V at the first cycle (Figure 7a). After the first cycle, the voltage window is conservatively adjusted as 0 V to 4.05 V to prevent a capacity degradation caused by over discharge. The full cell delivers a capacity of ~ 101 mAh g-1 (based on a cathode material mass) and an energy density of ~ 162.2 Wh kg-1 (based on both electrode materials mass) with ~ 2.09 V at 1 C, which is close to the expected voltage level based on a practical average discharge voltage of NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %) composite (~ 3.67 V) and average charge voltage of CuS (~ 1.55 V), respectively. The energy density of 162.2 Wh kg-1 is ~79% of theoretical value (Table S3). Even at a high current density of 10 C, it retains 81 mAh g-1 with energy density of ~ 114.6 Wh kg-1 (Figure 7b,c,d). On the basis of its crate capability, the energy density is plotted as a function of the power density to compare the full cell with the previously reported SIB full cells (Figure 7d) 10,22,30-37. Despite its relative low voltage, it ranks in high position. It delivers energy densities of 148.59 Wh kg-1, 138.27 Wh kg-1, and 114.60 Wh kg-1 with power densities of 599 W kg-1, 1091.59 W kg-1, and 1801.55 W kg-1, respectively. 
The NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %)-CuS full cell also exhibits high cyclic stability (Figure 7e). At the current density of 3 C, it still retains ~ 91 mAh g-1 after ~ 450 cycles, which is ~ 95.7 % of the initial capacity. Then, the current density is adjusted to 10 C, and the cell is successively operated for ~ 800 cycles. Considering the initial capacity of 81 mAh g-1 at 10 C, it still delivers ~ 87.6 % of the capacity, 71.4 mAh g-1, after 1200 cycles. 
 The suggested SIB full cell exhibits a well-balanced performance with moderate energy density, superior cyclic stability, and low raw material cost. In order to assess the competitveness of NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %)-CuS full cell, its performance is compared to those of previously reported SIB full cells 10,21,22,31,38 in terms of energy density, average voltage, cylic stability, and cost (Table 3 and Figure S11). Although it has a relative low energy density compared to VO2 nanosheet//NVOPF nanocuboid array and Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) nanotube//VOPO4 SIB full cells, it shows a superior capacity retention to them. In addition, it shows the lowest raw material cost among the candidates (Figure S11 and Table S3). Especially, the experimentally demonstrated performance is quite competitive to LTO-based LIBs, which is used in energy storage system or high power applications, while its cost is much more inexpensive (Table S4). Therefore, the suggested SIB full cell is quite suitable to support the LIBs in energy storage system and high power devices.
We does not only demonstrate that 8.9 atomic % of Fe substitution into NVPF/NVP significantly enhances its sodium storage performance, but also conduct in-depth study on the origin of the improved performance with in-situ XRD, ex-situ XPS, DFT calculation, and electrochemical characterization. Fe substitution into NVPF/NVP enables the complete utilization of V3+/V4+ redox pair in NVPF/NVP and two-step phase transition in NVP, which enhances the Na diffusivity. Reaction behavior of NVPF becomes close to biphasic rather than solid solution with Fe substitution. Furthermore, band gap of the material is also reduced by Fe substitution to improve electronic conductivity. Finally, we materialize the previously suggested concept of the CuS-NVPF full cell by combining Fe-doped NVPF/NVP and CuS. On the basis of the earth abundances and low costs of Cu and S, the minimized V content in NVPF/NVP composite, and the high energy density and long cycle life of CuS-NVPF/NVP (Fe 8.9 %), we believe it can be one of the most appealing candidates for energy storage system and high power applications to support lithium ion battery.
