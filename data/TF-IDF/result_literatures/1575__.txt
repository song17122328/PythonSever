Cation mobility in Li 3 – 2 x Nb x In 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 complex phosphates was studied by impedance spectroscopy, calorimetry, and 7 Li NMR spectroscopy. A phase transition at ≈ 273 K is suggested for compositions containing ≈ 1 mol lithium per formula unit.

NASICON (from Na Super Ionic CONductor) compounds of composition å x Ä 2 (ê O 4 ) 3 (where M is a ter-, tetra-, or pentavalent element, such as Sc 3+ , Fe 3+ , Zr 4+ , Hf 4+ , Ti 4+ , Sn 4+ ) have been actively studied on account of several practically important properties, such as high ionic conductivity and thermal stability and low heat conductivity and thermal expansivity [1–4]. The 3D crystal structure of these compounds is built of corner-sharing PO 4 tetrahedra and Ä O 6 octahedra. Ions å + can occupy two nonequivalent positions in this structure: the surrounding of the position M(1) is a distorted octahedron, whereas the position M(2) is an interstice formed by 10 oxygen atoms [5]. Partial heterovalent substitution of polyvalent cations A considerably changes properties of the material [5]. Li 3 In 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 at room temperature crystallizes into a lowsymmetry monoclinic phase [4], while NaInNb ( PO 4 ) 3 crystallizes into a high-symmetry hexagonal phase with a disordered sodium sublattice [6]. In our previous studies, we prepared materials of composition Li 3 – 2 x Nb x In 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 . Compounds containing ≈ 1 mol lithium per formula unit crystallized into a high-symmetry hexagonal phase. The conductivity of these materials increases monotonically in the order Li 0.6 Nb 1.2 In 0.8 ( PO 4 ) 3 – LiNbIn ( PO 4 ) 3 and Li 1.2 Nb 0.9 In 1.1 ( PO 4 ) 3 – Li 3 In 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 because of the consecutive filling of M(1) and M(2) positions in complex phosphate structures [7]. In many systems, the appearance of high ion mobility is associated with phase transitions [8]. This situation was observed, for example, for many NASICON materials [4]. Here, we study phase transformations and cation mobility in Li 3 – 2 x Nb x In 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 complex phosphates. Our study is focused on low-lithium compounds ( ≈ 1 mol lithium per formula unit), whose phase transitions have not been documented.

Materials with the composition Li 3 – 2 x Nb x In 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 were synthesized by annealing stoichiometric mixtures of lithium carbonate, ammonium hydrophosphate, indium oxide, and niobium oxide in a two-stage scheme described in [9]. 7 Li MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer with Fourier transform and magic angle spinning (spinning rate, 10–12 kHz) at 194.4 MHz ( SW = 125 kHz). Chemical shits were determined relative to 0.1 M LiCl solution. Wide-line 7 Li NMR spectra were recorded within 118–433 K at 33 MHz on a Tesla BS-567A spectrometer modified for recording wide lines. For differential thermal analysis, an STA 409 PC Luxx Netzsch synchronous thermal analyzer was used. Conductivity was measured in cylinder-shaped disks (5 mm in diameter and 2 mm high) with platinum electrodes within 298–773 K in 10–20 K steps on a 2V -1 impedance meter/analyzer at frequencies from 10 Hz to 2 MHz. Conductivity was found by extrapolation of bulk conductance semicircles to the resistance axis.

High-resolution NMR spectra show that chemical shifts for 7 Li NMR signals from Li 3 – 2 x Nb x In 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 increase monotonically from –1.18 to –0.14 ppm, as lithium content increases from 0.8 to 3.0 atom per formula unit. This trend is dictated by a decrease in phosphate anion polarization with progressing substitution of tervalent indium for pentavalent niobium ions (table). Spin–lattice relaxation times T1 tend to systematically increase in the same order, which can be regarded as a signature of a change in cation mobility. Compositions near LiNbIn(PO4)3 are most interesting; they experience the strongest change in structure and conductivity [7]. To understand more details of these transformations, we studied wide-line 7Li NMR spectra for LiNbIn(PO4)3 and Li1.1Nb0.95In1.05(PO4)3 samples. Both samples have very similar spectra (Figs. 1, 2). At 118 K, the spectra are singlets with line widths of ≈2.2 Gs. As temperature increases, the spectrum narrows to 1.0 Gs at 273 K. However, subsequent temperature elevation again broadens the spectra. Triplet shoulders become distinct; their intensity increases noticeably with temperature elevation. Theoretically, this evolution of NMR spectra is not quite trivial. As a rule, the line width decreases with temperature elevation because of increasing internal (molecular or ionic) mobility [10]. Most likely, the observed spectral evolution arises from the following structural evolution of the test materials. At low temperatures, lithium ions occupy M(1) positions. With temperature elevation, lithium ions progressively increase their translational mobility; the lithium lifetime in these positions decreases, and translations between these positions are hops with intermediate lithium fixation in M(2) positions. V erifying this, the correlation time τc calculated according to Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound [11] decreases as temperature increases to 273 K (Fig. 3). The correlation time characterizes the mean lifetime of a molecule in a fixed state and is determined from (1) Here νc is the correlation frequency of molecular motion, which depends on the line width and can be calculated from (2) where ∆H1/2 is the line width at half-height at a particular temperature, Hz; ∆Hr.l. is the 7Li NMR line width for a rigid lattice, Hz; and α is a constant function of line shape. In our case, α ≈1 because a resonance line at low temperatures is fitted to the Gaussian [10]. A further rise in temperature appreciably decreases the occupancy of M(1) positions [12], and a considerable part of lithium becomes delocalized over the lattice. Lithium spends most time in M(1) and M(2) interstices, but the effective lifetime of lithium in M(2) positions increases systematically. It is known from [13] that lithium ions in these positions have a greater quadrupole coupling constant than in M(1) positions. Therefore, the intensity of triplet shoulders in the spectrum increases with increasing number of lithium ions in M(2) positions. In addition, M(2) positions should have a different chemical shift. In the case of exchange between two positions with different chemical shifts, lines gradually merge and the spectrum broadens [10]. It is only for very rapid exchange that the spectrum again narrows. Thus, we may infer that lithium redistribution between M(1) and M(2) sites is responsible for the effective broadening of the spectra. Many materials enter a high-ion-mobility state with a phase transition. We observed a similar transformation near room temperature in materials based on lithium zirconium phosphate LiZr2(PO4)3 [14]. This involved the triclinic-to-hexagonal phase transition in LiZr2(PO4)3 with an insignificant lattice distortion. We used calorimetric experiments to verify the occurrence of the suggested phase transition in the test materials. Heating LiNbIn(PO4)3 and Li1.1Nb0.9In1.1(PO4)3 samples from 273 to 318 K generates a broad peak with a peak temperature of 273 K; the heat of transition is 75 and 183 J/mol, respectively. For LiNbIn(PO4)3, unexpectedly, the heat of this transition is smaller, possibly, because of the higher ion mobility than in Li1.1Nb0.95In1.05(PO4)3 [7]. In both cases, however, the heats of transition are small. This provides indirect evidence in favor of the insignificance of the structural alteration induced by lithium ion redistribution between M(1) and M(2) positions. In structurally related zirconium compounds, the phase transition also occurred over some range of temperatures rather than at a point [14]. Ionic conductivity measurements over a wide temperature range also verify the existence of the phase transition. Figure 4 plots ionic conductivity versus temperature for LiNbIn(PO4)3 in the linearizing coordinates of the Frenkel equation: σT = Äexp(–E‡/RT). (3) Here, í is temperature in degrees Kelvin, Ä is the frequency factor, E‡ is the conductivity activation energy, and R is the universal gas constant. A well-defined flex is observed near 273 K, with the activation energy decreasing from 79 ± 1 kJ/mol (T = 247–275 K) to 46 ± 0.2 kJ/mol (T = 275–453 K) in transition from the lowtemperature phase (characterized by strict cation order) to the high-temperature phase with its disordered cation sublattice. Similar transformations at similar temperatures were observed for other Li3 – 2xNbxIn2 – x(PO4)3 compounds containing ≈1 mol lithium per formula unit. Most likely, we have not detected this transition in measuring conductivity above room temperature [7] because all samples were the high-temperature hexagonal phase. A further increase in temperature brings about a further decrease in conductivity activation energy to 33.0 ± 0.2 kJ/mol (453 to 773 K). In summary, impedance spectroscopy, calorimetry, and 7Li NMR spectroscopy data together imply the existence of phase transitions near 273 K in Li3 – 2xNbxIn2 – x(PO4)3 materials containing ≈1 mol lithium per formula unit. 7Li NMR spectroscopic data imply that the low-to-high-temperature phase transition is due to redistribution of cations between M(1) and M(2) positions, the latter being vacant in the lowtemperature phase.
