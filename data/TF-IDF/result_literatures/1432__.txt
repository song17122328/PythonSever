Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3 NASICON 2)like solid solutions, where R = Al or Sc and 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5, were prepared; their crystal lattice parameters and thermal stabilities were determined. Silver 2)ion conductiv 2) ity was measured, and conductivity activation energy values were calculated for various temperature ranges. Above 400°C, Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3 phases have ionic conductivities comparable to the conductivities of sodium 2)ion and lithium 2)ion NASICON 2)like conductors. The conductivity increases as the tervalent cat 2) ion radius increases or the amount of mobile silver ions increases.

Progress in many fields of science and engineering is controlled by the development of novel ion 2)conduc 2) tive  materials  and  expansion  of  their  application  in solid 2)phase electrochemical devices [1–5].

NASICON 2)like compounds MnR2(MoО4)3, where M = Li or Na; R stands for a III–V Group element, and n = 1–4, are known to be efficient singly 2)charge 2) cation  ionic  conductors  [6–9].  The  high  mobility  of moderate 2)sized alkali cations here is due to the geo 2) metrical  opportunity  of  their  transport  through  a rhombohedral crystal framework built of corner 2)shar 2) ing MoО6 octahedra and RО4 tetrahedra. The distribu 2) tion  of  singly  charged  cations  to  allowed  positions changes  with  rising  temperature  toward  a  more  uni 2) form  occupation  of  all  extraframework  positions;  in some NASICON 2)like compounds, this is manifested as  phase  transitions  [10,  11].  The  ability  of {R2(MoО4)3}3∞ rhombohedral frameworks to isovalent and  heterovalent  substitutions  makes  it  possible  to control structural, thermodynamic, and electrophysi 2) cal  properties  of  NASICON 2)like  materials.  Specifi 2) cally, in cases of heterovalent substitutions of R atoms, the change in framework charge can be balanced by a change  in  the  amount  of  extraframework  univalent cations.

This work is targeted at the synthesis of and study of ion  conductivity  in  phases  of  variable  composition Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3, where R = Al or Sc.

The starting components used were silver, sodium, magnesium,  aluminum,  and  scandium  molybdates presynthesized by solid 2)phase reactions from AgNO3 (chemically  pure  grade),  MgO  (chemically  pure grade),  Al(NO3)3  ⋅  9H2O  (chemically  pure  grade), Sc2O3 (chemically pure grade), and molybdenum(VI) oxide  (chemically  pure  grade)  taken  stoichiometric proportions  by  stepped  annealing  at  350–450°С (Ag2MoO4),  400–750°С  (MgMoO4),  300–700°С (Al2(MoO4)3),  and  400–800°С  (Sc2(MoO4)3).  To prepare  samples  of  Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3  solid solutions where R = Al or Sc, stoichiometric amounts of the components appropriate for samples where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, or 0.7 were carefully stirred in  an  agate  mortar  and  then  annealed  in  air  starting with 350°С in 50°С steps with intermittent homogeni 2) zation every 20–30 h. Depending on the composition and the nature of the R3+ cation, the limiting anneal 2) ing temperature was within 550–600°С for R = Al and 750–800°С for R = Sc. The annealing length at each temperature  was  at  least  80–100  h.  Homogeneity boundaries were determined by X 2)ray powder diffrac 2) tion in air 2)quenched samples.

Ceramics  were  prepared  by  sintering  powders ground with one or two ethanol drops and compacted in  tablets  for  2  h  at  500–550°С  for  aluminum  com 2) pounds and at 650–700°С for scandium compounds.

X 2)ray  diffraction  studies  were  carried  out  on  a Bruker AXS Advance D8 automated powder diffracto 2) meter  (CuKα  radiation;  graphite  monochromator; maximal 2θ angle: 90°; scan step: 0.01°–0.02°; expo 2) sure  time  per  datapoint:  1  s).  To  determine  unit  cell parameters, HUBER Guinier G670 and Termo ARL automated  diffractometers  were  employed  (CuKα radiation;  reflection  geometry;  2θ  range:  10°–50°; scan step: 0.02°).

A  thermoanalytical  study  was  carried  out  on  a Netzsch  STA  449  Jupiter (TG–DTA/DSC)  thermal  analyzer  and  an  MOM  OD 2)103 derivatograph (the temperature rise rate was 10 K/min).

Electrophysical properties were studied on ceramic tablets 9–10 mm in diameter and 1–2 mm high; silver and platinum electrodes were applied to the end sur 2) faces of tablets. Direct current conductivity tests were performed  using  a  V7 2)38  tester.  Ion  transport  was studied by a two 2)point dc method at frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz using an automated impedance meter designed at the Institute of Control Sciences, Russian Academy  of  Sciences,  at  temperatures  from  25  to 600°С  with  linear  temperature  variation  at  a  rate  of 4 K/min  in  heating  and  cooling  modes.  Some  mea 2) surements were performed on a Novocontrol Beta 2)N impedance  analyzer  at  frequencies  from  10  mHz  to 3 MHz.  The  conductivity  activation  energy  was derived  from  the  slopes  of  straight 2)line  plots  corre 2) sponding  to  the  Arrhenius  log  conductivity  versus reciprocal temperature plots.

By  X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  data,  the  onset  tem 2) perature of the reaction between neutral molybdates is 500°С for scandium compounds and 400°С for alumi 2) num compounds. At these temperatures the reaction is slow and does not go to end; so, the annealing temper 2) ature  was  consecutively  raised  to  650–700  and  550– 600°С,  respectively.  Single 2)phase  triple  molybdates Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3 where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 were pre 2) pared by annealing at 650–700°С for 100–150 h, and Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3 molybdates where 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4  were  annealed  by  annealing  at  500–550°С  for 150–200  composition Ag0.5Mg0.5Al1.5(MoO4)3 quenched from 580–600°С was a single phase, which allows us to expand the homoge 2) neity range of the phase at these temperatures to x = 0.5.  Phases  of  variable  composition  Ag1 – xMg1 – x R1 + x(MoO4)3  represent  AgMgR(MoO4)3 2)based  sub 2) traction solid solutions.

The  highest  thermal  stability  was  found  in  scan 2) dium solid solutions, whose incongruent melting tem 2) perature  range  was  1120–1140°С;  aluminum  solid solutions were stable up to 790–820°С.

X 2)ray powder diffraction showed that, judging from the reflection positions in the patterns and the inten 2) sity  ratios,  Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3  phases  are  isos 2) tructural  to  sodium  zinc  scandium  molybdate  [12]. Powder  patterns  for  all  of  the  materials  synthesized were  satisfactorily  indexed  on  the  assumption  of rhombohedral space group R c. Table 1 lists unit cell parameters  samples  of  Ag1 – xMg1 – x R1 + x(MoO4)3  solid  solutions.  The  unit  cell  size decreases in the progress of substitution a smaller alu 2) minum cation (rAl(VI) = 0.53 Å) for scandium (rSc(VI) = 0.745 Å [13]).

In both systems, a systematic increase is noticed for the parameter с of the solid solutions in the range of lower  silver  percentages,  which  is  in  agreement  with the idea of weakening bonding strength in silver 2)ion 2) filled  positions  lying  on  the  triple  axis  of  the  crystal structure.  The  other  positions  (which  lie  beyond  the triple axis and relate in number to the former as 3 : 1) at room temperature are likely to remain dominantly vacant.

Direct  current  conductivity  measurements  on  a V7 2)38 instrument showed that the room 2)temperature conductivity of samples with platinum electrodes did not exceed 10–7 to 10–8 S/cm and allowed us to classify these  materials  as  insulators.  The  relationships between the resistive and reactive impedance (Fig. 1) obtained for a ceramic  AgMgAl(MoO4)3 sample with the use of a Novocontrol Beta 2)N impedance analyzer are representative for ionic conductors equipped with blocking electrodes [11].

It is known [11] that the impedance values corre 2) sponding  to  the  minimal  reactive  component  of  the locus  in  its  high 2)ohmic  portion  at  the  termination point  of  the  characteristic  semicircle  in  Fig.  1,  are equal  to  the  direct  current  conductivity  σDC  of  the sample. From the data displayed in Fig. 1, it follows that  in  our  samples  the  impedance  at  100  Hz  over  a wide  range  of  temperatures  systematically  appears near the above 2)indicated point, and therefore may be taken, with a satisfactory accuracy, to be the σDC value. The applicability criterion of this choice is the weakest frequency dependence of the logarithm of conductiv 2) ity when the frequency deviates from the chosen value of  100  Hz  (Fig.  2).  Another  support  for  the  lucky choice of frequency for representing ionic conductiv 2) ity for the entire range of the compounds prepared is provided  by  the  obedience  of  the  quantities  to  the Arrhenius law (Figs. 3, 4).

Another  pointer  to  the  ion  character  of  electrical conductivity is the ascending branch of the locus in the lowest frequency portion thereof; this corresponds to the presence of ion 2)transport 2)blocking platinum elec 2) trodes on the sample.

Above 420°С for AgMgAl(MoO4)3 and above 410°С for AgMgSc(MoO4)3, at all frequencies there is a con 2) siderable  rise  in  conductivity  in  the  form  of  a smoothed kink; as a result, the conductivity at 550°С reaches a value of 8.29 × 10–3 S/cm for AgMgAl(MoO4)3 and 2.58 × 10–2 S/cm for AgMgSc(MoO4)3 with an acti 2) vation energy of 0.3–0.4 eV (Table 2). These values are characteristic of superionic states and are close to the conductivity  parameters  of  the  best  state 2)of 2)the 2)art sodium 2)ion conductors [10]. The rise in conductivity with increasing tervalent octahedral cation radius (R = Al  or  Sc)  is  on  account  of  the  structural  features  of NASICON 2)like  phases,  whose  structure  is  a  three 2) dimensional framework built of corner 2)sharing MoO4 tetrahedra and octahedra of doubly or triply charged cations. The framework is penetrated by two types of channels (type I and type II); normal to these chan 2) nels,  there  is  a  zigzag  net  of  type  III  channels.  The positions  of  singly  charged  silver  cations,  which  bal 2) ance  the  excess  charge  of  the  framework,  lie  inside voids formed by the intersection of type I and type II channels  with  type  III  channels.  Silver  cations  ran 2) domly occupy these positions and are responsible for the  electrical  conductivity  of  the  compounds  under study.  The  ion  radii  of  the  structure 2)forming  cations have a great effect on the ion 2)conductive properties of compounds and solid solutions that have rhombohe 2) dral frameworks, because an octahedral edge and an edge  of  one  of  the  tetrahedra  are  at  the  same  time edges of the polyhedron under consideration and dictate  both  the  size  of  “bottleneck”  of  conductivity channels and the volume of the polyhedron itself [1, 6–8, 10, 11]. Thus, to the increasing cation size there corresponds a trend to rise in ion conductivity; that is, to the maximal ion radius (rSc(VI) = 0.745 Å), there cor 2) responds  the  highest  conductivity.  In  the  framework with R3+ having a smaller radius (rAl(VI) = 0.53 Å), silver cations are more “jammed” with the correspondingly lower conductivity of the aluminum 2)containing phase of variable composition (Fig. 3).

Before the superionic transition (before the kink) in  the  Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3  solid  solution  series, electrical conductivity increases as х rises from 0 to 0.5 (Fig.  4).  This  trend  is  associated  with  the  fact  that additional  vacancies  that  appear  in  the  major  silver positions (these positions are populated at room tem 2) perature) have a positive effect on the ability of silver cations to move freely through voids along conductiv 2) ity channels. In the high 2)temperature range, there is a more  uniform  distribution  of  charge  carriers  over  all positions. It is for this reason that a maximal conduc 2) tivity in Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3 samples, where R = Al  or  Sc,  at  high 2)temperatures  is  observed  for  х  =  0 compositions  (Table  2),  where  there  is  the  greatest amount of silver ions.

Proceeding from the occurrence of a temperature hysteresis  on  σ(1/Т)  curves  in  the  heating–cooling cycle,  the  superionic  transition  in  Ag1 – xMg1 – x R1 + x(MoO4)3, where R = Al or Sc, may be interpreted as a diffuse first 2)order phase transition. We should note that all structural alterations occur in the sublattice of mobile silver cations. Ag+ ions at low temperatures are located in positions lying on the triple axis, but as tem 2) perature rises they are uniformly distributed over posi 2) tions  in  between,  thereby  shortening  ion 2)hopping length, increasing electrical conductivity, and reduc 2) ing the conductivity activation energy.

To summarize, we have prepared NASICON 2)like solid solutions Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3, where R = Al or Sc and 0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5, and determined their unit cell parameters and thermal stabilities. Electrical conduc 2) tivity has been measured, and   versus reciprocal temperature plots have been constructed for samples having various х values. The Arrhenius σ plots consist of two segments. Conductivity activation energy val 2) ues  have  been  calculated  for  various  temperature ranges. We have found that phases of variable compo 2) sition  Ag1 – xMg1 – xR1 + x(MoO4)3  have  dominantly ionic conductivity, which rises as the tervalent cation radius  increases  or  the  amount  of  mobile  silver  ions increases.  High 2)temperature  conductivity  reaches  a value of 10–3 to 10–2 S/cm, and we may regard the tri 2) ple  molybdates  we  have  prepared  as  silver 2)ion 2)con 2) ductive solid electrolytes.
