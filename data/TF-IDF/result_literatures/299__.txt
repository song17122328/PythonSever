As one of the most promising market-oriented cathode materials with  a high specific capacity, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2(NCM622) cathode material has attracted  great  interest  of  researchers  despite  the  need  to  overcome  the  cyclic  capacity  of  persistent  attenuation.  Herein,  Al3+,  Ti4+,  P5+  was  precipitated  on  the  surface  of  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)  2 precursor by wet chemical method, and then calcined at high  temperature to form a compact Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7PO4(LATP) solid electrolyte film on the  surface  of  NCM622.  The  results  of  XRD,  TEM  and  XPS  showed  that  the  inner  layered structure of the cathode material was intact and the surface was covered with  a  solid  electrolyte  film  with  a  thickness  of  about  1.55  nm.  In  order  to  explore  the  influence  of  different  amount  of  LATP  on  NCM622,  0.2wt%,  0.5wt%  and  0.8wt%  LATP were coated on NCM622 surface. The EIS diagram shows that the stability of  NCM622 interface increases with the increase of LATP, but when the coating amount  reaches  0.8wt%,  its  capacity  will  decrease  slightly.The  results  of  electrochemical  performance test show that the capacity retention rate of the modified material with  0.5wt%  LATP  is  95.7%  after  300  cycles  at  1C  (corresponding  specific  capacity  is  148.1  mAh  g-1),  while  that  of  the  unmodified  cathode  material  is  only  68.1%  (corresponding specific capacity is 109.7 mAh g-1). This is mainly due to the excellent  ionic  conductivity  of  LATP  not  only  stabilizes  the  structure  of  the  material  and  reduces the resistance of lithium ion migration, but also absorbs the residual lithium  elements  on  the  surface  of  the  precursor,  forming  a  protective  layer  with  excellent  performance,  which  insulates  the  cathode  material  from  the  corrosion  of  the  electrolyte, and it will provide ideas for the follow-up related strategies.



1. Introduction

As  a  widely  used  clean,  safe  and  convenient  energy,  electric  energy  has  been  integrated with human life and become an indispensable part of human society. With  the  rapid  development  of  electric  vehicles,  portable  electronic  products  and  large-scale energy storage power plants in recent decades, people put forward higher  requirements  for  energy  storage  equipment,  and  urgently  need  to  develop  higher  capacity batteries1-3. In the commercial battery system, the capacity density is limited  mainly  by  the  cathode  material,  so  the  primary  task  is  how  to  realize  the  commercialization of the cathode material with higher capacity. For layered LiCoO2,  spinel LiMn2O4 and olivine LiFePO4, which have been put into the market for a long  time,  they  are  not  only  difficult  to  meet  the  increasing  capacity  requirements  of  human  being,  but  also  difficult  to  overcome  their  shortcomings.  For  example,  the  layered structure of LiCoO2 is easy to collapse4, the Jahn-Teller effect always occurs  in LiMn2O4 5 and LiFePO4 has the characteristics of the low diffusion coefficient of  lithium ion and low electronic conductivity6. Furthermore, the higher capacity battery  materials,  such  as  lithium-rich  manganese-based  cathode  and  lithium-sulfur  battery,  still can only stay in the laboratory stage due to the unsolvable trouble the circulation  capacity  decays  too  fast7,8.  So  the  best  solution  is  to  develop  high-nickel  LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2(NCM622)  cathode  material  at  present.  With  the  increase  of  nickel ion content, the battery capacity has been improved greatly and the use of Co  element has been reduced accordingly, also accompanied by the decrease of the cost  of cathode materials9-11 . However, in the process of repeated cycle, the high valence  Ni4+ in NCM622 cathode material reacts continuously with harmful components such  as hydrofluoric acid in electrolyte, resulting in surface structure distortion and internal  layer structure collapse, which greatly reduces the cycle stability of cathode material  and shortens   the service life of battery12, 13.

Surface  modification  is  the  most  common  and  effective  method  to  solve  the  continuous decline of battery cycle life.

Herein,  all  the  NCM  precursors  are  purchased  from  the  same  commercial  company. Fig.1 schematically illustrates the process of LATP pre-forming electrolyte  film on NCM622 surface, and explains its mechanism of resisting electrolyte erosion  process.The preparation of pre-forming LATP on NCM622 surface was completed in  two  steps.  First,  Al3+,  Ti4+,  P5+  were  precipitated  on  the  surface  of  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)2 precursor by chemical bath method. Then the coated precursor  was mixed with LiOH·H2O and calcined in a tubular furnace to obtain LATP coated  NCM622 cathode material. The specific experimental process is as follows: Firstly,  the  mass  of  the  coating  material  is  calculated  according  to  the  proportion  of  the  coating  material  LATP  to  the  precursor  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2  (OH)2,  then  the  amount  of  NH4H2PO4,  C16H36O4Ti,  Al  (NO3)3 · 9H2O  is  calculated  according  to  the  mass  of  LATP. In the phase of liquid phase coating, NH4H2PO4 and Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2 (OH)  2  were added into 20ml deionized water and stirred continuously, then ammonia water  was  added  to  adjust  the  pH  to  about  10;  subsequently ， C16H36O4Ti  and  Al(NO3)3·9H2O were added into 10ml anhydrous ethanol and stirred continuously.  Finally, the ethanol solution was added to the precursor solution drop by drop, and the  solution  was  steamed  at  90 ℃   to  obtain  Al3+,  Ti4+,  P5+  co-deposition  on  Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2(OH)2  surface.  In  the  calcination  stage,  the  modified  precursor  and  LiOH · H2O  were  ground  and  mixed  (the  molar  ratio  is  1:1.03).  Then  they  were  calcinated in a tubular furnace for 5 hours at 500℃, then heated to 850℃  and kept  for 12 hours (Oxygen is injected into the calcination process and the heating rate is 5℃  min-1.  The  same  calcination  conditions  are  applied  to  unmodified  precursors).  The  coating quality of LATP in the modified samples was 0.2wt%, 0.5wt% and 0.8wt%  respectively, which were recorded as LATP-0.2, LATP-0.5 and LATP-0.8 (the blank  group was recorded as LATP-0). 2.2. Material characterization

XRD (Japanese science company Rint-2000, Cu Kα radiation, 1.5418 Å) is used  to observe the crystal structure and cell parameters of samples. The set scanning range 

The  surface  morphology  of  is  obtained  by  SEM  (JEOL,JSM-5600LV), and the element distribution on the surface of the material can  be  obtained  by  the  matching  EDS.  In  order  to  further  determine  the  surface  morphology  and  the  crystal  separation  distance  of  the  samples,we  detected  the  samples by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 2100 F).    XPS (Thermo  fisher Scientific, K-Alpha+) was used to determine the valence states of the elements  on the surface of the cathode, and the whole spectrum was corrected by the standard  peak of C1s.  2.3. Electrochemical measurements

First,  the  cathode  materials  NCM622,  super  P  and  polyvinylidene  fluoride  (PVDF) were dried at 60℃  for 6 hours, subsequently mixed evenly at the mass ratio  of 8:1:1. Then, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) was added to grind sufficiently. Finally,  the slurry was evenly coated on the aluminium foil and dried at 70 ℃  for 8 hours.  Battery assemblies were carried out in a glove box with Positive plates, polypropylene  microporous membrane model of Celgard 2400 and battery shells model of CR2025.  The concentration of LiPF6 in the electrolyte is 1mol L-1, and the solvent is a mixture  of two methyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl carbonate (EMC) and andethyl carbonate  (EC) with a volume ratio of 1:1:1. The battery charge and discharge tests were carried  out  on  Neware  battery  test  system.  In  order  to  characterize  the  electrochemical  reaction  process  of  the  cathode,  cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  and  electrochemical  impedance  spectroscopy  (EIS)  were  tested  on  the  electrochemical  workstation  (CHI760E, CH Instruments). The test conditions of cyclic voltammetry are as follows:  the  scan  rate  is  0.1mV  s-1  and  the  voltage  range  is  from  2.6  to  4.3V.    And  all  samples were tested    AC impedance at frequencies ranging from 0.1HZ to 100KHZ  with 4.0V.  3. Results and discussion from the figure that LATP-0.5 is covered with a thin film, while the surface of the  original cathode material is smooth and clean, indicating that LATP is successfully  formed  on  NCM622.  In  order  to  determine  whether  the  coating  process  caused  damage to the material structure, we also carried out a Rietveld refine of LATP-0 and  LATP-0.5  and  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.S3.  The  spectrum  has  not  changed  significantly  before  and  after  coating,  which  indicates  that  the  structure  of  cathode  material has not been destroyed after coating LATP. Fig.2(g) is the XRD pattern of  each sample before and after modification, and the corresponding cell parameters are  listed in Table S1. It can be seen from the enlargement diagram that the (006)/(102)  and (108)/(110) peaks of the four samples split obviously, and the c/a values of the  cell parameters show that all the ratios are greater than 4.9, which indicates that the  electrolyte film pre-formed on the surface of NCM622 has no significant effect on the  structure  of  the  internal  material,  and  the  bulk  still  maintains  good  layered  properties33. The I(003)/I(104) value is used to evaluate the mixing degree of Ni2+ and  Li+. Generally speaking, when the I(003)/I(104) value is greater than 1.2, it is considered  that the mixing degree of nickel and lithium in the positive electrode is very low34. As  shown in Table S1, the cationic mixing degree in all samples is low, but the minimum  I(003)/I(104)  value  shown  by  LATP-0.8  is  1.412,  since  some  of  the  high  valence  ions  enter  into  the  layered  lattice  with  the  increase  of  the  amount  of  modified  material.  This result also corresponds to the magnification of (003) peak that the peak position  of LATP-0.8 moves to a low angle, reflecting the lattice spacing increases according  to the Bragg formula. It is noteworthy that the peak (003) of LATP-0.5 shifted to a  high angle, which may be due to the existence of modified materials. Because the two  strongest peaks of LATP are located at 24.553 and 20.835 respectively, the electrolyte  layer  closely  bound  to  the  surface  of  cathode  material  makes  the  peak  position  of  LATP-0.5 shift to the high angle. In order to obtain more powerful evidence to prove  that  the  coating  product  synthesized  under  the  coating  conditions  is  LATP,  we  synthesized  LATP  under  the  same  experimental  conditions  without  adding  NCM  precursors. The XRD results showed that the synthetic product is LATP, and its XRD  pattern is shown in Fig.S4, which indicates that LATP was successfully coated on the  surface of NCM622.

In order to further understand the microstructure and element distribution before  and  after  modification,  LATP-0  and  LATP-0.5  were  tested  by  high-resolution  transmission  electron  microscopy  (HTEM).
