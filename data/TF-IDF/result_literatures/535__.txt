The effects of spark plasma sintering (SPS) and Na2O-Nb2O5-P2O5 glass additive have been examined for the sintering of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (NASICON) ceramics. Full densification of NASICON ceramics is achieved at ~1045 °C, which is 200 °C lower than that of typical conventional sintering. The glass addition is demonstrated to markedly promote densification without any negative effects on electrical conductivity. Among all the glass-added samples, the 5 wt% glass-added sample sintered at 1045 °C for 30 min by SPS exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C with the lowest activation energy of 0.32 eV. These properties are almost the same as those of conventional NASICON ceramics. Formation of a trace amount of NaNbO3 as a secondary phase in the glass-added ceramics is due to an insolubility of Nb in the NASICON phase, and has little influence on the electrical conductivity.

Requirements for safer and cheaper rechargeable batteries with a higher energy density [[1], [2], [3]] are increasing because of the demand for large-scale applications such as electric vehicles and smart grid storage equipment [[4], [5], [6]]. Sodium batteries combined with solid electrolytes are one option that meets these requirements. For example, Na-S batteries with molten electrode active materials are characterized by excellent charge-discharge cyclability and cost performance comparable to pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Although a typical working temperature of ~350 °C limits their application in mobile devices [7], Na-S batteries with solid active materials that are operable at room temperature (RT) have been investigated in recent years [8,9]. Such the all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) might also solve the safety problem and have great potential in many applications [10]. ASSBs are divided into two major categories; oxide- and sulfide-based systems [11]. The oxide-based system has the advantage of better chemical stabilities against ambient oxygen and water as compared with the sulfide-based system. However one of its major problems is the insufficient conductivity of electrolytes and interfaces with electrode active materials [12,13]. NASICON with the general formula Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 < x < 3) is one of the most promising solid electrolytes in the sodium system. It is known that the chemical composition x = ~2 crystallizes in a monoclinic system and exhibits a maximum conductivity of ~1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at RT. Typical sintering temperatures of NASICON are >1200 °C [[14], [15], [16]].

Similar to NASICON, sintering of sodium-ion electrolytes generally requires high temperatures. Pressureless sintering of β″-alumina, which has been commercially employed in Na-S batteries, is typically carried out at 1650 °C. [17] Koganei et al. obtained β″-alumina ceramics with >98% of the theoretical density at a reduced sintering temperature of 1400 °C by employing the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. [18] Their sample showed an excellent total conductivity of 1.9 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is comparable to a β″-alumina single crystal. Co-sintering of oxide materials to construct an ASSB is further challenging because these component materials usually have different crystal structures, optimum thermal treatment temperatures, and different expansion coefficients [19]. The SPS technique might be effective for one-step assembly of bulky oxide-based ASSBs [20]. Indeed, Lalère et al. [21] reported the fabrication of an ASSB with a NASICON electrolyte using the SPS technique, obtaining a good interface between electrode and electrolyte materials. However the NASICON electrolyte sintered at 900 °C only showed a limited ionic conductivity of 1.5 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 200 °C, probably due to an insufficient sinterability. Although Na3Zr2Si2PO12 ceramics with a total conductivity comparable to conventionally sintered samples were obtained by employing SPS, the sintering temperature was not that much lower than 1200 °C [22], which is still too high compared with the synthesis temperature range of 550–900 °C of electrode materials [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]].

Very recently, Hayashi and Tatsumisago's group obtained NASIOCN-based ceramics with a RT conductivity of 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 by sintering at temperatures as low as 700 °C promoted by Na3BO3 additive that forms a liquid phase [35]. The conductivity was further enhanced to 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 by increasing the sintering temperature to 900 °C [36]. The successful enhancement of the conductivity by the addition of glassy or low-melting point oxide additives suggests the importance of examining other additives as well as establishing the working principles for oxide additive-promoted densification in such oxide matrices with complex chemical compositions.

This study examines full densification of NASICON-based ceramics with a conductivity of >10−3 S cm−1 at RT by SPS at <1000 °C. Na2O-Nb2O5-P2O5 (Na-Nb-P) glass additives are employed to reduce the densification temperature. Na-Nb-P glass has a melting point of 730 °C and an ionic conductivity of 2.6 × 10−7 S cm−1 at RT. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that a porous NASICON ceramic precursor was densified by a post impingement of the Na-Nb-P glass [37]. In this study, the glass and NASICON matrix are premixed before the sintering. The glass phase is expected to react with the NASICON and be disappeared by the sintering so that the negative effects of the presence of the glass phase on the electrochemical performance will be minimized.

60Na2O-10Nb2O5-30P2O5 glass was obtained using the conventional melt-quenching method. NaH2PO4·H2O (Purity of 99%; Product ID of 192-02815; supplied by Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. Osaka, Japan), Na2CO3 (99.8%; 199-01585; Wako) and Nb2O5 (99.9%; NB004PB; Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Saitama, Japan) were mixed and put into an alumina crucible. A melt obtained by heating at 900 °C for 2 h was poured onto an iron plate in air for quenching to form the glass. Next the glass was ground using an alumina mortar, and then pulverized together with zirconia balls with a diameter of 4 mm (3YTZ; Nikkato, Japan) in 50 mL zirconia pots using a planetary ball mill (PULVERISETTE 7 classic line, Fritsch, Germany) at 500 rpm for 15 min. Finally the powder was passed through a 45-mesh (with an opening of 355 μm) sieve.

NASICON powder with an approximated chemical composition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 were prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. Raw Na3PO4·12H2O powder (99%; NAH15XB; Kojundo) was heated at 300 °C. The dehydrated Na3PO4 powder was mixed with ZrO2 (99.9%; ZR002PB; Kojundo) and SiO2 (99.9%; SI007PB; Kojundo) using a ball mill (PULVERISETTE 6 classic line; Fritsch) with the zirconia ball and ethanol in a 500 mL nylon pot at 150 rpm for 1 h. After drying, the mixture was put in an alumina crucible and calcined at 1100 °C for 12 h in air. The product was pulverized at 200 rpm for 18 h using the ball mill, and passed through a 270-mesh (53 μm gap) sieve to remove coarse grains. The powder was then dried and further passed through a 45-mesh sieve. Mixed powders of NASICON and glass with 2, 5 and 10 wt% content were prepared using the ball mill at 250 rpm for 30 min, followed by sieving.

The sintering was performed by SPS technique. A glass-added powder with a weight of ~1.3 g was put into a set of graphite die with an inner diameter of 10 mm and relevant plungers, and this assembly was set in a SPS apparatus (SPS-515B, Fuji Electronic Industrial, Japan). The SPS chamber was evacuated to a background pressure of 6 Pa, and a uniaxial pressure of 40 MPa was applied onto the graphite plungers. Sintering temperature was set in a range from 800 to 1000 °C. The temperature was controlled with a radiation thermometer, which was calibrated by a direct measurement using a thermocouple. The heating rate was 100 °C min−1 and the holding time was 30 min. For the sample without the glass additive, SPS was performed under the following conditions: weights of 1.4–1.5 g; a uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa; and sintering temperatures of 900–1200 °C.

For a comparison, conventionally-sintered (CS) NASICON without the glass additive was prepared. The calcined NASICON powder was formed into a 20 mmϕ disc under a uniaxial pressure of 50 MPa, followed with cold isostatic pressing at 200 MPa for 5 min. The disc was sintered at 1270 °C for 12 h in air. During sintering, the disc was buried in a powder bed of the same NASICON powder in an alumina crucible to prevent volatilization of sodium.

Density of samples without open pores was measured by the Archimedes method using deionized water, while the density of samples with open pores was estimated from their weight and dimensions. Crystalline phases were identified by X-ray diffractometry (XRD; D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany). Rietveld refinement was performed using Topas software. Chemical analysis was carried out by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA; EPMA-1500, Shimadzu, Japan) and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) equipped with a wave-dispersive detector (Supermini KEK/09, Rigaku, Japan). Microstructure of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-5200, Hitachi, Japan). The surface of the samples was ground and finished by a diamond abrasive paste with 1 μm in granular size, and then thermally etched by annealing at temperatures around 1000 °C to highlight grain boundaries. Special care was taken to avoid grain growth. The average grain size was evaluated from >300 grains in SEM images, which were processed using ImageJ software, taken from different parts of a sample.

Pt electrodes were formed by sputtering (E-1045; Hitachi, Japan) for the conductivity measurement. The conductivity in the temperature range of 25 to 95 °C was measured using a electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (SI 1260 Solartron, UK) in a frequency range of 102 to 107 Hz. Cyclic voltammetry measurements (HSV-110; Hokuto Denko, Japan) were performed in a semi-blocking cell consisting of a Na anode and Pt counter electrode in a linear sweep range from −0.1 to 4.1 V versus Na+/Na and a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The counter electrode was formed by sputtering of Pt on one ceramic surface. The anode was prepared by attaching a metallic sodium foil on the other surface by uniaxial pressing at 20 MPa.

Results of thermogravimetric-differential thermal analyses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the Na-Nb-P glass are provided in Fig. S1. The glass has a glass transition temperature of 497 °C and a melting point of 730 °C. Crystallization (~500–580 °C) occurs during heating (10 K min−1) above the glass transition temperature. Its ionic conductivity at RT is 2.6 × 10−7 S cm−1.

Fig. 1 shows the density of ceramic samples against the sintering temperature. The relative density was calculated by assuming the chemical composition was fixed at Na3Zr2Si2PO12 with a theoretical density of 3.269 g cm−3. [38] The density of the CS sample (an open square in Fig. 1) was 3.18 g cm−3, which corresponds to the relative density of 97.3%. Practically, a ceramic becomes gas-tight when the relative density exceeds ~95%, which corresponds to 3.11 g cm−3 for Na3Zr2Si2PO12.

Filled circles show the densities of SPS-samples without the glass additive. The density increases with increasing SPS temperature. A density of 3.17 g cm−3 (97.0%), which exceeds the gas-tight criterion, was achieved at a temperature of 1210 °C, indicating that SPS is effective in reducing the sintering temperature as compared with the CS sample. However, the density of 2.70 g cm−3 (82.6%) at 1045 °C was obviously not enough for this criterion. Open symbols indicate the glass-added sample data. The densities at 1045 °C for 2, 5 and 10 wt% samples were 3.18 g cm−3 (relative density of 97.3% with assuming total chemical composition of Na3Zr2Si2PO12), 3.20 g cm−3 (97.9%) and 3.16 g cm−3 (96.7%), respectively. SPS assisted by glass additives is effective in reducing the densification temperature to ~1045 °C.

The density of the glass-added samples generally increases with increasing SPS temperature. However, the density of the 10 wt% samples exhibited a maximum value of 3.21 g cm−3 (98.2%) at 990 °C. Its sintering promotion effect is not much different from that of the 5 wt% sample. The possible reasons for this dependency are 1) squeezing out of glass components by the pressure application and 2) hindering of closed-pores annihilation by the enhanced grain growth at elevated temperatures. Sodium evaporation is unlikely to be the cause, because it usually becomes significant above 1200 °C. [39] Further details will be discussed later. The effect of the SPS holding time was investigated in the 10 wt% samples at 990 °C (Supplemental S2). The density of the sample reached 3.18 g cm−3 (97.2%) by holding for only 5 min, and gradually increased with the holding time, suggesting that SPS assisted by glass additives is effective for low-temperature rapid sintering. The density data are summarized in Table 2.

Fig. 2a shows XRD patterns of sinters without a glass additive. The calcined powder reacted at 1100 °C is mainly composed of a monoclinic NASICON phase (JCPDS No. 00-035-0412) and a small amount of unidentified residual phases, as indicated by filled triangles, which likely relates to Na-P-O compounds such as Na3PO4. [40] The CS sample sintered at 1270 °C contained a small amount of ZrO2 (filled circles; JCPDS File No. 00-036-0420). The amount of ZrO2 was estimated to be 4.0 wt% by a Rietveld analysis (Supplemental S3). In the SPS sample without the glass additive, the amount of ZrO2 increased with increasing SPS temperature, and reached 4.0 wt% at 1210 °C. This is convincing because the ZrO2 is an equilibrium phase that coexists with the NASICON, and its equilibrium portion increases with increasing temperature at a fixed total chemical composition, due to a nonstoichiometric NASICON phase. [41]

XRD patterns of the glass-added samples, which are collected under the same measurement condition, are shown in Fig. 2b and c. As compared with the CS sample, the intensity of the ZrO2 signal was weaker in the glass-added samples (Fig. 2b). This tendency is ascribed to the decrease in the equilibrium ZrO2 content. In addition, a small amount of NaNbO3 (filled star; ICSD No.190965) was present in the glass-added samples [37]. The peak width in the XRD pattern gives a measure of crystallinity. In general, samples with lower glass content, e.g. 2 wt%, or lower sintering temperature, e.g. 935 °C, were found to have lower crystallinity. These samples contain the unidentified phase (filled triangle) that is similar to the calcined powder, and thus the lower crystallinity is principally due to an incomplete reaction to form the NASICON phase. The higher crystallinity was obtained in the samples with 5–10 wt% glass sintered at 1045–1155 °C. This trend indicates that the addition of glass as well as the higher sintering temperature contributed to enhancing the reaction to form the NASICON phase with higher crystallinity.

To observe the distribution of the glass component, the 10 wt%–990 °C sample was characterized by EPMA and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Segregation of Nb and depletion of Si and Zr were found at the pores. Concentrations of Na and P were not always correlated with the Nb-enriched parts: some parts were enriched together with Nb, while some parts were depleted. These observations suggest that the glass component was inhomogeneously incorporated into the NASICON crystal, and the Nb tends to segregate on the surface of pores, part of which may lead to formation of a NaNbO3 phase. It is also expected that Nb preferably segregates at the grain boundary. However, this was not directly observed due to the spatial resolution of the apparatus. In addition, some parts were enriched with Na and P, which likely correspond to the unidentified phase indicated by filled triangles in Fig. 2a and b.

Table 1 summarizes the results of Rietveld refinements and XRF for selected samples. The lattice constants were almost unchanged against the amount of the glass additive; only the decrease in the unit cell volume by 0.2% was found in the 10 wt% glass sample. The amount of NaNbO3 estimated by the Rietveld analysis exceeded the total amount of Nb determined by the XRF. This is in part due to a limitation in accuracies of the two techniques, and suggests that Nb is not incorporated into the NASICON crystal but crystallized into the NaNbO3 phase. Such presence of the secondary crystalline phase may impede the densification, which is likely to be related to the density drop seen in the 10 wt% sample.

When the glass component is incorporated into the NASICON crystal, the P5+ ion occupancy in the tetrahedral site (Si4+ and P5+ site) will increase. A doping of another glass component of the Nb5+ ion most likely occupies the octahedral site (Zr4+ site). However this contribution is expected to be limited as described above. Extra positive charge caused by these dopings may be compensated for by a decrease in the occupancies of the Na+ ion, possibly leading to the decrease in the Na+ ion conductivity.

SEM images of cross-sectional surfaces are shown in Fig. 4. The CS sample exhibited a densified microstructure with heterogeneous square grains (Fig. 4a). The average grain size was 2.4 μm. These grains were crystallized well but some large pores remained. The SPS sample without glass sintered at 1210 °C showed a more densified microstructure (Fig. 4b) with a smaller average grain size of 1.0 μm. In contrast, the SPS sample sintered at 1045 °C (Fig. 4c and d) contained many pores and irregular shaped grains. The poor crystallization of this sample agrees with the XRD result. Despite the same SPS temperature of 1045 °C, the 5 and 10 wt% samples consisted of well-densified heterogeneous square grains. Their average grain sizes were 0.26 and 0.28 μm, respectively. Thus, the glass addition markedly promotes densification and crystallization with grain growth suppression.

All samples were pure ionic conductors with a transference number of >99.9%, which was confirmed by a chronoamperometry test under the application of a constant voltage of 1 V (Supplemental S4). Fig. 5a shows the impedance spectrum for SPS-1045 °C samples measured at 25 °C. The bulk resistance, Rbulk, grain boundary resistance, Rgb, and total resistance, Rtotal = Rbulk + Rgb, were estimated by the fitting of an equivalent circuit model (the inset of Fig. 5a) to the experimental data. The equivalent circuit model is composed of Rbulk, Rgb and electrode interfaces (Rinterface) as well as the relevant parallel capacitance components described by the constant phase elements (CPEgb and CPEinterface). Fig. 5b also compares impedance spectra of glass-added samples prepared by SPS at 1045 °C, and the dependence of the glass additive on Rbulk and Rgb is plotted in Fig. 5c, in which the two resistance values are normalized by the sample dimensions. Both resistance components have the minimum values at 5 wt%.

Bulk and total conductivities of selected samples at 25 °C are summarized in Table 2. Fig. 6 compares the total conductivity of the SPS samples. The SPS sample without glass additive (0%) sintered at 1210 °C exhibited a total conductivity of 1.7 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, which is higher by 50% than that (1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1) of the CS sample. Among the glass-added samples, the 5 wt%–1000 °C sample showed the best value of 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1. Overall, the glass addition contributed to a reduction in the SPS temperature of ~200 °C. The optimum condition, that is compatible with conductivity in the order of 10−3 S cm−1, was located at the 2%–5% and a sintering temperature of 990–1045 °C.

The activation energy was estimated from Arrhenius plots of total electrical conductivity (Supplemental S7), and listed in Table 2. SPS samples without the glass additive exhibited 0.28–0.41 eV. Samples with higher RT conductivity have a trend of lower activation energy. The glass-added samples exhibit activation energies in the range of 0.32 to 0.40 eV, and also show the same trend, which is due to the reduction in the grain boundary resistivity. The mean value of ~0.35 eV is almost the same as that of CS Na3Zr2Si2PO12 shown in the literature [16]. Among all the glass-added samples, the 5 wt%–1045 °C sample showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C and the lowest activation energy of 0.32 eV.

The electrochemical window and stability against the Na metal anode for the glass-added NASICON electrolyte were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, and the results for the 5 wt%–1045 °C sample are shown in Fig. 7. (Data for 10 wt%–1045 °C and CS samples are provided in Supplemental S6.) Reversible sodium plating and stripping currents were observed below and above 0 V. No other oxidation and reduction currents were observed up to 4.1 V. The Nb5+ ion in the secondary phase of NaNbO3 is the possible redox species in this potential range, because the redox potential of Nb3+/Nb, and Nb5+/Nb3+ is 1.60 and 2.34 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively. However, it is most likely that the NaNbO3 is stable and exhibits no noticeable valence change in this potential range. Essentially the same results were observed in the 10 wt% sample.

The effect of the glass additive and its optimal content of 5 wt% is explained as follows. It is evident that the glass addition promotes densification due to the liquid phase sintering process. The densification contributes to the reduction of both bulk and grain boundary resistances effectively. Since the Na-Nb-P glass has a lower conductivity compared with the NASICON phase, presence of the residual glass inter-granular layer may markedly increase the grain boundary resistance. However, the combination of NASICON and Na-Nb-P glass leads to the annihilation of the glass phase during sintering through the incorporation of the glass component to the NASICON, which forms the minor NaNbO3 phase, and thus the harmful effect of the glass on the grain boundary resistance might be minimized. Thus the sintered products are interpreted to be essentially the same as the conventional NASICON ceramics except for the inclusion of NaNbO3. The amount of NaNbO3 increases and the grain growth is suppressed with increasing glass additive content. These effects enhance the grain boundary resistance as shown in Fig. 5c. The value of 5 wt% results from the balance of the promoted densification and the enhancement of grain boundary resistance with increasing glass additive content.

SPS and Na-Nb-P glass additive are effective in reducing the densification temperature of NASICON ceramics to ~1045 °C, which is ~200 °C lower than the typical conventional sintering temperature. For example, SPS of a 5 wt% glass-added sample at 1045 °C resulted in a relative density of 97.9%. The glass promotes the densification and suppresses the grain growth, leading to a more compacted microstructure. Although the secondary phases of ZrO2 and NaNbO3 are formed in the glass-added samples after sintering, little influence was observed in the lattice parameters of the NASICON phase, suggesting the absence of Nb incorporation in the NASICON phase and little influence on the bulk conductivity. Among the glass-added samples, 5 wt%–1045 °C showed the highest ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C and the lowest activation energy of 0.32 eV. The combination of SPS and sintering aid of Na-Nb-P glass is effective for reducing the co-sintering temperature of the NASICON electrolyte and electrode materials.
