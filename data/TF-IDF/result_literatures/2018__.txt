Dependence of Ionic Conductivity on Composition of Fast Ionic Conductors Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3, 0 e x e 0.7. A

Materials with nominal compositions Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3, 0 e x e 0.7, have been prepared and studied with X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electrical impedance techniques. Substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+ reduces the unit cell dimensions of the NASICON framework but enhances the grain interior conductivity. The overall conductivity is dominated by the grain boundary composition. Detection of new broad peaks in the 31P and 27Al MAS NMR spectra supports the formation of an amorphous Li-conducting phase that accounts for the increase observed in the overall conductivity. In samples with x > 0.5, crystallization of Li4P2O7 as a segregated phase is accompanied by the appearance of a new electrical response. In these samples, a decrease in overall conductivity, associated with a modification of the amorphous phase, is also observed.

Lithium-ion-conducting solids are materials of increasing interest because of their possible use as solid electrolytes in high-energy solid-state batteries. Compounds with the NASICON (Na superionic conductor) 2(PO4)3, with M ) Ge, structure1 and the formula LiMIV Ti, Sn, Zr, and Hf, have been extensively studied2-6 because of their good ionic conductivity. The NASICON framework is built up of M2(PO4)3 units in which two MO6 octahedra are linked to three PO4 tetrahedra by shared oxygens. The usual symmetry is rhombohedral, space group R3hc, although in compositions with M ) Sn, Zr, Hf, a triclinic phase has been reported.7-9 In the rhombohedral phase, there are two different sites for alkali cations: (1) M1 sites surrounded by six oxygen atoms and located at inversion centers and (2) M2 sites surrounded by 10 oxygen and disposed symmetrically around ternary axes. Both sites are arranged in an alternating way along conducting channels. In rhombohedral LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 compounds, a preferential occupancy of the M1 sites has been deduced from neutron diffraction (ND) experiments.10,11

During the past few years, particular attention has been paid to titanium-based materials with the NASICON structure Li1+xTi2-xNx(PO4)3, LiTi2-xMx(PO4)3, and Li1-xTi2-xRx(PO4)3, where N, M, and R stand for tri-, tetra-, and pentavalent cations, respectively.12-20 Aono et al.12 showed that the conductivity was greatly enhanced upon substitution of Ti4+ by N3+ cations such as Al, Ga, Cr, In, Sc, Fe, and Y. The maximum conductivity obtained at 298 K was 7  2) 10-4 S cm-1 in Li1.3M0.3Ti1.7 (PO4)3, where M is Al or Sc. The same authors showed that an addition of Li2O or Li4P2O7 as a binder increased the density of the pellets and improved the overall conductivity of the samples considerably.12,21 In recent studies on Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 compounds, Wong et al.13 identified the formation of a minor AlPO4 phase that enhanced the sintering of pellets. However, the factors responsible for the improvement of the intrinsic and overall conductivities of

the Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 series are not yet well understood.

In this work, Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 samples in the compositional range 0 e x e 0.7 have been prepared and studied by XRD, NMR, and electric impedance techniques. The true composition of the materials is discussed, and the presence of secondary phases is analyzed. The information obtained on pellet composition has been correlated with the ionic conductivity. For that purpose, the grain interior and overall conductivities along the mentioned series were measured.


Samples were prepared by heating at 950 °C stoichiometric mixtures of Li2CO3 (g99%), TiO2 (99%), Al2O3 (99.99%), and (NH4)2HPO4 (g99%). The reagents were first dried at 120 °C for 10 h and then mixed and heat treated in a platinum crucible at 180, 300, 500, 700, 800, 900, and 950 °C. After each treatment, the mixtures were ground in an agate mortar and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The samples were stored for later use when the characteristic X-ray peaks of the reagents and/or intermediate compounds such as pyrophosphates were not detected.

X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded at room temperature with Cu KR radiation in a PW-1710 Phillips diffractometer. Data were taken in the 10° e 2ı e 70° range with 0.02° per step and a count of 0.5 s at each step. A small amount of Si (NIST, a ) 5.439 040 Å) was mixed with the sample in a second run to determine the correction to be applied to the peak positions. Lattice parameters were deduced by fitting the XRD patterns with the TREOR program.

Two-probe impedance measurements were carried out in a 1260 Solartron impedance/gain phase analyzer. The frequency range used was 5-107 Hz. The measurements were made on sintered cylindrical pellets, obtained by cold pressing the powder samples and sintering them at 1000 °C for 24 h. Platinum was used as the electrode. The conductivity of the samples was measured in the temperature range 150-300 K in an Oxford cryostat. All measurements were done with the pellets under a dried nitrogen atmosphere.

7Li, 27Al, and 31P MAS NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature in an MSL-400 Bruker spectrometer. The frequencies used for 7Li, 27Al and 31P were 155.50, 104.26, and 161.97 MHz, respectively. Samples were spun at 4 and 10 kHz, and spectra were recorded after  240)/2 pulse irradiation ( 24)4  237)s). The recycle time between successive scans was 10 s for lithium and 5 s for aluminum and phosphorus. The number of scans was in the range of 40-800. The 7Li, 27Al, and 31P chemical shift values are given relative to 1 M LiCl, 1 M AlCl3, and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solutions. The fitting of the NMR spectra was carried out with the Bruker WINFIT program.22 For quantitative purposes, the sum of the integrated intensities of the spinning sidebands corresponding to each component was determined.

1. X-ray Powder Diffraction. XRD patterns of Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 samples in the range 0 e x e 0.7 are given in Figure 1a. The more intense reflections, which correspond to a rhombohedral symmetry (R3hc space group), are ascribed to the NASICON-type compounds. For increasing Al contents, the XRD reflections shift toward higher 2ı positions, indicating a decrease in the unit cell dimensions. The a and c parameters of the corresponding hexagonal cell decrease as the Al content increases; however, for x e 0.3, the variation of

the c parameter is more important than that of the a parameter (Figure 1b). For x > 0.3, the variation of both parameters becomes less important.

For x g 0.2, a small XRD reflection is observed at 2ı ) 22° (asterisks in Figure 1a). For x g 0.5, other new reflections are detected in the X-ray patterns (marks in Figure 1a) that indicate the formation of new crystalline phases. The intensities of these reflections increase as the Al content increases.

2. NMR Spectroscopy. 27Al MAS NMR Spectroscopy. 27Al (I ) 5/2) MAS NMR spectra are formed by lines corresponding to the five possible nuclear transitions, modulated by equally spaced spinning sidebands as-

Peaks corresponding to aluminum phosphate and lithium phosphate are denoted by A and B, respectively.

sociated with the rotation of the sample (not shown). The central line of the spectra is formed by two components (Figure 2). The more intense component at  228)  25) -15 ppm corresponds to aluminum in octahedral coordination (AlO). The component at  228)  25) 40 ppm is ascribed to aluminum in tetrahedral coordination (AlT). The positions of the two components along the series are given in Table 1.

As the Al content increases, the intensity of the AlT band increases, and its position shifts slightly toward more positive values. However, in samples with xAl ) 0.5 and 0.7, this component shifts in the opposite sense and becomes broader. At the same time, another AlO component is detected at -17 ppm, indicating the formation of new phases.

31P MAS NMR Spectroscopy. 31P (I ) 1/2) MAS NMR spectra of the analyzed samples are shown in Figure 3. For x ) 0, a single line at -27.5 ppm is observed. For

higher x, the line shifts toward more positive values and becomes asymmetrically broadened. This indicates the presence of other components.

In Figure 3, a deconvolution of the 31P NMR spectra is given. For each sample, the line width and the separation between adjacent components were assumed to be constant. To describe the asymmetry of the main component of the samples with x < 0.2, two bands were used (peaks labeled 0 and 0¢ ). In agreement with previous works,23 the shift produced by substitution of Ti by Al was assumed to be additive, allowing for the identification of components associated with the P(OTi)4, P(OTi)3(OAl)1, P(OTi)2(OAl)2, P(OTi)1(OAl)3, and P(OAl)4 environments (bands labeled by the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, in Figure 3). We observe that the

intensity of the components located at less negative values becomes more intense as the aluminum content increases.

In the spectra of the samples with x g 0.2, another component of low intensity at approximately -29 ppm (line A) is detected; the intensity of this line increases as the Al content increases. In the spectra for x ) 0.5 and 0.7, a new broad component at -20 ppm is also detected (line B). The positions of the components obtained after deconvolution of the spectra are given in Table 1.

7Li MAS NMR Spectroscopy. 7Li (I ) 3/2) MAS NMR spectra of the samples are shown in Figure 4. The spectra are formed by a central line (-1/2, 1/2 transition) and two satellite lines (-3/2, -1/2 and 1/2, 3/2 transitions). Central and satellite lines are modulated by equally spaced spinning sidebands, the powder patterns of samples being reproduced by connecting the tops of the sidebands.

The full-width at half-maximum of the central transition is near 450 Hz in the static 7Li NMR spectra (not shown). This parameter is considerably reduced when Li-P and Li-Li dipolar interactions are eliminated in MAS NMR experiments. In the inset of Figure 4, the central component of the 7Li MAS NMR spectra of the series is shown. The line width of this component is almost constant for x e 0.2 but increases for x > 0.2. At the same time, a progressive shift of this component from -1.20 to -0.71 ppm is observed (Table 1). The increase in the line width is indicative of the presence of other environments for Li. In the case of x ) 0.7, two components at -1 and 0 ppm are resolved.

Spinning sideband patterns were used to determine the quadrupole constant (CQ) and the asymmetry parameter (Ł), both of which characterize the structural sites occupied by Li (see Table 1). Above x ) 0.3, the number of spinning sidebands increases, indicating the presence of another phase. In samples with x ) 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, the 7Li MAS NMR spectra are formed by two (1) ) 40 kHz components, with quadrupole constants CQ and CQ (1) parameter of NASICON compounds is observed along the series (Table 1).

3. Impedance Measurements. The angular frequency dependence of the conductivity for the x ) 0.2 sample is shown in Figure 5a. At 280 K, three regimes

are observed: (i) an ill-defined dispersive regime below 102 s-1; (ii) a plateau in the frequency range 102-104 s-1, followed by a dispersive regime at around 106 s-1; and (iii) an ill-defined plateau at about 107 s-1, followed again by a dispersive regime. These three features correspond to the spike and the lowand high-frequency arcs observed in the impedance plots (not shown). At lower temperatures, 150 and 210 K, the three features are shifted toward lower frequencies. The experimental data were fitted with the expression  243)* ) 1/(1/ 243)1* + 1/ 243)2*)

where the first asterisk stands for the overall complex conductivity and  243)1* and  243)2* account for grain interior

From the analysis of the overall conductivity of the Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 series vs the Al content, a maximum in conductivity at x ) 0.2 is observed (Table 2). Other authors have also reported this maximum; however, the causes responsible for this behavior are not wellknown.12,25 To understand the two regimes associated with the maximum, samples having different Al contents were studied by XRD and NMR techniques.

Samples with x e 0.2. The X-ray diffraction patterns of these samples were indexed by using the hexagonal unit cell of the NASICON-type compounds (hexagonal setting of the R3hc space group). The progressive substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+ reduces the parameters of the hexagonal cell (Figure 1), in agreement with the smaller size of Al3+ (0.54 Å) compared to Ti4+ (0.60 Å).26 This substitution is confirmed by the presence of octahedrally coordinated aluminum (AlO) in the 27Al NMR spectra. Thus, the NMR spectra show the line at approximately -15 ppm that is ascribed to Al located at the octahedral sites, which are occupied only by Ti4+ in the undoped LiTi2(PO4)3 member.13 Taking into account that each PO4 tetrahedron in the NASICON framework shares its oxygens with four MO6 (M ) Ti, Al) octahedron, the identified 31P NMR components were ascribed to the environments 4Ti, 3Ti1Al, 2Ti2Al, 1Ti3Al, and 4Al. The quantitative analysis of the NMR spectra allowed for an estimation of the Al content in the NASICON phases. The Al/Ti ratio was calculated according to the expression23

where In (n ) 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) represents the intensity of the bands associated with (4 n)Ti(n)Al environments (Table 1). From the Al/Ti ratios, the octahedral Al content, x, was deduced and compared with the nominal

and grain boundary contributions, respectively. To reproduce the overall conductivity,  243)1* and  243)2* were assumed to adopt the form24  243)dc + B(i 246))n. As an example, the fitting obtained at 210 K is shown as a solid line in Figure 5a. In this way, we separately estimated the dc conductivities for the grain interior and for the grain boundary, the latter being almost coincident with the overall dc conductivity of the pellet.

Variations of the grain interior and overall dc conductivity vs reciprocal temperature (1000/T) are shown for samples with x e 0.2 in Figure 5b. The experimental data are fitted to the Arrhenius expression

where  243)0 is a preexponential factor, E is the activation energy, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Values of  243)0 and E deduced from the fittings are reported in Table 2.

The frequency dependence of the conductivity for the x ) 0.5 sample, measured at 200 K, is shown in Figure 6. This plot is similar to that obtained for the x ) 0.7 sample. We observe three plateaus marked by arrows: a well-defined plateau at low frequency and two illdefined plateaus at higher frequencies. The dc conduc-

(c) Plot of Li content vs nominal Al content as deduced from 7Li MAS NMR spectra. The solid lines are the predicted AlO and Li contents for the nominal Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 compositions. content (Figure 7a). It can be observed that, for x e 0.2, aluminum is mainly incorporated, as octahedral AlO, into the NASICON framework. However, for x > 0.2, the experimental data are lower than expected (solid line), indicating that a significant part of Al must be placed outside of the NASICON phase. The presence of tetrahedral aluminum (AlT), as indicated in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra, is responsible for the decrease observed in the AlO/(AlT + AlO) ratio vs the Al content in Figure 7b. This finding was previously ascribed to the segregation of the AlPO4 phase; however, the main XRD peak of this phase, detected at 22° in the XRD patterns, always displayed a low intensity.13 To ascertain the locations of the Li ions, the intensity of the central line of the 7Li MAS NMR spectra, normalized to the amount of sample, is plotted vs x in Figure 7c. We again observe that, below x ) 0.2, lithium is mainly placed into the NASICON framework, as deduced from the good agreement between the experimental (circles) and predicted (solid line) data. However, above x ) 0.2, the experimental data are lower than predicted, indicating again that a part of the Li is placed in phases other than that of the NASICON compounds.

At this point, it is interesting to analyze the conductivity of the samples with x e 0.2. For the grain interior conductivity, plots of the activation energy (E) and preexponential factor ( 243)0) vs x are given in Figure 8a. We observe that  243)0 decreases as x increases, despite the fact that the Li content increases as 1 + x. The decrease in  243)0 cannot explain the increase observed in conductivity along the series. The increase in conductivity must be associated with the decrease observed in E as x increases. However, the decrease found in E differs from the results reported previously in the same series, where

Figure 8. Pre-exponential factor ( 243)0) and activation energy (E) as functions of the Al content: (a) grain interior conductivity, (b) overall conductivity. The solid and dashed lines are guides to the eye.

E does not vary with x.13,27 The observed decrease in E occurs in parallel with a decrease in the size of the hexagonal unit cell. This trend is opposite to that found in stoichiometric LiM2(PO4)3 compounds, where a decrease in E was accompanied by an increase in the hexagonal unit cell parameters.6

In the LiTi2(PO4)3 sample, the Li+ ions preferentially occupy the M1 sites.11 In agreement with this fact, the quadrupole constants deduced from the 7Li NMR spectra, CQ ) 42 kHz and Ł ) 0, are characteristic of undistorted sites with axial In Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 samples, the higher lithium content makes Li ions occupy, in addition to the M1 sites, other more distorted sites between the M1 sites in the conducting paths.5 This fact shortens the Li-Li distance, thus destabilizing the occupancy of the M1 sites and presumably enhancing the Li mobility. In agreement with these predictions, a high mobility of lithium was deduced in all samples from an analysis of the line width of 7Li NMR spectra recorded under static conditions. This finding is similar to that reported previously by Forsyth et al.25 According to this fact, an exchange process between the two structural sites must be

Dependence of Ionic Conductivity on Composition

favored, which would explain the slight increase observed in the averaged quadrupole constant CQ along the series5 (Table 1).

For the overall conductivity, we observe that  243)0 is almost constant but E decreases gradually with x for x e 0.2 (Figure 8b). The decrease of E accounts for the increase observed in conductivity. Although Al and Li are preferentially incorporated into the NASICON framework in the compositional range analyzed, appreciable amounts of the two metals seem to be segregated in a phase that is not detected by the XRD technique. The detection of new broad lines at 40 and -30 ppm in the 27Al and 31P MAS NMR spectra, respectively, suggests that an amorphous aluminum phosphate is formed.29 In this phase, Li+ ions should be incorporated, as deduced from the analysis of the intensity of the central line of 7Li MAS NMR spectra vs aluminum content (Figure 7c). The presence of lithium in the amorphous phase would spread the intensity of the NMR signal over a broad region, reducing the visibility of Li at the center of the spectrum. The formation of a conducting phase at the grain boundaries of the major NASICON phase increases the overall conductivity of the pellets and decreases their porosity.13,25

Samples with x > 0.2. In these samples, the grain interior conductivity does not change appreciably, in agreement with the fact that E and  243)0 remain almost constant (Figure 8a). This observation parallels to the slight variation of the unit cell parameters and indicates that, above x ) 0.2, the amounts of Al and Li incorporated into the NASICON framework are lower than expected. This conclusion is supported by the NMR results, which show lower experimental AlO and Li values than expected from the nominal NASICON compositions (Figure 7). Therefore, some Al and Li must be segregated in other phases. The lack of new reflections in the XRD patterns and the appearance of broad peaks in the 27Al and 31P NMR signals suggest that the segregated Al and Li are located in an amorphous phosphate probably surrounding the NASICON particles.

The nature of the amorphous segregated phase changes drastically along the series. For x > 0.3, the AlT line increases considerably and shifts toward lower values, and a new AlO line is detected in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra (Figure 2). Moreover, the intensity of the new NMR line detected at -29 ppm in the 31P MAS NMR spectra increases with the Al content indicating that the amount of amorphous aluminum phosphate increases significantly. On the other hand, the XRD patterns show the presence of the crystalline Li4P2O7 phase (Figure 1a). This is confirmed by the detection of new components at  24)0 ppm in the 7Li MAS NMR spectra and at -19 ppm in the 31P MAS NMR spectra of the x ) 0.5 and 0.7 samples. The appearance of


Li4P2O7 is accompanied by the newly found electrical response (Figure 6).

The overall conductivity of the pellets decreases as x increases in the compositional range 0.3 < x <0.7. This decrease is associated with the slight decrease observed in  243)0 and the slight increase observed in E (Figure 8b). Because the ionic conductivity of Li4P2O7 is higher than the overall (grain boundary) conductivity, the formation of this crystalline phase should not produce any decrease in the overall conductivity of the pellet. From this fact, we can establish that the decrease observed in conductivity must be ascribed to a modification of the amorphous phase. At first sight, the formation of Li4P2O7 should extract Li from the amorphous phase, thus decreasing the amount of charge carriers and hence decreasing  243)0. However, the increase observed in the activation energy E indicates that the local structure of the amorphous phase is also changed. The formation of an insulating phase similar to AlPO4 among the NASICON particles must block the conducting paths previously established for Li+ ions and must lead to a decrease of the overall conductivity. The observation of a maximum in the overall conductivity of the analyzed series agrees with that reported for other ion-conducting composites.30,31


The complementary use of XRD and NMR techniques has permitted the analysis of nominal Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 samples and the detection of secondary phases formed during their preparation. For samples with x e 0.2, substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+ in the Ti-based NASICONs Li1+xTi2-xAlx(PO4)3 reduces the unit cell dimensions but increases the amount of Li+ ions and increases the grain interior conductivity. For x > 0.2, the grain interior conductivity does not change appreciably.

In the analyzed samples, the overall conductivity is mainly affected by the composition of the segregated amorphous phase. Below x ) 0.2, the presence of the amorphous lithium-conducting phase between NASICON particles increases the overall conductivity of samples. For x > 0.2, the formation of Li4P2O7 reduces the Li content and modifies the structure of the amorphous phase; both facts account for the decrease observed in the overall conductivity.
