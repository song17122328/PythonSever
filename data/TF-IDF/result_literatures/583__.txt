VO43– anion was used to partially substitute for PO43– in the Nasicon compound of LiSn2(PO4)3 via a sol-gel method. XRD analysis revealed that the VO43–-substituted samples did not have a single LiSn 2(PO4)3 phase, and some secondary phases like SnO2 and SnP2O7 appeared. Introduction of the VO43– anion did not prevent the LiSn2(PO4)3 compound from decomposing during the initial lithiation; however the VO43– anion substitution remarkably enhanced the rate capability and cycling performance of the products because they reduced the charge transfer impedance, increased the lithium ion diffusion, and strengthened the role of the Li3PO4 matrix due to the precipitation of the Li3VO4 phase. Of the substituted samples, the sample with a nominal composition of LiSn 2(PO4)2.5(VO4)0.5 delivered a capacity of 449.2 mA·h/g at a rate of 0.25 C after 25 cycles and 373.8 mA·h/g at 2 C rate. Those values surpassed some previous reports on LiSn2(PO4)3 and the LiSn2(PO4)3/C composites. Accordingly, the partial substitution of phosphorus by vanadium in LiSn2(PO4)3 is a feasible technique to remarkably improve its electrochemical properties.

Sn-based materials are ideal anodic candidates in advanced lithium ion batteries(LIBs) and are the subject of much attention because they can form higher Li-containing alloys (e.g., Li4.4Sn at room temperature, 990 mA·h/g) during lithiation/delithiation than graphite(LiC6, 372 mA·h/g)[1—3]. Unfortunately, these materials are plagued by huge volume changes during electrochemical cycling that produce noticeable mechanical stress and destroy the mechanical robustness of the electrode during the subsequent charge/discharge cycles[4]. The derived exfoliation, pulverizing, cracking, and crumbling of the active materials could quickly cause capacity fading. Except for the structural issue, Courtney et al.[5] found that the cyclic decay in the Sn-based materials was associated with the aggregation of Sn atoms into clusters. Many Sn/matrix systems, such as Sn-M(M=Co, Ni, Cu, etc.) alloys[6—10], SnSO4[11], SnO2[12—15], SnS2[16,17], etc. have been investigated in recent years. The matrix has a great effect on the electrochemical performance of these materials. Accordingly, the optimum structural and composition design should be a prerequisite for those materials with valuable commercial applications. Cui et al.[18] used the decomposition product, Li3PO4, of the Nasicon LiSn2(PO4)3 as a matrix material to improve the cyclability of the Sn anode. A discharging capacity of 320 mA·h/g at 0.25 C was obtained after 50 cycles for the LiSn2(PO4)3, and its Coulombic efficiency was still low, less than 40% for the initial cycle due to side reactions. Based on this, Naren et al.[19] introduced a continuous carbon layer on the surface of the LiSn2(PO4)3 particles, and the prepared LiSn2(PO4)3/C composite electrode offered an improved reversible discharge capacity of 448.6 mA·h/g at 0.25 C and rate capability of 332.6 mA·h/g at 1.25 C. Even so, those values are less than half of the theoretical capacity of the Sn anode. Recent studies on Nasicon solid electrolytes and cathodes revealed that the VO43– anion substitution was a powerful strategy to improve their electrochemical performances[20—23]. Hence, we also expect the VO43– substitution to have analogous effects on the Nasicon-structured LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material. If the introduction of the VO43– anion does not prevent the compound from general decomposition during lithiation/ delithiation, the as-decomposed products should involve Li3VO4, Li3PO4, and Sn for the VO43–-substituted LiSn2(PO4)3. The Li3VO4 with a graphite-like structure is a promising anode material for LIBs with a lower Li insertion potential and reversible structural variation[24,25]. Accordingly, we deduced that the introduction of VO43– anion should not produce parasitic effects on the electrochemical performance for LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material. Here, we used the VO43– anion to substitute for partial PO43– in the Nasicon-structured LiSn2(PO4)3 compound and aimed to improve its electrochemical properties and cyclic stability.

The Nasicon-structured compounds with nominal compositions of LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x(x=0—0.7) were prepared via a sol-gel method. Reagent-grade CH3COOLi·2H2O(Kemiou Chemical, Tianjin, 99%), SnCl4·5H2O(Damao Chemical, Tianjin, 99%), V2O5(Tairuier Chemical, Shanghai, 99%), and NH4H2PO4(Fengchuan Chemical, Tianjin, 98%) were used as starting materials. The CH3COOLi·2H2O, SnCl4·5H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were dissolved into 80 mL DI water to achieve a total metal ions concentration of 0.19 mol/L. The V2O5 and Li2CO3 were dissolved in a stoichiometric ratio of Li3VO4 in 2.2 mol/L HNO3 solution for the samples with x≤0.3, and only V2O5 was dissolved in the HNO3 solution for the samples with x>0.3, maintaining the VO43– concentration of 0.21 mol/L[26]. These two solutions were mixed, and the same amount of citric acid and glycol was added and dissolved in the resulting solution as complexing agent and dispersant, respectively, with the molar ratio of citric acid to metal ions being about 1:1 except for 1.5:1 for the bare sample. The solution was thoroughly stirred and treated with ammonia water(30%) to adjust the pH to about 5. The final solution was heated to 70 °C to evaporate the excess water and form a gel. After holding for 48 h, the gel was calcined at different temperatures to obtain the final products.

The crystalline phases were determined by means of X-ray diffraction(XRD, D8 Discover, Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 8°/min and the electrode scan rate of 2°/min. The relative content of each phase in the samples was calculated based on the strongest peak area in the XRD patterns. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDX) obtained from a JEOL JSM-7100F SEM was used to measure the relative contents of the elements in the samples. X-Ray photoelectron spectra(XPS) of the samples were recorded on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe Scanning XPS Microprobe using Al Kα(hν=1486.6 eV) radiation at a step of 0.2 eV. The scale of binding energy was referenced by setting the binding energy of C1s to 284.80 eV. The as-prepared LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x samples were ball-milled with ketjen black(KB) at a mass ratio of 7:2 for 10 h at 300 r/min. The resulting composite was used to prepare the anode by mixing 90%(mass fraction) of this composite with 10% polyvinylidene fluoride(PVDF) as a binder in a certain amount of N-methyl pyrrolidinone(NMP) to form a homogenous slurry. The resulting slurry was coated onto the Cu foil and dried at 120 °C in vacuum for 16 h. The electrochemical performance of the LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x anode was investigated using CR2032 cells. The cell was composed of a lithium metal counter electrode and a LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x anode separated by Celgard 2400 separator in 1 mol/L solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate-diethyl carbonate(EC:DEC=1:1, volume ratio) electrolyte. The cells were assembled in a glovebox filled with high purity argon. The cells were galvanostatically cycled using LAND CT2001A battery tester between 5 mV and 2 V vs. Li+/Li electrode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) measurements were carried out by applying a potential of 10 mV from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz using Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation.

Fig.1(A) shows XRD patterns of the samples with x=0.5 heated at different temperatures. The main XRD peaks for the sample calcined at 600 °C agree with those of the Nasicon structure and rhombohedral symmetryβ-LiSn2(PO4)3 phase corresponding to the JCPDS No. 87-2078 card in addition to some weak XRD peaks indexed to SnO2 and SnP2O7, respectively. Those results suggest that the sample consists of β-LiSn2(PO4)3 and some SnO2 and SnP2O7. The XRD peaks corresponding to the SnP2O7 and SnO2 phases become weaker, and those of theβ-LiSn2(PO4)3 become stronger with increasing heating temperature. The SnP2O7 peaks disappear over 700 °C, but very weak peaks derived from SnO2 are still identified in the sample heated at 800 °C. Those results suggest that the introduction of VO43– anions weakens the affinity between atoms in the LiSn2(PO4)3 compound and leads to the precipitation of some secondary phases, like SnO2 and SnP2O7. However, no phases attributable to vanadium-containing compounds can be seen in the abovementioned samples, indicating that the introduced VO43– anions should completely dissolve in the β-LiSn2(PO4)3 phase. Therefore, the samples heated over 700 °C are mainly composed ofβ-LiSn2(PO4)3 and a trace of SnO2. Fig.1(B) presents the second charge-discharge profiles for the samples in Fig.1(A) at a discharge rate of 0.25 C. Though all the samples present similar charge/discharge profiles, the samples heated at 650 °C deliver the maximum discharging capacity of 541.7 mA·h/g, which is about 43.9% and 20.9% higher than those of the LiSn2(PO4)3 reported by Cui et al.[18] and Naren et al.[19], respectively. Those results prove that the introduction of VO43– anions improves the electrochemical properties of the LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material, and the presence of the secondary phases like SnO2 and SnP2O7, also being anode materials for LIBs[12—15,27,28], may not play an unexpected effect on the electrochemical properties of the materials. The decrease in discharging capacity should be related to the decreasing reactivity caused by the growth in particle size for the samples heated at temperatures over 650 °C. The XRD patterns of the LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x(x=0—0.7) samples heated at 650 °C are shown in Fig.2. Standard XRD patterns of phases likeα-LiSn2(PO4)3,β-LiSn2(PO4)3, SnO2 and SnP2O7 are also shown for comparison. The XRD peaks associated withβ-LiSn2(PO4)3 are much stronger than those of α-LiSn2(PO4)3 and SnP2O7 for the sample without any VO43–. This result suggests that this sample mainly consists of β-LiSn2(PO4)3 in addition to traceα-LiSn2(PO4)3 and SnP2O7 phases. The introduction of VO43– anions results in the disappearance of theα-LiSn2(PO4)3 phase and the appearance of the SnO2 phase. The XRD peaks due to the SnO2 phase become weaker with an increase in the VO43– content and are difficult to disappear in the high VO43– content samples. Therefore, the VO43–-substituted samples studied here are composite materials consisting ofβ-LiSn2(PO4)3, SnP2O7 and SnO2. A slight shift to the left of the XRD peaks with an increase in the VO43– contents can be resulted from the lattice expansion of the β-LiSn2(PO4)3 due to the replacement of larger V ions(0.0355 nm) for smaller P ions(0.017 nm)[22,23].

Fig.3 shows the EDX results of the elements in the LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x samples. The elements are the same as those of the sample design except for C, which is from the adhesive tape. The calculated V/P molar ratio in every sample is very close to its theoretical one. The V2p core level XPS spectra (Fig.4) were used to investigate the oxidation states of the vanadium in the VO43–-substituted samples. The binding energy corresponding to the V2p3/2 is nearly constant with increasing VO43– content in the range of 517.42—517.85 eV, which agrees with the value for V in the tetrahedra[22,23,29,30]. Those results suggest that the VO43– anions introduced here exist in the form of tetrahedra and substitute for partial PO43– anions in the LiSn2(PO4)3 compound. Fig.5(A) shows the second charge-discharge curves at a rate of 0.25 C for the LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x samples heated at 650 °C. The introduction of VO43– anions increases the charging and discharging capacities. Both capacities increase with an increase in the VO43– content, and a maximum discharging capacity of 541.7 mA·h/g was obtained for the sample at x=0.5. This discharging value is about 49.6% higher than that of the bare sample(362.2 mA·h/g). Further increases in the VO43– content decrease both capacities. Even so, the sample with x=0.7 presents a discharging capacities of 531.7 mA·h/g, which is about 46.8% higher than that of the bare sample. Increasing the rates slightly changes the charging/discharging plateaus for the samples[Fig.5(B)—(D)], but their discharging capacities are apparently decreased. The sample with x=0.5 has a remarkably enhanced rate capability versus the non-VO43–containing sample. Its discharging capacity is about 373.8 mA·h/g at a 2 C rate. This value is about 76.9% higher than that of the bare one and is close to that of the LiSn2(PO4)3 at 0.25 C rate by Cui et al.[18] as well as the LiSn2(PO4)3/C composite electrode at 1 C rate by Naren et al.[19]. These results prove that VO43– substitution can improve the electrochemical properties of the LiSn2(PO4)3 anode.

Fig.5 presents a promising result on the VO43– anion doping for the LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material, precipitation of the SnO2 and SnP2O7 phases in the samples motivated us to determine the real effect caused by adding VO43–. Considering that our samples were micro-particles, the precipitated SnO2 and SnP2O7 should also be micro or sub-micron particles. The second discharging capacity of 1025 mA·h/g at 0.25 C rate reported by Liu et al.[12] on SnO2 nanorods and 500 mA·h/g by Wu et al.[27] on SnP2O7 mesoporous spheres were used to subtract the effect of SnO2 and SnP2O7 phases in our VO43–substituted samples. The calculated discharging capacity of every phase in the samples is shown in Table 1. The sample with a VO43– content of 0.5 has a discharge capacity of 441.5 mA·h/g, which is higher than that reported by Cui et al.[18] on pure LiSn2(PO4)3 and very close to that of the LiSn2(PO4)3/C composite electrode[19]. The electrode was galvanostatically cycled at 0.25 C to further investigate the effect of the VO43– substitution on electrochemical properties of the sample with x=0.5[Fig.6(A)]. After undergoing an apparently irreversible insertion of lithium ions during the first discharge, the electrode presents a nearly similar potential file upon subsequent cycles, indicating good sample reversibility. Fig.6(B) shows the cyclability data of the samples with x=0 and x=0.5 at 0.25 C. The discharge capacity of the unsubstituted electrode drastically decreases and maintains only 118.4 mA·h/g after 25 cycles, whereas the electrode with x=0.5 exhibits remarkably enhanced capacity retention and delivers a capacity of 449.2 mA·h/g after the same number of cycles. This value is about 13.7% and 29.1% higher than those reported by Naren et al.[19] and Cui et al.[18], respectively. This further proves that VO43– substitution is a powerful method for improving electrochemical properties of the LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material. The EIS technique was employed to investigate the improvements in electrochemical performance of VO43– substituted LiSn2(PO4)3 anode in a lithium half-cell. The EIS data measured after the first charge-discharge cycle are presented in Fig.7(A). The Nyquist plots of all studied samples display the same features and consist of a semicircle in the high frequency region and a straight line in the low frequency region. The low frequency straight line can be attributed to the―Warburg impedance‖, resembling the solid state diffusion of Li ions within the solid active species; the semicircle was mainly attributed to the charge transfer impedance, Rct, at the electrode/electrolyte interface[22,23,31]. The inset of Fig.7(A) clearly indicates that the Rct decreases with increasing VO43– content, reaching a minimum of x=0.5 and then increasing with further increases in the VO43– content. These results reveal that the VO43– substitution reduces the charge transfer impedance, accelerates the charge transfer at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, and then enhances the anode performance. These are consistent with the discharge data.

The diffusion coefficient of lithium ion, D, can be calculated using the following equation[23,31]: D=R2T2/2A2n4F4C2σ2 (1) where, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons participating in the electrochemical reaction, A is the surface area of the anode, F is the Faraday constant, C is the molar concentration of Li+, andσ is the Warburg coefficient defined as following: Z′=σω–1/2+Rs+Rct (2) where Z′ is the real part of the EIS, Rs is the electrolyte resistance, andω is the angular frequency in the low frequency region[Fig.7(B)]. The D values obtained for the LiSn2(PO4)3–x(VO4)x(x=0—0.7) anodes are presented in Table 2. LiSn2(PO4)2.5(VO4)0.5 presents the largest value of D while the non-substituted LiSn2(PO4)3 has the smallest lithium-ion diffusion coefficient. The charge transfer diffusion is crucial for practical materials applicability because it determines the electrochemical process kinetics. The VO43– substitution used here remarkably increased the Li-ion diffusion within the solid active species. It promoted the electrochemical reactions to proceed in the anode. Collectively, these data proved that VO43– anion substitution for PO43– is a powerful technique to improve the electrochemical performance as an anode for lithium batteries. To investigate the electrochemical reactions of the VO43–-substituted materials, we measured the XRD patterns of the electrode with nominal composition of LiSn2(PO4)2.5(VO4)0.5 after different discharge stages. The electrode initially discharged to 0.95 V and presented an XRD pattern that was completely different from the non-discharged pattern. The XRD peaks attributable to β-LiSn2(PO4)3 and SnP2O7 disappear; only the very weak peaks due to SnO2 and Sn can be seen in Fig.8. Those results suggest that the prepared VO43–-substituted LiSn2(PO4)3 materials behave like the non-substituted samples, and the introduction of VO43– anion could not prevent the Nasicon compound from decomposing during discharging. The XRD peaks attributable to Li3PO4 and Li3VO4 are not observed in the electrode, probably because they are very fine particles. The electrochemical reaction for the VO43–-substituted LiSn2(PO4)3 compounds can be deduced to proceed via the following equation at this stage: LiSn2(PO4)2.5(VO4)0.5+8Li+→Li3PO4+Li3VO4+2Sn (3)

Further discharging to 5 mV resulted in the appearance of a very broad XRD peak in 2θ of 20° to 25°. This broad peak agreed with amorphous LixSn similar to Naren et al.[19]. This peak remained after the 10th discharging to 5 mV. These results suggest that better cyclability and reversibility were obtained for our VO43–-substituted sample.  Though it is currently difficult to obtain pure VO43–-substituted products, it is interesting that the resulting compounds likeβ-LiSn2(PO4)3,α-LiSn2(PO4)3, SnO2, SnP2O7, and Li3VO4 can be used as anodic materials with similar Li-insertion potential for LIBs. In contrast to the Sn-containing compounds, the graphite-like Li3VO4 does not undergo a struc-tural breakdown during lithiation/delithiation, i.e., possessing a reversible structural change. While the Li3VO4 may participate in partial charging/discharging of the Sn-containing compounds by forming Li3+xVO4(0<x≤3) phases, the Li3VO4 might also further strengthen the role of the Li3PO4 matrix in preventing the Sn atoms from aggregating into clusters during subsequent charge/discharge cycles. Therefore, the improved electroche-mical performance of our VO43–-substituted materials is attributed to the synergetic effects of Li3PO4 and Li3VO4 as stable matrices versus the single LiSn2(PO4)3 as reported by Cui et al.[18].Finally, the XRD peak due to metal Sn was observed in the discharged electrodes(Fig.8). This implies that an uncom-pleted lithiation reaction of the Sn also occurred in our VO43–-substituted sample. Future work will further improve its cyclability and reversibility.

We investigated partial substitution of PO43– by VO43– in the Nasicon LiSn2(PO4)3 compound to prepare a high performance anode for lithium-ion batteries. The VO43–-substituted samples were limited in their ability to obtain a single LiSn2(PO4)3 phase, and some secondary phases like SnO2 and SnP2O7 appeared. Though the introduction of the VO43– anion could not prevent the LiSn2(PO4)3 compounds from decomposing during initial lithiation, the VO43– anion substitution remarkably enhanced the rate capability and cycling performance of the products via reducing the charge transfer impedance, increasing the lithium ion diffusion, and strengthening the role of the Li3PO4 matrix due to the precipitation of the Li3VO4 phase. Of the substituted samples, the sample with a VO43– content of 0.5 showed a discharge capacity of 449.2 mA·h/g at a rate of 0.25 C after 25 cycles and 373.8 mA·h/g at 2 C rate. These values surpassed some previous reports on LiSn2(PO4)3 anodes and the LiSn2(PO4)3/C composites. These results suggest that VO43– substitution is a feasible way to improve the electrochemical properties of the LiSn2(PO4)3 anode material.
