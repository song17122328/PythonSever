Methods have been proposed for the preparation of NASICON-type hafnium hydrogen phosphate-based materials. 

The pH of the starting solution for the hydrothermal synthesis of NH4Hf2(PO4)3 has been  shown  to  determine  whether  rhombohedral  or  cubic  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  will  be  obtained.  The  thermal decomposition  of  rhombohedral  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  leads  to  the  formation  of  the  triclinic  phosphate HHf2(PO4)3, whereas the decomposition of cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3 yields a cubic phosphate with the composition (NH4)0.  The  thermal decomposition  of  rhombohedral  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  leads  to  the  formation  of  the  triclinic  phosphate HHf2(PO4)3, whereas the decomposition of cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3 yields a cubic phosphate with the composition (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3.6Hf2(PO4)3. HHf2(PO4)3 cannot be prepared from cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3, because the temperature of water elimination coincides with that of the elimination of the last portions of ammonia. We have studied the morphology, thermal stability, and ionic conductivity of the synthesized materials. The electrical conductivity of cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3 has been shown to exceed that of the rhombohedral phase, and the conductivity of the hydrogen forms slightly exceeds that of individual ammonium forms of hafnium phosphate. 

The highest conductivity among the materials studied here is offered by cubic (NH4)0. The highest conductivity among the materials studied here is offered by cubic (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3 (2.6Hf2(PO4)3 (2.0 × 10–7 and 1.0 × 10–7 and 1.2 × 10–6 S/cm at 400 and 500°С, respectively).

Proton conductors stable at elevated temperatures are of great interest because they can be used as solid electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. Elevated temperatures are desirable because at low temperatures platinum catalysts are susceptible to CO poisoning [1–3]. Intensive research effort has been concentrated on the proton  conductivity  of  materials  based  on  various classes of compounds, for example, metal pyrophosphates [4, 5], oxides [6, 7], membrane materials [8, 9], and various acid sulfates and phosphates [10].

NASICON-type  compounds  constitute  a  large class  of  compounds  with  formula AxB2(PO4)3, where A = H, Li, Na, K, H3O, or NH4 and B = In, Sc, Fe, Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, Ge, etc. [11–15]. The  configuration  of  interstitial  sites  in  their  crystal structure allows for fast ion transport [15]. In addition, they offer the advantages of chemical and thermal stability, low thermal expansion [16], and catalytic activity  [17].  These  compounds  can  be  considered  as potential  proton  conductors,  because  the  materials with A = H+, H3O+, or   possess proton conductivity [18–20].

To  date,  lithium and  sodium-containing  double phosphates have been the subject of extensive studies [21– 27].There is relatively little data on NASICON-type acidand  ammonium  phosphates  [28–38].  HZr2(PO4)3  was first prepared by Clearfield et al. [29] through the decomposition of an ammonium salt synthesized by a hydrothermal process. Komorowski et al. [30] described the synthesis of a hydrogen form from Na1 + xZr2SixP3 – xO12 through ion  exchange  during  boiling  in  a  hydrochloric  acid solution. Materials with the compositions HZr2(PO4)3 ⋅ nH2O, H1 ± xZr2 – xMx(PO4)3 ⋅ H2O (M = Nb, Y), and Н3 – 2xMIII 2 – xNbx(PO4)3 ⋅ nH2O (MIII = In, Fe) were prepared through ion exchange in concentrated nitric acid from the corresponding lithium salts [31–33]. As shown using NH4Zr2(PO4)3 and HZr2(PO4)3 as examples,  the  hydrogen  and  ammonium  forms  of  zirconium phosphates possess relatively high thermal stability (520 and 650°C, respectively) [29, 31] and the electrical  conductivity  of  NH4Zr2(PO4)3  is  slightly lower than that of HZr2(PO4)3 [20]. Samples based on zirconium hydrogen phosphate with a rhombohedral structure were shown to possess high proton conductivity and high thermal stability [31, 35]. Using a sol–gel process, Mieritz et al. [38] obtained NASICON-type compounds with the general formula H1 –  xTi2(PO4)3 –  x(SO4)x  (x  = 0. [38] obtained NASICON-type compounds with the general formula H1 –  xTi2(PO4)3 –  x(SO4)x  (x  = 0.5–1) and a rhombohedral structure.

Note that there is essentially no data on NASICONtype  hafnium  hydrogen  phosphate.  Voropaeva  et  al. [39] prepared HHf2(PO4)3 ⋅ 0. [39] prepared HHf2(PO4)3 ⋅ 0.5H2O via ion exchange and  investigated  its  properties.Ion  exchange  wasFig. 1. 1.

In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis of materials with the composition NH4Hf2(PO4)3 and their thermal decomposition products with the general formula (NH4)1 –  xHxHf2(PO4)3, as well as the morphology,  thermal  stability,  and  ionic  conductivity  of the synthesized materials.

The starting chemicals used in hydrothermal synthesis  were  HfO2  (Aldrich,  98%)  and  NH4H2PO4 (Aldrich, 98%) or (NH4)2HPO4 (Fluka, 99%).

The hafnium oxide was first partially dissolved by reacting it with hot concentrated hydrofluoric acid for 2 h with constant stirring in a plastic beaker. Next, the mixture  of  HfO2  and  HF  was  loaded  into  a  Teflonlined  autoclave  and  a  1  M  NH4H2PO4  or (NH4)2HPO4  solution  was  added  to  give  a  Hf  :  P atomic ratio of 1 : 2. Next, the mixture  of  HfO2  and  HF  was  loaded  into  a  Teflonlined  autoclave  and  a  1  M  NH4H2PO4  or (NH4)2HPO4  solution  was  added  to  give  a  Hf  :  P atomic ratio of 1 : 2. The degree of autoclave filling was 75%.  The  autoclave  was  held  at  a  temperature  of 250°C for 24 h in a furnace.The resultant precipitate was  separated  from  the  solution  by  centrifugation, washed  with  distilled  water  until  the  tests  for  phos-phate  and  fluoride  ions  were  negative  (AgNO3  and CaCl2  tests,  respectively),  and  dried  at  100°C.  To obtain  hydrogen  forms  of  hafnium  phosphates, NH4Hf2(PO4)3 was decomposed at 550°C for 72 h.

The phase composition of the materials thus prepared was determined by X-ray diffraction on a Rigaku D/MAX 2200 diffractometer (CuKα radiation).

In thermal analysis, we used a Netzsch-TG 209 F1 thermobalance  and  platinum  crucibles.  The  heating rate was 10°C/min. The composition of gaseous reaction products was determined using a Netzsch Aeolos QMS 403 C mass spectrometer.

Microstructures  of  the  materials  were  examined with the help of a Carl Zeiss NVision 40 scanning electron  microscope  (micrographs  were  obtained  at  an accelerating  voltage  of  1  kV)  provided  with  Oxford Instruments X-MAX energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer.

Ionic  conductivity  was  measured  at  frequencies from  10  Hz  to  2  MHz  and  at  dc  in  the  temperature range  25–500°C  using  a  2B-1  universal  bridge.  The samples  had  the  form  of  pressed  cylindrical  pellets with silver contacts.

Composition and morphology of NH4Hf2(PO4)3.Composition and morphology of NH4Hf2(PO4)3. X-ray diffraction examination showed that different phases of NH4Hf2(PO4)3 were formed, depending on starting reagents (NH4H2PO4 or (NH4)2HPO4) and the pH of the  starting  mixture  correspondingly.  When  NH4H2PO4 was used as a starting reagent (the pH of the starting mixture was ~3.  When  NH4H2PO4 was used as a starting reagent (the pH of the starting mixture was ~3.4), we obtained a rhombohedral (r) phase (Fig. 1). With (NH4)2HPO4 (the pH of the starting mixture, ~6. With (NH4)2HPO4 (the pH of the starting mixture, ~6.1), a cubic (c) phase was obtained (Fig. 2). Previously, the phase composition of reaction products was also observed to depend on the pH of the starting mixture in the case of the hydrothermal synthesis of NH4Zr2(PO4)3 [41]. The X-ray diffraction pattern of r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 contained weak reflections from hafnium pyrophosphate (ICDD PDF, card no. 37-1494) (Fig. 1, scan 1). Using the intensity of reflections characteristic of each phase, we estimated the percentages of the phases present in the sample. HfP2O7 content was found to be ~5%. The lattice parameters of r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 (sp. gr. R3c) were determined to be a = 8. R3c) were determined to be a = 8.644(1) Å and c = 24.644(1) Å and c = 24.1972(3) Å; the lattice parameter of c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 (sp. gr. P213) was a = 10. P213) was a = 10.168(3) Å.

According  to  SEM  results,  the  NH4Hf2(PO4)3 samples (Figs. 3a, 3b) and their thermal decomposition products (Figs. 3c, 3d) had a broad particle size distribution.  The  particles  observed  in  micrographs ranged in size from 100 nm to 10 μ m. The average particle size was ~400–500 nm (Fig. 3). According to X-ray microanalysis data, the Hf : P : O atomic ratio in our samples was 2 : 3 : 12. According to X-ray microanalysis data, the Hf : P : O atomic ratio in our samples was 2 : 3 : 12.

According to thermogravimetric analysis data, the r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  sample  experienced  a  weight  loss starting at a temperature above 500°C (Fig. 4a). The weight loss had the highest rate at 650°C and reached near  completion  at  900°C.  According  to  mass  spectrometry results, this was accompanied by NH3 (mass numbers M/z = 14, 15, 16, and 17) and H2O (M/z = 16,  17,  and  18)  evolution.  The  highest  rate  of  NH3 (M/z = 15) elimination was observed at a slightly lower temperature (Δ t ~ 30°C) than was the highest rate of water (M/z = 18) elimination (Fig. 4b).

After additional annealing at 900°C for 2 h, the rNH4Hf2(PO4)3  sample  experienced  no  weight  loss. After annealing to constant weight, the X-ray diffraction pattern of r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 contained reflections from HfO2 (card no. 6-0318), Hf2O(PO4)2 (card no. 37-0156), and HfP2O7 (card no. 37-1494). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that NH4Hf2(PO4)3 decomposition  is  similar  to  NH4Zr2(PO4)3  decomposition, described by Clearfield et al. [29] and Pinus et al.[42], with  sequential  detachment  of  ammonia  and  boundFig. 3. 3.

The processes involved in rNH4Hf2(PO4)3 decomposition can be represented by the following schemes:In  the  case  of  the  c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  sample,  a weight  loss  was  observed  in  a  broader  temperature range, starting at 200°C. According to mass spectrometry  results,  at  this  temperature  a  small  amount  of water was eliminated. The content of crystalline water in c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 was estimated at 0. The content of crystalline water in c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 was estimated at 0.1 mol per formula unit. The rapid weight loss due to decomposition began at 550°C, with a maximum at 820°C, and did not reach completion at 900°C (Fig. 5a).Heating to 900°C in the course of a TGA scan produced no significant changes in theFig.  5.  5.

X-ray diffraction pattern of c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3, which was probably due to the formation of solid solutions. After annealing  of  c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  at  a  temperature  of 1100°C, no weight loss was detected. After annealing to constant weight, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the from  HfO2, sample  Hf2O(PO4)2, and HfP2O7. After annealing to constant weight, the X-ray diffraction pattern of the from  HfO2, sample  Hf2O(PO4)2, and HfP2O7.

According to mass spectrometry results, heating of c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  was  accompanied  by  NH3  (M/z  = 14, 15, 16, and 17) and H2O (M/z = 16, 17, and 18) evolution  (Fig.  5b).  A  slight  release  of  a  less  tightly bound water was observed starting at 200°C, with the highest  rate  of  water  release  at  820°C.  A  rapid  NH3 release was observed at a lower temperature than was a rapid water release (600°C), but the ammonia release occurred  in  two  steps.  Note  that  the  position  of  the higher temperature peak in the ammonia signal intensity curve (Fig. 5b, M/z = 15) coincided with that of the peak in the water signal intensity (Fig. 5b, M/z = 18).

Thus, some of the ammonia was removed at the same temperature as water.

In view of this, to obtain  a  hydrogen  form  from  r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3,  we chose  prolonged  (72  h)  calcination  at  550°C.  As  a result,  we  obtained  a  triclinic  NASICON-type  hafnium phosphate (Fig. 1, scan 2). Its lattice parameters were determined to be a = 15. Its lattice parameters were determined to be a = 15.34(3) Å, b = 8.34(3) Å, b = 8.704(7) Å, с = 9.704(7) Å, с = 9.11(2) Å, α = 89.11(2) Å, α = 89.2(1)°, β = 123.2(1)°, β = 123.66(8)°, and γ = 90.66(8)°, and γ = 90.9(1)° (sp. gr. C1).

The TG curve of the sample obtained as a result of r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 decomposition has two steps. One of them,  with  a  peak  at  180°C,  corresponds  to  the removal of a small amount of water (0. One of them,  with  a  peak  at  180°C,  corresponds  to  the removal of a small amount of water (0.2 mol per formula unit), which was, most likely, sorbed on the surface of the anhydrous hydrogen phosphate. The other (600–900°C) is due to the decomposition of the anhydrous  phosphate.  The  only  gaseous  decomposition product is water (M/z = 16, 17, and 18). This suggests that the process of r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 decomposition to triclinic HHf2(PO4)3 reached completion.

According to the above data, the c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 thermolysis product was also obtained at 550°C and its composition was c-(NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3.According to the above data, the c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 thermolysis product was also obtained at 550°C and its composition was c-(NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3. Its TG curve has two steps: one, at a temperature of ~250°C, corresponds to the removal of sorbed water, and the other, in the range 600–900°C, is due to the decomposition of the anhydrous  phosphate  (NH4)1 –  xHxHf2(PO4)3,  accompanied by ammonia and water elimination. The weight loss process does not reach completion at annealing temperatures of up to 900°C. According to X-ray diffraction and TGA data, the composition of the reaction product is (NH4)0. According to X-ray diffraction and TGA data, the composition of the reaction product is (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3 ⋅ 0.6Hf2(PO4)3 ⋅ 0.1 H2O. After this heat treatment, the cubic structure of the material persisted (Fig. 2, scan 2). As a result of the partial substitution of protons for ammonium ions, the unit-cell volume of c-(NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3 (a = 10. As a result of the partial substitution of protons for ammonium ions, the unit-cell volume of c-(NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3 (a = 10.139(1) Å) was slightly smaller than that of c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3.139(1) Å) was slightly smaller than that of c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3.

Figures 6 and 7 show temperature  dependences  of  conductivity  rNH4Hf2(PO4)3 and c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 in the temperature range 300–480°C. At temperatures below 300°C, no unique extrapolation of impedance plots was possible. At higher temperatures, no measurements were performed  because  an  irreversible  ammonia  release was  possible  (Figs.  4,  5).  The  conductivity  of  cNH4Hf2(PO4)3  exceeds  that  of  r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  by almost one order of magnitude (at 450°C, 1.  The  conductivity  of  cNH4Hf2(PO4)3  exceeds  that  of  r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  by almost one order of magnitude (at 450°C, 1.4 × 10–8 and 1.4 × 10–8 and 1.0 × 10–7 S/cm, respectively). We call attention to the nonlinear behavior of the temperature-dependent conductivity  of  c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3. We call attention to the nonlinear behavior of the temperature-dependent conductivity  of  c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3.  It  is  reasonable  to assume that the change in slope at ~400°C (Fig. 7) is due  to  a  change  in  the  composition  of  the  sample, namely, to the release of a small amount of water.This correlates with the small weight loss in the TG curve inFig. 6. 6. Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity for r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3. Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity for r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3.

 A high temperature of the release of water of crystallization is also typical of NASICONtype  zirconium  hydrogen  phosphate  [33].  This assumption is supported by conductivity data obtained for  c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  during  heating  and  cooling (Fig. 7). According to these data, the high-temperature (400–480°C) conductivity values obtained during heating and cooling coincide, whereas at lower temperatures  (300–400°C)  the  conductivity  measured during  heating  is  higher—owing  to  the  presence  of water, which facilitates proton transport [35].

The calculated activation energy for conduction in c-NH4Hf2(PO4)3 in the high-temperature region and for  r-NH4Hf2(PO4)3  is  23  ±  1  and  32  ±  3  kJ/mol, respectively.

Figure 8 shows the temperature dependences of conductivity for HHf2(PO4)3 and (NH4)0.Figure 8 shows the temperature dependences of conductivity for HHf2(PO4)3 and (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3 in the temperature range 120–500°C. The conductivity of (NH4)1 – xHxHf2(PO4)3 exceeds that of NH4Hf2(PO4)3, so impedance plots can be extrapolated at lower temperatures.  In  the  temperature  range  from  120  to 250°C, the conductivity is most likely determined by proton transport with the participation of the crystalline water. During heating in this temperature range, the  conductivity  increases  only  slightly,  because  the thermal  activation  of  conduction  is  accompanied  by dehydration of the sample. Most likely, this is the water adsorbed on the surface of the samples. At higher temperatures, the conductivity is observed to rise owing to the thermally activated proton transport (Fig. 8). As a result,  the  conductivity  of  (NH4)xH1  –  xHf2(PO4)3 slightly exceeds that of HHf2(PO4)3 (Fig. 8). At 450°C, their conductivities are 4. At 450°C, their conductivities are 4.7 × 10–7 and 1.7 × 10–7 and 1.8 × 10–7 S/cm, respectively.  In  the  temperature  range  250–500°C,  the activation  energy  for  conduction  in  HHf2(PO4)3  and (NH4)0.  In  the  temperature  range  250–500°C,  the activation  energy  for  conduction  in  HHf2(PO4)3  and (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3  is  80  ±  3  and  76  ±  2  kJ/mol,the vehicle mechanism to proton transport (due to the + 4NHcation) also cannot be ruled out.

These  values  are  comparable  to  the activation energy for high-temperature conduction in H1 – xZr2 – xNbx(PO4)3 ⋅ nH2O [35].

We  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  activation energy  for  conduction  in  the  anhydrous  hafnium hydrogen  phosphates  considerably  exceeds  that  in NH4Hf2(PO4)3.We  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  activation energy  for  conduction  in  the  anhydrous  hafnium hydrogen  phosphates  considerably  exceeds  that  in NH4Hf2(PO4)3.  The  reason  for  this  is  that  different mechanisms  are  responsible  for  proton  transport  in the hydrogen and ammonium forms [43]. In the case of the hydrogen form, proton transport is due to proton  hopping  between  the  oxygens  of  the  phosphate anions. The high activation energy is the result of the large  hop  distance  [31].  In  the  ammonium  forms, nitrogen  atoms  may  also  participate  in  transport, reducing the proton hop distance.A contribution ofThe  rhombohedral  and  cubic  polymorphs  of  the NASICON-type  compound  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  have been prepared by a hydrothermal process. The pH of the  starting  solution  has  been  shown  to  determine whether rhombohedral or cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3 will be obtained. Both phases of NH4Hf2(PO4)3 are thermally stable  up  to  ~500°C.  Prolonged  heat  treatment  of rhombohedral  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  at  550°C  leads  to  the formation  of  the  triclinic  phosphate  HHf2(PO4)3, whereas  the  decomposition  of  cubic  NH4Hf2(PO4)3 yields  a  NASICON-type  cubic  phosphate  with  the composition (NH4)0.  Prolonged  heat  treatment  of rhombohedral  NH4Hf2(PO4)3  at  550°C  leads  to  the formation  of  the  triclinic  phosphate  HHf2(PO4)3, whereas  the  decomposition  of  cubic  NH4Hf2(PO4)3 yields  a  NASICON-type  cubic  phosphate  with  the composition (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3.6Hf2(PO4)3.

The electrical conductivity of cubic NH4Hf2(PO4)3 has been shown to exceed that of the rhombohedral phase,  and  the  conductivity  of  the  hydrogen  forms slightly exceeds that of individual ammonium forms of hafnium phosphate. The highest conductivity among the materials  cubic (NH4)0. The highest conductivity among the materials  cubic (NH4)0.4H0.4H0.6Hf2(PO4)3 (2.6Hf2(PO4)3 (2.0 × 10–7 and 1.0 × 10–7 and 1.2 × 10–6 S/cm at 400 and 500°С, respectively).
