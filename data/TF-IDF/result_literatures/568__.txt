We demonstrate a novel rechargeable energy storage system having a metallic lithium negative electrode and a liquid–solid hybrid positive electrode of Fe3+/Fe2+/Fe in N,N-Dimethylformamide, which are separated by an impermeable NASICON–type Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3–epoxy resin composite film with a lithium ion conductivity of ca. 5.0 × 10−4 S cm−1. The discharge curve for the battery shows two plateaus. The first plateau corresponds to Li + FeCl3 = LiCl + FeCl2, while the second one is associated with 2 Li + FeCl2 = 2 LiCl + Fe. In the process of reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, it delivers a stable discharge capacity of ca. 110 mAh gFeCl3−1 with a Coulombic efficiency higher than 95% and is capable of enduring over 60 circles at a high current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 without any catalyst. Furthermore, a stable discharge capacity up to ca. 455 mAh gFeCl3−1 is achieved for conversion of FeCl3/FeCl2/Fe with a three–electron reaction. This work demonstrates a proof of feasibility of hybrid liquid–solid hybrid positive electrode, since these reactions are reversible confirmed by x–ray diffraction patterns and EDX mapping test.

Building electric vehicles (EVs) with high–capacity rechargeable batteries instead of internal–combustion engine is considered as an effective way to reduce the consumption of fossil energy [1,2]. Up to now, many new types of lithium–metal batteries (LMBs) beyond lithium–ion batteries (LIBs) have been proposed, such as Li–O2 and Li–S rechargeable batteries [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. The Li–S battery promises to meet the target of a 500 km range for EVs in view of its high theoretical energy density (ca. 2510 Wh kg−1 and 2199 Wh L−1) [7]. However, rapid capacity fading owing to the well-known shuttle effect by the reactions of various soluble polysulfide intermediates with Li–metal negative electrode must be addressed [8,9]. Similarly, the calculated energy densities of rechargeable non-aqueous Li–O2 battery system including oxygen are as high as 3505 Wh kg−1 [10]. However, non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries still face some formidable challenges, including the sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reaction kinetics, plus side reactions between the strong oxidizing discharge products (Li2O2/LiO2) and electrolyte/carbon/binder [[11], [12], [13]]. Recently, Goodenough et al. proposed a new concept of aqueous positive electrode using a redox couple of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− for next-generation alkali–ion batteries [14,15], which was further branched out by Zhao et al. They used I3−/I2 [16], Br−/Br2 [17], Fe(C5H5)2/[Fe(C5H5)2]+ [18] as redox couples of fluid positive electrodes, respectively, which all exhibited excellent rate capacities. However, there is no great advantage for the specific capacity of these fluid positive electrodes due to a one–electron reaction, in comparison with that of the common positive electrode materials of commercial LIBs.

The energy density of battery is significantly determined by the electrode capacities and potential difference between positive and negative electrodes. The capacity of electrode is decided by the transfer number of electron per molecule and mole mass, while the potential difference is dependent on their Fermi energy. Given all this, in this work, we propose a radical but facile hybrid liquid–solid redox couple as the positive electrode for LMBs, in order to improve the capacity drastically by increasing transfer number of electron per molecule.

Fig. 1 demonstrates the theoretical potential of various hybrid liquid–solid redox couples versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Numerous redox couples have the potential to perform as the positive electrodes for the unique LMBs, because Li metal negative electrode has the lowest electrochemical potential (−3.04 V vs. SHE). The theoretical specific capacities and potential (vs. Li/Li+) of various hybrid redox couples are summarized in Table S1, which are calculated based on the metallic chlorides due to excellent solubility and low molecular mass. Among these materials, it is obvious that the three–electron redox couple of FeCl3/Fe2+/Fe has advantages in terms of high theoretical potential and capacity of 3.81 V and 496 mA h g−1, respectively. Additionally, FeCl3/Fe2+/Fe is inexpensive, abundant on earth and environmentally benign. Thus, we are committed to demonstrating the feasibility of redox couple of Fe3+/Fe2+/Fe in solutions as a positive electrode for LMBs.

It is noteworthy that one of the crucial components of this battery system is the impermeable solid lithium–ion conducting electrolyte so as to keep both electrodes apart. The commercial impermeable LISICON film (Li1+x+yAlxTi2-xSiyP3-yO12) is only supplied by Ohara Inc. Japan, which has a thickness of 150–250 μm with an excellent bending strength (4 points) of 140 N/mm2 [19]. However, its low ionic conductivity (ca. 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and high cost are the bottleneck for the commercialization of LMBs with fluid positive electrode. In our previous study, a water–impermeable hybrid sheet of LAGTP (Li1.4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3) and epoxy resin film with a high ionic conductivity of 5.26 × 10−4 S cm−1 and bending strength (3 points) of 120 N/mm2 has been already invented [20], and successfully used in the aqueous lithium–air batteries as a solid electrolyte separator. Herein, the LAGTP–epoxy resin hybrid film (denoted as LERHF) is used in the novel battery system as the impermeable separator to block fluid positive electrode.

The fabrication process of LERHF is shown in the flowchart (see Fig. S1 in the ESI). LAGTP powders prepared using a sol–gel method reported previously [21] were dispersed in a mixed solution of ethanol and toluene with binder and plasticizer to form a tape-casting slurry by ball milling for 24 h. Then the slurry was tape-casted, and the green sheets were dried, cut, laminated and sintered at 900 °C for 7 h sequentially. Finally, the LERHF was obtained by dropping a mixed solution of 1 M 1,3-phenylenediamine and 2 M 2,2-bis(4-glycidyloyphenyl)propane in tetrahydrofuran on the LAGTP sheet surface, followed by a heat treatment at 150 °C for 24 h. The LERHF must be polished to remove the residual epoxy resin polymer on the surface (see Fig. S1 in the ESI) after polymerization (See Fig. S2 in the ESI) to improve the ionic conductivity.

The X–ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku Rint 2500 diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ from 10° to 90° at a scanning rate of 0.02° s−1. The morphology of discharge products was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Carl Zeiss Jena Utral 55) coupled with an energy dispersion X–ray spectrometer (EDX).

All the chemicals used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Anhydrous FeCl3 (Aladdin) and LiCl (Aladdin) were further dried in an Ar–filled glove box (O2＜0.5 ppm, H2O＜0.5 ppm) at 100 °C for 24 h. All organic solvents (e.g. 1-propanol, ethylene glycol, ethanol, acetone, DMF, toluene) were dehydrated by soaking 4 Å sieves (Aladdin) for at least one week. Then the fluid electrodes were prepared by dissolving pre-weighing FeCl3 and LiCl in various organic solvents and deionized water under magnetic stirring for 2 h.

We noticed that the aqueous positive electrodes reported previously were usually circulated by a pump to enhance utilization efficiency of active materials [14,16]. Unfortunately, the architecture of this battery system is too complicated, resulting in a low practical specific mass/volume energy density. Consequently, it is logical to simplify the architecture of the battery, where the fluid positive electrode is flowed by itself instead of the pump. The battery performance was measured using a Swagelok–type cell designed by our engineer (Fig. 2). A lithium metal disk (ϕ12.0 mm) attaching to a steel column was used as a negative electrode and current collector, respectively. With regard to the positive electrode, the aforementioned solutions were injected into one side of cell using a disposable syringe, and then the injection hole was plugged up. A titanium column cladded with a hydrophobic carbon paper disk (ϕ12.0 mm) served as a current collector and supporter of discharge products. The conventional non-aqueous electrolyte consisting of ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene carbonate (DEC) (1:1 v/v) with 1 M LiPF6 soaked in a glass fiber (GF/A, Whatman) was employed as a buffer layer to prevent the direct contact of lithium metal with LERHF, because NASICON–type lithium–ion conducting electrolyte is unstable to lithium metal [22]. The LERHF combined with a pair of rubber rings was placed in the centre of battery to prevent any liquid permeating it. The thickness and effective working area of the LERHF were around 250 μm and 1.10 cm2 (ϕ12.0 mm), respectively. We designed two kinds of testers with different volume of fluid cathode. The capacities of the fluid cathode in #Tester 1 and #Tester 2 were ca. 2.2 ml and 120 μl, respectively, corresponding to the distances between the current collector in positive electrode and LERHF were ca. 2 cm and 1 mm, respectively.

In-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) change of LERHF stored in FeCl3 solutions was examined, using a self-made H–type symmetric cell with two symmetrical platinum pieces (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm) as symmetrical electrodes separated by a LERHF (see Fig. S3 in the ESI). The effective working area of LERHF was 0.25 cm2, while the distance between Pt electrode and LERHF was ca. 2 cm. The ionic conductivity measurements for saturated FeCl3 dissolved in various solvents were conducted by using an AC conductivity method with a conventional conductivity measurement cell with platinum electrodes. The EIS tests of Li–Fe3+/Fe2+/Fe battery was conducted on an impedance/grain phase analyzer (Solartron, 1260) in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The galvanostatic discharge–charge performance at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 at room temperature were tested on a potentiotastat/galvanostat (Hokuto Denko, HJ-10015D8).

In the case of the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 electrodes, the active material (80 wt%) was mixed with conductive carbon black (Super P) (10 wt%) and PVDF binder (poly(vinylidene difluoride)) (10 wt%) to form a slurry. After casting the slurry on the Al current collector, the electrodes were dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven overnight (for LiFeO4 and LiCoO2 with mass loading of ～2.1 and 2.8 mg cm−2). Electrochemical experiments were carried out using the standard CR2025 coin–type cell with a lithium disk (Φ12 mm) as a counter/reference electrode, our electrode, and a Celgard 2400 polypropylene film (Φ19 mm) as a separator soaked with 1 M LiPF6 in EC:DEC (1:1, v:v) electrolyte. In addition, the cathode of non-aqueous lithium–O2 battery was prepared by casting an 85:15 (w/w) mixture of Ketjenblack carbon (KB) and PVDF binder onto a carbon paper (Toray TGP-H) (for KB with mass loading of 1.3 mg cm−2). Electrochemical experiments were carried out in the standard CR2032 coin–type cell with many open pores, composed of a lithium disk (Φ12 mm) as a counter/reference electrode, our electrode disk (Φ12 mm)), and a glass fiber (GF/D, Whatman) (Φ19 mm) as a separator soaked with the electrolyte of 1 M LiTFSI in TEGDME. The discharge/charge performances of all batteries were measured at room temperature on a battery test system (Shenzhen Neware battery, China).

The aqueous FeCl3 solution is an attractive positive electrode in terms of advantages of high potential versus Li/Li+, a three–electron reaction, a high solubility (91.2 g FeCl3 per 100 g H2O at 25 °C, 68.5 g FeCl2 per 100 g H2O, 20 °C) [23], and an outstanding ionic conductivity (1.02 × 10−2 S cm−1). The electrochemical reaction of the aqueous Li/FeCl3 cell at the electrodes can be written as follows;

The theoretical open–circuit voltage (OCV) is 3.81 V at the first stage and 2.57 V vs. Li/Li+ at the second stage, respectively. The discharge performance of a Li/saturated aqueous FeCl3 battery in the #tester 1 at different current densities of 1.0–10.0 mA cm−2 for every half an hour was shown in Fig. 3. It is obvious that the battery presents different flat potentials, corresponding to various current densities less than 8.0 mA cm−2. However, its discharge potential platform became downward when the current density was larger than 8.0 mA cm−2. Goodenough et al. inferred from XRD patterns that the worsening discharge performance at high current densities was due to the deterioration of the impermeable solid electrolyte [15]. However, no impurity phase could be detected from XRD patterns of LERHF (see Fig. S4 in the ESI) after discharge processes at high current densities. Especially, it is noteworthy that when the current density returned to 2.0 mA cm−2, the flat discharge potential of around 3.1 V for battery was recovered. We speculated that the poor performance for battery discharged at high current densities may be associated with the onset of zero Fe3+ cationic concentration in the vicinity of the cathode at the Sand's time [24]. Nevertheless, the battery could exhibit a high power density of ca. 18 mW cm−2 sustaining for a short time, and it seems that the aqueous FeCl3 solution can be utilized as a promising fluid positive electrode for the novel LMB system. Unfortunately, it was found that LERHF is unstable in the aqueous FeCl3 solution on account of a low pH value attributed to the hydrolysis:

The pH values of aqueous FeCl3 solutions with various FeCl3 concentrations from 0.05 M to 2 M were summarized (see Table S2 in the ESI). The pH of the aqueous solution with 2 M FeCl3 was as low as 0.83. Surprisingly, a low pH of 2.37 was still observed for 0.01 M FeCl3 aqueous solution. Hasegawa et al. verified that Ohara Li1+x+yAlxTi2-xP3-ySiyO12 (LATP) decomposed in acid or alkaline aqueous solutions, but displayed the stability in 1 M aqueous LiCl solution [25]. Thus, the In-situ EIS change of LERHF immersed in 0.01 M FeCl3 and 2 M LiCl aqueous solution by fabricating H–type cells was tested. The high concentration of LiCl was intended to keep LERHF stable in aqueous solution [26,27]. As shown in Fig. 4, the impedance profiles show two circles. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency is nearly 50 Ω cm−2 similar to sum of the bulk resistance of hybrid film and solutions, which should represent the bulk resistance of LERHF and solutions. The semicircle in the high frequency may correspond to the grain boundary resistance of LERHF, while another one at low frequency may be attributed to the interface resistance between LERHF and the solution electrolyte. The rapid deterioration in all resistances was observed. The total resistances increased from 59 Ω cm−2 for the newly assembled H–type cell to 122 Ω cm−2 for the one with a storage period of 36 h. The increase in the total resistance could be explained by the ion exchange between Li+ and H+ observed in Li3xLa2/3TiO3 [28] and Li7La3Sn2O12 [29].

The aging effects of ionic conductivity for the LERHF stored in 0.01 M FeCl3–2 M LiCl mixed aqueous solution and pure 2 M LiCl were further investigated, respectively (see Fig. S5 in the ESI). The ionic conductivity was estimated from resistance, thickness and effective area of LERHF [21]. The ionic conductivity of the pristine LERHF can reach around 5.0 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is quite approximate to that in the previous report [20], and unobvious change for that immersed in the pure 2 M LiCl solution has been observed. In contrast, the ionic conductivity of LERHF drastically declined to ca. 7.7 × 10−5 S cm−1 immersed in 0.01 M FeCl3–2 M LiCl mixed aqueous solution after 8 days.

Thus, we have to use organic solvents instead of deionized water to dissolve the FeCl3, in order to avoid the H+ production by hydrolysis. The physicochemical properties for various common solvents were summarized (see Table S3 in the ESI). The solubility of FeCl3 with high molecular polarity in toluene was negligible due to its low relative polarity for toluene (0.099), although the viscosity of toluene was very low (<1cp). The discharge performances for Li/FeCl3 dissolved in various organic solvents, including 1-proponal, ethylene glycol, ethanol, acetone, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were investigated at various current densities. As depicted in Fig. 5, it is obvious that the fluid electrodes using DMF and acetone shows better discharge performances. A flat discharge potential of ca. 2.2 V at 4.0 mA cm−2 was observed for the battery with positive electrode of saturated FeCl3 dissolved in DMF, while a stable potential plateaus of 1.75 V at 5.0 mA cm−2 was achieved for the positive electrode of FeCl3 in acetone. However, the reversibility of positive electrode of FeCl3 in acetone was poor, ascribed to a low solubility of LiCl as one of discharge products in acetone (Ca. 1.08 g/100 ml, 25 °C). By contrast, solubility of FeCl3 and LiCl in DMF are ca. 53 g/100 ml and 17 g/100 ml, respectively, which is not unacceptable. In addition, the boiling point (152 °C) of DMF have an obvious advantage as compared to that of ethanol (78 °C) and methanol (64.7 °C), although the fluid positive electrode of FeCl3/ethanol and FeCl3/methanol exhibit higher ionic conductivities of 0.668 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 0.725 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively. In particular, a large number of H+ cations were still produced by reaction of Fe3+ with ethanol, methanol, and 1-propanol. The total resistances of LERHF drastically increased to as high as 8930, 4480 and 2890 Ω cm stored in absolute methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol for 1 week, respectively (see Fig. S6 in the ESI).

The stability of LERHF immersed into anhydrous 1 M FeCl3–0.1 M LiCl–DMF solution was checked at ambient temperature. Fig. 6 shows the impedance profiles of pristine Au/LERHF/Au, the Au/LERHF/Au stored in ambient air and FeCl3-LiCl-DMF solution for 2 weeks, respectively, which were fitted using an equivalent circuit. Au film was sputtered on the surface of LERHF as a blocking electrode. All these EIS profiles showed a semicircle, which is attributed to the grain boundary resistance [30], plus an inclined line in low frequency range representing an electrode response. In addition, the semicircle due to the bulk resistance was out of the frequency range for the impedance analyzer used. The grain, grain boundary and total ionic conductivity of pristine LERHF were estimated to be ca. 1.64 × 10−3, 7.6 × 10−3 and 5.06 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, using the equivalent circuit. Then the total resistance for LERHF stored in ambient air for two weeks increased obviously from around 2000 Ω cm to 3420 Ω cm, and especially the resistance of grain boundary increased from 1390 Ω cm to 2720 Ω cm. However, the grain, grain boundary and total ionic conductivities of LERHF did not change significantly after one week storage in DMF, corresponding to 1.52 × 10−3, 6.55 × 10−4, and 4.57 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively. It is guessed that the LERHF immersed in DMF can prevent the corrosion by H2O and CO2 from ambient air to avoid aging effect of ionic conductivity [21,31]. It is noteworthy that the total ionic conductivity of pristine LERHF is five times higher than that of Ohara LISICON.

A stable open circuit voltage (OCV) of 3.68 V at room temperature was observed for Li/1 M FeCl3–0.1 M LiCl in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) battery. The OCV is slightly lower than that (3.81 V) calculated from the standard electrode potentials, which is attributed to the addition of LiCl. The change in the impedance of the novel battery with the storage period at room temperature was tested (see Fig. S7 in the ESI). Two semicircles are evident in the impedance profiles. The intercept of the semicircle on the real axis at high frequency represents the bulk resistance of hybrid film and solutions. The semicircle in the high frequency may be attributed to the contribution of the grain boundary resistance of LERHF (R1), because similar semicircles were observed in the same frequency range for Au/LERHF/Au. The second semicircle in the low frequency range may be due to the resistance of a solid electrolyte interlayer (SEI) produced between lithium and the LiPF6–EC–DEC electrolyte (R2), and the charge transfer resistance between Li metal and the interface layer (R3). The impedance spectra were analysed using the equivalent circuit shown as an inset in Fig. S7. The resistance in second semicircle increased slightly from 46 Ω cm2 to 62 Ω cm2 with the storage period attributed to the growth of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) resistance, owing to instability of lithium metal to organic electrolyte [32]. Fig. S8 shows the change in impedance profiles of the coin–type cell composed of Li/LiPF6 in EC: DEC (1:1 vol)/steel plate as a function of storage time. The semicircle should be attributed to the SEI and the charge transfer resistances also increased gradually from 39 Ω cm2 to 52 Ω cm2 in a week. Other resistances representing LERHF did not change significantly for one week storage, which further confirmed that LERHF was stable to the FeCl3–LiCl–DMF fluid cathode, as well as organic electrolyte.

The discharge/charge profiles of the battery with a fluid cathode (1 M FeCl3–0.1 M LiCl–DME) at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2 in the voltage window of 2.0–4.8 V are shown in Fig. 7a, where the weight of the active material of FeCl3 was ca. 20 mg (#Tester 2), which corresponds to 3.3 mA h or 165 mA h gFeCl3−1 for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, as well as 6.6 mA h or 330 mA h gFeCl3−1 for the reduction of Fe2+ to Fe. It is noteworthy that the specific capacity was calculated only on the basis of the mass of FeCl3 in this work. The initial discharge capacity of the original electrode was about 127 mA h gFeCl3−1 for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, with an utilization efficiency of active materials and Coulombic efficiency of the cell around 77.0% and 81.9%, respectively. Notably, stable cycling performance was achieved, which could be sustained over 60 circles with a stable discharge capacity of ca. 110 mA h mg−1, corresponding to an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 95% (Fig. 7b). In addition, a long flat region between nearly 3 and 2.6 V, followed by the downward slope from 2.6 to 2.0 V was observed. Interestingly, it is worth noting that the charge curve of the battery shows two potential plateaus between 3.5 and 4.6 V, and the mid-capacity overpotential (defined as the overpotential at half capacity) [33] increased drastically from ca. 0.71 V–1.81 V. We guessed that it should be caused by the formation of LiFeCl4 by the reaction between FeCl3 and LiCl in solution [34], where the charge potential has to be increased to decompose the LiFeCl4. In order to confirm that second charge potential plateaus is indispensable for evolution of Fe2+ to Fe3+. After 45 circles, the charge cut-off potential was set down to 4 V from 4.8 V immediately to get a new charge–discharge profile of sustaining 5 circles to give a proof of our speculation (see Fig. S9 in the ESI). As expected, the discharge capacity value of 110 mA h gFeCl3−1 was diminished to 37 mA h gFeCl3−1 with a downward potential slope from 2.8 to 2.0 V, equivalent to the low capacity during charge process. Note that the mid-capacity discharge potential also decreased from 2.73 V to 2.51 V ascribed to less evolution of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

Subsequently, the charge–discharge performance of the battery with Li/1 M FeCl3–0.1 M LiCl–DMF positive electrode in the voltage window of 1.3 V–5.0 V at 1.0 mA cm−2 was investigated, In order to check the feasibility of hybrid liquid–solid cathode of Fe3+/Fe2+/Fe. As exhibited in Fig. 7c, there are two obvious plateaus in the discharge curve. The first plateau appears at ca. 3.0 V and ends at ca. 1.8 V, which correlates to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, with an initial discharge capacity of ca. 117 mA h gFeCl3−1. The second discharge plateau from 1.75 V to 1.3 V correlating to the reduction of Fe2+ to metallic Fe exhibits a discharge capacity of 351 mA h gFeCl3−1, which is a little larger than the theoretical capacity of 330 mA h g−1. It may be caused by a low utilization efficiency of Fe3+ reduction to Fe2+ in the first discharging stage. Finally, the total discharge capacity for initial circle is around 468 mA h gFeCl3−1, which is slightly lower than the theoretical capacity of 496 mA h gFeCl3−1 for the three–electron reaction (Fe3+→Fe). For comparison, the initial discharge capacities for LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 electrodes at a discharge rate of 0.2 C were measured (Fig. S10a), which are only ca. 138 and 153 mA h g−1, respectively. Moreover, we also measured the initial discharge capacities of the non-aqueous Li–O2 batteries at current densities of 1.0 and 0.1 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. S10b). The capacity could reach as high as 3560 mA h g−1carbon at 1.0 mA cm−2, which exhibits an excellent potentiality. However, the capacity declined to 330 mA h g−1carbon when the current density increased to 1.0 mA cm−2, which is caused by the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. In contrast, a stable discharge capacity of ca. 455 mA h gFeCl3−1 was observed for the battery with a hybrid liquid–solid positive cathode without any catalyst at 1.0 mA cm−2, indicating an outstanding reaction kinetics and specific capacity. However, the battery did not show a long cycling life (only sustaining 21 stable cycles) working in a voltage window of 1.3–5.0 V at 1.0 mA cm−2, due to LERHF being broken by lithium dendrite piercing the glass fiber separator. Generally, the onset time of lithium dendrite formation in the conventional non-aqueous lithium electrolyte is less than several hours at 1.0 mA cm−2 at room temperature [35].

In order to investigate the composition of discharge products, the combination of SEM images and EDX distribution mapping test of carbon paper after a discharge and recharge process at the first circle was carried out. As displayed in Fig. 8a and b, it is obvious that a large number of Fe particles deposited on the carbon fiber matrix of the CP after discharge, and then vanished obviously after recharge at 1.0 mA cm−2. Then the composition of the discharge products were further examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 8c, the main peaks can be indexed to graphite structure. However, the tiny peaks at 2θ values of 44.6°, 65.0°, 82.3° are well indexed to the planes of (110), (200), (211), respectively, in the standard spectrum of Cubic Iron (PDF# 65–4899), which implies the formation of metallic iron after discharge. And then the peaks indexed to iron vanished due to the amount of iron under detection after recharge. Based on the EDX and XRD results, it was confirmed that the hybrid liquid–solid cathode for novel battery is feasible, which may define a new research direction to modify other liquid/solid couples as hybrid cathodes.

An aggressive novel lithium–metal battery with a liquid–solid hybrid positive electrode of Fe3+/Fe2+/Fe protected by an impermeable Li1·4Al0.4Ge0.2Ti1.4(PO4)3–epoxy resin hybrid film was proposed. LERHF with an ionic conductivity of ca. 5.0 × 10−4 S cm−1, which is unstable in even very dilute aqueous FeCl3 solution, but exhibits the stability in 1 M FeCl3 dissolved in N,N-Dimethylformamide. The battery with 1 M FeCl3–0.1 M LiCl–DMF positive electrode can deliver a stable discharge capacity of ca. 110 mA h gFeCl3−1 for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ for 60 circles and 455 mA h gFeCl3−1 for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe for 21 circles at a current density of 1.0 mA cm−2,respectively. The combination of SEM images and EDX distribution map, and X-ray patterns confirmed that the iron particles were produced after discharge and the discharge product of Fe2+ and Fe can be recovered by recharging even without catalysts. This strategy is simple, cheap, high-efficient and mass-productive, and many metallic chlorides could be utilized as liquid–solid hybrid cathode such as Ni2+/Ni, Zn2+/Zn, Mn2+/Mn, Cu2+/Cu+/Cu, Co2+/Co in future, which also have high solubility in water or some organic solvents.
