Among the trivalent ion conductors reported, the highest ion conductivity was realized with the trivalent A13+ ion conducting (AlxZrx_x)4/{4 x)Nb(PO4)3 solid electrolyte and the value enters into the region between yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ) that are well known to be high oxide anion conductors commercialized. The improvement of the ion conductivity and the mechanical strength was simultaneously achieved by adding B203 during the sintering procedure. The A13~ ion conducting (AlxZrl_x)a/(4_x~Nb(PO4) 3 solid electrolyte with B20 3 treatment was combined with YSZ, and the 0.7La202SO4-0.3Li2SO4 solid was attached on the (AlxZrx_x)4/(a_x)Nb(PO4) 3 solid surface as the auxiliary electrode for sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas sensing. The sensor response was rapid, reproducible and continuous with obeying the Nernst theoretical relationship.
In some solids, ion migration occurs without any hole or electron conduction. Such a unique solid is called "Solid Electrolytes" and practically utilized for batteries and chemical sensors [1,2]. Among the ion species conducting in solids, monovalent and divalent cations and anions are well known to migrate in solids. In 1995 [3], macro-scopic trivalent cation conduction is solids was demonstrated by us and after that, various trivalent cations such as A13+ [4] and rare earth cations [5-7], are proved to migrate in solids in such structures as Sc2(WO4)3 type [8] and NASICON type. Among various trivalent cations, A13+ is one of the most practically applicable cation species, and especially, (A10.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4)3 of the NASICON type [9], has been demonstrated to show as high ion conductivity as yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) [10] and calcia stabilized zirconia (CSZ) [10]. 
In order to improve both the mechanical strength and the density of the polycrystalline solids simultaneously, one of suitable ways is to enhance the sinterability by diminishing the pores in the polycrystalline (Alo.2Zro.8)20/19Nb(PO4) 3 solid. Hot pressing (HP) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) methods are commonly applied under a high pressure of dozen to hundreds MPa to reduce the pores in polycrystalline solids and to obtain the well-sintered samples. However, these methods always need some high pressure apparatuses and therefore they are not suitable for the sintering at the ambient pressure. One of the effective ways to enhance the sinterability is to add some additives with the sample powder. Recently, we have succeeded in improving the sinterability and also the ion conductivity of the trivalent Sc 3+ ion conducting Sc2(WO4)3 polycrystalline solids by the use of the sintering additives of B20 3 [11] or GeO2 [12].
Starting materials of AI(OH)3, ZrO(NO3)2-2H20, Nb:O 5 and (NH4)2HPO4 were thoroughly mixed in a molar ratio of 8:32:19:114 and heated at 1000 ~ for 12 h and then pelletized. The pellets were heated at 1200 ~ for 12 h, and then 1300 ~ for 12 h in air. The pellets were pulverized and then pelletized with mixing B203 in a proper ratio. The mixed powder was pelletized and sintered at 1300 ~ for 12 h with intermediate holding at 850 ~ for 12 h in air. Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) was prepared by mixing ZrO 2 and Y203 in a molar ratio of 9:l and heating twice at 1600 ~ for 12 h in air. La20=SO4 was prepared by heating La:S3 at 1000 ~ for 12 h in air. The obtained L~202S04 was mixed with Li2SO4.H20 by a ball mill method in a molar ratio of 7 : 3 and the mixed powder was pelletized and heated at 850 ~ for 12 h in air. The 0.7LazO2SOa-0.3Li=SO4 prepared was made into pellets after pulverizing, and sintered at 850 ~ for 12 h in air. 
The sample characterization was carried out by X-ray powder diffractmeter (MultiFlex, Rigaku) using Cu-Kc~ radiation. The electrical conductivity measurements were carried out for the sintered pellets with platinum as an electrode using a complex impedance method at a frequency range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz by means of LCR meter (4192A, Hewlett-Packard)in the temperature range between 300 and 600 ~ 
The polarization measurements were done by passing adc current of 1 ~tA between two platinum mesh electrodes sandwiching the pellet and monitoring the dc voltage as a function of time both in oxygen (PO2:10 s Pa) and in nitrogen (PO25 40 Pa) atmospheres. In order to directly identify the conducting species in solids, dc electrolysis was performed by applying a dc voltage of 2.5 V for 100 h at 800 ~ in air, using two ion-blocking platinum bulk electrodes, and the elemental analysis on the cathodic surface of the electrolyzed sample was conducted by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) (EPMA-1500, Shimadzu). The Vickers hardness and the density of the pellets were measured by Micro Hardness Tester (HMV-2, Shimadzu) and the Archimedes method, respectively. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (S-4300SD, HITACHI) observation was performed so as to investigate the microstructure of the sintered sample. The boron content in the sintered samples was determined by the ICP (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analysis.
Figure 2 presents the X-ray powder diffraction results of the (Alo.2Zro.s)20/19Nb(PO4)3 solids with various amount of the B203 addition and that of pure (Alo.zZro8)20/19Nb(PO4) 3. The samples with the B203 addition lower than 6wt.%, were found to possess the single phase of the NASICON type structure with hexagonal symmetry. From the ICP measurements, the boron content in the sintered samples was found to be less than the detection limit of 10ppb and B203 added was found to have vaporized during the sintering procedure. In contrast, for the samples with the B203 addition more than 6wt%, the obtained phase is the mixture of the NASICON type (Alo.aZr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4) 3, ZrP~O7, and PzOs.9Nb2Os, indicating the decomposition of the mother NASICON type phase. From the above results, it is evident that the maximum amount of the B203 addition to obtain the single NASICON type phase is identified to be 6wt.%. 
The B203 mixed amount dependencies of the electrical conductivity for the B203 added (Alo.2Zr0.8)zo/19Nb(PO4) 3 series at 600 ~ is depicted in Fig. 3. The Vickers hardness of the sintered samples without and with B203 addition is also presented in the inserted figure in Fig. 3. Typical impedance plots for 300 and 400 ~ for both parent and B203 added samples are presented in Fig. 4. It is clear that the conductivity which is obtained from the intersection in abscissa (real) axis and corresponds to total conductivity, is enhanced by the B203 addition. The conductivity improves with the B203 addition up to 6wt.% and shows the highest conductivity of 8.51x10 -4 S'cm -1 for the 6wt.% B203 mixed sample. However, further B203 addition results in the decrease of the conductivity according to the formation of the insulating ZrP207, and P2Os.9Nb205 phase (see Fig. 2).
Polarization measurements were performed for the (Alo.2Zr0.8)20/19Nb(PO4) 3 sample with the 6wt.% B203 addition by measuring the dc to ac conductivity ratio (odc/crac) with time in oxygen (P~: 105 Pa) and in nitrogen (Po2:40 Pa) atmospheres at 600 ~ 
The (crao/cM) ratio abruptly reduces in both atmospheres and reaches the value lower than 0.005 after 30 rain, which is similar to the case for the pure A1 ~ ion conducting (A10.2Zr0.s)20119Nb(PO4)3 solid [9]. The result described above clearly indicates that the probability of oxide anion, hole, or electron conduction were denied and the cation transference number estimated is higher than 0.995 from the (%c/oaD ratio. Furthermore, dc electrolysis was carried out so as to directly identify the conducting cation species in the sample mixed with 6wt.% B203. After dc electrolysis, the deposits were clearly recognized on the cathodic surface and the content of the A1 element in the deposits was found to enhance approximately twenty times in comparison with that of the sample before the electrolysis from the EPMA measurement, same as the case for the pure A1 ~+ ion conducting (A10.zZr0.s)20,19-Nb(PO4)3 solid electrolyte [9]. 
From the results mentioned above, the present (Alo.2Zr0 s)zo/igNb(PO4)3 solid with the addition of 6wt.% B203 was found to be a pure A1 ~ ion conducting solid electrolyte.
The B203 addition in the A13+ ion conducting (A10.2Zr0,s)20/19Nb(PO4) 3 solid was appreciably effective to improve not only the A1 ~ ion conductivity but also the mechanical strength. The (A10.2Zr08)20/19Nb(PO4)3 solid electrolyte with B203 treatment was combined with divalent oxide anion conductor of stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and the 0.7La202SO4-0.3Li2SO4 solid solution was attached on the (Alo.2Zro.8)20/19Nb(PO4) 3 solid surface as the auxiliary SO2 sensing electrode. The sensor EMF output was rapid, continuous and reproducible with obeying the two electrons type Nernstian relationship, demonstrating a practical applicable SO2 sensing performance.
