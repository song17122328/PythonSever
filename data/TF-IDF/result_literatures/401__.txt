Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have been considered as promising candidates for large-scale energy storage, owing to the high abundance and low cost of sodium (Na) resources. However, the development of full SIB has been hindered by low energy density because of the sluggish kinetics of large Na+. Here, we report a full SIB with commercial tin (Sn) anode, cross-linked Na3V2(PO4)3/carbon nanotubes composites (NVP-CNT) cathode, and ether-based electrolyte. Sn is capable of delivering high reversible capacity via formation of Na15Sn4 and stable solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) in initial cycles. Meanwhile, the NASICON-type NVP enables ultrafast and stable Na+ intercalation/extraction, and the incorporation of CNT can improve its electrical conductivity. The assembled full SIB delivers high output voltage of ~3.2 V, high energy density of 253.4 W h kg−1 at 1600 W kg−1 based on total mass of both cathode and anode, and remarkable capacity retention of 96.1% after 180 cycles. These merit construction of high-energy full SIBs and will promote the development of SIBs. 

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted increasing attention from electric energy storage to electric vehicles due to the low cost and high abundance of sodium resources [1– 4]. However, SIBs are still constrained by the relatively lower energy density (50–120 W h kg−1) than Li-ion batteries (120–250 W h kg−1). It is mainly because the heavy and large sized Na+ reduces the mass transport and kinetics. Theoretically, the energy density (E) can be promoted by enhancing either the capacity (C) or output voltage (V) (E=CV) [5–8]. Numerous efforts have been dedicated into the cathodes/anodes based on the material design, structure and morphology [9,10]. To date, high-energy electrodes are still lacking, severely hindering the rapid development of full SIBs. Therefore, it remains challenging to explore suitable electrode materials to host the large-sized Na+ and provide sufficient capacity for high-energy full SIBs [11,12].

A variety of cathode materials, such as layered oxides (NaMO2), sulfate (AMSO4), phosphate (A3M2(PO4)3) and pyrophosphates (AMP2O7) have been investigated. Of note, Na3V2(PO4)3, a sodium super ion conductor with high redox voltage of ~3.4 V, is favorable as cathode material for highenergy-density full SIBs. The most critical issue for a SIB is to identify a desirable anode to accommodate Na+ [13–17]. Graphite, the commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, delivers a low reversible capacity of ~110 mA h g−1 with an operating potential of ~0.6 V in SIBs, which may not be appropriate for full SIBs with high energy density [18,19]. Alloy-based anodes (i.e. Bi, Sn, Pb or Sb) can provide a high capacity of >300 mA h g−1 and reasonable sodiation potential of 0.2–1.0 V, which are promising candidates in comparison to carbon materials (~100 mA h g−1) and metal oxides/sulfides (>1.0 V) [20–23]. Sn with a high capacity of 847 mA h g−1 and low redox potential of ~0.2 V seems to be a promising anode for a full SIB with high energy density. But the severe pulverization and decaying capacity resulting from the dramatic volume change (420%) restrain its practical application [24,25]. Recently, this issue has been resolved by coupling with ether-based electrolytes [26,27]. Up to now, desirable cathode/anode materials are rarely reported towards the construction of high-energy full SIBs with high voltages.

Herein, we construct a high-energy-density full SIB with microsized Sn anode and composite cathode of Na3V2(PO4)3 and carbon nanotubes (NVP-CNT), as well as an ether-based electrolyte. The synergetic effect of Sn anode with etherbased electrolytes promotes formation of a porous integrity of Sn and guarantees high electron and Na+ transport; the combination of NVP and CNT endows the cathode with high electric conductivity. These merit the full SIB with high output voltage of ~3.2 V, ultrahigh energy density of 253.4 W h kg−1 at power density of 1600 W kg−1 (based on total mass of both cathode and anode), and outstanding cycling stability with 96.1% capacity retention after 180 cycles. This work will encourage the design of high-performance full SIBs.

Sn powder (325 mesh) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). NVP-CNT was prepared by sol-gel and sequent thermal reduction. Firstly, 1 mmol of V2O5 and 3 mmol of H2C2O4•2H2O were dissolved in 20 mL deionized water with stirring at 70 °C to get a clear blue solution. Then, 3 mmol of NaH2PO4 was added with continuous stirring for 1 h. CNT (22.8 mg) was firstly dispersed into 50 mL absolute ethyl alcohol with ultrasonic treatment for 2 h. Then the dispersed CNT suspension was dropped into the above solution and kept stirring at 70 °C to get the precursor. After drying, the precursor was grounded in an agate mortar and pressed into pellets using infrared mold. Finally, the NVP-CNT was obtained after preheating the precursor at 400 °C for 4 h and then annealing at 750 °C for 8 h under argon (Ar) atmosphere.

X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Miniflex600, Japan; Cu Kα radiation, λ=1.5406 Å) was applied to characterize the crystal structure of Sn, NVP-CNT, and intermediates generated at different charge and discharge states. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7500F, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips Tecnai FEI, Japan) were employed to characterize the morphologies and microstructures of electrodes. Before characterization, all the charged/discharged electrodes were washed with 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) to remove the residual electrolyte in an Ar-filled glove box.

The CR2032 coin cells, assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with O2<0.1 ppm and H2O<0.1 ppm, were used to investigate the electrochemical property for both half and full batteries. The Sn anode was prepared by mixing 85 wt% Sn, 5 wt% Super P, and 10 wt% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC) in deionized water. Then the as-prepared slurry was coated onto a copper foil followed by vacuum-drying at 80 °C for 10 h. While the NVP-CNT cathode was obtained by mixing NVP-CNT, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) and Super P in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with a weight ratio of 8:1:1. The slurry was pasted onto an aluminum foil and dried at 110 °C in a vacuum oven for 10 h. The mass loading is 0.5–0.8 mg cm−2 for tin anode and 3.8–5.8 mg cm−2 for NVP-CNT cathode, respectively. T The electrolyte was 1 M of NaPF6 in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DEGDME, Meryer, 99.5%). Glass fiber of Whatman was used as separator. In the half batteries, metallic sodium foil was used as negative electrode. For full SIB of Sn//NVPCNT, there was a slight excess capacity (5%–10%) of anode compared with that of cathode. Before assembling the full SIB, the Sn anode was presodiated to achieve stable surface/ interface. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on Solartron 1407E electrochemical workstation. Charge/discharge tests were performed on Land CT2001A battery (China). The EIS at different temperatures were tested in Bluepard LRH-CL/ CA (China).

Commercial Sn was used as anode active material without any treatment. XRD pattern of Sn in Figure 1(a) can be readily indexed to tetragonal Sn with space group of I41/amd (JCPDS No. 04-0673). The morphology of Sn is spherical particle with a size of 1–4 μm, as displayed in SEM image in Figure 1(b). The NVP-CNT was synthesized by a sol-gel method. Figure 1(c) displays XRD profile of NVP-CNT, in which all sharp diffraction peaks match well with rhombohedral phase (JCPDS No. 32-1101). The morphology of NVP-CNT is shown in Figure 1(d). The combination of NVP and CNT guarantees excellent conductive framework among NVP particles, and thus favors high electron and Na+ transport.

The full SIB based on Sn//NaPF6-diglyme//NVP-CNT is assembled, as demonstrated in Figure 2(a), and its electro-chemical mechanism is further explored. CV was implemented to examine the half cells of Sn and NVP-CNT, and full SIB of Sn//NVP-CNT. The CV profile of Sn in Figure 2(b) shows three cathodic peaks at 0.25, 0.17 and 0.02 V, which can be intrinsically attributed to the formation of NaxSn alloys (x<3.75). In the anodic scan, three well-defined peaks at 0.24, 0.55 and 0.68 V are assigned to the desodiation process. Accordingly, the CV profile of NVPCNT exhibits a pair of well-defined redox peaks at about 3.4 V in Figure 2(b), corresponding to the reversible transformation of V3+/V4+. The CV profile of the full SIB in Figure 2(b) shows three peaks at 3.17, 3.37 and 3.41 V during cathodic scan, corresponding to the Sn alloying and desodiation of NVP-CNT. On the contrast, in the anodic scan, there are also three peaks at 3.15, 2.81 and 2.71 V. This phenomenon represents reversible electrochemical process during cycling.

The rate capability of Sn anode at different current densities from 50 to 3200 mA g−1 is presented in Figure 2(c) and Figure S1 (Supporting Information online). The reversible capacity is obtained to be 729 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and even the current density increases up to 3200 mA g−1, the discharge capacity remains 587.8 mA h g−1. The typical discharge-charge profile at 50 mA g−1 shows three voltage platforms, in agreement with CV profile. The excellent rate capability is endowed with high electric conductivity of Sn. In addition, the long-term cyclic stability of Sn is obtained at 200 mA g−1 for 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 93% in Figure S1. This is attributed to the formation of porous integrity of Sn in ether-based electrolyte, as shown in Figure S3. Simultaneously, NVP-CNT shows outstanding rate capability with reversible capacities of 106.3 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and 98 mA h g−1 at 3600 mA g−1. The cycling performance is further studied at 100 mA g−1 in Figure S1, where reversible discharge capacity of 104.4 mA h g−1 is obtained. It shows only 2.6% capacity loss after 200 cycles. For comparison, the cycling stability and rate performance of bare NVP are investigated, as shown in Figure S2. It delivers a low capacity of ~65 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with capacity retention of 91.2% after 100 cycles, and only ~20 mA h g−1 at 1600 mA g−1. The superior electrochemical performance of NVP-CNT is attributed to the combination of NVP and CNT, which enables fast Na+ extraction/insertion in conductive structure.

Typical charge-discharge profiles of the full SIB at 400 mA g−1 are presented in Figure 3(a), in which the obvious voltage platforms are consistent with the redox peaks of CV profile in Figure 2(b). The full SIB exhibits excellent cycling capability, delivering a capacity of 645 mA h g−1 after 180 cycles with a capacity retention of 96.4% in Figure 3(b). Impressive rate capability is also achieved in the full SIB in Figure 3(c) and Figure S4. Even at higher current density of 4000 mA g−1, the capability can still be up to 630.8 mA h g−1. The excellent rate capability of the full SIB enables fast charge and discharge, which is essential for practical application. Figure 3(d) shows the Ragone plot of the full SIB, revealing the relationship between energy and power density. Note that, all values of energy and power densities are calculated based on the total mass of both cathode and anode materials. As shown in Figure 3(d) and Table S1 (Supporting Information online), the full SIB of Sn//NVP-CNT delivers a higher energy density, which is rarely reported in the other reported full batteries [28–31]. The result suggests that the rational design of full SIB is an effective approach to improve the battery performance.

To elucidate the electrochemical reaction mechanism of both Sn anode and NVP-CNT cathode, ex-situ XRD was performed for the second cycle at 50 mA g−1. In Figure 4(a, b) the diffraction peaks of the pristine Sn gradually disappear as charging to 3.4 V, and alternatively a new phase of NaSn occurs. As charging to 3.5 V, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Na9Sn4 phase emerges, and when further charged to 3.8 V, the presence of Na15Sn4 is confirmed by the diffraction peaks at 19.1°, 31.9°, 33.4° and 35.9°. In the following discharging process the reversible dealloying reaction can be observed evidently. Accordingly, the reversible alloying/ dealloying process can be described as the following equa4NaSn+5Na++5e−↔Na9Sn4; tions: Na9Sn4+5Na++5e−↔Na15Sn4. The phase transformation process for NVP-CNT is shown in Figure 4(c), all diffraction peaks are indexed to NVP-CNT with the NASICON structure. Upon charging, the diffraction peaks at 28.8°, 32.1°, and 35.6° gradually decrease while new peaks at 24.5°, 29.4°, 32.6° and 36.8° gently emerge, which corresponds to the gradual formation of NaV2(PO4)3 phase [32,33]. Also, the peaks of Na3V2(PO4)3 disappear at 3.8 V, and all the remaining peaks match with NaV2(PO4)3 phase. These are in good accordance with the redox peaks of CV profile in Figure 2(b).

The pristine, charged and discharged phases of Sn anode and NVP-CNT cathode are characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM). The lattice plane of (220) with 0.20 nm is assigned to pristine Sn in Figure 4(d). When charged to 3.8 V, the phase of Na15Sn4 arises, which is confirmed by the well-developed facets with d-spacing of 0.28 nm in Figure 4(e). When discharged to 2.5 V, it can recover to original Sn phase, as displayed in Figure 4(f). In addition, it is clear that uniform solid electrolyte interface (SEI) films exist in both charging and discharging processes, which ensures excellent cycling stability. In addition, the HRTEM images in Figure 4(g–i) show lattice fringes with d-spacing of 0.37, 0.43 and 0.27 nm, which are ascribed to the (113) plane of pristine, the (104) plane of NaV2(PO4)3, and (122) plane of Na3V2(PO4)3, respectively. These results further confirm the existence of charged and discharged products, and indicate highly reversible electrochemical reaction process.

To further investigate the excellent rate capability of both Sn anode and NVP-CNT cathode, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) was employed to analyze the Namigration kinetics. For single titration in Figure S5, a linear fitting is usually observed between cell voltage (V) and square root of galvanostatic time (τ1/2). Therefore, the ionic diffusion coefficient (DNa) can be calculated by the following equation:

where mB, MB, and VM represent the active mass, molar weight and molar volume of the Sn, respectively; τ is the time for an applied galvanostatic current; S and L are the geometric area and average thickness of the electrode, respectively; ΔEs and ΔEτ are marked in Figure S5 [34]. Here, VM for Sn and NVP-CNT are assumed to remain stable as their slightly change can be ignored. The calculated DNa values for Sn anode in Figure 5(a) are in the order of magnitude of 10−15–10−12 cm2 s−1, and the values in the middle of each plateau are clearly smaller than those at both ends, which is coincident with previous reports [35]. For the NVP-CNT cathode, the calculated values in Figure 5(c) are in the order of magnitude of 10−13–10−9 cm2 s−1, which shows similar variation trend. The high diffusion coefficient of both anode and cathode ensures the excellent rate capability of the full SIB [36].

The activation energies (Ea) of the main discharging process at 0.25, 0.175 and 0.02 V were characterized by EIS. Figures S6 and S7 show the EIS of the bulk Sn anode at different discharge states and temperatures. The typical Nyquist plot consists of a semicircle in the high-frequency region including electrode/electrolyte interface film resistance (Rf) and charge transfer resistance (Rct), and an inclined line in the low-frequency region, which is related to the Na+ diffusion in active materials [37]. Both the Rf and Rct decrease with the increase of temperature, which can be attributed to the faster Na+ diffusion in an elevated temperature. The exchange currents (i0) and Ea can be calculated by the Eq. (2) and the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)) as follows:

where R, T, F, A and n represent gas constant, absolute temperature, Faraday constant, temperature-independent coefficient, and number of transferred electrons, respectively [38,39]. The calculated Ea at the voltages of 0.25, 0.175 and 0.02 V in Figure 5(b) are 25.7, 22.3 and 27.3 kJ mol−1, respectively. For the NVP-CNT cathode in Figure 5(d), the calculated Ea are 44.39 and 46.59 kJ mol−1 at 0.338 and 0.339 V in charging process. The relatively low Ea of both anode and cathode indicates fast electrochemical kinetics and short diffusion pathway of the charge transfer process, resulting in excellent rate performance of half batteries and thus full SIB.

In summary, a high-energy-density full SIB with commercial bulk Sn anode and cross-linked NVP-CNT cathode was successfully constructed. The full SIB exhibits high output voltage of ~3.2 V and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 96.1% after 180 cycles. The energy and power densities of the full SIB reach up to 253.4 W h kg−1 and 1600 W kg−1, respectively, based on total mass of both cathode and anode. The excellent performance is attributed to the formation of a porous integrity of Sn in ether-based electrolyte and the combination of NVP and CNT for high electron conductivity and Na+ transport. The design of full SIB provides a viable solution for future large-scale energy storage.
