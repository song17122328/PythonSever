Molybdate cathode materials have attracted a lot of attention due to their rich crystal structure, stable skeleton structure and moderate electronic conductivity. In this paper, a new NASICON-type material Li3Cr(MoO4) 3 has been studied for the first time as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries with high specific capacity. Comprehensive studies by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis-IR diffuse reflection, bond valence sum maps calculation, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the Four-Probe method show that Li3Cr(MoO4)3 possesses a narrow band gap, high electronic conductivity and fast lithium ion transport channels, and delivers a high specific capacity (200 mA h g−1) and rate performance. Electrochemical mechanism studies indicate that both the Mo6+/5+ and Cr3+/Cr2+ reactions contribute to the high specific capacity.

In order to meet the urgent needs of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage, rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIB) have been widely studied over the past few decades.1–5 Cathode materials are the key factors and limitations for the further improvement of energy density. A lot of cathode materials have been widely investigated and applied in LIBs, for example, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4, and Li(NixCoyMnz)O2 (x + y + z = 1).6–9 Among them, polyanion compounds have attracted a lot of attention due to their high levels of safety, moderate capacities, long-term cycling stabilities and higher working voltages. A large number of polyanion cathode materials, such as LiFePO4, Li3V2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 have been explored.10–15

Phosphate cathodes are the most investigated polyanion cathode materials.16–18 On the one hand, the inductive effect of the PO4 groups can raise the operating potential compared to their oxide counterparts.12,19–22 On the other hand, the electronic insulating PO4 groups also separate the valence electrons of the transition metal phosphides, which leads to very low intrinsic electronic conductivity (e.g., LiFePO4: 10−9 to 10−11 S cm−1, Li3V2(PO4)3: 10−8to 10−10 S cm−1)23–30 and thus limits their wider applications. In order to solve these problems, much effort has been made in reducing particle size, carbon coating and ion doping.19,29–31 By contrast, in molybdate cathodes, MoO4 anion groups can not only provide certain inductive effects, but can also form a skeleton. In addition, they can supply moderate electronic conductivity and additional specific capacity through the Mo6+/Mo5+ redox couples. Therefore, molybdate is a kind of potential cathode material for lithium ion batteries. Several molybdate polyanion electrode materials have been explored. For example, the Li3V(MoO4)3 cathode delivers a specific capacity of more than 100 mA h g−1 and has two voltage platforms of 2.1 V and 3.7 V between 1.7–4.9 V.15 During the charging process, Li ion extraction is related to vanadium oxidation (V4+/3+), while in the discharging process, molybdenum reduction (Mo6+/5+) and partial vanadium reduction (V3+/V2+) take place. In Li3Fe(MoO4)3, the insertion and desertion of Li ions can be found at about 1.8 V and 2.4 V, with a specific capacity as high as 150 mA h g−1.32

In addition, the application of polyanion materials with a Na+-superionic-conductor (NASICON) structure as solid electrolyte and cathode materials has attracted a lot of attention. The NASICON-type Li3Fe2(PO4)3, Fe2(SO4)3, V2(SO4)3, TiNb(PO4)3, LiTi2(PO4)3, Li2TiFe(PO4)3, and Li3V2(PO4)3 have all been investigated as electrode materials for LIBs.14,33–41 Li3V(MoO4)3 and Li3Fe(MoO4)3 molybdate both belong to the NASICON structure series, and possess excellent lithium ion diffusion rates. Combined with moderate electronic conductivity, NASICON-type molybdates show competitive electrochemical properties as LIB cathodes. Therefore, exploring new NASICON-type molybdate polyanion electrode materials for LIBs is an interesting and challenging research topic.

In this paper, a new and high specific capacity molybdate polyanion, NASICON-type Li3Cr(MoO4)3, is synthesized. The crystal structure and electrochemical properties are studied. The bond valence sum difference maps (BVS-DMs) are also calculated and discussed. In addition, the charge–discharge mechanisms are investigated.

The Li3Cr(MoO4)3 sample was synthesized by a solid state method using Li2CO3, Cr(NO3)3 and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O as raw materials. First, stoichiometric Li2CO3, Cr(NO3)3, and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O were ground together in an agate mortar, then placed in a crucible and put into a muffle furnace. The pretreatment temperature was 300 °C, and the reaction time was 10 h. Finally, the pretreated powder was reground and sintered at 550 °C for 24 h in air, and the final sample was obtained.

The crystal structure of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 was analyzed using a Rigaku Ultima IV powder X-ray diffractometer with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation at λ = 1.54 Å in the 2θ range of 10–70°. The morphology of the sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL 7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100). The conductivities of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 and Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C were measured by the Four-Probe method using the digital Four-Probe resistivity tester (SX1934(SZ-82), Suzhou Dianxun Instrument Factory). A Perkin Elmer Lamda-950 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer with a diffuse reflectance accessory was used to measure the spectra of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 in the range of 200 nm (6.2 eV) to 2000 nm (0.62 eV).

The Bond-Str program of the Fullprof software was used to calculate the bond valence sum difference maps (BVS-DMs)2,42 of Li3Cr(MoO4)3. At each point on a 3D grid (100 × 100 × 100) within the unit cell, the absolute value of the difference (|ΔV|) between the calculated valence of Li and the ideal valence of 1 was plotted as an isosurface with the VESTA software.43

The electrochemical properties were tested by assembling CR2016 coin cells in a glove box filled with pure argon gas. In order to improve the electrochemical properties, carbon black (Super P) and Li3Cr(MoO4)3 with a weight ratio of 1 : 9 were mixed by ball-milling at 450 rpm for 12 h. Primary or carbon-mixed cathode materials, Super P and polyvinylidenefluoride in a weight ratio of 7 : 2 : 1 were mixed and dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidone to form a slurry. The slurry was then uniformly coated on carbon-coated Al foil and dried under vacuum at 120 °C. Metallic lithium foil was used as the anode electrode, Celgard 2325 membrane was used as a separator and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1 : 1 volume) was used as the electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed in the voltage window of 1.5–4.2 V on a LAND 2100 system (Wuhan, China). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded between 1.5 V and 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li on a CHI electrochemical working station at 25 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the batteries were performed in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz using a PARSTAT 2237 test system with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV under open circuit potential conditions.

Fig. 1a shows the XRD refinement pattern for the Li3Cr(MoO4)3 sample. The Li3Cr(MoO4)3 compound is crystalized in the space group of Pnma (62) with an orthorhombic crystal system.44 There are no obvious impurities in the compound. In addition, the pattern for Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C is agreement with that for Li3Cr(MoO4)3 (Fig. 1b), which indicates that the ball-milling process did not change the crystal structure.

The crystal structure of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 is shown in Fig. S1a and c.† In Li3Cr(MoO4)3, one Mo atom is connected to four O atoms to generate distorted tetrahedra. The Li1 atom and the Cr1 atom share the same 4c sites, and are coordinated to six O atoms in an octahedral geometry. The Li2 and Cr2 atoms both occupy the same 8d sites. The polyhedrons are further linked by sharing O atoms to form a three dimensional structure with a one dimensional channel along the a direction with Li3 atoms occupying and diffusing along this direction. This is confirmed by the BVS-DMs (Fig. 1c and S1b and c†), where a clear channel along the a axis can be observed. The size of the one-dimensional channel along the a axis is about 1.6 Å, which is large enough for the mobility of lithium ions. The one-dimensional channel of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 provides fast lithium ion mobility in electrochemical reactions, indicating excellent rate performances.

Fig. 1d shows Raman spectra of primary and carbon-mixed Li3Cr(MoO4)3. In general, there are four vibron modes in the MoO4 tetrahedra: a totally symmetrical stretching mode v1(A1), a bending mode v2(E), an asymmetrical stretching mode v3 and a bending mode v4(F2), respectively. All four of the vibron modes can be well-defined in Fig. 1d, suggesting that Li3Cr(MoO4)3 has a good crystal quality. In addition, the D-band (1346 cm−1) and G-band (1602 cm−1) are obvious in the Raman spectra for Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C, indicating the existence of carbon in the composite.19 The high value of IG/ID (0.98) suggests high electronic conductivity. In addition, after mixing with Super P, the intensity of the vibrational peak decreases significantly, indicating that the Li3Cr(MoO4)3 particles are mainly coated by conductive carbon and are reduced in size. This provides high electronic conductivity and a large reaction area for electrochemical reactions, which is beneficial to the performance of the electrode materials.

The SEM image (Fig. 2a) of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 shows homogeneous rod-like crystals, with sizes of up to 10 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. The crystal grows along the crystallographic c direction, the longest axis direction of the crystal structure (the inset of Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2b–d, after ball-milling with Super P, the Li3Cr(MoO4)3 rod partially maintains its shape, but the particle size is greatly reduced, which is beneficial for shortening the transmission distance of the lithium ion. Super P with a thickness of about 10 nm is coated on the surface of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 to form Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C.

Fig. 2 (a) SEM image of Li3Cr(MoO4)3, (b) SEM image of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C, (c) TEM image of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C, (d) and (e) HRTEM images of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C, and (f) SAED pattern of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C.

As observed in Fig. 2e, the HRTEM image shows a distance of 0.896 nm, corresponding to the lattice spacing of the (011) crystal plane of Li3Cr(MoO4)3. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the Li3Cr(MoO4)3 crystal shows single crystalline diffraction spots as seen in Fig. 2f, corresponding to the (011), (101) and (112) crystal planes. The TEM results further prove the high crystallinity of Li3Cr(MoO4)3, which is in agreement with the XRD and Raman spectra results.

The intrinsic electronic conductivity is significant to the specific capacity and rate performance of electrode materials. As is well known, the intrinsic electronic conductivity is determined by the band gap. Here, the band gap of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 was characterized by UV-vis-IR diffuse reflection. As shown in Fig. 3, Li3Cr(MoO4)3 has obvious absorption at about 450 nm. With a straightforward extrapolation method,45 the optical band gap of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 can be estimated to be 2.76 eV, which is consistent with its red color. The band gap of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 is much smaller than that of LiFePO4 (3.8 eV), which means a higher intrinsic electronic conductivity. In addition, the practical bulk conductivity of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 was further characterized by the Four-Probe method. The conductivity of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 is 1.0 × 10−4 S cm−1. After being coated with Super P, the bulk conductivity of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C is increased to 0.2 S cm−1, higher than the reported value of Li4.5Mo2.48VO9.93 (2.0 × 10−5 S cm−1),46,47 which suggests higher rate performances.

The electrochemical properties of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C and Li3Cr(MoO4)3 for LIBs were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling testing between 1.5∼4.2 V. As shown in Fig. 4a, pure Li3Cr(MoO4)3 only delivers a specific capacity of 25 mA h g−1 at 0.1C (1C = 200 mA g−1), which indicates that the intrinsic electronic conductivity is still not large enough for the electrochemical reaction. Considering that the large particle size and the low conductivity are the main defects, the samples were subjected to ball-milling with Super P. After ball-milling, the particle size reduces to several hundred nm (as shown in Fig. 2b), which reduces the diffusion distance of the lithium ions and increases the area of electrochemical reaction. In addition, conductive carbon enhances the electronic conductivity of the Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C material, thus improving the utilization of the active materials. As a result, Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C presents a specific capacity as high as 200 mA h g−1. There are obvious stages of lithium extraction and insertion on the charge–discharge curves of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C. As shown in Fig. 4b, two oxidation peaks (2.5 V and 3.8 V) and two reduction peaks (3.2 V and 2.0 V) can be observed in the corresponding CV profiles. As reported, the distinct plateau regions and peaks at 3.7V/3.2 V are attributed to the Mo6+/Mo5+ redox couple.15,48,49 And the distinct plateau regions and peaks at 2.4V/2.0 V are attributed to the Mo6+/Mo5+ and Cr3+/Cr2+ redox couples.48–50 The electrochemical reactions of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 are inferred as follows:

The theoretical specific capacity calculated based on the above reactions is 194 mA h g−1 for Li3Cr(MoO4)3, close to the experimental value. The additional specific capacity should be attributed to the effects of the conductive carbon. Fig. 4c shows the rate performances at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C, 5C, 10C, and 20C, respectively. Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C delivers a much better rate performance than Li3Cr(MoO4)3. With an increase of rate, the specific capacity gradually decreases. At 5C, it delivers a specific capacity of 100 mA h g−1. Even at 20C, it still delivers a specific capacity of 50 mA h g−1. Fig. 4d reveals the cycling stability of the Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C samples. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity remains at 130 mA h g−1. The cycling stability can be further improved by optimizing the synthesis conditions. Compared to reported Li3V(MoO4)3 and Li3Fe(MoO4)3 cathode materials with similar structures, Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C delivers a much higher specific capacity.

In order to study the structure information during the charge–discharge process, in situ XRD is carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer. As seen in Fig. 5a, the evolution of the XRD pattern is closely related to the electrochemical process. The symmetric structure evolution behaviour (Fig. 5b) suggests that the insertion–deinsertion process of Li3Cr(MoO4)3 is reversible during charge–discharge between 1.5 V and 4.2 V. Li3Cr(MoO4)3 exhibits single-phase solid-solution insertion–deinsertion behaviour. As shown in Fig. 5b, the intensity and position of the (122) peak at 26.5° and the (104) peak at 26.8° evolve smoothly and no new peaks emerge during the charge–discharge process.

In addition, the peak corresponding to the (122) lattice plane shifts to a lower 2θ angle during the charging process, and shifts back to a higher 2θ angle during the discharging process. However, the peak corresponding to the (104) lattice plane shifts to a higher 2θ angle during the charging process, and shifts back to a lower 2θ angle during the discharging process. These phenomena indicate an increase of the b-axis with a subsequent decrease, while the c-axis decreases with a subsequent increase (Fig. 5c). The increase is related to the enhancement of electrostatic repulsion between the adjacent MoO4 anion groups, while the decrease is attributed to the empty space during delithiation.

EIS analysis was carried out to characterize the resistance and lithium ion diffusion of Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C. A semicircle and a sloping line can be obviously observed from the Nyquist plot (Fig. 6a). The spots are fitted using the equivalent circuit, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6a. The ohmic resistance (Rs) obtained from the intercept in the upper-frequency region of the Z′ real axis is the resistance of the electrolyte and the contacts of the cell. The constant phase element (CPE) represents the double layer capacitance. The charge transfer resistance estimated from the semicircle in the upper-middle frequency region is associated with the charge transfer process. The numerical value of the diameter of the semicircle on the Z′ axis is approximated to be the charge transfer resistance (Rct). Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C delivers a charge transfer resistance of 45 Ω. The sloping line is attributed to the Warburg impedance, which is associated with the diffusion of the Li ions,19,30,31 and the diffusion coefficient of the Li ions (D) is calculated according to eqn (1) and (2), with detailed information given in the ESI:†

The inset pattern shows the relationship between Z′ and the square root of frequency (ω−1/2) in the lower-frequency region. The slope of the linearly fitted lines of Z′ and ω−1/2 is the Warburg factor (σ). The diffusion coefficient of the Li ions (D) can be easily obtained according to eqn (1). Table S1† presents the values of s and D. The Li ion diffusion coefficient of the Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C is about 4.3 × 10−15 cm2 S−1, comparable to other reported cathode materials.51–53

In summary, two main reasons cause the high specific capacity and moderate electrochemical properties. First, the Li3Cr(MoO4)3 possesses a NASICON-type three-dimensional structure with a large channel, which can provide fast lithium ion mobility for electrochemical reactions. Second, Li3Cr(MoO4)3 possesses a narrow band gap and thus moderate intrinsic electronic conductivity. After ball-milling with Super P, Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C exhibits high intrinsic and apparent electronic conductivity. In addition, the ball-milling process reduces the particle size and increases the area of electrochemical reaction. These two facts are significant for enhancing the rate performances.

A new NASICON-type molybdate, Li3Cr(MoO4)3 is reported for the first time as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries with a high specific capacity. The sample can be obtained by a simple solid state method at a low temperature (550 °C). The BVS-DMs indicate that Li3Cr(MoO4)3 possesses a NASICON structure with a one-dimensional channel, thus favoring the fast mobility of lithium ions. In addition, experiments prove the existence of narrow band gaps (2.76 eV for Li3Cr(MoO4)3) and high bulk conductivity (0.2 S cm−1 for Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C), which play important roles in electrochemical performances. The Li3Cr(MoO4)3@C sample delivers a specific capacity as high as 200 mA h g−1. The mechanism for the electrochemical reactions is related to the lithium extraction/insertion of Li3Cr(MoO4)3. This cathode material is a promising cathode material for lithium ion batteries after enhancing its stability by optimizing the synthesis conditions.
