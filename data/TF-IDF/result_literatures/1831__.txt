A new potassium iron (III) pyrophosphate was synthesized by hydrothermal technique and cha- racterized by X-ray studies. The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic space group, P21/c, with cell parameters, a = 7×365(2) Å, b = 10×017(2) Å, c = 8×214(1) Å, b = 106×50(1)° and Z = 4. The structure has tunnel-type cavities and  are congenial for ion transportation through them. The compound exhibits moderate thermal stability.
NASICON and related compounds belong to the well known family of solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and general formula, Na1+x Zr2SixP3–x  O12, with 0 < x < 3 (Goodenough et al 1976; Hong 1976). The application of these materials as solid electrolytes to replace  the conventional b-aluminas in Na batteries was initially suggested. However, NASICON-based cells are not stable when they are in contact with molten Na electrodes (Gordon et al 1981). However, possible application of NASICON related in Na, K or Co, Fe sensors was demonstrated and a NASICON based commercial CO2 sensor has already been proposed (Caneiro et al 1991; Miura et al 1992; Fuentes et al 2001). Recently, this family of materials has attracted the attention of researchers looking for ionselective electrodes or gas sensor devices (Ahmad et al 1995; Khireddine et al 1997; Fuentes et al 2001). 
Most of  these stable ones assess the relation between composition, structure and electrical conductivity and the higher values of conductivity, and is also related to monoclinic symmetry, when x lies in the range 1×8–2×2. For other values of x, the structural modification to rhombohedral symmetry is associated with decrease in conductivity. Earlier reports indicate the use of iron phosphates with different substitutions as luminescence materials (Sarver et al 1961; Looeny and Brown 1971; Donker et al 1989; Pelova et al 1995). A new structural diversity of the simple stoichiometric composition of iron pyrophosphate compound (KFeP2O7) is reported here. The compound has been synthesized by hydrothermal technique and characterized by X-ray diffraction method
NASICON related new potassium iron (III) pyrophosphates were synthesized by the hydrothermal technique at relatively moderate temperature and pressure conditions. The growth of phosphates by hydrothermal method is relatively new. The use of hydrothermal method is quite complicated for these compounds, because of the highly corrosive and volatile nature of phosphorus at higher temperatures. The present experiments were carried out in Morey autoclaves (figure 1) provided with Teflon liners at 260°C and in the pressure range 60–100 bars. The starting materials such as iron (III) chloride and known quantity of 85% H3PO4 were added to the reaction vessel. The  alkaline component, KOH, was added in the form of molar solution and this solution acts as a mineralizer. KFeP2O7 crystals could be synthesized under the following ratios The experiments were carried out for 10 days and quenched to ambient conditions and thoroughly washed with distilled water. 
The crystals thus obtained were of good quality with well developed morphology. The morphology  of the crystals varied according to the growth techniques,  the physico-chemical conditions and the composition and concentration of the starting materials. On the whole, KFeP2O7 crystals obtained by the hydrothermal methods were of good quality and exhibited smooth surface morphology, translucent luster, gray colour; growth steps were observed to have a size in the range 0×5–3 mm (figure 2).  A prism shaped crystal with approximate size, 0×2 × 0×2 × 0×2 mm, was chosen for X-ray diffraction study.
The measurements were made on a DIPLabo Imaging Plate system with graphite monochromated radiation  (MoKa). Thirtysix frames of data were collected by osci- llation method. Successive frames were scanned in steps of 5°/min with an oscillation range of 5°. Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied. Image processing  and data reduction were done using Denzo (Otwinowski  and Minor 1997; Mackay et al 1999). All frames could be  indexed with a monoclinic primitive lattice. The phase set with the highest combined figure of merit gave the positions of all the non-hydrogen atoms. Least-squares  refinement using SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick 1997) with isotropic temperature factors for all the non-hydrogen atoms converged the residual to R1 = 0×1453. 
Few more final cycles of full-matrix least square refinement based on 934 observed reflections and 100 variable parameters with anisotropic thermal parameters for nonhydrogen atomsand isotropic thermal parameters for hydrogen atoms converged the residual to R1 = 0×0729 and wR2 = 0×2060 and G.O.F. on F2 was 1×108.
The details of crystal data and refinement are given in table 1. The final positional coordinates with equivalent isotropic temperature factors and anisotropic thermal parameters (Uij) of all the atoms are listed in tables 2 and 3. Bond distances and angles are given in tables 4 and 5, respectively. The bond distances and angles are in good agreement with the standard values. Figure 3 represents the ORTEP of the molecules with thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability (Johnson 1976). The packing of molecules along a and c axes exhibits a three-dimensional  open framework structure with tunnel type cavities inside it (figures 4 and 5). These cavities help the movement of ions and thus support the ion transport phenomenon.
FTIR-spectrum was registered for KFeP2O7 compound using a high resolution Perkin Elmer Infrared Spectrophotometer in the range 4000–400 cm–1  (figure 6). This compound exhibits prominent multiple absorption bands especially in the frequency ranges 2351 cm–1  and 1050–459 cm–1  regions. The multiplication and fineness of the absorption bands of phosphates lie in the lower range, which indicates complexity of the internal crystalline structure of the [PO4] tetrahedron. The degree of condensation of the anion, [PO4]3–  to [P2O7]4– , is directly related to its multiplicity of absorption bands (Byrappa et al 1970). This compound has relatively more bands in the medium to low frequency region, i.e. 906–459 cm–1 , when compared to earlier reported pyrophosphate compound (Gopalakrishna et al 2001). The degree of condensation of phosphate is observed in the latter region and is also confirmed by X-ray studies.
To provide more information on the mechanism of the formation of KFeP2O7 crystals, we have carried out  differential thermal study on the compounds. The DTA curve was recorded for KFeP2O7 using DTA/ETA instrument (Model 021 NAL India) from room temperature to 500°C. The results yielded multiple phase transitions at 180, 428 and 480°C (figure 7). The preliminary impedance spectroscopy results are encouraging. Ionic conductivity values of this compound are of the order of 10–6  to 10–4 W cm–1  at 573 K. Detailed impedance spectroscopy studies are under way.
KFeP2O7 crystals synthesized by hydrothermal method in  the form of single crystals have well developed morpho- logy. Single crystal structural study of this monoclinic compound reveals that it has an open-framework tunnel type cavity structure.
