Phase formation processes were studied and features of the crystallization of complex phosphateswith a langbeinite structure from potassium phosphate melts were established.
The compounds obtainedwere characterized by X-ray phase analysis, IR spectroscopy, diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and ESRspectroscopy.
(1) As a result of comprehensive studies of phaseformation of complex phosphates with the langbeinitestructure in potassium phosphate melts, the crystallizationareas (K/P, MIII/Ti, MII/Ti, and MII/MVratios) and conditions were determined for the followingcomplex phosphates: K2Ti1.5MII0.5(PO4)3 (MII =Mn, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn), K1+yTi2  xMxIII(PO4)3 (0 < x 1, 0  y  1, y   x; MIII = Al, Sc, Cr, Fe, In, Y), andK2MV0.5MIII1.5(PO4)3 (MV = Nb, Ta; MIII = Fe, Cr,In, Y).
(2) The complex phosphates obtained were shownby X-ray phase analysis and powder X-ray diffractionto be isostructural; the parameters of their unit cellswere calculated.
(3) The compounds synthesized were characterizedby IR spectroscopy, diffuse reflection spectroscopy,and ESR spectroscopy.
