Vitreous phases of K3M2P3O12 (M =B, Al, Bi) NASICON-type materials are prepared and their electrical properties are investigated overa frequency range from 42 Hz to 1MHz and at different temperatures.
An anomalous diffusion model (ADM) is applied to discuss the acconductivity, permittivity and electric modulus of the NASICON-type glasses.
The ADM is used to extract the dc conductivity and relevantphysical parameters, namely, crossover length and relaxation frequency in the ion diffusion process.
The dc conductivities and relaxationfrequencies are thermally activated, with activation energies found to be in the range 0.70–0.82 eV.
The frequency- and temperature-dependentconductivity spectra of individual glasses can be superimposed by means of the Summerfield scaling.
The new K3M2P3O12 (M =B, Al, Bi) NASICON-typematerials were successfully vitrified and the glassy natureis further characterized by XRD, DSC and FTIR techniques.
The electrical properties of the glasses were studied over widerange of temperature and ac frequency.
The anomalous diffusionmodel is used to study the power law dependence ofconductivity and permittivity and to evaluate various importantparameters of NASICON-type glasses.
In general, thecross over lengths, ξ and activation energies show M sitecation size dependency in all systems under the present investigation.
The electrical modulus spectra are analyzed by both KWW and ADM models, enabling further discussion of themodel validity, particularly at the high frequency wing of themodulus spectra.
A scaling approach between the ac conductivityand the temperature further appreciates the meritof our systems, and also shows generalized features of otherreported glasses.
