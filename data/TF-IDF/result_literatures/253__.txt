A sodium-ion battery operating at room temperature is of great interest  for large-scale stationary energy storage because of its intrinsic cost  advantage. However, the development of a high capacity cathode with  high energy density remains a great challenge. In this work, sodium super  ionic conductor-structured Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3 is achieved through the  sol–gel method; Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 is demonstrated to have a capacity of  150 mAh g−1 with reversible three-electron redox reactions after insertion of a  Na+, consistent with the redox couples of V2+/3+, V3+/4+, and V4+/5+. Moreover,  a symmetric sodium-ion full cell utilizing Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 as both the  cathode and anode exhibits an excellent rate capability and cyclability with  a capacity of 70 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1. Ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis and in  situ impedance measurements are performed to reveal the sodium storage  mechanism and the structural evolution during cycling.

Among  the  well-known  cathode  materials  for  sodium-ion  batteries, transition-metal phosphates with the sodium super ionic  conductor  (NASICON)  structure  are  particularly  appealing  because  their  framework  structure  can  enable  an  acceptably  high-voltage  capacity  at  high  current  densities  over  a  safe  cycle  life.[1–7]  Its  robust  crystal  framework  provides  a  reversible  3D  Na+  diffusion  pathway  with  limited  lattice  volume  variation (below 10%), which is a critical factor for good cycling  performance.[8,9]  Moreover,  the  strong  inductive  effect  of  the  phosphates  allows  full  utilization  of  high-voltage  transitionmetal  redox  reactions  and  can,  therefore,  allow  access  to  a  higher  working  potential  versus  Na/Na+  than  that  of  other  sodium-based  oxides  with  similar  redox  couples.  The  issue  of oxygen  evolution  from  an  oxide  cathode  can also be effectively avoided. As a result,  safe  and  excellent  cycling  capability  has  been demonstrated.

Na3V2(PO4)3  is  a  typical  NASICONstructured cathode material; it has a theoretical  specific  capacity  of  117  mAh  g−1  with  a  potential  plateau  around  3.5  V  versus  Na/Na+.  To  date,  several  phosphates  have  been  successfully  synthesized  based  on  cation  substitution  to  increase  energy  and  power  densities,  including Na3MnV(PO4)3, Na3MnTi(PO4)3,  Na3MnZr(PO4)3,  and  Na2VTi(PO4)3.[10–18]  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  electrons  participating in the electrochemical reactions  for  most  of  these  reported  NASICONto  structured  electrodes  ≤2  per  formula  unit.  Thus  the  development  of  an  NASICONstructured cathode with more than two electron redox reactions  and excellent cycling stability is of great interest. In this work,  the Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3 electrodes were successfully synthesized.  Among  them,  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  demonstrates  a  reversible  capacity of ≈150 mAh g−1, resulting from a three-electron redox  reaction from V2+ to V3+, V4+, and V5+. Ex situ X-ray diffraction  analysis  indicates  that  both  two-phase  reaction  and  solid-solution  processes  are  involved  in  the  sodium  storage  reaction.  By  making  full  use  of  the  potential  differences  between  V2+/V3+ (1.6 V) and V3+/V4+ (3.6 V), V4+/V5+ (4.1 V vs Na/Na+),   a  symmetric  sodium-ion  battery  with  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  as  both  anode  and  cathode  exhibited  excellent  cycling  and  rate  performance.

A  sol–gel  method  was  employed  to  prepare  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3  (x  =  0,  0.2,  0.5,  1,  and  2).  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3  are  shown  in  Figure  1a.  At  room  temperature,  the  diffraction  peaks  of  all  these  samples  can  be  indexed  to  a  rhombohedral  NASICON  structure  in  space  group  R3̅c.  With  the  absence  of  apparent  additional  diffraction  peaks,  long-range  ordering  between  the  transition  metals  V  and  Cr  has  been  realized  in  an  NASICON  framework.  The  similar  ionic  radius  between  Cr3+  (0.755  Å)  and  V3+  (0.78  Å)  is  favorable  for  the  formation  of  solid  solutions  in  the  whole  composition  range  between  Na3V2(PO4)3  and  Na3Cr2(PO4)3.  The  variations  of  the  lattice  constants  a  and  c,  and  a/c  with  

A previous report indicates that the reversible Cr3+/Cr4+ redox  reaction in Na3Cr2(PO4)3 is located at 4.5 V (vs Na/Na+),[20] and  consequently  the  Cr3+/Cr4+  redox  couple  in  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3  would  be  inactive  in  the  electrochemical  voltage  window  of  2.5–4.4  V.  Cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  was  utilized  to  investigate  sodium  storage  behavior  of  the  initial  four  kinds  of  sample;  the  corresponding  results  are  shown  in  Figure  S6  in  the  Supporting  Information.  A  reversible  V3+/4+  transition  located at  ≈3.55/3.25  V  was  observed  in  a  Na3V2(PO4)3  electrode.  In  the  other  three  analogues,  two  distinct  couples  of  redox  reaction  peaks  at  ≈3.65/3.25  and  ≈4.1/3.9  V  were  observed,  corresponding  to  the  reversible  transition  of  V3+/4+  and  V4+/5+,  respectively. The substitution of V3+ by Cr3+ in Na3V2(PO4)3 activates the redox reaction of V4+/V5+ to boost the energy density,  in accord with previous studies.[19,21–23]

Galvanostatic  cycling  was  applied  to  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3;  the  1st discharge/charge curves are shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information. In general, the extraction of 1–2 Na+ from  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3 first occurs at ≈3.6 V through the oxidation of  vanadium from V3+ to V4+. On additional Na+ extraction toward  the phase of NaV2−xCrx(PO4)3, the oxidation of vanadium from  V4+  to  V5+  occurs  due  to  partial  substitution  by  Cr.  With  specific regard to the Na3VCr(PO4)3 electrode, its S-shaped profile  during  the  first  cycle  is  evidently  different  from  the  dominant  potential  plateau  for  the  other  three  kinds  of  electrode.  The  observed  S-shaped  curve  of  Na3VCr(PO4)3  electrode  is  consistent  with  previous  reports  showing  irreversibility  of  the  phase  change  during  initial  cycles  and  fast  capacity  fade  at  room  temperature.[19]  Therefore,  an  optimized  Cr  doping  can  achieve  a  high-energy-density  cathode  with  stable  cycling  performance.

To  evaluate  the  influence  of  Cr  substitution  on  the  electrochemical  performance  of  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3,  electrodes  were  investigated within the potential region of 2.5–4.4 V (Figure S8,  Supporting  Information).  Notably,  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  exhibited  the  most  stable  cycling  performance  with  a  specific  discharge capacity of 107 mAh g−1. Even at a current density of  1 A h g−1, this composition still maintained a specific discharge  capacity of 64 mAh g−1. This superior cycling stability and rate 

To explore the redox activities of the Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 electrode,  electrochemical  performance  was  evaluated  by  CV  and  galvanostatic  charge/discharge  within  the  voltage  range  of  1–4.4  V;  the  corresponding  results  are  presented  in  Figure  2.  After  insertion  of  a  Na+  into  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3,  a  three-electron redox reaction is achieved to boost its capacities and in a  practical  full-cell.  The  presodiation  treatment  is  necessary  for  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  to  deliver  its  full  sodium  storage  capacity 

The kinetic behavior of sodium storage in Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  was  studied  via  CV  analysis  with  different  scan  rates  (Figure  2e).  Metal-ion  electrochemical  storage  can  be  divided  into  two  processes,  a  diffusion  reaction  and  a  pseudocapacitance  process.[24,25]  The  diffusion  reaction  process  usually  plays  the  dominant  role  in  sodium-ion  storage;  the  pseudocapacitance  behavior  is  beneficial  for  rate  capability  and  extended cycling life. The slopes depicted in Figure 2f indicate  that these two kinds of energy storage behavior coexist within  a  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  electrode;  the  detailed  information  is  described in Supporting Information.

To  reveal  the  structural  evolution  of  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  electrode during cycling, an ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis  was  carried  out  at  different  charge/discharge  states  during  the  first  cycle  (Figure  3a).  Before  charging,  all  peaks  of  the  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  electrode  were  indexed  with  a  rhombohedral NASICON structure (Figure 3b) with an evident diffraction 

In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out to gain more insight into the kinetic  properties  of  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  during  cycling  (Figure  3c  and  Figure  S11,  Supporting  Information).  A  typical  fitting  equivalent  electrical  circuit  for  EIS  is  shown  in  Figure  S12  in  the  Supporting  Information,  consisting  of  the  electrolyte  resistance  (Re),  electrolyte/electrode  interfacial  resistance  (Rsf),  and  charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Re remained almost unchanged  during  cycling  and  the  fitted  resistances  of  Rsf  and  Rct  for  the  first  cycle  are  summarized  in  Figure  3d.  As  depicted,  Rsf  and  Rct  exhibited  different  variation  trends.  During  the  charge  process, Rsf monotonously increased because of the formation  of  an  interfacial  layer  between  the  electrolyte  and  the  highly  oxidized cathode.[27,28] In the following discharge process, elimination of the electrolyte/cathode interphase made Rsf become  smaller. Rct was prominently reduced upon charging, especially  at the high cutoff voltage of 4.4 V, which is ascribed to a high  cathode  Na-ion  diffusion  after  initial  extraction  of  sodium.  Consequently,  NaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  manifested  the  lowest  charge  transfer  resistance  of  134  Ω.  After  being  discharged  to  1  V,  a  largest  Rct  of  1562  Ω  was  found  owing  to  full  occupation  of  Na  sites  in  Na4V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3.  Both  Rsf  and  Rct  show  similar  trends  and  values  in  the  following  cycles  in  the  Nyquist  plots  (Figure S11, Supporting Information).

The  V3+/V4+  and  V4+/V5+  redox  couples  at  3.6  and  4.1  V  and  the  V2+/V3+  redox  couple  at  1.6  V  indicate  that  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  can  serve  as  both  a  cathode  and  an  anode  material. Figure 4a shows the respective capacity and potential  matchup  of  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  half  cells.  As  is  shown,  the  reversible extraction of two Na+ from Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 results  in a specific capacity of 104 mAh g−1 and the reversible insertion  of  one  Na+  into  a  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  anode  leads  to  the  phase  of  Na4V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  at  1.6  V  for  a  specific  capacity  of  about  60  mAh  g−1  for  the  first  cycle.  After  100  cycles,  the  capacity  retention  of  the  anode  was  93%  (Figure  S13,  Supporting Information).

By  taking  advantage  of  the  potential  difference  between  the  V3+/V4+,  V4+/V5+,  and  V2+/V3+  redox  couples,  a  symmetric  sodium-ion  battery  was  constructed.  The  capacity–voltage  curves  are  illustrated  in  Figure  4b.  The  low  voltage  plateau  is related  to  the  potential  difference  between  V3+/4+  and  V2+/3+,  while  the  higher  plateau  is  mainly  ascribed  to  the  potential  difference  between  V4+/5+  and  V2+/3+.  The  average  operation  potential of this symmetric cell is above 2 V, which is relatively  high compared to previously reported symmetric systems using  an NASCION-structured electrode (Table S4, Supporting Information). Although the working potential window of this work is  a  bit  smaller  than  some  oxide  electrodes,  the  capacity  stability  and  rate  capability  endow  its  own  advantages.  Figure  4c  demonstrates  the  cycling  capability  of  a  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3-based  symmetric  cell  at  30  mA  g−1;  the  specific  capacity  remained  nearly  100  mAh  g−1  after  200  cycles.  Even  under  the  current  density of 1 A g−1, the symmetric cell still delivered a capacity  of 75 mAh g−1 (Figure 4d), indicating stable and reversible reactions  of  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3.  The  cycling  stability  and  excellent  rate performance with this NASICON structure can be ascribed  to its rigid framework for fast ion diffusion as well as the symmetric  feature  of  a  full  cell  in  which  the  cell-volume  variation  during cycling is small.

In  summary,  by  optimizing  the  atom  ratio  of  V3+  and  Cr3+,  a  solid  state  solution  of  Na3V2−xCrx(PO4)3  (0  ≤  x  ≤  2)  was  constructed.  The  introduction  of  Cr3+  into  the  NASICON-structured  Na3V2(PO4)3  provides  an  effective  approach  to  access  the  active  redox  reaction  of  V4+/V5+,  resulting  in  an  enhancement of energy density. Making full use of the stepwise redox  reaction from V5+ to V4+, V3+, and V2+, a fully reversible threeelectron redox reaction endowed Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 with a specific  capacity  of  150  mAh  g−1  at  30  mA  g−1;  the  highly  stable  NASICON  structure  manifested  excellent  cycling  stability  (96% capacity retention after 400 cycles). Ex situ XRD and EIS  characterization  revealed  the  structural  variation  and  sodium  storage behavior during the initial cycle. A symmetric sodiumion  battery  utilizing  Na3V1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3  as  both  cathode  and  anode  provided  a  long  cycle  life  and  good  rate  capability.  Our  research  highlights  the  importance  of  NASICON-structured  cathode with high energy and power density for a sodium-ion  battery.
