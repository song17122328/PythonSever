The  widespread  interest  in  NASICON-type  comB PO  (A is a monovalent cation; B is a pounds A ( ) 3 4 2 x tri or  tetravalent  cation)  stems  from  the  high  cation mobility and thermal stability of these materials [1, 2]. The  conductivity  of  similar  substances  can  be enhanced, for example, by substitution of EO  anions 4 (E = Si ) for a fraction of phosphate ions [3, 4]. The substitution of trivalent ions for a fraction of tetravalent  cations  in  the  B  positions  with  a  concurrent increase  in  the  alkali-metal  content  has  the  greatest effect (see, e.g., [5–8]). This approach seems to be rea  structure  contains PO sonable,  because  the  AB ( ) 3 4 2 many vacancies, which can be occupied to eventually give the A  composition. A possibility for the (EO ) 4 3 4 substitution  of  pentavalent  ions  for  tetravalent  ones with  the  simultaneous  formation  of  additional  vacancies in the A positions has been considerably less studied.  Data  on  the  conductivity  of  similar  compounds available from early works [9, 10] were discrepant. PO Herein, the formation of defects in the LiZr ( ) 3 4 2 structure and the products of its aliovalent doping were quantitatively  characterized  for  the  ﬁrst  time.  It  was shown that the mobility of lithium cations occurring by the vacancy mechanism was higher than that proceeding by the interstitialcy mechanism.

Double lithium zirconium phosphates and the prodSc PO   and ucts  of  their  substitution  (Li ( ) 2 —  3 4 x x Li ) were syntheNb PO  ( ( )  = 0.02, 0.1, 0.2) x 3 4   1  x x sized by annealing, at 1470 K, a stoichiometric mixture of lithium orthophosphate, zirconium hydrogen phosphate, and zirconia, scandia, or niobia. Low extents of substitution  for  zirconium  were  chosen,  because  the  is nondependence of conductivity on the parameter  x

linear for large extents of substitution and has a noticeable maximum [10].

Fragments of X-ray diffraction patterns of the compounds under study are shown in Fig. 1. X-ray powder diffraction  shows  that  crystals  of  LiZr   are  triPO ( ) 3 4 2 clinic  and  give  rise  to  a  set  of  reﬂections  that  agrees well with the data in [11] (  =  = 15.33  c a ).  However, 9.11  some  weak  reﬂections  of  a  hexagonal  phase  are ).  The observed  even  for  this  sample  (Fig.  1,  curve  content of this phase in the compound is relatively low, about 10%. The addition of aliovalent dopants leads to a gradual disappearance of the triclinic phase (Table 1). The content of this phase is considerably lower in niobium-doped samples (Fig. 1, curves  ). Indeed, even b Li  gives rise only to reflections of the PO ( ) 3 4 0.1 hexagonal modiﬁcation (Fig. 1, curve  ). In the samples d with a high scandium content, an impurity phase based  is formed; some of them contain traces Sc PO on Li ( ) 3 4 2 3 of zirconium pyrophosphate.

As is known, the mobility of cations in solids occurs through  crystal  defects  (vacancies  and  interstitials) [13]. Upon the substitution of scandium ions for a fraction  of  zirconium  with  simultaneous  incorporation  of an excess of lithium ions, the scandium ions take zirconium positions ( ) and the corresponding number of

lithium ions takes interstitials ( ). Analogously, the substitution of niobium for zirconium leads to the formation of cationic vacancies ( ). In both cases, the concentration of interstitial defects should be similar to the extent of substitution for zirconium.

jump  frequency    and  the  probability  of  a  cation vacancy being in the nearest environment of some cation (equal to the relative vacancy concentration):

The frequency of ion jumps by the interstitialcy mechanism can be written as

where   is the jump frequency of interstitial lithium ions.  The  intrinsic  disorder  in  LiZr2(PO4)3  can  occur only by the Frenkel mechanism. The latter can be characterized by the defect formation constant

The  correlation  LiZr2(PO4)3  is  considerably  smaller  than  that  in  the compounds with a degree of zirconium substitution of 2% or 10%. For these compounds, the plot of n c versus doping level remains roughly linear. To fulﬁll the condition of electrical neutrality, the vacancy concentration in LiZr2(PO4)3 should be equal to the concentration of interstitial  sites.  Assuming  the  cation  mobility  to  be independent on the doping level, we can calculate the concentration of intrinsic defects. For LiZr2(PO4)3, this concentration  is  equal  to  0.0013.  Hence,  the  Frenkel constant for this compound is 1.6 ·  10—6. Accordingly, the  frequencies  of  interstitial  and  vacancy  jumps  are  109 s—1, respectively. The correlation frequencies of lithium ions calculated from these data are in good agreement with experimental  except Li1.2Zr1.8Sc0.2(PO4)3. According to the X-ray diffraction evidence, this is caused by separation of this compound into  phases  with  different  scandium  contents.  This leads  to  a  deviation  from  the  initial  stoichiometry. Therefore, the mobility of vacancies is more than twice
