Phase formation in the A1 + xAlxTi2 – xP3O12 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.0) and B0.5(l + x) AlxTi2 – xP3O12 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.0) systems was studied using X-ray powder diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, and IR spectroscopy. The following double and triple orthophosphates were found to exist: A1 + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 with A = Li (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3), Na (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), K (x = 0, 1.0, or 2.0), Rb (x = 0, 1.0, or 2.0), or Cs (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) and B0.5(l + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 with B = Mg and Ba (x = 0), Ca and Sr (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2). These orthophosphates crystallize in the structure types of kosnarite, langbeinite, cesium titanium arsenate, potassium aluminum phosphate, or rubidium aluminum phosphate. Their crystal parameters were calculated. For CsTi2(PO4)3 (x = 0), Rietveld refinement was carried out: space group Ia d, Z = 32, a = 19.909(5) Å, V = 7892(1) Å3. This compound has a framework structure. The framework is built of TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra; eight- and 12-coordinated Cs+ cations populate interstices.

Phosphates with octahedral–tetrahedral frameworks {[ L 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 ] p – } 3 ∞ , where L stands for an octahedral framework position (which can be occupied by cations with oxidation states of +5 to +1) and p is framework charge, constitute a large class of compounds [1–3]. Many such phosphates are isostructural to minerals that withstand environmental impacts, namely, kosnarite KZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 (space group R c , Z = 6, a = 8.687(2), c = 23.877(7) Å , V = 1560.5 Å 3 ) [4] and langbeinite K 2 Mg 2 ( SO 4 ) 3 (space group P 2 1 3, Z = 4, a = 9.920(4) Å , V = 976.2 Å 3 ) [5]. Common names for materials isostructural to kosnarite are NZP (NaZr 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 [6] is a synthetic analogue, which was known before the discovery of kosnarite) and NASICON (Na 1 + x Zr 2 Si x P 3 – x O 12 [7], an ionic conductor). The frameworks of NZP- and langbeinite-type structures have a common structural feature, namely, lantern-shaped fragments formed by two LO 6 octahedra and three PO 4 tetrahedra linked to form the ring [1–3]. In NZP compounds, these groups form columns running parallel to one another along axis Ò . In langbeinite compounds, lantern columns run in the four nonintersecting directions parallel to the diagonals of the cube. The structurally studied double phosphates are AM 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 with A = Li, Na, K, and Rb for M = Ti and A = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs for M = Zr and Hf [8] and B 0.5 M 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 with B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba for M = Ti, Zr, and Hf [9–13]. Most of the aforementioned com3 pounds have NZP-type structures. Lithium phosphates can also crystallize in other structures [14–16]. For äí i 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 , a langbeinite phase is known apart from NZP [17]. Attempts have been made to synthesize cesium phosphate CsTi 2 ( PO 4 ) 3 [8, 18], but data on its existence and structure type are controversial, and its structure has not been studied. Solid solutions based on alkali-metal, aluminum, and Group IV 3 d -metal phosphates have been studied on account of their ion conductivity. A limited number of such systems within narrow ranges of compositions have been studied. These solid solutions are Li 1 + x Al x Ti 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4) [19], Li 1 + x Al x Ge y Ti 2 – x – y ( PO 4 ) 3 (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.8; y = 0.8, 1.0) [20], Na 1 + x Al x Ti 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.9) [21, 22], Na 1 + x Al x Zr 2 – x ( PO 4 ) 3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.25) [23], and Na 1.4 Al 0.4 M 1.6 ( PO 4 ) 3 for M = Ge, Sn, Ti, Zr, and Hf [24]. The maximal conductivity ( 10 –3 S –1 cm –1 at 300 K) was measured for ı ≈ 0.3 in the Li1 + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 system, where aluminum and titanium are structure-forming cations. Triple phosphates containing metal(+2), aluminum, and titanium have not been studied. This work studies the possibility of titanium, aluminum, and alkali (alkaline-earth) metals to simultaneously enter Ä1 + xAlxTi2 – xP3O12 (A = Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs) and Ç0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – xP3é12 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) phosphates. This work also studies the structure of a newly synthesized compound: CsTi2(PO4)3.

We were intended to synthesize Ä1 + xAlxTi2 – xP3O12(A = Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs) and B0.5(l + x)AlxTi2 – xP3O12(B = Mg, Ca, Sr, or Ba) phosphates with 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.0. For the sol–gel synthesis of Ä1 + xAlxTi2 – xP3O12 and Mg0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – xP3é12, we used chemically pure reagents—Li2CO3, ACl (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs), MgCO3, AlCl3, and NH4H2PO4—and aqueous solutions of H3PO4 and TiOCl2; the last was prepared by oxidizing TiCl3 by nitric + hydrochloric acids. First, weighed samples of alkali-metal chlorides and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate were dissolved in distilled water, and metal carbonates were dissolved in a required HCl amount. Then, stoichiometric amounts of aqueous solutions of alkali-metal (or magnesium) salts and titanium oxychloride were combined with continuous stirring at room temperature; aqueous phosphoric acid or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, also taken according to the stoichiometry, was added with stirring. The resulting gel was dried at 80°ë, heated in contact with air, and exposed consecutively at 600–900°ë in 100°ë steps for at least 24 h at each step until the reaction between newly formed intermediates (metal pyrophosphates and phosphates) was over. Stepped heating was alternated with dispersion. For the solid-phase synthesis of Ç0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – xP3é12 (B = Ca, Sr, or Ba) phosphates, the following chemically pure reagents were used as precursors: CaCO3, SrCO3, BaCl2, TiO2, Al2O3, and NH4H2PO4. The solid-phase synthesis included several stages. A mechanical mixture of stoichiometric proportions of the reagents was ground with an agate mortar and pestle and exposed for 12 h at 200°ë to decompose ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and eliminate volatile gaseous products (NH3 and HCl). Next, to obtain the final product, the reaction mixture was annealed at 600– 1100°ë in 100°ë steps in contact with air and intermittent dispersion at each step. Chemical composition and homogeneity were monitored using a CamScan MV -2300 (VEGA TS 5130MM) scanning electron microscope equipped with Y AG detectors of secondary and scattered electrons and a Link INCA ENERGY 200C energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyzer with a Si(Li) semiconductor detector. The accelerating voltage was 20 kV; the X-ray generation region was ~3 µm. PAP correction was used to calculate compositions. Errors in compositions did not exceed 2.5 wt %. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer (CuKα1 + α2 radiation, reflection geometry). The powder patterns were used to determine the phase composition of samples during preparation after each stage of isothermal annealing. The recording rate was 1 deg/min. The 2θ angle was 10°–50°. Unit cell parameters were derived from indexed X-ray diffraction patterns and refined by the least-squares fits. In structure experiments, the X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded for a CsTi2(PO4)3 sample within 2θ range of 10°–90° with scan steps of 0.02°. The processing of the X-ray diffraction pattern and the refinement of the phosphate structure were carried out by the Rietveld method [25] using RIETAN-97 software [26]. Peak profiles were fitted by the pseudo-Voigt function (Mod-TCH pV) [27]. IR absorption spectra were recorded on an FTIR8400 spectrophotometer equipped with an A TR attachment for wavenumbers within 400–1400 cm–1 at room temperature. Test samples were applied to a KRS-5 cell as isopropyl mulls and dried.

Samples with A = Li, Na, or K started to crystallize at 600°ë; those with A = Rb or Cs at 800°ë. Single-phase products in these systems were formed at 700–900°ë. All phosphates were stable at least up to 1200°ë. The single-phase samples consisted of variously shaped grains (Fig. 1). Electron probe data showed that the samples were homogeneous and their as-analyzed compositions were close to the calculated compositions (Table 1). Ä1+ xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 phosphates with A = Li (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3), Na (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), K (ı = 0), and Rb (ı = 0) crystallize in NZP-type structure (Fig. 2). In the potassium and rubidium phosphate systems, unlike in the lithium and sodium ones, solid solutions have not been prepared. The compound K2AlTi(PO4)3 (ı = 1) crystallizes in a langbeinite-type structure. X-ray diffraction data for Rb2AlTi(PO4)3 and Cs1 + xAlxTi2 – x P3O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) showed their structural analogy with previously studied cesium titanium arsenate CsTi2(AsO4)3 [28]. Compounds K3Al2(PO4)3 and Rb3Al2(PO4)3 (ı = 2) were identical to their formula analogues [29] that have orthorhombic symmetry. Samples of the lithium (ı = 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0), sodium (ı = 1.5 and 2.0), potassium (ı = 0.5 and 1.5), rubidium (ı = 0.5 and 1.5), and cesium (ı = 1.5 and 2.0) systems were mixtures containing the aforementioned complex phosphate phases, titanium pyrophosphate, and aluminum and alkali-metal phosphates. In view of the considerable structural distinction between the newly synthesized phosphate CsTi2(PO4)3 (space group Ia d), on the one hand, and NZP (space group R c) and langbeinite (space group P213) structures, on the other, we carried out the Rietveld refinement of its structure. The initial model included the coordinates of atoms in the CsTi2(AsO4)3 structure (space group Ia d) [28]. The details of the X-ray diffraction experiment and selected refinement data are listed in Table 2. Figure 3 shows measured, calculated, line, and difference X-ray diffraction patterns for CsTi2(PO4)3. There is a good agreement between the measured and calculated patterns. The atomic coordinates and their isotropic thermal parameters are listed in Table 3. Selected bond lengths and bond angles are listed in Table 4. The CsTi2(PO4)3 unit cell is relatively large for inorganic compounds and contains 32 formula unit. The framework positions 48g and 16‡ in this phosphate are populated by titanium cations; the framework positions 96h are populated by phosphorus and oxygen atoms. In the refinement, we assumed that Cs+ cations can populate two types of interstitial positions: 16b and 48g. These positions in the precursor CsTi2(AsO4)3 being occupied only partially, the number of Cs+ cations in the positions of the CsTi2(PO4)3 structure were found from the refinement of their occupancies. In the refined model, positive isotropic thermal parameters Ç were obtained for all atoms. The Ti and P atoms in the phosphate structure reside in six- and fourcoordinated arrays of oxygen atoms, respectively. The bond lengths and bond angles in TiO6 and êé4 coordination polyhedra agree with respective values in other framework compounds [8, 10, 28]. Diversified distortions of the structural polyhedra are manifested as a small scatter of the bond lengths and deviations of the bond angles from their ideal values (90° and 180° for TiO6 octahedra and 109.5° for PO4 tetrahedra). In the Ti(1)O6 octahedra, for example, the Ti(1)–O distances are within 1.827–2.118 Å (avg.: 1.98 Å). The more symmetric Ti(2)O6 octahedra have six identical Ti(2)–O bond lengths (1.81 Å). A considerable differentiation of P–O distances (within 1.490–1.591 Å) characterizes a strong distortion of the phosphate tetrahedra in the refined model. The cesium cations in the Cs(1) and Cs(2) positions are surrounded by twelve and eight nearest-neighboring oxygen atoms. Average Cs–O distances for these positions agree with the values reported by KwangHwa Lii [28] and are 3.43 and 3.22 Å, respectively. In cesium titanium orthophosphate, unlike in the parent CsTi2(AsO4)3 structure, extraframework positions are not equally populated by cesium cations: the occupancy of one interstice is 0.725(2), and that of the other is 0.275(2). The framework of the CsTi2(PO4)3 structure is built of TiO6 octahedra and êé4 tetrahedra; however, similar building blocks are stacked differently in NZP and langbeinite phosphates. The CsTi2(PO4)3 framework can be represented as closely packed columns linked to one another (Fig. 4). The core of each column consists of alternating Ti(2)O6 octahedra and 12-coordinate Cs(1) cations lying on the triple axis of the unit cell of space group Ia d. This core is surrounded by consecutive rings of êé4 tetrahedra, Ti(1)O6 octahedra, and êé4tetrahedra. Octahedral framework positions between these columns are occupied by Ti(1) and Ti(2) cations. Each octahedron in the CsTi2(PO4)3 structure is linked to six tetrahedra; each tetrahedron is linked to four octahedra. Each interstice in the CsTi2(PO4)3 structure is surrounded by eight TiO6 octahedra and eight êé4 tetrahedra. The interstices form a three-dimensional system of channels that penetrate the framework. The Cs(1) positions are the cross-points of channels; the Cs(2) positions are in interstices. The Cs(1) cation position is a six-capped trigonal prism. Eight-coordinate Cs+ cations 3 are disordered between two closely lying and randomly populated Cs(2) positions. Crystals of phosphates of alkali metals, aluminum, and titanium-family elements were studied by IR spectroscopy (Fig. 5). For LiTi2(PO4)3 (x = 0), Li1.2Al0.2Ti1.8(PO4)3 (x = 0.2), NaTi2(PO4)3 (x = 0), Na1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 (x = 0.5), Na2AlTi(PO4)3 (x = 1), KTi2(PO4)3 (x = 0), and RbTi2(PO4)3 (x = 0) samples, IR spectra are similar in band positions and shapes and are typical of NZP orthophosphates (space group R c). The bands within 1234–1000 cm–1 were assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibrations ν3 in phosphate tetrahedra. The bands within 990–970 cm–1 were assigned to symmetrical stretching vibrations ν1. Asymmetrical bending vibrations ν4 appear as two or three bands (of the five possible) within 650–540 cm–1. The absorption band near 440 cm–1 corresponds to symmetrical bending vibrations ν2. The IR spectrum of K2AlTi(PO4)3 (Fig. 5b, spectrum 2) is typical of langbeinite phosphates with space group ê213 [30]. Selection rules allow the appearance of one ν1 band, two ν2 bands, three ν3 bands, and three ν4 bands in these compounds. The bands within 1150–950 cm–1 in this phosphate were assigned to stretching vibrations. In the ν4 region (660–540 cm–1), all three allowed bands appear; the band at 470 cm–1 is due to the ν2 mode. The structures of K3Al2(PO4)3 and Rb3Al2(PO4)3(ı = 2) are joint frameworks built of corner-sharing êé4- and AlO4 tetrahedra. Some êé4 tetrahedra have terminal P–O bonds outside the framework. The potassium phase has a primitive orthorhombic cell; the rubidium phase has a base-centered cell C. Most bands in the IR spectra of these compounds are due to the P−O–Al vibrations in the tetrahedral framework (Figs. 5b, 5c; spectra 3). Inasmuch as the number of bridging oxygen atoms involved in P–O–Al bonds in the base-centered unit cell is one-half that in the primi3 tive cell, fewer bands appear in the IR spectrum of Rb3Al2(PO4)3 compared to K3Al2(PO4)3. The bands within 1210–980 cm–1 are associated with the P–O–Al asymmetrical stretching vibrations in the tetrahedral framework. The band with the peak at 917 cm–1 in the potassium phase is likely associated with the symmetrical stretching vibrations of extraframework terminal P–O bonds. The relevant asymmetrical vibrations overlap the framework vibrations. The bands within 750– 600 cm–1 are due to the symmetrical stretching vibrations of P–O–Al; the bands below 600 cm–1 are due to the bending vibrations of P–O–Al. The IR spectra of Rb2AlTi(PO4)3 and Cs(l + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 (x = 0.5 and 1) are similar to the spectra of ring silicates (Figs. 5c, 5d). The ësTi2(AsO4) structure, which is a prototype of these compounds, contains eight-membered rings formed of AsO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra together. By analogy with the spectra of ring silicates, the doublet of strong bands at 1110 and 1010 cm–1 can be assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibrations of P–O–Ti and O–P–O. The band at 730 cm–1 corresponds to the symmetrical stretching vibrations of P–O–Ti. The bands at 640 and 460 cm–1 are associated with the relevant bending vibrations. Spectrum 1 in Fig. 5d displays the IR spectrum for orthophosphate CsTi2(PO4)3, for which Rietveld analysis was carried out. Selection rules for a cubic compound allow the appearance of three bands associated with the asymmetrical stretching vibrations of P–O at 1202, 1070, and 1007 cm–1, one band of the symmetrical stretching vibrations at 962 cm–1, and three bands of the relevant asymmetrical bending vibrations. Of the last three allowed bands, only two appear in the spectrum, namely, at 642 and 567 cm–1.

Phosphates with B = Mg or Ca started to crystallize at 600°ë; those with B = Sr or Ba at 700–800°ë. For samples annealed at 600–800°ë, X-ray diffraction patterns contained reflections from NZP phases, AlPO4 (two phases with tridymite and cristobalite structures), TiP2O7, and alkaline-earth phosphates (Fig. 6). In samples annealed at 900–1100°ë, strong reflections from NZP phases were observed. Some samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2 annealed at these temperatures contained minor titanium pyrophosphate, which reacted to yield singlephase products as temperature increased further. After these single-phase products were annealed at 1200°ë, double and triple phosphates either retained their composition and structure or partially decomposed. The first members of the aforementioned (ı = 0) B0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (B = Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) series (x = 0) were single-phase NZP samples as shown by electron probe and X-ray diffraction data. Our X-ray diffraction data agree with the X-ray diffraction patterns described in the literature in terms of space group R c for Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [9] and Ba0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [10] and R for Ca0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [10] and Sr0.5Ti2(PO4)3 [11]. In the B0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 systems with B = Ca and Sr and compositions ranging from ı = 0 to ı = 0.2, NZP phases were formed. We failed to synthesize triple phosphates with magnesium or barium. A single-phase Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 sample was prepared at 900°ë; it was stable up to 950°ë. Difficulties in Mg0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – x (PO4)3 synthesis can arise from the rather high temperatures required for the reactions of intermediate components to produce the complex phosphate; these temperatures should exceed the thermal stability limit of the complex phosphate. Ba0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 triple phosphates, unlike their calcium and strontium analogues, have not been prepared, possibly because of the geometric hindrance to the accommodation of large extraframework cations (compared to interstices of the {[AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3]p–}3∞ framework) in NZP-type structures. In general, the phase formation pattern was rather complex (Table 5). IR spectroscopic data for B0.5(1 + x)AlxTi2 – x (PO4)3 phosphates verified their orthophosphate nature. For the 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2 samples, IR spectra are typical of rhombohedral NZP orthophosphates. The P–O stretching vibra tions in êé4 tetrahedra appear within 1290–930 cm–1; the relevant bending vibrations are within 670–400 cm–1. As a whole, IR spectroscopic and X-ray powder diffraction data are consistent and indicate the existence of double and triple phosphates in the systems under consideration: Ä1 + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 with A = Li (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3), Na (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0), K (ı = 0, 1.0, and 2.0), Rb (ı = 0, 1.0, and 2.0), and Cs (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) and Ç0.5(l + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3with B = Mg and Ba (x = 0), Ca, and Sr (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2); these phosphates crystallize in kosnarite, langbeinite, cesium titanium arsenate, potassium aluminum phosphate, and rubidium aluminum phosphate structure types.

We observed the following trend in the series of ATi2(PO4)3 and Ç0.5Ti2(PO4)3 NZP double phosphates: the parameter Ò systematically increases and parameter ‡ decreases with increasing alkali cation radius [2, 3, 8]. This trend is related to the distortions of frameworkforming columns built of TiO6 octahedra and êé4 tetrahedra caused by a correlated rotation of these polyhedra in order for larger cations to enter voids inside columns that run along axis c. Doping with aluminum or increasing alkali-metal concentration changes the trends of the unit cell parameters. The parameter a increases in the Al + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 series when the type of cation Ä+ remains unchanged. This is because of the fact that voids inside columns running parallel to axis c cannot accommodate more than one cation per formula unit, and alkali cations in triple phosphates enter voids between polyhedral columns. The decrease in parameter c in these phosphates is due to the substitution of a smaller cation (aluminum) for titanium in the framework. Inasmuch as solid solutions in these systems exist within limited ranges of compositions, the unit cell parameters of phosphates vary insignificantly. The trends of the unit cell parameters for Ç0.5(l + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 phosphates in the region where rhombohedral symmetry is realized are dictated by the systematic occupation of cations B2+ with different radii (Ca2+ or Sr2+) of voids inside columns running parallel to axis c. For Csl + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 phosphates, which are structural analogues of CsTi2(AsO4)3, Cs+ cations (cesium is the largest alkali metal) have the dominant effect in the solid solution region (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0); as a result, the cubic unit cell parameters increase. The small extent (ı) of the accommodation of Al3+ cations in the framework of the NZP structure of Al + xAlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 and Ç0.5(l + x)AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3 can be explained by a considerable difference between the ion radii of Al3+ (rCN 6 = 0.53 Å) and Ti4+ (rCN 6 = 0.61 Å) and the associated incomplete isomorphic miscibility. The accommodation of Al3+ cations (rCN 4 = 0.39 Å) into the structure on account of substitution for ê5+ ions (rCN 4 = 0.17 Å) in their tetrahedral positions is also unobserved because of the considerable difference of relevant radii and charges, whereas complete miscibility of Al3+ with its horizontal (Si4+) and diagonal (Be2+) analogues in the Periodic system is widespread in natural minerals [31]. The greatest extents of isomorphic miscibility (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) are observed for sodium phosphates Nal + x AlxTi2 – x(PO4)3. A likely reason for this is that the radius and charge of sodium ions are optimal for their accommodation in NZP interstices and enhance the structure stability upon cationic substitutions, as, for example, in Na5M(PO4)3 (M = Ti, Zr, or Hf) [32]. The existence of two framework positions in langbeinite- and cesium titanium arsenate-type compounds makes it possible to distinguish Al3+ and Ti4+ cations on account of their preference to occupy one position; this also makes possible the formation of triple phosphates. In the CsTi2(PO4)3 structure, the Ti4+ Cs+ + Al3+ substitution is also enhanced by the noticeable distortion of Ti(1)O6 structure-forming octahedra and the decreased bond lengths in Ti(2)O6 octahedra, both factors arising from the bulging-out effect of large cesium cations.
