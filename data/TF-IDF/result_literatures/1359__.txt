The NASICON-type crystal structure (AxM2(XO4)3; A = alkali and alkaline-earth metal, M = transition metal, X = metalloid) as shown in Fig. 1 exhibits A-ion nonstoichiometry and conductivity. The structure has a three-dimensional network frame comprising of MO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra, with A-ions located in the large interstitial sites. NASICON-type materials have been given a great deal of attention in recent years due to their potential as multivalent ionic conductors. Nomura et al. investigated the phase transition and electrical conductivity of zirconium phosphates, AIIZr4(PO4)6 (A = Mg, Ca, Ba, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb).1,2) Imanaka et al. studied Al, rare earth (Sc, Eu, Gd, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu) and tetravalent (Ti, Hf and Ge) cation conduction in phosphates and tungstates.3­5) In our previous study, the crystal structure and ionic conductivity of trivalent (Fe3+, Mn3+, Co3+)(Nb5+)-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were studied.6,7) Based on the ﬁndings in these reports, it is reasonable to assume the existence of an optimum lattice volume with high cation conductivity; large lattice expansion in Nb-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 leads to lower ionic conductivity and higher activation energy than in trivalent-doped and undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 while smaller cation doping (such as Co3+) improves ionic conductivity. To further clarify the relationship between the dopants and ionic conductivity, we investigated the doping of Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 with Al, which has a smaller ionic radii (0.054 nm) than Co3+ (0.061 nm),8) and its crystal structure and electrical conductivity were evaluated.

Aland Fe-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 were prepared by the sol­gel method. Two solutions were prepared; in one solution, Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O, titanium tetra-butxide tetramer C4H9O[Ti(OC4H9)2O]4C4H9 Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in ethanol, and in the other, NH4H2PO4 was dissolved in distilled water with a concentration of 0.1 mol/l separately. These solutions were mixed into the stoichiometric ratios of the target samples. The obtained gels were dried at 90°C for periods of 12 h or longer and heated at 300°C for 12 h. The precursors were pressed into pellets, and then crystallized and sintered at 600­800°C for 12 h. Analysis was performed by X-ray diffractmetry (XRD) to identify the phases present. The microstructure was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). To evaluate the electrical conductivity, Pt electrodes were applied on both sides of the sintered samples, and ac impedance measurements were taken in the frequency range of 0.01 to 107 Hz. In order to determine the exact ionic conductivity in the ac impedance measurements, directcurrent measurement was also performed.

Firstly, Al-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was prepared with Al substituted for Ti sites. In undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, Mg ions occupy 50% of all the interstitial sites, whereas in the Aldoped phosphates, the Mg concentration increases with increasing Al content, and thus holds the charge neutrality. The XRD proﬁles of Al, Fe-doped and undoped Mg0.5-

Ti2(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 2. As the content of the dopants increases, peaks close to the basal planes, such as (024) and (116), shift toward higher angels, indicating lattice contraction in the c-axis direction. Figure 3 shows the lattice constant as a function of dopant content for Al-doped samples and other cation-doped samples.7) The trivalent-doped samples clearly experience lattice contraction in the direction of c-axis, and the Al-doped samples have the smallest lattice constant. In addition, the lattice constant of the 15 mol%Aldoped sample is almost same as that of the sample doped with 10 mol%, indicating the solubility limit is around 10 mol%Al, even though no secondary phase can be seen for the 15 mol%Al-doped sample in Fig. 2. To see the effect of the dopant on microstructure and ionic conductivity, 10 mol%Al-, Fe-doped and undoped samples were investigated. To evaluate the ionic conductivity precisely, a well sintered body is required. For that purpose, the reaction sintering in this study was carried out at lower temperatures than those reported in previous studies. The densiﬁcation conditions, relative density and grain size of the undoped and doped phosphates are summarized in Table 1, and the SEM images of the samples after reaction sintering at relatively lower temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. Due to its poor sinterbility, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 itself required high sintering temperatures of around 1150­1200°C; however, such high temperatures resulted in partial decomposition. On the other hand, during the reaction sintering of the precursors at low temperatures,

the precursors become dehydrated, the ammonium and acetate salts were removed, and the result was a single-phase sample with high relative density. Undoped and 10 mol%Fedoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 sintered at 700 and 750°C had a higher relative density (80%, 93%) than samples sintered at 1150­ In the case of 10 mol%Al-doped 1200°C, Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, two-step sintering, involving pre-sintering at 600°C for 12 h followed by sintering at 700°C for 12 h, had better relative density (72%) than samples sintered at 800°C. Grain growth was observed in all the reaction-sintered samples.

By using the ac impedance technique, the electrical conductivity of the samples was measured. Two or three semicircles can be observed in the Nyquist plots of 10 mol%Al-, Fe-doped and undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 densiﬁed by reaction sintering shown in Fig. 5. By ﬁtting an equivalent circuit, the magnitude of capacitances of 10¹12, 10¹8 and 10¹7 F were derived from the semicircles observed between high and low frequencies. This suggests that ﬁrst and other semicircles can be attributed to grain and grain boundary responses, respectively. For the Al-doped samples, a two-probe dc measurement was also performed. The dc conductivity was found to be lower than the grain boundary

conductivity by approximately two orders of magnitude. This suggests that the mobile carrier is ionic, presumably Mg2+. The Arrehnius plots in Fig. 6 show the grain (open markers) and grain boundary (ﬁlled markers) ionic conductivity of undoped, 10 mol%Feand Al-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 densiﬁed by reaction sintering. The dashed lines represent the grain conductivity of undoped and 10 mol%Fe-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 sintered at 1150­1200°C. The ionic conductivity of the reaction-sintered samples was in good agreement with that for samples sintered at 1150­1200°C. For 10 mol%Al-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 the grain and grain boundary conductivity at 600°C were 7.1 © 10¹5 and 1.3 © 10¹5 S/cm, respectively. The ionic conductivity was lower than that for undoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 by one or two orders of magnitude. The activation energy of 10 mol%Aldoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (128 and 144 kJ/mol) was the highest among the samples.

The changes in the ionic conductivity and activation energy can be understood by taking the unit-cell volume into consideration. The grain conductivity and activation energy of 10 mol%M-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 at 400°C, where M denotes Fe, Mn, Co, Al and Nb, are plotted as a function of

Preparation and Ionic Conductivity of Al-Doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3

Al-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was prepared as a single phase NASICON-type structure. The dense and single-phase sample was obtained by reaction sintering. For 10 mol%Aldoped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3, the grain and grain boundary conductivity at 600°C were 7.1 © 10¹5 and 1.3 © 10¹5 S/cm, respectively. The activation energy of 10 mol%Al-doped Mg0.5Ti2(PO4)3 (128 kJ/mol for the grain conduction) was the highest among various doped phosphates. By comparing the ionic conductivity of the phosphates, the optimum lattice volume was estimated to be 1.304 nm3.

unit-cell volume in Fig. 7.7) While trivalent doping resulted in a reduction in the c-axis, in the case of Coand Mn-doped samples, the unit-cell volume increases as a result of expansion in the a-axis. It should be noted that the highest grain conductivity and lowest activation energy were attained for the slightly expanded Co-doped sample. For 10 mol%trivalent-doped titanium phosphates, a unit-cell volume of 1.304 nm3 seems to be optimum for Mg-ion conduction. To further clarify the relationship between crystal structure and ionic conductivity, further studies are required for a better understanding of the conduction pathways themselves and their connectivity.
