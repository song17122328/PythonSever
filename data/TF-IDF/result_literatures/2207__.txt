SmarV  (0 5 x 50.5)  phosphates have been prepared by solid state reaction and by sol-gel m&hod. ne  X-ray  diffraction  study shows that these materials belong to the N&con-type  structure. The structure of  i%O.sTiz(PO& has been  solved in  the  R?  space group. Mn*’  ions are ordered in  half of  M(1)  shows  a pammagnetic 

Titanium  phosphates  &,~oTi2(P04)3  have  been  largely  studied  for  their  catalytic  properties  (M  =  Cu)  (1,2)  or  for  their  low  thermal  expansion  coefficient  (M  =  Mg,  Ca, Sr,  Ba)  (3).  Recently,  structures of  Mo.soTiz(PO&  (M  =  Cu,  Mg,  Co,  Ca) (4-S)  have  been  determined.  To  our  knowledge,  the phosphate  &.,T&(PO&  has not  been  studied.  We present  in this paper  the results  obtained  for  the N~~.&vln~“Ti&‘O& 

system : chemical,  structure  and magnetic  properties.

Five  thermal  processings  with  intermittent  regrinding  at 200°C  (24h),  600°C  (48h),  8OO’C (96h),  900°C  (48h)  and  950°C  (48h)  are necessary to obtain  these compounds  without  impurities.  They  can also  be prepared  by  a sol-gel  method  as  described  elsewhere  for  Co0,50Ti2(P0.&  and  crystallize  at high  temperature  (fieure  1).

The progressive  substitution  of  sodium  by manganese provokes  a decrease of  the ch parameter  and a very  slight  variation  of the  ah parameter.  This  decrease of  Ch  is in  favor  of the  occupation  of  M(1)  sites by the manganese  (ri=  0.82A)  of  size  smaller  than  the  sodium  one  (ri  =  1.021%). The  x =  0.5  composition  (Mn0.sTiz(P04)3)  is  a  new  phosphate  of  the  h&Ti2(PO&  series. The  chemical  analysis of  this compound  obtained  by  the two ways of  preparation,  carried  out  in the  Analysis  Service  of  CNRS  (Vernaison-France),  gives experimental  atomic  ratios  in  good  agreement  with  the  calculated  values
