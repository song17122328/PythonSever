Amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms were deposited on the NASICON-type Li-ion conducting glass ceramics, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP), by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering below 130 ◦C. The amorphous ﬁlms were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Li/PEO18–Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au all-solid-state cells were fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance of the amorphous ﬁlms. It was found that the lowtemperature deposited amorphous cathode ﬁlm shows a high discharge voltage and a high discharge capacity of around 130 mAh g−1.

In recent years, there is an increasing need for the all-solid-state microbatteries due to the rapid development of microelectronics devices. The thin ﬁlm Li-ion battery is one of the best choices as power source for these devices. The ﬁndings of some inorganic solid electrolytes with a high Li-ion conductivity, such as Li(P,N)O3 (Lipon) [1–3], NASICON-type glass ceramics [4,5], LVSO [6,7], and LLT [8,9], make it possible for the fabrication of all-solidstate Li-ion batteries. Among them, the NASICON-type electrolyte, Li1+xMxTi2−x(PO4)3, has been received great interest because of its high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature. Recently, allsolid-state Li-batteries based on this electrolyte have been cycled successfully at room temperature [10,11].

However, the as-obtained cathode ﬁlms by sputtering are generally amorphous or partially crystalline if the substrate is not preheated. Low capacity and low operating voltage are always observed for these amorphous ﬁlms compared with the crystalline ﬁlms [12–15]. Therefore, preheating the substrate or postannealing the ﬁlm is necessary to improve the crystallization of the ﬁlms. However, these processes are complicate for the preparation of the microbatteries and cause some undesired side reactions[16,17]. In this work, amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms were prepared on the NASICON-type Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP) substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at low-temperature (not over 130 ◦C). The as-prepared amorphous ﬁlm exhibits a high discharge voltage and a high speciﬁc capacity. The results show that the fabrication process of the microbatteries can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed when amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms are used directly.

The glass ceramics plates, LATSP (0.26 mm in thickness), provided by OHARA Inc., were used as the solid electrolyte for the following experiments, the conductivity of which was about 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 powder was prepared by two-step solid-phase reactions using stoichiometric amount of Li(OCOCH3)·2H2O, Co(OCOCH3)2·4H2O, Mn(OCOCH3)2·4H2O and Ni(OCOCH3)2·4H2O as the starting materials. The mixture was pressed into pellets and heated at 400 ◦C for 5 h. The reaction product was then ground and pressed again into pellets, and headed at 900 ◦C for 20 h. The LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms (8 mm× 8 mm) were deposited on the LATSP substrates (10 mm× 10 mm) by RF magnetron sputtering using an Ulvac SCOTT-C3. The target (50 mm in diameter) used for sputtering was prepared by cold pressing the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 powder. The LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 sputtering was carried out for 2 h in an Ar/O2 mixture (30% O2) or pure Ar with a total pressure of 2 Pa and a power of 50 W. The weight of the ﬁlm was calculated by the weight gain of the substrate before and after sputtering using a precise balance. The substrate with an aluminium mask was placed 10 cm away from the target. Au ﬁlm was then deposited on the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 by RF magnetron sputtering from an Au target in pure Ar for 30 min as a current collector to form a LATSP/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au electrode. For comparison, the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 ﬁlms were also sputtered on Au substrates under the same conditions to form LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au electrodes. The as-prepared electrodes were then post-annealed in air for 0.5 h. The crystalline structure of the ﬁlms was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RINT2000/PC diffractometer with Cu K␣ radiation. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the ﬁlms were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4000. The chemical composition of the ﬁlm was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy using a Shimadzu ICPS-1000IV spectrometer.

Li/PEO18–Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au cells were fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance of the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms. A polyethyleneoxide (PEO)based solid polymer electrolyte ﬁlm, PEO18Li(CF3SO2)2N, was inserted between Li and LATSP to prevent the reactions between Li and LATSP. The polymer electrolyte was prepared by our previously reported method [18]. Galvanostatic cycling of the cells was carried out at 5 ␮A (7.8 ␮A cm−2) between 2.5 and 4.5 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was conducted by applying an ac signal of 10 mV amplitude over the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface combined with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. The EIS plots were recorded at the open circuit voltages of about 3.4 V. For comparison, Li/liquid electrolyte/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au cells were also fabricated and cycled at 5 ␮A between 2.5 and 4.5 V. The liquid electrolyte used was 1 M LiClO4 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate (1:1 in volume). All the electrochemical measurements were performed at 50 ◦C.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms deposited on the LATSP substrates. The XRD patterns of the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 target agree well with the previous reports [19,20]. No peak attributed to LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 can be found in the as-deposited thin ﬁlm in Ar/O2 (30% O2). In contrast, the ﬁlm deposited in pure Ar exhibits a partially crystalline structure with a (1 0 4) preferred orientation at diffraction angle about 44◦ (2). The ICP analysis shows that the molar ratio of Li:Co:Mn:Ni of the asdeposited thin ﬁlm on Au is 1:0.31:0.27:0.26. Note that the content of Li is slightly rich. For simplicity, LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 is still used in the following sections. It was found that the thin ﬁlms deposited both in pure Ar and in Ar+ 30% O2 showed improved crystallization upon annealing at high-temperatures, but annealing also results in the reactions between ﬁlm and the LATSP.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of as-deposited LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm on the LATSP prepared in Ar/O2 (30% O2). As seen in Fig. 2(a), the surface of the ﬁlm is coarse with some islands, the formation of which may be due to the reactions of the Li-rich LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm with air. The thickness of the ﬁlm is estimated to be 0.6 ␮m after 2 h sputtering as shown in Fig. 2(b). Note that, apart from these islands, the ﬁlm seems to be uniform, dense and crack free.

Fig. 3 shows the charge–discharge curves of the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms on LATSP. Note that compared with the crystalline LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 using liquid electrolyte [19], the as-deposited amorphous one shows a relatively low capacity. This is due to the fact that the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm is conducting agent free and that the active area for electrochemical reactions is much smaller compared with the electrode in the liquid electrolyte. Nevertheless, a discharge capacity of around 130 mAh g−1 is comparable to that of the well-crystallized LiCoO2. Furthermore, the irreversible capacity is not so signiﬁcant for this thin amorphous ﬁlm on LATST. As a result, amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 prepared at a low deposition temperature (below 130 ◦C) seems to be a promising cathode material for all-solid-state Li-ion batteries, especially for microbatteries considering its practicable working voltage and speciﬁc capacity. As seen in Fig. 3(b), the capacity of the thin ﬁlm is slightly increased by annealing at 500 ◦C for 0.5 h. However, annealing will add the complexity of batteries preparation process and cause the undesired reactions between the deposited ﬁlm and the electrolyte. Fig. 4 shows the Nyquist plots of the Li/PEO18–Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/Au cells. Note that the diameter of the semi-circlets, which corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/LATSP interface, increases drastically with increasing the annealing temperature. In this regard, the low-temperature processing of thin ﬁlm is favored.

Since the as-deposited ﬁlm sputtered in pure Ar shows different microstructure as that in Ar+ 30% O2 shown in Fig. 1, its electrochemical performance was also characterized. Fig. 5 shows the charge–discharge curves of the as-deposited ﬁlm in pure Ar. Note that the ﬁlm exhibits a rather poor electrochemical performance. This means the sputtering atmosphere plays an important role for the microstructure of the ﬁlm.

Considering the fact that LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm is chemically stable with the Au substrate upon annealing, the electrochemical performance of the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms deposited on the Au substrates in Ar/O2 (30% O2) was also checked using the liquid electrolyte. For the as-deposited ﬁlm, a larger ﬁrst irreversible capacity is evident compared with the ﬁlm on LATSP as shown in Fig. 6(a). For the 600 ◦C-annealed sample on Au, a large irreversible capacity still exists as seen in Fig. 6(b). The obvious capacity increase after annealing is due to the improvement of the crystallization of the ﬁlm. In addition, the ﬁlm will crack after the high-temperature annealing. The cracking of the ﬁlm will cause the penetration of the liquid electrolyte, also contributing to the increase of the capacity. For the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm on LATSP, the capacity increase is caused mainly by the improved crystallization of the ﬁlm since the solid electrolyte is used, excluding the penetration of the electrolyte. However, the capacity increase by annealing in the case of solid electrolyte is slight due to the formation of an inert layer at the LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2/LATSP interface during anneling, evidenced from the impedance proﬁles in Fig. 4, which makes it difﬁcult for the charge transfer reactions occur. Therefore, for the fabrication of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries, the post-annealing temperature should be controlled as low as possible.

Amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlms with a high operating voltage and a high speciﬁc capacity were prepared by RF magnetron sputtering in Ar/O2 (30% O2). A discharge capacity of around 130 mAh g−1 is obtained for the amorphous ﬁlm. The discharge capacity is slightly increased by annealing at 500 ◦C for 0.5 h, but the annealing also caused the interfacial reactions between LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 and LATSP. The amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm prepared in pure Ar shows a poorer electrochemical performance than that prepared in Ar/O2 (30% O2), even though it exhibits somewhat enhanced crystallization. The amorphous LiCo1/3Mn1/3Ni1/3O2 thin ﬁlm on LATSP is considered to be a promising cathode for the all-solid-state microbatteries.
