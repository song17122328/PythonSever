Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C Nasicon-type phosphate is introduced as a new anode material for Lithium ion 

batteries  (LIBs).  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C  was  synthetized  via  the  sol-gel  route  and  delivered  some 

remarkable electrochemical performances.  Specifically, Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C electrode evidenced 

a high rate capability performance and delivered high reversible capacities ranging from 130 

mAh/g to about 111 mAh/g at current rates ranging from 0.1C to 5C in the voltage window of 

1.85-3V vs Li+/Li. At the same voltage range, the material reached an initial capacity of 105 

mAh/g with a capacity retention of about 82% after 1000 cycles at the high current rate of 10C. 

The electrodes were also tested at the wider voltage range of 0.5-3V vs Li+/Li and show good 

reversibility  and  rate  capability  performance.  Moreover,  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C  electrodes  were 

found  to  enable  fast  Li+  diffusion  (order  of  10-13  cm2/s)  compared  to  other  Nasicon-type 

materials. As a result, a first discharge capacity of 480 mAh/g is reached.  


Research and development of energy storage materials have been considered as high priority 

topic due to their key role in the development and use of clean and renewable energy sources 

as alternatives to fossil ones [1,2].  

For  the  advantage  of  their  high  energy  density,  energy  efficiency,  long  cycle  life  and  the 

continuous drop of their cost, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered as one of the most 

promising energy devices for  the portable electronic and electric vehicles (EVs) markets [3–

6]. However, LIBs still suffer from safety issues related to the formation of metallic lithium 

(dendrite) while using graphite as an anode material because of the low plateau voltage (~0.1V) 

[7,8].  With the aim of finding safer alternatives to be used as anode for LIBs, many research 

efforts have been done to investigate new materials providing good and stable electrochemical 

performance and better safety conditions than graphite [8,9].  

Among the panoply of existing  materials, the phosphate-based materials providing attractive 

properties such as the long-term cycling life, good structural stability, better safety and high 

ionic conductivity, were considered as promising electrode materials for LIBs as well as sodium 

ion batteries (SIBs) [10–12]. As part of this compound class, Nasicon-type materials with the 

general  formula  AxMM’(PO4)3  where  “A”  can  be  either  monovalent  (Li+,  Na+)  or  divalent 

(Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, etc.) ions, and M and M’ are transitional metals (Ti, Fe, V, Zr, Sc, etc.), 

stand as potential candidates that can be used either as electrode materials, or solid electrolyte 

for both LIBs and SIBs [5,11,13]. 

As part of these Nasicon materials, the A0.5Ti2(PO4)3 family, where A is a divalent ion (Mn2+, 

Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, etc.)  is considered for negative electrodes for LIBs and SIBs, because of the 

low working voltage (~2.5 vs Li+/Li and ~2.2 vs Na+/Na) as well as the empty sites that these 

compounds provide for lithium (or sodium) hosting (3.5 empty sites) [14–17]. Nevertheless, 

Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3 was not reported to date although Ni2+ is the cation exhibiting the closer ionic radii to that of Li+. This property could be considered as an advantage for the lithium insertion 

during the electrochemical cycling as a result of a better diffusion of Li+ inside the existing 

channels, as reported by Z. Wu et al. in their interesting review regarding the use of Nasicon 

type phosphates as solid electrolyte for all-solid-state lithium batteries [18].  According to these 

authors, the high Li+ ionic conductivity can be only achieved as the channel size of Nasicon 

framework structure is comparable to the ion size. 

Likely to the known Li4Ti5O5 anode material, A0.5Ti2(PO4)3 materials offer a minimum chance 

for the formation of SEI and lithium dendrites due to the relatively higher working voltage 

corresponding  to  titanium  (Ti)  redox  reactions  (~1.5  V  for  Li4Ti5O12,  and  ~2.5  V  for 

A0.5Ti2(PO4)3  materials)  compared  to  graphite  (~0.1).  The  electrochemical  behavior  of  the 

A0.5Ti2(PO4)3 materials is based on a two-step lithium insertion/extraction mechanism due to 

the existence of two different vacant sites for lithium intercalation, while in Li4Ti5O5 anode, 

with spinel structure, the insertion mechanism is based on two-phase step, where lithium is 

inserted into the vacant site (16c) and at the same time structural lithium ions existing in the 

structure migrate from their structural site (8a) to the new hosting site (16c). [19,20] 

In this work, we report the optimization of the synthesis process of a new Nasicon-structure 

electrode  material  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C  (NTP@C)  and  its  electrochemical  behavior  as  a  novel 

anode material for use in Li-ion batteries within two potential ranges 1.85-3.0V and 0.5-3.0V. 

Furthermore, an analysis of the structure, morphology and electrochemical kinetics of the as-

prepared NTP@C material are provided in this manuscript.  



The  synthesis  of  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3  (NTP)  Nasicon-type  material  is  accomplished  via  the 

conventional sol-gel synthesis route, by mixing a stoichiometric amounts of C4H6NiO4,4H2O 

(99.0%;  Sigma-Aldrich)  dissolved  in  ethanol,  H3PO4  (85,8%;  Sigma-Aldrich),  and  TiCl4 

solution (99.0%; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in ethanol. After mixing four about 2 hours, a gel was 

obtained. The gel is then dried at 90 °C for 24 hours and calcined at 680 °C for 12 hours under 

air. This synthesis temperature was selected as best after numerous attempts done in a narrow 

temperature range (660 – 700 °C). The resulting NTP powder (85wt%) was ground with 15 

wt% of sucrose in acetone, then the mixture was dried and annealed at 600 °C for 5 h under an 

argon flow. The final Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3/C (NTP@C) composite material was black. 

The  phase  structure    and  morphology  of  the  prepared  NTP  and  NTP@C  material  were 

characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima IV, Cu Kα radiation), Raman 

spectroscopy (Cofotec MR520 3D Raman confocal microscope; 532 nm beam),  field-emission 

scanning electron microscopy (SEM TESCAN Mira 3 LM field emission),  and field-emission 

transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai Spirit).  

The  specific  surface  area  of  the  NTP  and  NTP@C  materials  was  determined  at  77K  using 

Brunauer-Emmett-Teller  (BET)  method  on  a  Gemini  VII  2390  Surface  Area  Analyzer 

(Micromeritics Instrument Corp.). The degassing conditions were set to be 200°C during 24h 

for both samples.  

The carbon content in the composite material was determined by thermogravimetric thermal 

analysis (TGA), with a heating rate of 10°C/min using a Discovery TGA instrument under air

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on a SPECS Phoibos 100 spectrometer using Mg Kα X-ray. Samples were transferred into the XPS chamber through 

glove box without exposure to air. To remove the electrolyte residues on the surface, samples 

were sputtered using Ar+ prior to the XPS measurement. The binding energy was corrected 

using the C 1s peak at 285 eV.



Electrodes were prepared by blending 75 wt% of NTP@C active materials, 15 wt% Super P as 

the conductive additive and 10 wt% of Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as a binder dissolved 

in distilled water. The obtained slurry is then pasted onto a cooper foil and dried at 80 °C for 

12 h in a vacuum chamber. The electrodes were cut into discs with two different diameters, 11 

and 12.6 mm with active material mass load around 1-2 mg/cm2. Metallic lithium foil was used 

as the counter and reference electrode. Commercial Celgard was used as a separator. The used 

electrolyte was 1M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) 

Electrochemical  tests  were  performed  with  CR2032  coin  cells.  Cells  were  assembled  in  an 

argon-filled  glove  box  with  water  and  oxygen  contents  below  0.1  ppm.  The  cells  were 

electrochemically tested at two different potential ranges of 1.85-3.0 V and 0.5-3.0 V vs Li+/Li. 

The  electrochemical  tests  were  carried  out  on  an  MPGE  (Biologic  instrument),  Arbin 

instrument  and  Autolab  (Metrohm  autolab) instruments.  

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed using an SP150 Biologic instrument.  



Nasicon-type  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3  was  reported  to  be  a  thermodynamically  unstable  material  that 

decomposes easily to an oxyphosphate phase[21,22]. With the aim of optimizing the synthesis 

conditions  related  to  this  Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3  Nasicon  material,  its  crystallization  process  was 

followed  by  X-ray  powder  diffraction  in  the  temperature  range  of  [660-700  °C].  As 

demonstrated in Fig. 1-(a), at a temperature of 660 °C, only some characteristic peaks related 

to the TiP2O7 phase appear. At 680 °C, the XRD pattern shows the crystallization of the material 

as  a  Nasicon  phase  (space  group  R-3)  with  minor  impurity  traces  of  TiP2O7  (~3  %)  and 

Ni0.5TiOPO4 (~3 %). At 700 °C, the Nasicon structure of the material was preserved but the 

appearance  of  more  intense  TiP2O7  and  Ni0.5TiOPO4  related  peaks  compared  to  the  ones 

obtained at 680 °C was observed. 



Based on these results, only the Ni0.5Ti2(PO4)3 material obtained at 680°C is considered for the 

following  characterizations.  At  this  synthesis  temperature,  the  peaks  identified  as  Nasicon 

crystalline phase were indexed assuming a rhombohedral symmetry (space group R-3). 

In the R-3 space group, the structure of the material (Fig. S1) is built by lantern-like units 

sequenced along the c-axis and each unit is composed of four [TiO6] octahedra and two [PO4] 

tetrahedra sharing O-atoms as corners [11]. Theoretically, Ni2+ ions occupy only the more stable 

3a site leaving more vacant voids at the 3b sites[16,17] 



Moreover, the carbon content in the NTP@C composite material was qualitatively recognized 

by Raman spectroscopy as XRD analysis was unable to prove the presence of carbon in an amorphous form.
