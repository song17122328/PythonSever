The phosphate Na2FeSn(PO4)3, obtained by solid state reaction, was found to be isotypic with Na2CrTi(PO4)3, with space group R-3c and unit cell parameters a = 8.6617(2) Å, c = 22.0161(7) Å, V = 1430.47(5) Å3, Z = 6. The structural parameters reﬁned using Rietveld method showed that the Na+ ions occupy totally the M1 sites and partially the M2 sites and sharing faces with the [Sn/FeO6] octahedra. The presence of the unique valence of ferric iron in the reported phosphate was conﬁrmed using UV–visible diffuse-reﬂectance spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy.

Inorganic phosphates cover a large class of diverse materials whose applications include: catalysts, solid electrolytes for batteries [1–4], linear and non-linear optical components and laser materials [5–7]. However, the study of phosphates has become more popular particularly, after the development of NASICON groups of fast ionic conductors [8–14]. Original NASICON compounds are solid solutions derived from NaZr2(PO4)3 by partial replacement of P by Si, where Na compensates the negatively charged framework, to give the general formula Na1+xZr2P3−xSixO12 (0≤ x≤ 3). So the general formula of Nasicon materials can be written as AxBy(XO4)3, where An+ can be monovalent cation (Na+, Li+, Cu+,. . .) or bivalent cation (Ca2+, Ba2+, Cu2+,. . .) and B is one or more ions in tri-, tetra-, or penta-valent state (Fe3+, Cr3+,. . .Ti4+, Zr4+,. . .Nb5+, Sb5+,. . .). The NASICON structure has a negatively charged 3D-framework, where the An+ cations reside in fully or partially occupied sites. The framework is built of [XO4] tetrahedra linked by corners to [BO6] octahedra. Each [XO4] tetrahedron shares each corner with one [BO6] octahedron and, conversely, each [BO6] octahedron shares each corner with a different [XO4] group. The interstitial voids generated within the network are of two types known as M1 and M2 sites in the R-3c space group. An+ ions at the M1 sites are coordinated by a trigonal antiprism of oxygens and at the M2 site has a distorted 8-fold coordination. These sites are connected by bottlenecks generally termed M1M2 bottlenecks. Speciﬁc structural details, such as the size of the M1M2 bottleneck [15–17], are needed to understand the electrical parameters (ionic conductivities and activation energies) of these samples. Structural information can be obtained either by single-crystal diffraction or by Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data.

In general, the properties of the NASICON-type Na+ ion conductor compounds strongly depend on the chemical stoichiometry, the crystal structure and unit cell parameters, that, at the same time, depend on the ionic radii of the cations located in octahedral (B) and tetrahedral (X) sites. Recently many attempts have been reported on mixed M/M 4) phosphates A2MM 4)(PO4)3 (M = Ti4+, Zr4+, Sn and M 4) = Fe3+, Cr3+, In3+) on the octahedral site [18–22].

The goal of this work is to synthesize orthophosphate Na2FeSn(PO4)3; to reﬁne its crystal structure on the basis of powder data (the Rietveld method). Additionally, the UV–visible diffusereﬂectance spectroscopy, magnetic measurements and Mössbauer spectroscopy have been used to study the valence state of the iron as well as the cation distribution in the compound.

Powder of Na2FeSn(PO4)3 was prepared by solid state reaction, starting from reagent grade Na2CO3, (NH4)2HPO4, Fe2O3 and SnO2 mixed in stoichiometric ratios.

The mixture was heated at 200, 600 and ﬁnally at 950 ◦C for 48 h with intermediate grinding. The obtained powder is whitish.

The X-ray powder diffraction data (XRPD) were collected at room temperature with a Philips PW 3040 (–) diffractometer using a graphite monochromator. The structure of the iron phosphate compound was derived from the step-scanned X-ray intensity data, in the range 10–120◦ (2) with a step size of 0.02◦ (2) and counting time of 30 s for each step. The structural parameters were reﬁned by Rietveld method [23] using the computer program FULLPROF [24].

Optical absorption spectrum has been recorded at room temperature on a Cary 2400 spectrophotometer in the region 210 and 2400 nm.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out with a Quantum Design SQUID MPMS-5S magnetometer. Data were recorded at a constant applied magnetic ﬁeld (0 < H < 3T) in the temperature range 4.2–340 K.

Mössbauer measurements were performed with a constant acceleration HALDER-type spectrometer using a room temperature 57Co source [Rh matrix] in the transmission geometry. Isomer shift values refer to ␣-Fe at 293 K. The spectra were recorded at 4.2 and 293 K using a variable temperature cryostat.

The X-ray diffraction pattern can be indexed assuming an hexagonal cell: a = 8.6617(2) Å, c = 22.0161(7) Å. The order of magnitude of these parameters is consistent with a Nasicon-type structure. All the observed reﬂections could be indexed in the space group R-3c (No 167). The reﬁnement of the structure was carried out using the Rietveld proﬁlation method. The X-ray diffraction data was collected at room temperature. The initial coordinates were those of Na2CrTi(PO4)3 [20]. The sodium was introduced with full occupancy of the M1 site (one Na atom per formula unit), at (0 0 0) 6b position, and the excess of sodium (one Na atom per formula unit) located in the M2 site, 18e position. The iron and tin atoms were assumed to be statistically distributed over the octahedral sites (Nasicon framework). These reﬁnements lead to a rather good agreement between the experimental and calculated XRPD patterns and to follow reliability factors [RP = 11%, Rwp = 15% and RB = 5%. The experimental conditions of the data collection are given in Table 1. Final atomic coordinates are given in Table 2. Selected interatomic distances and angles are listed in Table 3. The experimental and calculated diffractograms are compared in Fig. 1.

The structure of Na2FeSn(PO4)3 consists of a three-dimensional framework of [PO4] tetrahedra and [(Sn/Fe)O6] octahedra sharing corners (Fig. 2). The overall set of distances within the framework [(Sn/Fe)–O(1) = 2.01(2) Å, (Sn/Fe)–O(1) = 2.03(7) Å and Na(1)–O(2) = 2.422(4) Å] is in good agreement with the ionic radii values in six coordination [r(Sn4+) = 0.69 Å, r(Fe3+) = 0.645 Å, r(Na+) = 1.02 Å] [26]. The P–O distances [1.50(1) Å; 1.53(2) Å] are comparable to those generally found in Nasicon like phosphate. In M2 site, the sodium is bounded by eight oxygen with Na(2)–O distance values of 2× 2.34(2), 2× 2.40(3), 2× 2.61(1) and 2.88(2) Å. The Na+ ions are located in the usually labelled M1 sites i.e. at the center of an antiprism elongated along the c axis and sharing faces with the (Sn/Fe)O6 octahedra. The PO4 tetrahedra are rather regular with a weak angular O–P–O dispersion between 103.42◦ and 115.83◦, around the ideal value 109.45◦.

Electronic spectrum of Na2FeSn(PO4)3 (Fig. 3) was successfully deconvoluted into three Gaussian bands at lower energy, corresponding to crystal ﬁeld (CF) electronic absorptions at 707, 498 and 418 nm, characteristic of the octahedral environment of Fe3+ ions. These bands correspond to forbidden transitions between states with different multiplicities. According to the high-spin d5 conﬁguration, the fundamental term is 6A1g(S) and the observed bands correspond, respectively to the transitions: B1:6A1g (S) → 4T2g (G) (707 nm) B2:6A1g (S) → 4T1g (G) (498 nm)

Plus two further bands (one Gaussian and one Lorentzian) at higher energy, probably referable to metal-oxygen charge transfer (MLCT). The intense bands observed in the UV region (236 nm, 313 nm) are attributed to O→ Sn/Fe charge transfers. Due to the higher oxidant power of the Fe(III) in comparison with Sn(IV), O→ Fe charger transfer occurs at lower energy (313 nm) than the O→ Sn charger transfer (236 nm).

The experimental  5)M−1 = f(T) variation (Fig. 4) shows the onset of a long-range antiferromagnetic order at a Neel temperature of 16 K. Above this temperature, the data can be ﬁtted with a Curie −1 = C/(T− ), with a Weiss temperature  =−40 K Weiss law,  5)M and a Curie constant C = 4.35 emu K mol−1. The negative value of  reveals the existence of antiferromagnetic interactions between the metallic ions. The value of C is slightly close to the value predicted for high-spin Fe3+ (t2g 2), in octahedral environment, with only spin contribution (4.375 cm3 K mol−1) [27].

The Mössbauer spectra of Na2FeSn(PO4)3 measured at 293 and 4.2 K are shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 5a. The experimental data are represented by points and the ﬁtted curves by solid lines. The hyperﬁne parameters corresponding to the ﬁts are listed in Table 4. The results obtained indicate that the compound is paramagnetic at 293 K and magnetically ordered at 4.2 K.

The Mössbauer spectrum at room temperature indicates the presence of a symmetrical doublet with ı = 0.46 mm/s (isomer shift) in the range 0.29–0.5 mm s−1 expected for high spin Fe3+ ions in an octahedral ﬁeld [28–30], and  6) = 0.28 mm/s (quadrupole splitting). The obtained isomer shift value is compared to the isomer shift values observed in K3Fe(PO4)2 [31], Fe2(SO4)3 [32] and Li3Fe2(AsO4)3 [33] where their structures are built up from isolated [FeO6] octahedra linked by the [XO4] tetrahedra (X = S, P, As) (Table 5); the comparison shows that while going from S to P to As containing compounds a decrease in the isomer shift value is observed: ıS > ıP > ıAs. This trend can be explained by the principle of antagonic bonds. According to this principle, the lengthening of the X–O bond (Table 5) which reasonably increases its ionicity induces an increase of the covalence character of antagonic Fe–O bond, reducing the isomer shift from sulphate to arsenate.

The Mössbauer spectrum at T = 4.2 K shows clearly a sextuplet characteristic of the magnetic ordered compound (Fig. 5b) in agreement with the magnetic susceptibility results. The difference between the low temperature and the room temperature isomer shifts is due in part to the second order Doppler effect.

Powder of Na2FeSn(PO4)3 compound has been prepared by solid state route. Its crystal structure has been resolved by Rietveld method, from powder X-ray diffraction data, the results revealed that the compound is isotypic with Na2CrTi(PO4)3 and belongs to the Nasicon family and crystallizes in the in R-3c space group. It is formed by a 3D network of [Fe/SnO6] octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra connected by corners. Fe3+ and Sn4+ cations are statistically distributed in the octahedral sites (12c) of the framework. Na occupies totally the M1 sites and partially the M2 sites. The oxidation state of irons was clearly identiﬁed by Mössbauer spectroscopy, magnetic measurement and UV–visible.
