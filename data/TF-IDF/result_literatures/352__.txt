NASICON-structured  materials  have  evolved  to  fill  many  critical  roles  in  battery systems due to their three-dimensional (3D) framework structures. Here, by coupling NASICON-structured  Na3V2(PO4)2O2F  (NVPF)  cathode  and  Na3V2(PO4)3  (NVP) anode, an asymmetric Na-ion based full cell exhibits two flat voltage plateaus at about 2.3  V  and  1.9  V  and  a  high  capacity  of  101  mAh/g.  Moreover,  an  all-solid-state Na-ion  battery  has  been further  enabled  by the  concept  of  using  all NASICON-structured including cathode, anode and electrolyte (Na5YSi4O12, NYSO), which delivers a high output voltage. Importantly, the full cell displays high safety without  using  flammable  organic  liquid  electrolyte  and  superior  structure  stability with all NASICON-structured materials.


Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the most common and typical energy storage devices are  currently  dominating  in  consumer  electronics  and  penetrating  the  automotive industry.1-2  However,  the  large-scale  application  of  LIBs  for  grid  energy  storage would be limited due to the shortage and uneven distribution of lithium resources.3 

Recently, Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are being intensively pursued because of their much more abundant and available resources.3-4 Over the past couple of years, great efforts have  been  devoted  to  developing  suitable  electrode  materials  and  electrolytes  for NIBs and much progress has been achieved.


NASICON (Na super ionic conductor)-structured materials were first reported by Goodenough  et  al.  and  developed  as  solid-state  electrolytes  due  to  their  open three-dimensional (3D) framework structures and high ionic conductivity.9 Moreover, when NASICON-structured materials are used as electrodes in LIBs or NIBs, Li ion or Na ion can also be easily inserted and extracted in their 3D framework, showing a high  capacity  and  fast  kinetics.  To  date,  vanadium-based  NASICON-structured electrode  materials  have  attracted  great  attention  since  their  high  capacities  and versatility with multiple redox couples (V5+/V4+, V4+/V3+, and V3+/V2+).10-12 Among various  vanadium-based  NASICON-structured  cathodes  for  NIBs,  Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP)  becomes  appealing  where  two  Na  ions  can  be  extracted  from  the  NVP structure  with  a  small  volume  change  (8.26%).3,  13  More  interestingly,  the  NVP structure can accommodate one more Na ion and form Na4V2(PO4)3, as a result, the NVP can serve as anode as well.14 In this regard, symmetric NVP//NVP full cell have been demonstrated to show an attractive performance. Nevertheless, the practicability of this symmetric system is limited by its low operating voltage (~1.8 V).15-19

To  increase  the  operating  voltage  of  vanadium-based  NASICON-structured materials, introduction of higher electronegative O2and Fto substitute PO4effective strategy. This is mainly attributed to the stronger bonding interaction of V-F than  V-O.  Recently,  we  reported  a  Na3V2(PO4)2O2F  (NVPF)  electrode  by  a  simple hydrothermal  method.20  As  cathode  for  NIBs,  NVPF  electrode  exhibited  two  high working  plateaus  at  about  4.0  and  3.6  V  versus  the  Na+/Na,  higher  than  3.4  V  for NVP.  Motivated  by  providing  a  high  output  voltage,  herein,  we  coupled  NVPF cathode  and  NVP  anode  in  a  full  cell.  The  full  cell  demonstrated  two  flat  voltage plateaus at about 2.3 V and 1.9 V. In contrast, NVP//NVP full cell only delivered a smaller  output  voltage.  Furthermore,  NASICON-structured  solid-state  electrolyte (Na5YSi4O12)21 has been employed to substitute flammable organic liquid electrolyte to fabricate a solid-state Na-ion battery based on all NASICON-structured materials. The solid-state full cell model shows not only high voltage plateaus similar with in organic liquid electrolyte system but also higher safety.


Na3V2(PO4)2O2F were synthesis by a facile hydrothermal method without further high-temperature annealing process, as described in our previous report.20 First, 0.01 mol V2O5 and 0.03 mol H2C2O4 was dissolved in 100 mL deionized water by stirring for 1 h at 70 °C. 0.03 mol NaF and 0.02 mol NH4H2PO4 were added into the obtained V2O5  and  H2C2O4  solution  while  the  pH  was  controlled  to  7.00±0.05  by  adding NH3·H2O.  The  resulting  green  suspension  was  tightly  sealed  in  a  Teflon-lined stainless-steel  autoclave  and  maintained  at  170  °C  for  12  h.  Finally,  the  obtained powders were washed several times by deionized water and collected after dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C.


XRD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 ADVANCE) using  Cu  Kα  radiation  (λ  =  1.5418  Å).  The  morphology  and  particle  size  were investigated  by  using  scanning  electron  microscopy  (SEM,  Hitachi  SU8000).  The image of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was collected on the JEOL-2100F.

The  NVPF  electrodes  were  composed  of  as-prepared  active  materials  (NVPF), acetylene black and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (Na-CMC) binder with a weight ratio  of  7:2:1.  Similarly,  the  NVP  electrodes  were  made  by  75  wt.%  NVP  active materials,  15  wt.%  acetylene  black  and  10  wt.%  polyvinylidene  difluoride  (PVDF) binder.  

The  CR2032  coin  cells  were  assembled  to  measure  the  electrochemical performances. In half-cell system, Na metal foil was used as counter and reference electrode,  a  glass  fiber  (Whatman)  as  the  separator,  a  solution  of  1  M  NaClO4  in EC:DMC  (1:1  vol%  +  5.0%  FEC)  as  electrolyte.  Based  on  the  theoretical  specific capacity of active materials, the current values of NVPF and NVP electrode is 1 C = 130 mA/g and 1 C = 117 mA/g. It should be noted that the capacity of the full cell was  based  on  the  NVPF  cathode.  The  solid-state  full  cells  were  enabled  by  NVPF cathode, PEO-NYSO SSE membrane and NVP anode in a CR2032 coin cell. Cyclic voltammetry  (CV)  tests  were  carried  out  on  an  electrochemical  working  station (BioLogic,  VMP3)  at  a  scan  rate  0.05  mV/s.  The  charge/discharge  tests  were performed on a Neware BTS-4000 system.

Moreover,  the  desodiation/sodiation  reaction  of  NVPF  is  highly reversible with a Coulombic efficiency of 91.6% and stable, which offers excellent cycle performance with a capacity retention of 94% over 50 cycles (Figure 3b). Such a high stability is due to the high structure stability and small volume change (about 2.79%  at  the  full  sodiation)  upon  cycling.24,  27  The  initial  galvanostatic  charge  and discharge curves in the inset of Figure 3b show two flat potential plateaus at around 3.6 V and 4.0 V with a small polarization (0.37 V), in accordance with the CV results. 

Since  NVP  electrode  was  employed  as  anode,  the  NVP  half-cell  was  performed  in between 1.2-2.5 V vs. Na/Na+. One sharp redox couple at 1.74/1.45 V was observed (Figure  3c),  which  can  be  attributed  to  phase  transformation  of  Na3V2(PO4)3  and Na4V2(PO4)3  with  valence  state  change  of  vanadium  (V2+/3+).13-14  Meanwhile,  the cycling properties of NVP anode were investigated at 0.1 C. As shown in Figure 3d, NVP  delivers  an  initial  charge  capacity  of  42  mAh/g  and  a  capacity  retention  of 96.4% after 50 cycles, which is similar to the previous reports.14 From inset of Figure 3d, it is clearly seen that the charge curves of NVP anode in half cell show a voltage plateau at ~1.6 V , which is ascribed to the change of vanadium valence state between +2 and +3 during cycling.16


In summary, a Na-ion full cell has been successfully enabled by a concept of using all  NASICON-structured  materials.  Taking the  advantage  of  high  voltage Na3V2(PO4)2O2F  cathode  and  stable  Na3V2(PO4)3  anode,  the  NVP//NVPF  full  cell displays two high voltage plateaus at around 2.3 V and 1.9 V, high capacity of 101 mAh/g,  great  rate  and  cycling  performance.  Furthermore,  a  all-solid-state  Na-ion battery  was  fabricated  by  introducing  NASICON-structured  solid-state  electrolytes, which delivers equivalent electrochemical kinetic with liquid electrolyte. We believe that this concept may open up a new research field for next generation battery system and energy storage technology.
