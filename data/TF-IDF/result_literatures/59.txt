Diﬀerent sources of the starting materials can inﬂuence the properties of the lithium-ion conductors. Two dif-ferent sources of phosphorous are used to prepare NASICON type lithium-ion conductor Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 via a hydrothermal-assisted solid-state method in this paper. X-ray diﬀraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are conducted to characterize the structure and mor-phology. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to characterize the conductivity of the samples. The sample using NH4H2PO4 as phosphorus source exhibits a lower total conductivity than the sample using H3PO4 as phosphorus source, which is attributed to the lower relative density and the more porous micro-structure obtained in N-LATP. While the more porous microstructure formed in N-LATP is rooted in the loss of driving force for sintering caused by the earlier crystallized rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3. The porous mi-crostructure results in a tortuous path for lithium ions migration. Diﬀerent sources of phosphorous can result in diﬀerent reactions taken place in the hydrothermal reactor, thereby leading to a diﬀerent particle size dis-tribution, relative density, crystallography and morphology, eventually aﬀecting the lithium ion conduction in the pelletized samples.
Li-ion batteries are widely used in modern electronic devices and electric vehicles nowadays. But the potential hazards due to the use of ﬂammable organic liquid electrolytes cause concerns in society. To replace the ﬂammable organic liquid electrolytes with solid-state elec-trolytes seems to be a safer alternative. Solid-state electrolytes exhibit several advantages of better stability against lithium and wider elec-trochemical operating window over organic liquid electrolytes. To compete with the currently-used organic liquid electrolytes, the ionic conductivity of solid-state electrolytes needs to be increased to the level of 10−2 S/cm.Several solid-state lithium-ion conductors are being intensively in-vestigated to explore their uses as solid-state electrolytes, including perovskite-type La2/3-xLi3xTiO3 [1,2], garnet-type Li7La3Zr2O12 [3–5] and NASICON-type Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 [6–8]. Among these lithium-ion conducting materials, NASICON-type Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3(LATP) ex-hibits a better overall performance ascribed to its high ionic conductivity, stability at high potential, as well as great stability in atmosphere and water. Although the grain conductivity of LATP is in the order of magnitude of 10−3 S/cm, the grain-boundary conductivity is quite low, in the order of magnitude of 10−5 S/cm, becoming a dominant factor on the low total conductivity. Therefore the research focus is to increase the total conductivity to meet the requirements of solid-state electrolytes. Investigations being employed to increase the total conductivity include trying various preparation methods, doping other elements, increasing the density of the samples and etc. Pre-paration methods include solid-state reaction method, sol-gel method, hydrothermal, melt-quenching method and solution chemistry.The ionic conductivities of LATP prepared by these methods are listed in Table 1. Although the LATP electrolytes with the same com-position were prepared by using the same method, the total con-ductivity reported by diﬀerent research groups could be diﬀerent. It seems that factors such as the morphology of the precursors [9], the particle size distribution, the crystallinity of the precursors and the sources of lithium, aluminum, titanium and phosphorus all become dominating factors on the performance of LATP prepared [10–16]. The eﬀect of Li-source and Al-source on the performance of LATP has been investigated, respectively. Lee et al. tried to use LiNO3, LiCl and CH3COOLi to prepare Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 electrolytes and found that LATP originated from LiCl exhibited the highest total conductivity of 8.36 × 10−4 S/cm [17]. Kotobukin et al. studied the eﬀect of Al sources (Al(C3H7O)3 and Al(NO3)3) on the performance of LATP and found that the total conductivity of LATP prepared from Al(C3H7O)3 was one order of magnitude higher than that of LATP prepared from Al (NO3)3 [18]. It was ascribed to the insuﬃcient mixing of water-soluble Al(NO3)3 and water-insoluble Ti(C3H7O)4, resulting in an impure phase of AlPO4 which is highly resistive. It can be concluded that the sources of elements play an important role on determining the performance of LATP. The eﬀect of the sources of elements on the performance of LATP is also included in Table 1.Yang et al. [31] studied the inﬂuence of phosphorus sources on Li2O-Al2O3-GeO2-P2O5 glass-ceramics and found out that the con-ductivity is consistent very well with the results of phase composition and density, aﬀected greatly by the choice of phosphorus. To the best knowledge of the authors, no works have been carried out to investigate the eﬀect of phosphorus sources on the performance of LATP. There-fore, solid-state electrolyte Li1.3Ti1.7Al0.3(PO4)3 was prepared via a hydrothermal-assisted solid-sate route and the eﬀect of phosphorus sources on the performance of LATP was investigated in this paper. H3PO4 and NH4H2PO4 was used as phosphorus source to synthesize Li1.3Ti1.7Al0.3(PO4)3 and the properties of samples prepared from these two phosphorus sources were characterized.
The starting materials for preparation of Li1.3Ti1.7Al0.3(PO4)3 were Ti(OC4H9)4 (99%, Kermel), CH3CH2OH (> 99.7%, MACKLIN), Al (NO3)3∙9H2O (99%, Huadong), LiOH∙H2O (98%, MACKLIN), H3PO4 (86%, Beichen) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Guangfu). All the starting ma-terials were added in stoichiometric ratio, except 10% excessive lithium was added to compensate the lithium loss at high temperatures. Firstly, 3 g Ti(OC4H9)4 was dissolved in 20 ml ethanol, then 100 ml deionized water was added drop wise to form a semi transparent solution and the solution was kept stirred for 2 h. After that, 0.585 g Al(NO3)3∙9H2O and 0.312 g LiOH∙H2O was added, followed by the addition of 1.78 g H3PO4 or 1.8 g NH4H2PO4. The mixed solution was kept stirred for another 1.5 h to form a milky white sol. The resultant sol was then transferred into a hydrothermal reactor which was left at 180 °C for 12 h. The mixture obtained in the hydrothermal reactor was dried at 100 °C for 8 h to obtain white powders. The resultant white powders using NH4H2PO4 or H3PO4 were designated as N180 or H180, which were then calcined at 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C for 3 h to get precursor powders namely H180–500, H180–600, H180–700 and H180–800. Accordingly, N180 calcined at 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C for 3 h to get precursor powders namely N180–500, N180–600, N180–700 and N180–800. These precursor powders were pressed into coin-shaped pellets and then sintered at 850 °C, 900 °C, 950 °C, 1000 °C and 1050 °C for 6 h. The sintered pellets using H3PO4 as phosphorous source were designated as H-LATP and the one using NH4H2PO4 were designated as N-LATP.The powders obtained in the hydrothermal reactor (H180 and N180) were examined by a thermogravimetry (TG) analysis with a TG analyzer (TGA4000). The heating rate was 10 °C/min from 35 to 950 °C under the air ﬂow of 40 ml/min. Particle size distributions of powers H180, H180–500, H180–600, H180–700, H180–800, N180, N180–500, N180–600, N180–700 and N180–800 were characterized by the laser diﬀraction method (BT-9300H).The density of the sintered pellets was determined according to the mass and the volume of the pellets. X-ray examination was carried out at room temperature using an X-ray dif-fractometer (XRD, Rigaku: Ultima IV) with a scanning step rate of 0.02° s−1 in the 2θ range of 10° to 75°. The microstructures of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7800F). AC impedance data were collected with VersaSTAT3 electrochemical workstation in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz at 25 °C to 125 °C in an increment of 20 °C in air and the activation energies of the samples were calculated accordingly. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the obtained samples were collected using a BRUKER TensorII spectrometer in the range of 500–4000 cm−1.
A series of calcination temperatures was experimented to in-vestigate the eﬀect of calcination temperature on the properties of samples, especially on the ionic conductivity and the relative density. Table 2 shows the ionic conductivity and relative density of sintered pellets made of powders calcined at diﬀerent temperatures.It was found from Table 2 that the relative density, the total con-ductivity and the grain-boundary conductivity of both H-LATP and N-LATP all peaked at a calcination temperature of 600 °C. Increasing the calcination temperature did not impose a positive eﬀect on the relative density and the ionic conductivity. Especially for N-LATP, the relatively densities of the sintered pellets made of powders calcined at all the temperatures investigated were all quite low. As well known, the ionic conductivity of the lithium conductors was largely aﬀected by the re-lative density. And the relative density was inﬂuenced by conditions of the starting powders for making the pellets. Therefore, the particle size distributions and the crystallography of H180 and N180, as well as those calcined at 600 °C, were investigated.After reacted at 180 °C for 12 h in a hydrothermal reactor, particle size distributions of the resultant powders H180 and N180 were de-termined and shown in Fig. 1. Both samples displayed unimodal, near-Gaussian particle size distributions. It shows a narrower distribution for powders using H3PO4 (H180) with D50 close to 0.86 μm, while the distribution of powders using NH4H2PO4 (N180) was slightly broader with D50 close to 2.33 μm.The SEM photos of H180–600 and N180–600 along with the particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 2. It was found that the particle size distribution of H180–600 evolved from a unimodal distribution of H180 into a tetra-modal distribution with distinct maxima centred at 2.2 μm, 17.8 μm, 40.2 μm and 90.8 μm. And the SEM photo of H180–600 also exhibited an inhomogeneous morphology with large and small agglomerates co-existed. Powder N180–600 still displayed a unimodal distribution, but D50 increased to 2.74 μm. As seen in the SEM photo, the morphology of powder N180–600 was more homogeneous than that of H180–600. This is consistent with the modeling results reported by Wang and Chen [32] which claims that the microstructure of a compact with more and smaller agglomerates will become more inhomogeneous. Tuan et al. found that the densiﬁ-cation increases with an increasing radius of agglomerates during sin-tering [33], which oﬀers an explanation why the multi-modal dis-tribution and larger powder size in H180–600 accounted for the generally higher relative density observed in H-LATP (Table 2). Han et al. also observed that bimodal particle size distribution was bene-ﬁcial to achieving a denser microstructure than a unimodal particle size distribution [34].XRD examination was carried out on the resultant powder using NH4H2PO4 as starting materials after reacted at 180 °C for 12 h in a hydrothermal reactor (N180) and the majority of the phases was identiﬁed as starting materials of tetragonal NH4H2PO4 (PDF #37-1479) and LiOH·H2O (PDF #25-0486), with some intermediate pro-ducts of NH4NO3 (PDF #47-0867) and C3H3AlO6·3H2O (PDF #38-0655)(shown in Fig. 3(a)), which indicated that all the starting materials have not yet reacted to give the desired rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 phase at this stage. After calcined at 600 °C, all the peaks in the pattern of N180–600 could be assigned as rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 (PDF # 35-0754) with only a small trace of TiP2O7 (PDF #38-1468), which means that N180 already crystallized into rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 at 600 °C. In contrast, the XRD pattern of the powder using H3PO4 as starting material after reacted in the hydrothermal reactor at 180 °C (H180) was quite diﬀerent and all the peaks could be assigned as two main phases, which were LiTiPO5 (PDF # 44-0083) and (TiO)2P2O7 (PDF # 39-0207)(shown in Fig. 3(b)) without the phases of the starting materials. This indicates that the starting materials involved H3PO4 already reacted with each other in the hydrothermal reactor at 180 °C, unlike the one using NH4H2PO4 as starting materials. The reason was ascribed to two. First, H3PO4 can dissolve in both water and ethanol, the reacting in-terface was increased and hence the reaction can take place more readily in this case. The second reason was attributed to the diﬀerence in ionization ability. Both H3PO4 and NH4H2PO4 can ionize in water and the ionization processes are shown below.
Compared to NH4H2PO4,H3PO4 was easier to release H+ in water which was beneﬁcial to the hydrolysis of Ti(OC4H9)4, hence more so-luble Ti4+ can be released in the reacting system to take part to make the reaction happen readily.After calcined at 600 °C, H180 also started to crystallize into rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3, but still exhibited a relatively large amount of impurity phase of (TiO)2P2O7 (~40%), while N180 was mainly LiTi2(PO4)3 (PDF # 35-0754) with a much less trace of TiP2O7 (~10%). The fact that diﬀerent phases co-existed in H180–600 might also contribute to the inhomogeneous morphology with large and small agglomerates as shown in Fig. 2.Fourier-transform infrared spectra of H180 and N180 have been obtained between 500 cm−1 and 4000 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 4. The bands at 3378 and 1642 cm−1 correspond to stretching vibrations of OeH, which could belong to either adsorbed and coordinately bound water molecules or organic matters. The band at 2398 cm−1 corre-sponds to the vibration of H2PO4−. The band at 1400 cm−1 at H180 was thought to correspond to H2PO4− and the band at 1400 cm−1 at N180 corresponds to the bending vibrations of the NeH bond. The band at 1045 cm−1 could be related to asymmetric stretching vibrations of PO43−. The band at 2026 cm−1 was considered to be the overtones band. The band at 740 cm−1 corresponds to out-of-plane bending vi-bration of OeH. It was noticeable that the spectra of N180 have extra three bands at 1763, 820 and 606 cm−1, which corresponds to de-formation vibration of NeH bond, the vibration of NO3- and in-plane rocking vibration of NH3, respectively. These extra bands found in N180 were consistent with the XRD pattern of N180, which showed that existence of NH4NO3 and NH4H2PO4.The TG/DTG curves of H180 and N180 (see Fig.S1 in supplementary material) showed that the total weight loss (30.6%) of N180 was much greater than that (13.3%) of H180, which also indicated that starting materials involved H3PO4 already reacted with each other and have lost more weight in the hydrothermal reactor.XRD patterns of H180 and N180 calcined at diﬀerent temperatures are collected (See Fig.S2 in supplementary materials). After calcined at 500 °C, the main phase of H180 was still LiTiPO5 (PDF#44-0083). As the calcination temperature was raised to 600 °C, rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 formed with a large amount of (TiO)2P2O7 coexisted as described previously. When the calcination temperature was increased further to 700 °C and 800 °C, rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 dominated. As for N180, the XRD pattern was still largely amorphous after calcined at 500 °C, which indicated that a calcination temperature of 500 °C was not enough to induce the crystallization. When the calcination tem-perature increased above 600 °C, the rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 dominated with a small trace of TiP2O7 coexisted. Despite the fact that rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 dominated in N180–600 while a large amount of (TiO)2P2O7 coexisted with rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 in H180–600, the sintered pellets made of H180–600 exhibited slightly higher total conductivity (shown in Table 2). This result suggested that the desired phase achieved in the powders prior to pelletizing was not necessarily beneﬁcial for the enhancement of the ionic conductivity. For both H180 and N180 calcined at 700 °C and 800 °C, the diﬀraction patterns were all dominated by the rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3. Given the fact that the total conductivities of H180–700 and H180–800 were all lower than that of H180–600, that an early crystallization of a desired phase prior to pelletizing was not beneﬁcial for the migration of lithium ion was once again proved.
Given that a calcination temperature of 600 °C seemed an optimal condition, 600 °C was selected to calcine the powders and the sintering temperature was varied to investigate the eﬀect of it on the properties of samples.The impedance spectra of samples sintered at diﬀerent temperatures were measured and the RT total ionic conductivities were calculated, shown in Fig. 5. All the impedance spectra exhibited a depressed semicircle at high frequencies which was assigned to the response of grain boundaries, followed by an inclines spike in the low-frequency region which was related to electrode polarization, i.e. to blocking of the ions at the silver electrodes. The response of the grains was outside the frequency window at room temperature. All the impedance spectra were ﬁtted and the equivalent circuit was shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The peak capacitance of the grain-boundary response was in the order of 10−10 F, which correlated well with the values reported in the literatures [35,36]. The peak frequency of the grain-boundary response was in the order of 105 Hz, which was similar to the literature [37] and the calculated dielectric constant was in the range of 10−11–10−10. Since the grain semicircle was outside the frequency window, it was not possible to obtain the grain conductivity. However it was often reported in the literatures that the total resistance of the samples can be obtained from the intercept of the low-frequency semicircle or spike with the real impedance axis [38,39], the total resistance was obtained from the impedance spectra by using this method. The diﬀerence between the total resistance and the ﬁtted grain-boundary resistance was taken as the grain resistance, the grain conductivities were calculated accord-ingly. The ratio of the ﬁtted grain-boundary resistance and the total resistance was in the range of 86%–95%, which was in good agreement with the reported value, which indicated that the calculated grain re-sistances were relatively reliable.The RT total conductivity of both H-LATP and N-LATP ﬁrstly in-creased with the sintering temperature and then decreased. The RT total conductivity of H-LATP maximized at 900 °C and the RT total conductivity of N-LATP peaked at 950 °C. The maximum total con-ductivity of N-LATP was lower than that of H-LATP. To ﬁgure out the reason why the RT total conductivity of N-LATP was lower, XRD and SEM examinations were carried out. The fractured surfaces of H-LATP and N-LATP sintered at 850 °C–1050 °C were examined. For H-LATP (shown in Fig. 6), the sample sintered at 850 °C seemed quite loose and the particles were not well connected. No substantial densiﬁcation or grain growth at this temperature was observed. When the sintering temperature increased to 900 °C, the loose particles started to grow and the grains contact was much improved, forming a much denser mi-crostructure. After sintered at 950 °C and 1000 °C, the particles con-tinued to grow and the contact between grains is so tight that the grain boundary cannot be distinguished at this resolution. When subjected to 1050 °C, the morphology changed dramatically and big pores/voids started to appear in the sample, which indicated that the sample was over sintered at this temperature [40]. Unsuitable sintering conditions can cause cracking develop and therefore deteriorate ionic conduction, which has also been reported by Huper et al. [41] and Raymond [42]. Ma et al. [16] reported microcracking along grain boundaries appeared even after sintered at 880 °C. The evolution of the morphology is consistent with the relative density shown later in Fig. 8, the relative density of H-LATP started to increase from 850 °C and then started to drop after sintered at 1050 °C.The XRD patterns of H-LATP sintered at diﬀerent temperatures (see Fig.S3 in supplementary materials) can be assigned to a dominant rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 (PDF # 35-0754) with a small trace of AlPO4. The rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 did not change with the increase of the sintering temperature, but the AlPO4 phase did change from cubic phase (PDF # 31-0028) into orthorhombic phase (PDF # 11-0500) and also the relative amount to the dominant phase increased from 3.5% to 24.9% as the sintering temperature increased from 850 °C to 1050 °C, which was in agreement with the results reported by Yu et al. [25]. The signiﬁcant increase of the amount of AlPO4 in the sample sintered at 1050 °C indicated that the sample was over-sintered at this temperature just as suggested by SEM photos. As a result of the over-sintering, the rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 started to decompose as follows.
As seen in Eq. (7), gas-phased Li2O and P4O10 was released due to the decomposition of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, which would result in a porous microstructure in H-LATP sintered at 1050 °C and the amount of AlPO4 would increase. Although Thokchom and Kumar [43] claimed that the AlPO4 impurity could also be a source for the space charge mediation that forms a AlPO4: Li+ complex to support the migration of Li ions, excessive amount of AlPO4 could be detrimental to the migra-tion of lithium ions.For N-LATP (shown in Fig. 7), the morphologies of samples sintered at 850 °C and 900 °C were quite loose and the particles were not well connected, which was similar to the morphologies of H-LATP sintered at 850 °C. No substantial densiﬁcation or grain growth was observed at this stage. When the sintering temperature increased to 950 °C and 1000 °C, the particles started to grow and the contacts between parti-cles were much improved. The changes of morphology found on N-LATP were not as dramatic as H-LATP when the sintering temperature was raised to 1050 °C. Generally, N-LATP was more porous than H-LATP and the grain size was much smaller, which was ascribed to the early crystallization of powder N180 to the rhombohedral phase at the calcination stage of 600 °C (Fig. 3). An earlier formation of the rhom-bohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 observed in powder N180–600 could cause the loss of sintering driving force, thereby aﬀecting the densiﬁcation of the green pellets and leaving big pores and voids [44].
The driving force for grain growth in the solid state is given by [45]:where σgb is the average grain boundary energy, r is the radius of the growing grain and r is the mean grain radius. According to Eq. (8), the larger grain will have larger driving force for grain growth. Therefore, H180–600, which exhibited larger particles and a multi-modal particle size distribution, had larger driving force for grain growth than N180–600, which has smaller particles with a unimodal distribution. Therefore, the smaller driving force in N180–600 would result in the formation of smaller grains after sintering.The XRD patterns of N-LATP sintered at diﬀerent temperatures are collected (See Fig.S4 in supplementary materials). Both samples sin-tered at 850 °C and 900 °C presented a dominant rhombohedral phase of LiTi2(PO4)3 with a small trace of AlPO4 (51–1674) and TiP2O7 (38–1468). From 850 °C to 900 °C, the amount of TiP2O7 decreased from 5% to 1.8% and then completely disappeared after the sample sintered at 950 °C. This phase can be traced to the powder of N180–600 used for the pelletization and that is probably why it disappeared as the sintering progressed. Above 950 °C, the phases of the three samples can all be assigned to a dominant rhombohedral phase of LiTi2(PO4)3 with a small trace of AlPO4.The relative amount of AlPO4 was ~3% and did not change much as the temperature was raised to 1050 °C. This was consistent with the morphology observations which showed that the morphology of N-LATP didn't change as dramatically as H-LATP did after sintered at 1050 °C.The relative densities of H-LATP and N-LATP pellets after sintered at high temperatures are shown in Fig. 8. It was found that the relative density was initially increasing with the sintering temperatures and then reached a plateau for both H-LATP and N-LATP. The relative density of H-LATP reached as high as 96% after sintered at 900 °C and the photo of it also conﬁrmed a smooth and dense appearance. The relative density of H-LATP started to drop above 1000 °C and the SEM photos shown in Fig. 6 also exhibited a microstructure with big pores emerged at 1050 °C, indicating an over-sintering microstructure at this temperature [46–48]. Thus, the sintering temperature should be set as less than 1050 °C. Apparent pores and voids could be seen on the sur-face of N-LATP (shown in the inset of Fig. 8), which was due to the earlier crystallization of the rhombohedral phase occurred at the cal-cination stage causing the loss of the driving force for grain growth, as previously discussed.The microstructures of H-LATP sintered at 900 °C and N-LATP sin-tered at 950 °C, which both exhibited the best total conductivity at its type, were examined for comparison (Shown in Fig. 9). The morphology of H-LATP sintered at 900 °C was quite dense, while N-LATP sintered at 950 °C was very porous with big voids presented all over the surface. This observation was consistent with the measurements of relative density of the two samples. Given that the rhombohedral phase Li-Ti2(PO4)3 dominated in both H-LATP and N-LATP, the lower ionic conductivity of N-LATP was mainly ascribed to the porous morphology. The big pores and voids formed a tortuous path for lithium ions mi-gration and therefore led to increasing total resistance or decreasing total conductivity in N-LATP.The conductivity was measured at 25–125 °C and the temperature dependences of conductivity plot of ln(σ) vs.1000/T was ﬁtted and adhered a linear relationship with temperature, as shown in Fig. 10. The activation energies H-LATP and N-LATP were calculated according to the Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of the total ion transport of H-LATP was 0.21 eV, which was lower than 0.26 eV of N-LATP. The activation energy of the grain ion transport of H-LATP was 0.15 eV, which was also lower than 0.23 eV of N-LATP. But the acti-vation energy of the grain boundary ion transport of H-LATP was 0.53 eV, which was quite close to that of 0.54 eV for N-LATP.
The lower activation energy of H-LATP indicated an easier lithium migration path in H-ALTP than in N-LATP, which was consistent with the morphologies of the two samples. The activation energy of total ion transport of H-LATP obtained in this study was lower than the value reported in the literatures, which was 0.4 eV [24] and 0.3 eV [30], and the RT total ionic conductivity of H-LATP was higher than 1 × 10−4 S/cm [24] and 3.15 × 10−4 S/cm [30]. The Li+ transference number of both samples was measured and close to 1, which indicated that the samples made in this study were all ionic conductors.In summary, it can be seen that diﬀerent sources of phosphorus have greatly inﬂuenced the properties of Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 made in this study. Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 made with NH4H2PO4 (N-LATP) exhibited lower total conductivity than the one made with H3PO4 (H-LATP). The reason was attributed to that the earlier crystallization of the majority rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 (90%) formed at the calcinations stage in N-LATP caused the loss of driving force for sintering, thereby forming a porous microstructure which resulted in a tortuous path for lithium ions migration.
NASICON type lithium-ion conductor Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 were prepared via a hydrothermal-assisted solid-state route by using dif-ferent sources of phosphorus. The starting materials involving H3PO4 reacted as early as in the hydrothermal reactor at 180 °C, but not forming the desired rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 at this stage. After calcined at 600 °C, a large amount of (TiO)2P2O7 (40%) coexisted with the rhombohedral phase LiTi2(PO4)3 in H180–600. While the starting materials involving NH4H2PO4 hardly reacted with each other in the hydrothermal reactor, but started to crystallize the desired rhombohe-dral LiTi2(PO4)3, which was dominant (90%), at the calcination stage of 600 °C. After pelletized and sintered, the sintered pellet N-LATP ex-hibited lower total conductivity than the sintered pellet H-LATP gen-erally. Given the fact that the dominated crystalline phases of these two types samples could be all assigned to the rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3, the lower total conductivity of N-LATP was attributed to the lower relative density and the more porous microstructure, which originated from the loss of driving force for grain growth caused by the early crystallization of the majority rhombohedral LiTi2(PO4)3 prior to pel-letizing. The porous microstructure resulted in a tortuous path for li-thium ions migration.In summary, diﬀerent sources of phosphorous would result in dif-ferent reactions taken place in the hydrothermal reactor, thereby leading to a diﬀerent particle size distribution, relative density, crys-tallography and morphology, eventually aﬀecting the lithium ion con-duction in the pelletized samples.
