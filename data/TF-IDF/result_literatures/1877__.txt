A new iron–niobium phosphate, Fe has been prepared and studied by X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe analysis, IR spectroscopy, and neutron powder diffraction. On the basis of X-ray powder data, it was found that the synthesized phosphate crystallizes into the sp. gr.   and corresponds to the structural type of sodium–zirconium phosphate NaZr . The structure was reﬁned by the Rietveld method ) (PO 4 2 3 based on a powder neutron diffraction experiment. The obtained phosphate belongs to complex niobium orthophosphates and has a framework structure with a zero framework charge.
The series of known phosphates with the composiT a' T b''  can be expanded by synthesizing new tion  (PO ) 3 4 compounds.  This  problem  is  of  interest,  since  such compounds  serve  as  a  basis  for  promising  materials with good thermal–mechanical characteristics, in particular low and ultralow thermal expansion.
In this paper, we report the results of studying a new representative of the above series: iron–niobium phos. The aim was to synthesize and phate Fe characterize  this  compound  crystallochemically,  as well as reﬁne its structure by neutron powder diffraction analysis.
The  iron–niobium  phosphate  was  synthesized  as follows. Stoichiometric amounts of aqueous solutions of  ferric  chloride  (III)  and  niobium  ﬂuoride  complex (V) were merged at room temperature; then, under continuous stirring, phosphoric acid was slowly added in an amount calculated from the reaction stoichiometry; C for and, after that, the mixture was evaporated at 80 24  h. The  powder  formed  was  successively  heated  at 200 C (1 day),  1000 C  (8  h),  alternating heating with grinding.
The sample obtained was a light brown powder. The elemental  composition  of  the  sample  determined  by microprobe  analysis  corresponded  to  the  formula Fe0.58Nb1.54P3O12; i.e., it was similar to the calculated composition.
The X-ray diffraction data indicate that the crystallization occurs at 800 176) C; a further increase in temperature increases the sample crystallinity. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample (Fig. 1) exhibits a set of reﬂections indexed in the sp. gr.  , which suggests that the obtained phosphate belongs to the NZP structural type. Along with the reﬂections of the main trigonal phase, the diffraction pattern also contains reﬂections of niobium oxophosphate NbOPO4 (JCPDF 731609) and iron phosphate FePO4 (JCPDF 84-0876) (the maximum  intensity  of  the  impurity  lines  of  niobium oxophosphate  was  15%).  A  change  in  the  synthesis conditions and the calcination temperature almost did not affect the contents of the noted impurity phases.
The IR spectrum of the synthesized sample (Fig. 2) is characterized by a set of absorption bands typical of the framework of NZP-type orthophosphates: bands in the  range  1200–850  cm–1,  which  are  due  to  valence oscillations of phosphor tetrahedra, and a set of bands related to bending vibrations in the range 635–400 cm–1. The  appearance  of  the  high-frequency  strong  band  at 1185 cm–1, which is not characteristic of phosphates, is explained by the contribution of a small, highly charged Nb5+ ion to the P–O bond. The shoulder at 850 cm–1 is due to oscillations of the Nb–O bond.
The  structure  of  the  iron–niobium  phosphate  was  using the structural charreﬁned within the sp. gr.  acteristics of titanium–niobium phosphate TiNb(PO4)3 as starting points [8]. The calculation parameters also included  the  structural  data  on  NbOPO4  [12],  which were reﬁned during the calculation.
The  unit-cell  parameters  and  the  results  of  the reﬁnement of the crystal structure of Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 are listed in Table 1. The experimental and theoretical proﬁles of the neutron diffraction pattern of the sample under  study  and  the  difference  curve  (experiment minus  calculation),  as  normalized  to  the  root-mean square deviation at a point, are shown in Fig. 3. The calculated  positional  and  thermal  parameters  of Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 are listed in Table 2 (for niobium oxophosphate, in Table 3). The corresponding interatomic distances and bond angles for iron–niobium phosphate are listed in Table 4. It is noteworthy that the reﬁned structural  parameters  of  NbOPO4  are  in  good  agreement with the data of [12].
A  fragment  of  the  structure  of  Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 phosphate  constructed  based  on  the  obtained  data (Table 2) is shown in Fig. 4. This structure is based on a three-dimensional mixed framework with the general formula Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3 composed of discrete polyhedra:  octahedra  TO6  (in  the  case  under  consideration, (Fe/Nb)O6)  and  phosphate  tetrahedra  PO4.  The  discreteness  of  two  kinds  of  Pauling  polyhedra  follows, according to [14], from the ratio T : P = 2 : 3. Iron and niobium cations are located at the   axes and are statistically distributed over the 12-fold position (00z), being coordinated by six oxygen atoms.
A  dimer  group  {T2(PO4)3},  which  consists  of  two octahedra linked by three bridge tetrahedra, is a characteristic fragment of the framework of such a type. The presence of this group is typical of a large number of framework  orthophosphates  with  NASICON-type structure  [15,  16].  The  aforementioned  groups  are located  at  the    axis;  they  form  a  three-dimensional bond by sharing the terminal oxygen atoms of neighboring  dimers.  Thus,  the  formed  three-dimensional mixed  framework  [Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3]  involves  all  the cations of the structure.
The bond lengths in the coordination polyhedra of the  Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3  phosphate  and  its  analogue TiNb(PO4)3 are rather similar. In Fe0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3, they are equal to 1.93–2.01 Å in (Fe/Nb)O6 octahedra (1.92– 1.97 Å in TiNb(PO4)3) and 1.46–1.57 Å in PO4 tetrahedra (1.48–1.56 Å in TiNb(PO4)3). However, it should be noted  that  distortions  of  phosphate  tetrahedra  in  the compound under study are much larger in comparison with the analogue. Speciﬁcally, we observed larger distortions  of  the  bond  angles  O–P–O  (99.2¡–110.4¡  in comparison with 106.3¡–107.4¡ in TiNb(PO4)3) and a larger spread in the values of interatomic distances PO (0.11 and 0.07 Å, respectively).
