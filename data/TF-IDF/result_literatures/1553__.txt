LiCoPO4 thin films were deposited on Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP) solid electrolyte by radio frequency magnetron sputtering and were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. The films show a (1 1 1) preferred orientation upon annealing and are chemically stable with LATSP up to 600 ◦C in air. An all-solid-state Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCoPO4/Au cell was fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance and Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients, ˜DLi, of the LiCoPO4 thin films. The potential dependence of ˜DLi values of the LiCoPO4 thin film was investigated by potentiostatic intermittent titration technique and was compared with those of the LiFePO4 thin film. These results showed that the intercalation mechanism of Li-ion in LiCoPO4 is different from that in LiFePO4.

Since pioneered by Amine et al. [1], olivine-type lithium cobalt phosphate, LiCoPO4, has received great interest as a candidate cathode material for Li-ion batteries due to its high electrode potential of 4.8. V vs. Li/Li+ and it can be easily synthesized in air. LiFePO4 only gives a 3.5 V electrode potential vs. Li/Li+ and must be synthesized in an inert atmosphere even though both belong to the olivinetype family [2,3]. The reported discharge capacity of LiCoPO4 was less than 136 mA h g−1 [4,5], which is lower than the theoretical value of 167 mA h g−1. It seems that the low discharge capacity of LiCoPO4 can be attributed to its low electronic conductivity of around 10−10 to 10−9 S c m−1 [6,7]. Although the electronic conductivity can be significantly increased by introducing a second phase Co2P by heat treating LiCoPO4 in Ar, the discharge capacity of LiCoPO4 is still unsatisfactory [6,8–10]. The discharge capacity of LiFePO4 almost reached its theoretical value when measured in a quasi-open-circuit mode. As a result, the discharge capacity of LiCoPO4 should not be simply controlled by its electronic conductivity. As is generally accepted, the poor rate capability of LiFePO4 is partly due to the slow diffusion through the LiFePO4/FePO4 twophase interface. Similarly, a two-phase model was also suggested by Bramnik et al. [1 1,12] using in situ and ex situ XRD to explain the Li extraction/insertion mechanism in LiCoPO4. However, the XRD results showed that the crystalline phase was only a lithiumpoor phase; no “CoPO4” phase was identified even though LiCoPO4 was fully charged. In addition, two successive voltage plateaus were often observed during the charge of LiCoPO4 [5,1 1–14]. Nakayama et al. [13] proved that it was not related to the irreversible side reactions and suggested that it might be due to an increase in electrochemical polarization around x = 0.3 in Li1−xCoPO4. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism for the two-plateau charge profile is still controversial, and in other cases, a one-plateau charge profile was reported [15–17]. LiFePO4 exhibits only one-plateau charge profile in the two-phase region. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the different electrochemical behavior can be ascribed to the different Li-ion diffusion character. In our present work, LiCoPO4 thin films were prepared by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering on Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (LATSP) solid electrolyte. Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients were measured by potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT) using the all-solid-state Li/PEO18-Li (CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCoPO4/Au cell. Eftekhari [16] showed that the ˜DLi values of LiCoPO4 depended on the electrolyte used. The author also pointed out that the ˜DLi values measured at high voltages were not reliable due to the decomposition of the electrolyte. The LATSP used in our case is electrochemically stable at the high voltage. Therefore, the ˜DLi values at high voltages are reliable when LATSP is used. The ˜DLi values of LiCoPO4 were compared with those of LiFePO4 to clarify the different Li-ion diffusion behaviors between LiCoPO4 and LiFePO4.

The glass ceramics plates, Li1+x+yAlxTi2−xSiyP3−yO12 (0.15 mm in thickness), provided by OHARA Inc., were used as the solid electrolyte for the following experiments. LATSP was selected as the solid electrolyte because of its high Li-ion conductivity at room temperature [18,19]. LiCoPO4 was prepared by the twostep solid-phase reactions using stoichiometric amount of Li2CO3, Co(OCOCH3)2·4H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 as the starting materials. The mixture was pressed into pellets and heated at 400 ◦C f o r 5 h. The reaction product was then ground and pressed again into pellets and headed at 800 ◦C for 24 h. The LiCoPO4 thin films (8 mm × 8 mm) were deposited on the LATSP substrates (10 mm × 10 mm) by RF magnetron sputtering using an Ulvac SCOTT-C3. The target (50 mm in diameter) used for sputtering was prepared by cold pressing LiCoPO4 powder. LiCoPO4 sputtering was carried out for 2 h in pure Ar with a working pressure of 2 Pa. The power used for LiCoPO4 sputtering was 50 W, and the distance between the substrate and the target was 10 cm. Au was then deposited on the LiCoPO4 by RF magnetron sputtering in pure Ar for 30 min as a current collector to form a LATSP/LiCoPO4/Au electrode. The as-prepared electrodes were then annealed for 1 h in air to improve crystallization. The structure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RINT2000/PC diffractometer with Cu K? radiation. The cross-sectional morphology of the films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Hitachi S-4000. An Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiCoPO4/Au cell was fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance and Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients of the LiCoPO4 thin film. To prevent the reaction between Li and LATSP, a polyethyleneoxide (PEO)-based solid polymer film, PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N, was inserted between them. The polymer electrolyte was prepared by our previously reported method [20]. Galvanostatic cycling of the cells was carried out at a current density of 1 ?A between 3.5 and 5 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed between 3.5 and 5.1 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface. For the PITT measurements, a potential step of 10 mV was applied and the current was recorded as a function of time. The procedure was repeated between 4.7 and 5 V. In this work, PITT method was chosen because it is a useful tool even for the electrode reactions involving a two-phase process [21]. All the electrochemical measurements were performed at 50 ◦C. The electrochemical behavior of LiCoPO4 was compared with that of LiFePO4. The LiFePO4 powder was prepared by solid-phase reactions of stoichiometric Li2CO3, F e C2O4·2H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 at 700 ◦C for 6 h in an Ar/H2 mixture (2% H2). The LiFePO4 thin films were sputtered under the same conditions as LiCoPO4 and were annealed for 1 h in the Ar/H2 mixture (2% H2). An Li/PEO18-Li(CF3SO2)2N/LATSP/LiFePO4/Au cell was also fabricated to investigate the electrochemical performance and Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients in the LiFePO4 thin films. Galvanostatic cycling of the cells was carried out at 1 ?A between 2.8 and 4.1 V. CV was performed between 2.8 and 4.1 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. PITT measurements were conducted between 3.4 and 3.7 V with a 10 mV potential step. All the electrochemical measurements were also performed at 50 ◦C.

The as-deposited film by sputtering is generally in an amorphous state. The film was annealed to improve the crystallization. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the chemical stability between the sputtered film and the LATSP solid electrolyte during the heat treatment. Previous studies showed that some electrode materials, such as the LiMn2O4 thin film (up to 600 ◦C) [22], the Li4Ti5O12 thin film (up to 600 ◦C) [23], the Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and LiCoPO4 powders (up to 900–1000 ◦C) [5], showed chemical stability toward NASICON-type solid electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 1, the LiCoPO4 thin film shows a sharp peak at 2? = 25.5◦ by annealing at 600 ◦C in air, which is indexed to the (1 1 1) diffraction peak of LiCoPO4. The LiCoPO4 thin film deposited on LATSP exhibits a (1 1 1) preferred orientation upon annealing. The LiCoPO4 thin film was also sputtered on Au substrate for comparison. The LiCoPO4 thin film on Au, which was sputtered under the same conditions and annealed at 600 ◦C, shows similar XRD patterns as the LiCoPO4 powder. It suggests that the orientation of the LiCoPO4 thin film depends on the substrate used. When annealed at 700 ◦C, the peak becomes broad and is slightly shifted to a high angle, indicating some interfacial reactions take place between LiCoPO4 and LATSP. At 800 ◦C, a new peak at around 2? = 1 9◦ appears, suggesting that the interfacial reactions become significant at elevated temperature. The new peak is suggested to be (0 0 3) peak of LiCoO2. The LATSP/LiCoPO4/Au electrodes annealed at 600 ◦C were used in the following electrochemical experiments. The interfacial stability between LiFePO4 and LATSP upon annealing in the Ar/H2 mixture (2% H2) was also checked. As shown in Fig. 2,the LiFePO4 film is chemically stable toward LATSP up to 550 ◦C. At 600 ◦C, some unknown peaks appear, indicating chemical reactions take place between LiFePO4 and LATSP. Thus, we used the LATSP/LiFePO4/Au electrodes annealed at 550 ◦C in the following electrochemical experiments. Fig. 3 shows the cross-section SEM image of the LiCoPO4 thin film sputtered on the LATSP followed by heating at 600 ◦C for 1 h. Note that the film is dense and the thickness is estimated to be about 0.7 ?m. The relative density of the film was estimated to be about 80% by the weight gain and the density of the LiCoPO4. Fig. 4(a) shows the charge and discharge profiles of the LiCoPO4 thin film for the first three cycles. It is clear that the film exhibits different charge profiles between the first and following cycles; the first charge curves give only a plateau at around 4.9 V vs. Li/Li+, while the second and the third ones give two successive plateaus at around 4.8 and 4.9 V, respectively. Similar behavior was observed by Nagata et al. [5] and Bramnik et al. [12], where the composite electrodes composed of LiCoPO4, acetylene black and polymer binder were used. The structural rearrangement in LiCoPO4 may take place during the first charge process of the LiCoPO4 thin film. Note that only a sloping line can be observed between 4.6 and 4.9 V during the discharge process, indicating that the mechanisms for Li-ion re-insertion into “CoPO4” and extraction from LiCoPO4 are different. Fig. 4(b) shows the CV plots of the cycled LiCoPO4 thin film. Note that in addition to an obvious peak at 4.95 V, a small shoulder at around 4.8 V is observed as indicated by the arrow. The small shoulder corresponds to the first charge plateau in Fig. 4(a). The asymmetry between the cathodic and anodic CV plots implies that the Li-ion diffusion in LiCoPO4 thin film obeys a different mechanism between charge and discharge processes. In contrast, both the charge–discharge curves and the CV plots of the LiFePO4 thin film show that the process of Li-ion extraction and re-insertion is reversible as shown in Fig. 5, even though the charge and discharge plateaus are not well developed due to the large interfacial resistance between LiFePO4 and LATSP caused by annealing. The Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients, ˜DLi, in the LiCoPO4 thin film are measured with the help of PITT [21] method, in order to clarify the different electrochemical behaviors between LiCoPO4 and LiFePO4. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5(a), the voltage exhibits a sloping profile with time rather than a flat plateau expected for the typical charge–discharge curves of LiFePO4 and LiCoPO4. Therefore, we measured the chemical diffusion coefficients at a wide potential region for both the films. Fig. 6 shows the ˜DLi values as a function of the electrode potentials for the LiCoPO4 thin films measured by PITT. For the LiCoPO4 thin film cycled for three times between 3.5 and 5 V, the ˜DLi value decreases monotonously from 7 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 at 4.71 V to 6 × 10−14 cm2 s−1 at 5 V. The Fig. 7. Comparison of Li-ion chemical diffusion coefficients in the cycled LiCoPO4 and the cycled LiFePO4 thin films by PITT. decrease of ˜DLi value with the increasing electrode potentials means that the Li-ion diffusion is hindered by extracting Li-ion from LiCoPO4, which can explain the relatively low capacity of LiCoPO4. Theoretical calculation by first-principle method also showed that Li-ion diffusion coefficients in LiCoPO4 is 4 orders higher than in “CoPO4” [24]. Fig. 7 compares the ˜DLi values vs. voltage curves between the cycled LiCoPO4 and the cycled LiFePO4 thin films. The ˜DLi values of LiCoPO4 decrease monotonously between 4.7 and 5.0 V even though they are higher than those of LiFePO4. By contrast, the ˜DLi values of the LiFePO4 thin film show slight change with cell voltage in the voltage range 3.5–3.7 V. These chemical diffusion results suggest that the lithium extraction mechanism in LiCoPO4 is different from that in LiFePO4; that is, Li1−xCoPO4 has multiphases, contrasted to two phases of LiFePO4 and FePO4.

LiCoPO4 thin films were deposited on the LATSP electrolyte. The films show a (1 1 1) preferred orientation upon annealing and are chemically stable with LATSP up to 600 ◦C. The chemical diffusion coefficients of LiCoPO4 were determined by PITT and were compared with those of LiFePO4 on the LATSP. The ˜DLi value of cycled LiCoPO4 decreases from 7 × 10−13 cm2 s−1 at 4.71 V to 6 × 10−14 cm2 s−1 at 5 V upon charging. On the other hand, the ˜DLi value of LiFePO4 showed no significant dependence on the cell voltage in the range 3.5–3.7 V vs. Li/Li+. We could conclude that the Li-ion de-intercalation mechanism in LiCoPO4 is different from that in LiFePO4.
