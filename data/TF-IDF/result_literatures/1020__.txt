In our study, various fast lithium-ion conductors of composition Li1+ xAlxGe2 − xP3O12 (LAGP, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) have been synthesized following a sol–gel process with subsequent annealing. For the annealed, crystallized samples, the subtle structural changes upon exchange of Ge4+ for Al3+ and Li+ in LiGe2P3O12 were followed employing Xray diffraction and solid-state NMR. Among the samples studied, Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6P3O12 (x = 0.4) shows the highest Li mobility at room temperature with an activation energy of approx. 30 kJ mol−1. Employing heteronuclear dipolar NMR techniques, i.e., 27Al{31P}-REDOR NMR and 31P{27Al}-REAPDOR NMR, allowed us to clearly assign the different 31P-MAS-NMR signals to P(OAl)n(OGe)4 − n species with 0 ≤ n ≤ 3 and to show that the tetrahedrally coordinated Al is incorporated in an extra AlPO4 phase, thus not participating in the NASICON structure. For Alrich samples with x ≥ 0.7, apart from crystalline impurity phases such as AlPO4, Li4P2O7 and GeO2, an additional phase Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 is observed, which replaces the LAGP phase as the dominant phase for x N 1.0, giving rise to a compositional limit of Al content as x ≈ 0.6 in LAGP by the sol–gel route. In addition, the effect of the annealing temperature on the nature of the resulting phases was examined.

The advancement of electrically powered vehicle marks an important ingredient to the quest to reduce the CO2 emission with all its impacts on the environment. As a consequence, immense work has been devoted to the development of high energy all solid-state Li batteries. In particular, the Li/air or Li/sulfur rechargeable batteries with their exceptional speciﬁc energy density of 11140 Wh kg−1 and 2600 Wh kg−1, respectively, may evolve as the most promising next generation battery system [1,2]. For the electrolyte, which carries the Li-ions between the anode and the cathode, a material with a decent chemical inertness, large electrochemical window, good ionic conductivity is needed.

Among the various classes of solid materials such as polymer electrolytes, glasses, crystalline materials or glass ceramics, especially the latter holds considerable promise, combining facile ion transport via vacancies and a large compositional freedom. In particular, lithiumtitanium phosphates (LiTi2P3O12) and lithium-germanium phosphates (LiGe2P3O12), in which a fraction of the Ti4+ or Ge4+ is being replaced by Al3+ (or other trivalent cations) and Li+, show exceptional ionic conductivities. Aono et al. [3] reported a detailed framework study of Li1+ xAxM2 −x(PO4)3 (A = Al, Sc, Y; M = Ti4+, Ge4+, Ta4+). Subsequently, Li1+ xTi2 − xAlxP3O12 (LTAP) was prepared from a conventional solid-state reaction, exhibiting an ionic conductivity as high as 7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C [4]. The ionic conductivity could then successively be improved [5–12] to 5.08 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 27 °C for Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP, x = 0.5) glass ceramic, synthesized via the melt-quenching technique [7]. In the next years, Ohara Co., Japan, provided a Lithium-Ion Conducting Glass-Ceramic LICGCTM (Li1+ x + yAlxTi2 − xSiyP3 − yO12) for use as membranes for a water stable electrode [8] to the market. The inﬂuence of additional B2O3 in Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5 (PO4)3 (LAGP, x = 0.5) was examined by Chan-Jin Park et al. [12] and a total conductivity of 6.9 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C was achieved. Studies about sol–gel-derived LAGP have appeared to a much lesser extent. Zhang et al. [16] reported an ionic conductivity of 1.22 × 10−3 cm−1 for sol–gel processed Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6P3O12 at room temperature. Fabry [20] found an upper limit for Al incorporation of x = 0.6 with the formation of additional phases such as Li4P2O7, AlPO4 and GeO2. Although a number of electrical characterization and XRD analysis have appeared in previous studies, the subtle local structural changes upon the aliovalent doping and the concomitant changes in the dynamics behavior of the Li-ions has only been a subject of few studies [13–15]. The knowledge of the detailed structural features including the distribution of Al and Li among the various possible sites within the LAGP structure, however, presents a mandatory prerequisite for any controlled optimization of the material's performance. One of the most important open questions is the destination and distribution of the trivalent cations (Al3+) and the excess Li cations within the NASICON structure. Being inherently element-selective and local, solid-state NMR spectroscopy has especially emerged as a rather powerful technique for the investigation of structural motifs on short and intermediate length scales. The short range order (1–2 Å) can be successfully analysed employing magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy, aiding in the identiﬁcation and assignment of the local phosphate and aluminate polyhedra. the intermediate range order (2–8 Å)—hence allowing for an unequivocal assignment of P-O-Al connectivity—may be obtained via an exploration of the heteronuclear dipolar coupling between 31P and 27Al, which scales with the inverse cube of the internuclear distance. Here, one can tap from a large inventory of solid-state NMR strategies to quantitatively determine heteronuclear dipolar couplings and to analyse these with respect to the spatial distribution of a given chemical species and connectivity patterns. Moreover, solid-state NMR enables the identiﬁcation of amorphous phases and the analysis of dynamics, which normally escapes detection by XRD methods.

Very recently, Schröder et al. [15] published a detailed solid-state NMR study on the glass to crystal transition of melt quench-derived LAGP samples with x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. Applying dipolar based advanced NMR techniques, the nature of the various phosphate species present—P(OAl)n(OGe)4 − n with 0 ≤ n ≤ 4—could be speciﬁed. In addition, these authors found that Al is exclusively found on the Ge positions of the LAGP structure, the AlO4 signal found for x ≥ 0.5 could be traced back to the presence of AlPO4.

In this contribution, we present the results of an analysis of sol–gelderived LAGP glass ceramics Li1+ xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 for the extended compositional range 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1.2. Special attention is paid to the compositional dependent emergence of the various identiﬁed phases and the maximum amount of Al/Li which can be incorporated into the LAGP structure. In addition, the effect of the annealing temperature on the ﬁnal structure is addressed.

The LAGP powder was synthesized by a sol–gel method with citric acid [11, 16]. Stoichiometric amounts of Ge(OC2H5)4 (Aldrich) were dissolved in a 0.22 M aqueous solution of citric acid (100 ml), heated and stirred at 80 °C for 30 min. Then stoichiometric amounts of chemical grade Li2CO3, Al(NO3)3•9H2O and NH4H2PO4 were added, dissolved and stirred at the same temperature for 15 min until a transparent homogeneous solution was obtained. During this period, a small amount of distilled water was added, to keep the ﬁnal concentrations of: citric acid = 0.22 M, Li++Al3++Ge4+ = 0.1 M. After that, ethylene glycol with a molar ratio of citric acid at 1:1 was added and the mixed solution was heated continuously stirring at 80 °C for nearly 150 min to promote the sol–gel process, until the volume changed from 100 ml to 25 ml. The concentrated solution was transferred to a dish and heated up to 170 °C with 1 °C/min for 16 h to evaporate the water and obtain the polymer precursor. The dried gel was transferred to a ceramic crucible, heated up to 500 °C for 4 h with 5 °C/min to complete the pyrolysis process. The resulting powder was then uniformly ground and calcined in open air at 800 °C for 5 h to obtain the ﬁnal material. To monitor the effect of annealing on the obtained powders, some portions of the obtained LAGP powder were annealed again at various temperatures from 750 °C to 950 °C.

LAGP powders were characterized using laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (HUBER Imaging Plate Guinier Camera G670) operated in the 2θ range from 10° to 100° with Cu Kα radiation at room temperature. The Jade cell reﬁnement program was adopted to obtain the lattice parameters for various LAGP samples.

Liand 31P-MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III 300 MHz spectrometer employing a 4-mm MAS probe. Corresponding resonance frequencies were 116.5 and 121.4 MHz for 7Li and 31P, with pulse lengths of 3 μs for 7Li and 2.5-4.1 μs for 31P, respectively. Recycle delays of 120 s and 20–40 s were used. 6Liand 27Al-MAS-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 500 MHz spectrometer with a 5-mm MAS probe. Corresponding resonance frequencies were 73.5 and 130.2 MHz, with pulse lengths of 5.2 μs for 6Li and 1.5 μs for 27Al; related recycle delays were selected at 100 s and 5 s. All measurements were performed at MAS spinning frequencies of 10 kHz; chemical shifts are referenced relative to aqueous solutions of LiCl (1.0 M and 9.7 M), Al(NO3)3 (1.1 M) and concentrated H3PO4 (80 wt.%). Static 7Li-NMR spectra at room temperature were acquired employing a home-built high throughput solidstate NMR probe, as described in ref. [17]. The temperature-dependent static 7Li-NMR spectra were obtained on the Bruker Advance III 300 MHz spectrometer in the temperature range 160 K ≤ T ≤ 360 K. For the 27Al{31P}-Rotational Echo Double Resonance (REDOR) [26] and 31P{27Al}-Rotational Echo Adiabatic Passage Double Resonance (REAPDOR) [27] experiments, performed on the Bruker Avance III system, typical pulse lengths of 9.5 μs (27Al; νRF = 52.6 kHz) and 8.2 μs (31P; νRF = 61 kHz) were used in REDOR, the dephasing pulse in the REAPDOR experiments was set to one third of the rotor period as 33 μs.

The structural changes upon Al incorporation into LAGP were followed employing XRD and solid-state NMR techniques. The XRD patterns of the LAGP samples Li1+ xAlxGe2 − xP3O12 with (0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1.5) and sample Li1+ xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 (x = 0.7) annealed at various temperatures (750 °C −950 °C) are collected in Fig. 1. For all samples with x ≤ 1.0, the most intense XRD peaks can be assigned to the LAGP phase with a NASICON-type structure (LGP, PDF #80-1924). With increasing Al content, some additional reﬂexes arise, indicating the presence of impurity phases. The diffraction peaks in the 2θ range of approx. 20°–35°can be assigned to AlPO4 (PDF #48-0652). The trace peak at around 2θ = 26° is ascribed to GeO2 (PDF #83-2474), as reported by Losilla [14] and Kun [21]. The peak at 2θ = 21° which is observable for samples with x ≥ 0.7, may be assigned to either Li2O, as reported by Xu et al. [23] and Thokchom et al. [7] or to Li4P2O7 (PDF #77-1045). This issue was solved employing 7Li and 31P MAS-NMR (vide infra), in favor of Li4P2O7. However, these impurities are only present in a rather marginal amount for samples with x ≤ 0.7. At x N 1.0, a new crystalline phase with its most intense peak at 2θ = 13° is becoming the dominant phase. This peak is not observed in melt-quenched samples [10] and has been assigned to AlPO4 in sol–ge-derived samples [16]. However, from the XRD pattern for the x = 1.5 sample, the new dominant phase can safely be identiﬁed as Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (PDF #52-1463), which is replacing LAGP as the dominant phase for x ≥ 1.2. As obvious from Fig. 1b, the relative amount of this phase is decreasing with increasing annealing temperature. The lattice constants for LAGP were obtained employing the Jade cell reﬁnement program and the reﬁned crystallographic parameters, lattice constants a, c and volume V of LAGP as a function of the Al content 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1.0 are summarized in Fig. 2. Compared to the lattice parameters of Al-free LiGe2(PO4) (PDF #80-1924), the cell parameters change in Li1+ xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 as Ge4+ is subsequently substituted by Al3+ and Li+. Whereas the cell constant a only exhibits marginal changes, c shows a considerable increase for 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.6, followed by a further but slight increase for 0.6 ≤ x ≤ 1.0. The results for x ≤ 0.6 are in line with the ﬁndings by Fabry [20] and Zhang [16]. The only slight increase in the cell parameter c for x ≥ 0.6 indicates that the value x = 0.6 marks the maximum amount of Al which can be incorporated into the LAGP structure. The average particle size for the sol–gel samples studied in this work (50– 60 nm) is found to be signiﬁcantly smaller than that for meltquenched samples (150–250 nm) [21].

The results of the XRD study are corroborated by complementary solid-state NMR experiments. While XRD allows to follow the overall structural changes upon Al incorporation, NMR enables the detailed elucidation of changes in the local structural features. The 27Al-MAS-NMR spectra for Li1+ xAlxGe2 − xP3O12 with 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1.2 are compiled in Fig. 3a, top. The spectra are composed of three components: marked as C (−13 ppm), V (−11 ppm) and A (39 ppm). Components C and V correspond to six-coordinated aluminum species, while component A represents Al in AlO4 environments. For x ≤ 0.7, signal C marks the dominant signal. A typical deconvolution of the 27Al-MAS-NMR spectra for LAGP (x = 0.8) is shown in Fig. 3b, bottom, the corresponding results are summarized in Table 1a. Based on the results of the XRD study we assign signal C to Al within the LAGP structure (situated on the Ge positions) and signal A to Al in AlPO4. We note, that, according to Losilla et al. [14], a fraction of the tetrahedrally Al may have entered the (tetrahedral) P sites of the LAGP structure. This may be checked with the help of an 27Al{31P}-REDOR experiment. Principally, in a REDOR experiment, the heteronuclear dipolar coupling between two nuclei I (31P) and S (27Al) is measured. The results from a rotor-synchronized spin-echo experiment for the observed (S) nuclei, deﬁning the full echo intensity S0, are compared to spectra resulting from an experiment in which the heteronuclear dipolar coupling between nuclei S and I has been reintroduced by the action of rotor-synchronized I-channel π-pulses. For more in depth information about REDOR and REAPDOR, the reader is referred to the literature [26,27]. Owing to the inverse cubic distance dependence of the dipolar coupling, the evaluation of the dipolar coupling strengths allows to assess the local Al coordination, i.e., an estimation of the number of 31P neighbors (connected via an oxygen linkage) and the involved 27Al–31P internuclear distances becomes possible from an analysis of the dipolar evolution curves. From the REDOR analysis (cf. Fig. 4), we obtain effective dipolar coupling strengths of 660 Hz (AlO4) and 800 Hz (AlO6). Assuming dipolar coupling strengths of 330 Hz (corresponding to a P · · · Al distance of 3.3 Å), these values translate to 4 and 6 phosphorous neighbors for the tetrahedral and octahedral Al. Since tetrahedrally coordinated Al within the NASICON structure would replace phosphorous and thus would not exhibit any direct Al-O-P linkages, producing rather low 27Al-31P dipolar coupling strengths, the presented REDOR results clearly show that the tetrahedrally coordinated Al is not incorporated into the NASICON structure. Moreover, the observed coordination to 4 P neighbors corroborates the assignment given above. These results are in decent agreement with the results obtained by Schröder et al. on samples prepared from melt-quenched-derived glasses [15]. Signal V, whose relative intensity is increasing with increasing x, may be assigned to the octahedrally coordinated Al present in Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2.

Thus, in agreement with the results from XRD, the data indicate a maximum value of x = 0.6 for Al to be incorporated within the LAGP structure. Excess Al will be consumed for the formation of AlPO4 and Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2. This may be expressed by a reaction (for x ≥ 0.7) according to (ignoring the minor amounts of Li4P2O7, GeO2 and Ge incorporated within the Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2).

Complementary 31P-MAS-NMR spectra allow for a direct observation of Al incorporation into LAGP and offer the chance to obtain more information about the additional identiﬁed phases. The corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 5a, top. Although only a single 31P signal at δiso = −42 ppm is observed for x = 0, representing 31P nuclei with 4 Ge neighbors in the second coordination sphere (P(OGe)4), additional signals, shifted downﬁeld with respect to the P(OGe)4 signal, can be identiﬁed for samples with x N 0. As much as 15 different lines can be identiﬁed in the spectra, the assignment of which will be given below. An unambiguous deconvolution of the spectra is possible employing the DMFIT software [19]. As a typical example, the results of the deconvolution of the spectrum for the sample with x = 0.8 are shown in Fig. 5b, bottom. The identiﬁed lines can be grouped as follows: The ﬁrst group includes the signals P0–P4 in the range of −25 ppm to −43 ppm, which can be assigned to phosphorous atoms within the NASICON structure. In accordance with the evolution of the intensities of these lines with increasing x, the lines are assigned to P(OGe)4(OAl)4 − n units with the signal around −36 ppm representing P(OGe)3(OAl) and the most downﬁeld shifted signal around −22 ppm P(OAl)4 species. Signals in the chemical shift range −13 ppm b δiso b −21 ppm are assigned to phosphorous atoms within Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (V1–V6). Here, the two signals at −13.1 ppm and −14.9 ppm (V1 and V2, with relative ratio of 1: 3, in agreement with the crystal structure) represent the phosphate and pyrophosphate moieties in pure Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2, whereas the four upﬁeld shifted signals can be assigned to the PO4 and P2O7 units in Li9 − yAl3 −yGey(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (with 0 ≤ y ≤ 2) as suggested by the results of a 31P{27Al}-REAPDOR experiment (data not shown). The remaining signals with only marginal intensity are indicative of the crystalline impurity phases AlPO4 (A, ca. −28 ppm) and Li4P2O7 (P′ and P″, −3.3 and −6.5 ppm). The detailed results of the deconvolution are summarized in Table 2. The assignment of the signals P0–P4 to P(OAl)n(OGe)4 − n was independently checked with the help of 31P{27Al}-REAPDOR NMR. In REAPDOR, a variation of REDOR, the I-channel π-pulse is replaced by a long pulse of one third of a rotor period, which enhances the dephasing efﬁciency, if the I nucleus is a quadrupolar nucleus [27,28]. Thus, from an analysis of the dipolar evolution curves, we are able to assess the local P coordination within the NASICON phase. Again, the data for the samples with x = 0.8 are shown as an example. The corresponding data for the signals P0 to P3 are collected in Fig. 6. The initial slope of the evolution curves clearly increases in the series P0 b P1 b P2 b P3. Since the dipolar coupling strength scales with the initial slope of the evolution curves, the data clearly corroborate the assignment of the signals as given above. A more quantitative evaluation is possible employing the SIMPSON software package [18]. Since the exact spin geometry and the distribution of the dipolar and quadrupolar interaction parameters are unknown, the data were analyzed employing a two-spin approximation, restricting the analysis to the initial part of the evolution curves [24,25]. The individual dipolar coupling constants between the involved nuclei 31P and 27Al are calculated according to Dind ¼ , with n denoting the number of 31P nuclei interacting with 27Al and D2spin the dipolar coupling as obtained from the two-spin approximation. The effective dipolar coupling strengths increases in the series P0 b P1 b P2 b P3 b P4, thus clearly corroborating the assignments given above. The obtained effective dipolar couplings of 330 Hz, 460 Hz and 570 Hz for P1, P2 and P3 translate into P-O-Al distances of 3.3 Å, in reasonable agreement with the expected P · · · Al distance in LAGP and with the results by Schröder et al. [15] obtained on melt-quenched-derived samples. Thus, combining XRD and advanced solid-state NMR methodology, it has been possible to elucidate the subtle structural changes in LAGP upon substitution of Ge for Al. For x ≤ 0.5, LAGP is virtually the only phase present. For the samples with x ≥ 0.6, additional phases (AlPO4, Li4P2O7 and Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2) can be observed. The amount of Al incorporated into LAGP, xr, can be calculated from a deconvolution of the 31P-MAS-NMR spectra. 

These values are collected in Table 3a. The distribution of Al and Li among the various phases was independently checked from a deconvolution of the 27Al-MAS-NMR and static 7Li-NMR spectra (cf. Table 1), the results of which were found to be in reasonable agreement to those obtained from a deconvolution of the 31P-MAS-NMR spectra as described above. In principle, a deconvolution of the 31P-MAS-NMR spectra for the Al-rich phases would also allow for a evaluation of the distribution of Ge upon LAGP, GeO2 and Ge within Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2; however, due to severe overlap of the corresponding 31P signals, we refrained from such a calculation. We note that the observed Al contents may be slightly biased towards higher x values due to the synthesis process (alumina crucibles). The results (cf. Table 3a) again indicate that the LAGP structure can only accommodate a maximum amount of 0.6 Al. Excess Al is then consumed for the formation of AlPO4 and—at high x values—Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2.

The mobility of Li within the LAGP structure was studied employing 6Li and 7Li-NMR. Static 7Li-NMR spectra and 7Li-MAS-NMR spectra of Li1+ xAlxGe2 − x(PO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) are shown in Fig. 7. In general, the line width of the central transition is governed by the strength of the homoand heteronuclear dipolar interactions, which may be modulated in the presence of Li motion. Thus, the Li mobility scales inversely with the observed line width of the central line. As obvious from Fig. 7a, the line width of the central transition decreases signiﬁcantly in LAGP with x ≥ 0.2, indicating the onset of Li+ ion mobility upon substitution of Ge4+ by Al3+/Li+. The observed line widths are in the range 800– 1000 Hz, the sample x = 0.4 exhibiting the narrowest line. This variation is in good agreement with the ﬁndings of Maldonado-Manso et al. [14]. A second central line with a line width of approx. 5000 Hz appears for samples with x ≥ 0.7. Since the fraction of this signal is increasing drastically for x = 1 and x = 1.2 (in line with the drastic increase in the intensity of the 31P and 27Al signals assigned to Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2), it may be assigned to immobile Li species within Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2. An alternative explanation for the appearance of the broad signal would involve the assumption of a (partially) averaged quadrupolar interaction of mobile Li-ions. This, however, can be ruled out on the basis of the 7Li-MAS-NMR spectra (cf. Fig. 7b). Here, the spinning sidebands for samples with x ≥ 0.7 extend over a spectral range of approx. 600 ppm, indicating a quadrupolar coupling constant CQ = 70 kHz. Thus, according to these results, all Li within the LAGP structure is found to be mobile at ambient temperatures. For x ≥ 0.6, excess Li is consumed within Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2. From an analysis of the evolution of the static 7LiNMR line shape with temperature, we assessed details for this motional process. The spectra for Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6P3O12 in the temperature range of 160–360 K are presented in Fig. 8a. At the lowest accessible temperature, the line width of the 7Li-NMR spectrum indicates immobile Liions (on the time scale of the experiment) within the crystal structure. At temperatures as low as 200 K, Li ion dynamics is activated, thus (partially) averaging the dipole-dipole coupling. This then entails a narrowing of the central transition (cf. Fig. 8b). From the onset temperature (Tc = 190 K) for the motional narrowing and employing the empirical Waugh-Fedin [22] relation EA = 0.156 × TC kJ mol−1 K−1, the activation energy can be estimated to 30 kJ mol−1. This value is found in good agreement with that reported by Zhang [16], obtained from an analysis of impedance data of a sol–gel processed x = 0.4 sample. Concomitant T1-NMR relaxation time measurements for 6Li and 7Li (data not shown) produced somewhat lower activation energies of 15 kJ mol−1. Such a bias of the EA values from T1-relaxation times measurements towards lower values is well known from the literature [29, 30].

According to Paris [13], Li can enter two different sites within the NASICON structure, the six-coordinate M1 site and the irregular eightcoordinate M2 site. For the Al-free pure LGP, the M1 site is completely ﬁlled with Li whereas the M2 site left unoccupied. As Ge4+ is subsequently substituted by Al3+/Li+, the additional Li-ions populate the M2 sites. Since the achievable spectral resolution is much higher for the isotope 6Li as for 7Li [31,32], we attempted to quantify the population of sites M1 and M2 employing 6Li-MAS-NMR spectroscopy. The temperature-dependent 6Li-MAS-NMR spectra for samples x = 0.4 and x = 0.6 are collected in Fig. 9. For the lowest accessible temperatures (T = 175 K), two different signals are obtained at −0.9 ppm and −2.1 ppm, respectively. Since the low ﬁeld signal is increasing with increasing x, we assign this signal to Li-ions within the M2 site. Increasing the temperature, the two lines subsequently narrow into a single line. Thus, the results nicely support the ﬁndings from the static 7Li-NMR experiments and clearly indicate a motional process which is characterized by a fast exchange between Li-ions in M1 and M2 sites. From our data, we can however not rule out that upon increasing x, Li-ions from M1 are transferred to M2.

The inﬂuence of the annealing temperature on the resulting structure is exemplarily shown for the sample with x = 0.7. In the 27Al-, 31Pand 6LiMAS-NMR spectra (cf. Fig. 10), the gradual decrease of the signal at −13 ppm (27Al) and the signals around −15 ppm (31P) and −0.8 ppm (6Li) demonstrate a successive disappearance of Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 with increasing annealing temperature. At the same time, however, the decrease in the relative amount of the signals assigned to P1–P3 units with increasing annealing temperature indicates that Al is being expelled from the LAGP structure, thus reforming the pure LGP structure. The calculated xr values and the distribution of Li, Al, P and Ge among the various phases are collected in Table 3b.

Glass ceramics in the series Li1+ xAlxGe2 − xP3O12 (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 1.2) have been synthesized by a sol–gel route and characterized by solidstate NMR and X-ray diffraction techniques. Crystalline side-phases such as AlPO4, Li4P2O7 and GeO2 as well as Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2 (dominant phase for x N 1.0) were observed when x ≥ 0.6, thus limiting the amount of Al which can be incorporated into the NASICON structure to x ≈ 0.6. Al is exclusively replacing Ge within the LAGP structure, no tetrahedrally coordinated Al within the NASICON structure is observed. Among the studied samples, the solid electrolyte Li1.4Al0.4Ge1.6P3O12 exhibits the highest Li+ ions mobility (shown as FWHH ≈ 800 Hz in static 7Li-NMR spectra), extending down to temperatures as low as −30 °C. For a given composition, the annealing temperature has been shown to have dramatic effects on the resulting structure and hence Li mobility. The higher the annealing temperature, the lower is the relative fraction of Li9Al3(P2O7)3(PO4)2, but at the same time the amount of Al—and hence Li—incorporated into the LAGP structure is decreasing.
