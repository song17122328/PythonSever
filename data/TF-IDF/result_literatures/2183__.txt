The room temperature distortion of LiZr (PO ) 4 3

reacted at 11008C and above, widely considered to be monoclinic, is proved here to be triclinic by detailed indexing of its powder X-ray diffraction pattern taken under good resolution rhombohedral conditions. This and other results seem to indicate that the low temperature distortion of most LiMe (PO ) 4 3 NASICON-type structures, is triclinic, while the homologous Na compounds are known to be monoclinic. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The title compound has been known at least since ˇSljukic et al. [1] reported its preparation by heating stoichiometric mixtures of ZrO and Li PO or Li HPO to 12008C, followed by slow cooling, using B O as a ﬂux. The material was found to be rhombohedral by optical goniometry and oscillation and Weissenberg single-crystal X-ray diffraction pictures. Subsequently, Hong [2] prepared the compound by ion exchange of NaZr (PO ) with molten LiNO , and reported it to be isostructural with the Na compound, which served to deﬁne the NASICON aristotype, [2,3]. Shortly afterwards, Taylor et al. [4] found that the compound, obtained by reaction of Li CO , ZrO and (NH ) HPO , presented at room temperature rhombohedral NASICON-type; they observed the same XRD pow-

der pattern in the material obtained by duplicating the work of Sljukic et al., and could only obtain rhombohedral LiZr (PO ) by rapid quenching of samples held at 13008C. From this, they concluded that the transition temperature had to be close to 10008C, and suggested that Hong’s product must have contained some Na , or perhaps be slightly off stoichiometry. Subramanian et al. [5] observed only the distorted room temperature form, and hypothesized that it ‘possibly had a triclinic cell’. Petit et al. [6] obtained the compound via sol/gel, after calcination at 13508C, and reported a monoclinic phase at room temperature that would transform into the rhombohedral, NASICON-type phase at ł 258C; they reﬁned the rhombohedral R3c structure from single crystal X-ray diffraction data collected at 308C. Casciola et al. [7], found a monoclinic phase in samples obtained by aqueous precipitation of the amorphous, hydrated material, followed by calcination at 9008C; samples calcined below 6008C were of

poor crystallinity. According to these authors, the monoclinic phase undergoes a transition at ł3008C, detected calorimetrically, thereby becoming orthorhombic. The powder patterns corresponding to these phases were measured by the Guinier-Hagg technique, and indexed with the help of program TREOR [8]; they are however difﬁcult to rely on, because:

1. Neither intensities nor observed or calculated 2u values are given; only observed and calculated d-values are compared, but this gives poor indications as to the quality of the ﬁt.

2. No ﬁgure of merit of those customarily used (and routinely furnished by indexing programs, including TREOR) is given.

3. The orthorhombic phase observed by these authors above 3008C has cell axes related to those of the monoclinic low temperature phase by the relations: c 5 c , b 5 b , a 5 a 1 c , where the subscripts -o and -m stand for orthorhombic and monoclinic, respectively, as the authors have noted.

In a subsequent paper [9], these authors reported that the monoclinic phase transforms into the rhombohedral one at about 3008C, without making any further mention of the orthorhombic phase reported in the previous paper. One may conclude that the rhombohedral phase was misindexed as orthorhomthe inherent geometric bic, but not because of ]˛ ¢ ¢ ¢ ambiguity, a 5 a (subscript O H to a fortuitous -H refers to hexagonal axes) but relation. In fact, if one takes:

which results from the usual rhombohedral to monoclinic coordinate transformation in the NASICON structure, after redeﬁning a 9 5 a 1 c , then it is easy to see that:

be metrically orthorhombic for x 5 6 ( ł 2.45), and ¢ then ua 9u 5 ua u 2, ub 9u 5 ua u, uc 9u 5 ua u. For the H for the title reported values [4–6] of a compound, the angle b9 would range between 88.478 and 88.908, close to 908 but measurably different; however, it is interesting to note that in their second paper [9] these authors report on the stabilization of the rhombohedral structure through Ti substitution, and their c /a values are very close to 2.45. Consequent with all this, the existence of the orthorhombic phase is to be doubted. It is more difﬁcult to decide as to the existence of the ‘monoclinic’ phase reacted at less than 10008C. Close examination of the patterns published by these authors [7] indicate that the pattern of the highly crystalline product they obtain by reaction at 14008C, which they, as explicitly recognized, failed to index, is extremely similar to the phase we report on in this paper.

Chavez et al. [10] studied the phase equilibria in the system ZrO –Li O–P O , and reported that no phase transition at all is to be found in LiZr (PO ) 4 3 from room temperature up to 14508C. The nonindexed powder pattern they give ‘does not correspond to either of the.....patterns given by Taylor et al.’, but ‘all three patterns show considerable similarities’. They conclude that the high temperature phase of Taylor et al. [4] corresponds to the so-called phase C they observe, for which they assume a composition different from LiZr (PO ) . It must be said that their unindexed pattern for LiZr (PO ) at room temperature is compatible with the data herein reported. Sudreau et al. [11] prepared the material by the sol/gel method and found a transition between a room temperature and a high temperature rhombohedral form, for material sintered at 12008C, thus conﬁrming results by Taylor et al. [4] as well as those of Petit et al. [6]. They found that the distorted low temperature form disappears upon heating beyond 508C, the NASICON-type phase being observed at this and higher temperature. They studied the transition by DSC and found that it was reversible with some hysteresis, concluding that they were dealing with a ﬁrst order phase transition. From their DSC data the onset of the transition is ł308C and the maximum is ł408C. Their P MAS–NMR data is consistent with the low temperature phase being monoclinic Cc, since space group C2/c can be excluded from the fact that three signals are found,

but only two would be observable if the symmetry was C2/ c. These authors reinterpret the data for the ‘orthorhombic’ phase observed at 3008C by Casciola et al. [7] (see above) for materials reacted at 9008C, in terms of a monoclinic cell with parameters a5 8.816 A, b58.940 A, c512.381 A, b590.798 at T5208C, which, they believe, would belong to space group P2 /n; this requires that the data by Casciola et al. [7] satisfy the extinction rules of P2 /a, which holds approximately: the rule h0l, h52n is violated once (102) out of nine observations in this class, and obeyed by all ten observations in a different diagram [9] reportedly indexed with exactly the same lattice parameters. A monoclinic structure with similar geometry has been observed in several phosphates like Li In (PO ) (see reference for other 4 3 isotypic with the monoclinic phase of examples), Fe (SO ) [13,14], that presents NASICON-like 4 3 units of FeO octahedra and SO tetrahedra. Such monoclinic for LiZr (PO ) , as suggested by the fact the compound Fe (SO ) shows also a NASICON-type 4 3 structure [15,16], with symmetry R3 instead of the usual R3c. A similar monoclinic phase has also been reported for LiHf (PO ) [17] in samples reacted at 4 3 11208C, as opposed to the R3c normal NASICON phase obtained when the reaction temperature is 12208C.

Alamo and Rodrigo [18] also observed, in samples prepared at 12008C by the ceramic method, a transition at 50–758C between the rhombohedral phase and a low temperature monoclinic one, with lattice parameters similar to those reported by Hong [2] for monoclinic Na Zr Si P O . The transition is reported to be fast, and to show some hysteresis. Similar results were obtained on samples prepared by the ceramic method by Sanz et al. [19], who also reached from P MAS NMR data, the conclusion, in agreement with Sudreau et al. [11], the low temperature distortion of the rhombohedral phase ought to belong to space group Cc. Recently, we have found that

rhombohedral LiHf (PO ) low temperatures (, 2 4 3 408C) to a triclinic modiﬁcation [20], a fact which was conﬁrmed by neutron diffraction data by Losilla et al. [21]. We have reported also on the room temperature modiﬁcation [22] of LiSn (PO ) , 4 3 which has a rhombohedral NASICON-type structure

at temperatures higher than 1508C, and whose phase transition shows considerable hysteresis; we have proved by careful indexing of its powder diffraction pattern that the controversial room temperature phase is triclinic. The purpose of this paper is to show that the room temperature modiﬁcation of LiZr (PO ) 4 3 reacted at 12008C is also triclinic, and not monoclinic, as generally admitted to date.

Samples of LiZr (PO ) were prepared by the ceramic method, from stoichiometric amounts of (NH ) HPO , Li CO and ZrO . The mixtures were calcined at 9508C to decompose the hydrogenphosphate, and initiate its reaction with the carbonate. Then the samples were heated at increasing temperatures and reground, and ﬁnally calcined at 12008C for 12 h.

The diffractometer trace, 128#2u#708, was measured at 228C in a Philips X’pert diffractometer, ﬁtted with a Ge(111) incident beam monochromator of the Johansson symmetric type, using CuKa1 radiation (l51.5405981 A). Previous data indicated that strain-free, well crystallized materials could give around 0.068 for FWHM, using moderate values of the equatorial divergence. The data were therefore taken with a 0.58 divergence slit, an antiscatter slit of 18, a receiving slit of 0.018, and a set of Soller slits with an axial divergence of ł1.18 in the diffracted beam path. The usual u/2u mode was used, and intensity was counted at steps of 0.028 for 10 s. The ﬂat sample was spun around its normal at about 2 Hz. A second trace was obtained under the same conditions and reduced 2u domain, with a small amount of NIST Si standard (a55.430940 A for the wavelength quoted above) mixed with the sample material, for calibration purposes. Peak positions were determined by hand, with the help of the diffractometer standard software. The trace obtained is in Fig. 1.

Several runs were also made on a Philips PW 1710 diffractometer equipped with a high temperature Anton Paar camera, with CuKa radiation monochromatized with a pyrolytic graphite diffracted beam monochromator, in order to locate the transition temperature.

The transition temperature T was determined to be 558,T ,608C by repeated scans (see Fig. 3 for a representative), raising and lowering the temperature in the HT XRD camera, of the peaks located around 2u.288. In the rhombohedral phase there is a single peak at this Bragg angle, 024 , which splits (see Fig. 3), upon phase transition.

The indexing was carried out by trial and error, starting from the three peaks at 2u around 288, which derive from 024 and were assigned Miller indices 400, 222 and 222; this reﬂection would split into just two lines if the distorted room temperature modiﬁcation were monoclinic. The ﬁrst orders of these reﬂections were consequently indexed. Next, we looked for splitting of 110 , at around 2uł208; this reﬂection is also overlap-free, and should give rise to 020, 311, 311. The reﬂection was clearly split into three peaks (Fig. 3). At this point we had six independent equations to determine the six independent lattice parameters in the triclinic system. The remaining reﬂections were added in small groups, performing least squares calculations to constantly

reﬁne the initial parameters. For each family of reﬂections coming from each measurable reﬂection in the pattern of the rhombohedral phase, care was exercised that all members could be accounted for, be it as clearly resolved peaks (see other instances of resolved groups in Fig. 3), or else assigning the same observed 2u value to several predicted reﬂections which were expected to be of about equal intensity. Whenever the last case occurred, the unit weight assigned in all reﬁnements to uniquely resolved reﬂections was split among the various reﬂection sharing the same observed value. A number of weak observations that could not be indexed under the above requisites were satisfactorily assigned once reﬂections deriving from R3c space group extinctions were allowed; all of them are weak, and have been duly marked on Table 1, where the indexed pattern is presented. Five peaks, marked with short dashes under the diffractometer trace in Fig. 1, having intensities of 1% or less, were left nonindexed. They were identiﬁed as strong reﬂections in the pattern of baddeleyite, monoclinic ZrO , although the two strongest lines of baddeleyite overlap with strong reﬂections of LiZr (PO ) and are 4 3

First, it can be seen that uD(2u)u, 0.0358 for all reﬂections; in fact, uD(2u)u#0.028 for about 93% of the expected reﬂections, and uD(2u)u# 0.018 for about 68% of these.
