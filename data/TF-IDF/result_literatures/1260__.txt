DTA-TG  and  powder  XRD  analyses  are  used  to  study  the  occurring  upon  heating  structural ‘‘glaserite’’  type  zirconosilicate  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O.  The  title  compound transformations  of  the  undergoes  energetically  favored  irreversible  topotactic  dehydration  within  the  temperature  range  200 and  400  8C.  Essential  structural  transformations  occur  only  after  700  8C,  however,  the  phase  composition of  the  run-product  strongly  depends  on  the  conditions  of  thermal  treatment.  In  all  cases  the predominant  phase  at  1000  8C  is  the  NASICON  type  zirconosilicate  –  Na4Zr2Si3O12.  The  concomitant compound  is  either  Na2SiO3 or  the  parakeldyshite  synthetic  analog  –  Na2ZrSi2O7.  The  mechanism  of structural  transformation  and  certain  structural  relationships  are  discussed  in  terms  of  the  crystal chemical  peculiarities  of  the  initial  compound  and  the  run-products.

frameworks  have  attracted  attention  for  more  than  two  decades, because  of  their  structural  and  functional  similarities  to  other zeolite  and  zeolite-like  materials.  Some  of  these  compounds exhibit  technologically  important  alkali-ion  mobility  and  ionexchange  properties.  Advances  considering  the  synthesis,  crystal chemistry,  classiﬁcation,  properties,  and  applications  of  these materials  have  been  reviewed  by  Rocha  and  Anderson  (2000), Byrappa  and  Masahiro  (2002), Anderson  and  Rocha  (2002),  Chukanov  et  al.  (2004),  Roch  and Lin  (2005),  Zubkova  and  Pushcharovsky  (2008)  [1–7].

Recently  we  described  synthesis  and  crystal  structure  determination  of  a  hydrous  sodium  zirconosilicate  material  with  ‘‘glaserite’’ type  structure  and  generalized  formula  Na3 xH1+xZrSi2O8yH2O, 0  <  x  <  3,  0  <  y  <  1  [8].  It  is  found  that  with  synthesis  duration  the crystal  structure  gradually  transforms  from  higher  symmetrical into  triclinic  one,  however  preserving  its  topology.  The  structure of  the  triclinic  form  –  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  was  reﬁned  from powder  diffraction  data.  It  crystallizes  in  the  space  group  P-1  with lattice  parameters  a  =  9.0523(4),  b  =  5.5612(2),  c  =  6.9622(3)  A˚ , a  =  92.178(3),  b  =  90.839(3),  g  =  90.288(2)8.  To  the  best  of  our

knowledge  the  studied  compound  is  the  only  water-containing material  with  ‘‘glaserite’’  type  structure.  In  addition,  upon  treatment with  hydrochloric  acid  the  entire  amount  of  extra-framework  Na atoms  could  be  leached  out.  These  facts  are  indicative  that  the structure  of  this  material  is  rather  an  open-framework  than  a  densepacked  one.

Furthermore,  the  TG-DTA  measurements  registered  that  the weight  loss  of  1.77%  occurring  between  215  and  400  8C  was accompanied  by  an  endo-effect  followed  by  a markedly  expressed  exo-effect.  The  latter  has  been  assigned  to the  release  of  water  positioned  in  voids  within  the  structure  which possibly  causes  certain  phase  transition.

One  of  the  end  products  from  the  thermal  treatment  of  the  title compound  has  been  recognized  as  a  NASICON  type  sodium zirconosilicate  Na4Zr2Si3O12.  In  their  survey  of  the  literature  of  the solids  with  high  ionic  conductivity  Kumar  and  Yashonath  [9] pointed  out  the  pioneering  work  of  Hong  [10]  demonstrating  that it  is  possible  to  synthesize  a  series  of  materials  of  the  general formula  Na1+xZr2SixP3 xO12 with  0    x    3  some  of  which  are excellent  ionic  conductors.  Suchlike  materials  obtained  a  general name  –  NASICON  (for  Na  SuperIonic  CONductor).  The  same  authors encountered  also  various  techniques  for  synthesis  of  NASICONs  e.g. conventional  ceramic  methods  including  solid  state  reaction method  (or  powder  mixing),  solution-sol-gel  method,  hydrothermal  method,  and  ion  exchange.

TG  and  DTA  studies  were  performed  on  a  combined  DTA/TG apparatus  LABSYSG; EVO  (SETARAM,  France)  in  static  air  (20  ml/ min)  at  a  heating  rate  108/min.

XRD  powder  diffraction  analyses  were  performed  aiming that  occur  with

at  elucidation  of  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  upon  heating.

Preliminary  in  situ  high  temperature  diffraction  patterns  were collected  with  a  Huber  Guinier  image  foil  camera  G670.  The focused  monochromatic  CuKa1 radiation  is  transmitted  through the  sample,  placed  in  a  rotating  quartz  glass  capillary  tube Ø0.5  mm.  The  X-ray  sensitive  foil  in  the  camera  collects  all  the Bragg  reﬂections  in  the  range  0–1008  2u  simultaneously,  providing fast  acquisition  and  highly  reliable  intensity  data  set,  read  by  a laser  reader  with  a  scan  accuracy  of  0.0058  2u.  X-ray  patterns  were measured  between  100  8C  and  1000  8C  with  a  step  of  50  8C.  After each  measurement  the  temperature  was  increased  up  to  the  next step  with  the  speed  of  1008/min,  kept  at  this  temperature  for 15  min  and  next  the  X-ray  pattern  was  acquired  for  another 15  min.  The  slight  breakup,  visible  in  all  diagrams  at  about  178  2u  is due  to  a  constructive  peculiarity  of  the  heat  preserving  cap, the  whole  2u  range hindering  simultaneously.  This  is  why  XRD  data  were  collected  twice  in different  positions  of  the  heater  cap,  thus  providing  visibility  on both  sides  of  the  178  2u  boundary.  X-ray  patterns  were  measured between  100  8C  and  1000  8C  with  a  step  of  50  8C.  After  each measurement  the  temperature  was  increased  up  to  the  next  step with  the  speed  of  1008/min,  kept  at  this  temperature  for  15  min and  next  the  X-ray  pattern  was  acquired  for  another  15  min. Despite  the  advantages  of  this  method  certain  limitations  (quartz glass  capillary  tube  as  a  sample  holder,  construction  of  the  heat preserving  cap)  call  forth  the  necessity  to  repeat  the  experiment with  another  technique.

In  a  new  experiment  the  in  situ  high  temperature  diffraction patterns  were  collected  with  a  PANalytical  X’Pert  PRO  diffractometer  equipped  with  a  conventional  X-ray  tube  (Co  Ka  radiation, 40  kV,  30  mA,  line  focus)  and,  the  high  temperature  chamber

(HTK  16,  Anton  Paar,  Graz,  Austria)  and  the  multichannel  detector X‘Celerator  with  an  anti-scatter  shield.  X-ray  patterns  were measured  at  25  8C  and  between  100  8C  and  1000  8C  with  a  step of  50  8C  in  the  range  of  12–858  2Q  (step  of  0.03348  and  50  s counting  per  step).  In  this  case  we  used  conventional  BraggBrentano  geometry  with  0.04  rad  Soller  slit,  18  divergence  slit,  28 anti-scatter  slit,  and  10  mm  mask  in  the  incident  beam,  6.6  mm anti-scatter  slit,  0.04  rad  Soller  slit  and  Fe  beta-ﬁlter  in  the diffracted  beam.  The  heating  program  was  composed  of  the  50  8C steps  starting  from  100  8C  to  1000  8C.  At  each  step  the  temperature was  kept  constant  for  15  min  necessary  for  the  X-ray  pattern acquisition.  Immediately  after  the  measurement  the  temperature was  increased  up  to  the  next  step  with  the  speed  of  608/min.

Additionally,  powder  XRD  data  of  samples  heated  with  the speed  of  68/min  to  1000  and  1100  8C,  respectively,  held  at  that temperatures  to  room temperature  were  collected  on  a  Bruker  D2Phaser  diffractometer with  CuKa  radiation  in  the  2u  range  from  5  to  508  and  in  a  stepscan  regime  (step  0.028  and  time  2  s).  Weight  fractions  of  the  runproducts  in  this  case  have  been  calculated  using  the  GSAS  program [11]  and  EXPGUI  [12].

The  crystal  structure  of  the  title  compound  is  composed  of zirconium  and  silicon  polyhedra  connected  to  build  layers additionally  stacked  to  form  3D  zipper-like  network.  Within the  network  there  are  cavities  interconnected  to  channels with  irregular  shapes  running  along  [10-1]  where  the  sodium atoms  and  water  molecules  reside  [8].  Fig.  1  presents  the layer  construction  (a)  and  the  interlayer  atoms  ﬁlling  (b)  of Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O.

The  TG-DTA  curves  of  the  studied  as-synthesized  phase  indicate weight  loss  occurring  in  three  main  stages  (Fig.  2a).  The  liberation of  physisorption  water  between  40  and  80  8C  is  followed  by  a second  weight  is accompanied  by  an  endo-effect  followed  by  a markedly  expressed  exo-effect.  It  has  been  assigned  to  the  release of  water  positioned  in  voids  within  the  structure  and  possibility  for phase  transitions  occurring  upon  that  has  been  suggested.  The  last step  registered  between  550  and  830  8C  with  1.88%  weight  loss  has been  assumed  to  be  due  to  the  release  of  framework  hydroxyl groups.  The  TG  curves  in  Fig.  2b  demonstrate  the  impossibility  for rehydration  of  samples  dehydrated  beforehand  at  350  8C  for  3  h. Fig.  3  contains  selected  in  situ  high  temperature  diffraction patterns  collected  with  the  PANalytical  X’Pert  PRO  diffractometer for  samples  treated  within  the  temperature  interval  25–1000  8C.

The  only  changes  occurring  between  room  temperature  and  650  8C are  due  to  the  thermal  expansion  as  illustrated  by  the  shift  of  the (2  0  0)  reﬂection  in  relation  to  the  marker  line.  Thus,  the  release  of water  positioned  in  the  cavities  of  the  layers  between  200  and 400  8C  seems  to  be  energetically  favorable  for  the  structure  of  the studied  compound  as  evidenced  by  the  exo-effect  registered  at 302.62  8C  in  the  DTA  curve  (Fig.  2a)  and  does  not  lead  to  any structural  transformations.  Decomposition  and  rearrangement  of the  structure  starts  at  about  700  8C  and  traces  of  the  initial  phase can  be  detected  up  to  900  8C.  The  predominant  phase  registered  at

1000  8C  is  a  NASICON  type  sodium  zirconosilicate  Na4Zr2Si3O12 (ICSD  CC  38055)  [13,14].  Its  reﬂections  (denoted  by  ‘‘N’’  in  Fig.  3) appear  already  at  750  8C.  It  is  accompanied  by  a  small  amount  of another  phase  (denoted  by  asterisk  in  Fig.  3)  identiﬁed  as  Na2SiO3 (ICSD  CC  74640)  [15].

Fig.  4  presents  the  powder  XRD  pattern  of  a  sample  heated gradually  with  the  speed  of  68/min  to  1000  8C,  held  at  that temperatures  for  3  h,  and  next  cooled  to  room  temperature.  Again NASICON  type  sodium  zirconosilicate  is  the  predominant  phase. Interestingly,  in  this  case  the  concomitant  phase  is  not  Na2SiO3 but another  sodium  zirconosilicate  identiﬁed  as  synthetic  analog  of  the mineral  parakeldyshite  Na2ZrSi2O7 (ICSD  CC  24866)  [16].  Its  peaks are  denoted  by  ‘‘p’’  in  Fig.  4.

The  applied  quantitative  phase  analysis  using  the  Rietveld method  as  indicates  the following  weight  fractions  for  this  sample:  phase  1  (NASICON)  – 93.75  (4)  wt%,  phase  2  (parakeldyshite)  –  6.25  (5)  wt%.  These fractions  are  similar  to  those  ones  obtained  for  the  stepwise  heated up  to  1000  8C  sample  from  the  XRD  experiment  where  NASICON and  Na2SiO3 are  end-products:  phase  1  Na4Zr2Si3O12 –  94.403  wt%; Phase  2  Na2SiO3 –  7.134  wt%  (Fig.  3).

Fig.  5  presents  the  powder  XRD  pattern  of  a  sample  stepwise heated  to  1000  8C  and  collected  with  a  Huber  Guinier  image  foil camera  G670.

Again  the  NASICON  type  sodium  zirconosilicate  is  recognized among  the  end-products  together  with  a  small  amount  of  some other  crystalline  matter  part  of  which  can  be  identiﬁed  as  being  the parakeldyshite  synthetic  analog.  The  reﬂections  denoted  by  ‘‘hc’’ belong  to  a  phase  identiﬁed  as  cristobalite  high  –  PDF  card

Fig.  4.  The  observed  (crosses),  calculated  (continuous  line)  and  difference  (bottom line)  proﬁles  for  a  sample  of  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  heated  gradually  to  1000  8C  and cooled  to  room  temperature.

All  the  three  sodium  zirconosilicates  involved  in  the  studied process  contain  a  similar  block-building  unit  composed  of  central zirconium  octahedra  and  six  surrounding  it  silica  tetrahedra  the way  it  is  shown  in  Fig.  7a.

The  degree  of  deformation  in  this  unit  for  each  compound  is expressed  in  terms  of  the  angle  between  the  planes  deﬁned  by the  ‘‘free’’  (not  bound  to  the  central  Zr)  oxygen  atoms  for  each pair  of  oppositely  disposed  monodentate  tetraheda.  No  doubt, such  distortion  is  related  to  the  structural  rearrangements that  occur  upon  heating  and  correlates  with  the  way  the  BBUs connect  in  these  structures.  The  ‘‘glaserite’’  type  zirconosilicate Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  can  be  characterized  by  two-dimensional connectivity  of  the  block-building  units  in  its  framework  typical for  the  layered  compounds.  Within  the  layers  the  ZrO6  octahedron is  linked  to  six  SiO4  tetrahedra,  each  in  turn  connected  to  three different  octaheda.  The  unconnected  apex  of  each  tetrahedron  is pointing  toward  the  interlayer  space  where  the  sodium  cations  and water  molecules  reside  (Fig.  1b).  In  contrast,  the  ‘‘NASICON’’  type zirconosilicate  obtained  after  thermal  treatment  of  the  initial phase  can  be  characterized  with  three-dimensional  connectivity typical  for  the  frameworks  of  the  porous  compounds.  Each  ZrO6octahedron  is  connected  to  three  SiO4-tetrahedra,  each  of  which  is linked  to  four  ZrO6-octahedra  (Fig.  6).  Further  connectivity  of  these units  gives  rise  to  a  fairly  open  framework  structure  with  cages  and channels  where  the  Na  cations  reside.  The  structures  of  both Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  and  Na4Zr2Si3O12 are  characterized  by  the presence  of  isolated  SiO4  orthogroups.  The  structure  of  the accompanying  the  main  end-product  parakeldyshite  analog  also exhibits  three-dimensional  connectivity.  Each  ZrO6-octahedron  is connected  to  three  SiO4-tetrahedra,  however,  in  contrast  with  the ‘‘NASICON’’  structure  each  silica  tetrahedron  is  connected  to  three ZrO6-octaheda  and  one  SiO4-tetrahedron,  thus  forming  Si2O7 diorthogroups  in  Na2ZrSi2O7 (Fig.  6).

Silica  tetrahedra  condensation  in  the  form  of  SiO4  chains  is observed  also  in  the  structure  of  Na2SiO3 –  the  concomitant  phase from  pathway  A  in  the  thermal  evolution  (Fig.  6).

No  matter  which  pathway  is  undertaken  the  thermal  evolution of  the  title  compound  ends  with  formation  of  phases  characterized with  higher  degree  of  polyhedral  condensation  in  comparison  with the  initial  phase.  This  provides  free  oxygen  to  combine  with  the hydrogen  from  the  framework  of  the  already  dehydrated  starting compound  –  Na3HZrSi2O8.  Weight  loss  of  nearly  2%  is  registered  in the  temperature  range  700–800  8C  where  the  essential  structural transformations  have  been  registered  and  it  is  assigned  to  the release  of  these  newly  formed  water  molecules  (Fig.  2.).

numbers  04-013-9481  and  01-076-0934  [17];  ICSD  CC  34923  and 35536  [13,18,19].  Its  formation  upon  the  conditions  of  this experiment  will  be  discussed  in  the  following  section.

The  performed  investigations  give  evidence  for  energetically favored  irreversible  topotactic  dehydration  of  the  studied  ‘‘glaserite’’  type  compound  within  the  temperature  range  200  and  400  8C. Essential  structural  transformations  occur  only  after  700  8C  (Fig.  3). Depending  on  the  conditions  of  thermal  treatment  (stepwise  or gradual  heating  of  the  initial  phase;  heating  rate;  etc.)  there  are  at least  thermal  evolution  of  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O.  In  all  cases,  at  about  1000  8C  the  predominant phase  is  the  NASICON  type  sodium  zirconosilicate  –  Na4Zr2Si3O12. The  concomitant  compound  is  either  Na2SiO3 (Fig.  3)  or  the parakeldyshite  synthetic  analog  –  Na2ZrSi2O7 (Fig.  4).  This  is presented  schematically  in  Fig.  6.

Structural  relationship  between  NASICON  and  glaserite  type materials  was  noticed  by  Vlasse  et  al.  in  1980  [20].  A  common block-building  unit  (BBU)  has  been  found  in  both  structures.  It  is composed  of  a  central  octahedron  linked  at  the  corners  to  three  uppointing  and  three  down-pointing  tetrahedra.  The  six  surrounding tetrahedra  are  able  to  rotate  thus  accommodating  various  in  size, chemical,  and  physical  characteristic  cations  in  the  structures  of these  compounds.

The  ‘‘free’’  oxygen  atoms  deﬁne  planes  marked  with  numbers  1,  2,  and  3  for  the  three  pairs of  opposite  tetrahedra.  The  angles  between  the  planes  within  the  pairs  (1/1;  2/2;  3/3)  describe  the  degree  of  deformation  of  the  structural  unit.  Structural  units  in  the  studied compounds  with  1/1;  2/2  and  3/3  angles  (b).

characteristic  of  this  last  liberated  portion  is  its  high  corrosiveness being  due  to  the  increased  activity  of  sodium  atoms  at  these elevated  temperatures.  This  is  illustrated  with  the  XRD  experiment conducted  in  the  Guinier  camera.  It  is  characterized  with  closed environment  of  the  sample  in  the  capillary,  which  makes  more difﬁcult  the  liberation  of  H2O  to  the  outer  atmosphere.  Under  the described  thermal  conditions  a  sodium  hydroxide  hydrate substance  is  obtained  which  reacts  with  the  non-crystalline  SiO2 (material  of  capillary).  The  result  is  the  formation  of  ‘‘cristobalite high’’  among  the  run-products  registered  at  1000  8C  (Fig.  5).  On  its side,  the  sample  from  the  experiment  carried  out  in  HTK  16  is placed  in  a  platinum  holder  that  is  inert  and  ﬂat,  and  provides  easy liberation  of  H2O  without  any  reaction  occurring  between  the product  and  the  Pt  plate  on  which  it  is  suspended  on.

DTA-TG  and  powder  XRD  analyses  are  used  to  study  the occurring  upon  thermal  treatment  structural  transformations  of ‘‘glaserite’’  type  zirconosilicate  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O.  Two the  pathways  in  the  structural  evolution  of  the  title  compound  are outlined  in  dependence  with  the  applied  heating  procedure (stepwise  or  gradual  heating).  ‘‘NASICON’’  type  zirconosilicate Na4Zr2Si3O12 is  always  present  among  the  end-products  as  a  main phase  accompanied  by  either  Na2SiO3 or  the  parakeldyshite synthetic  analog  –  Na2ZrSi2O7.  A  common  block-building  unit  is distinguished  in  the  structures  of  all  sodium  zirconosilicates involved  in  this  process.  It  is  composed  of  central  zirconium octahedra  and  six  surrounding  it  silica  tetrahedra.  The  difference comes  from  the  way  these  units  are  assembled  in  the  structures  – 2-dimensional  connectivity  in  Na3HZrSi2O80.4H2O  vs.  3-dimmensional  one  in  Na4Zr2Si3O12 and  Na2ZrSi2O7.  The  polyhedral condensation  observed  in  the  structures  of  some  run-products has  occurred  upon  heating  and  contributes  to  the  formation  of water  released  during  the  structural  decomposition  and  rearrangement  of  the  title  compound.
