The phase relationships in the subsolidus region of the Li2MoO4–K2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3–Lu2(MoO4)3 system have been studied by X-ray crystallography and vibrational spectroscopy. A phase of variable composition Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) with a NASICON structure (space group R ) was synthesized by the ceramic route. The phase exhibits high conductivity, which makes it a candidate for use as a solid electrolyte with lithium and potassium ion conductivity. The unit cell parameters were determined, and IR and Raman spectra were interpreted.

Interest in oxide phases with a NASICON structure is due to their unique properties: high chemical and thermal stability, low thermal expansion, and high ionic conductivity [1–4]. A special feature of their structures is the presence of stable frameworks of octahedra and tetrahedra {[R2(EO4)] }∞ (R is an octahedral cation in phosphate, arsenate, molybdate, tungstate, and sulfate systems) in which the voids are occupied by alkali metal atoms [4]. The possibility of varying the cation composition within a single structure type allows directional synthesis of phases of variable composition M1–хA1–хR1 + х(MoO4)3 isostructural with NASICON. The structure consists of a 3D porous framework formed by vertex-sharing A(R)O6 octahedra and MoO4 tetrahedra [1, 2]. Such a structure of the M1‒хA1–хR1 +х(MoO4)3 phases is topologically identical to the rhombohedral corundum structure [2]; the A(R) atoms are located on threefold axes and the MoO4 groups, on twofold axes. The vacant part of octahedral and tetrahedral voids coalesce to form a 3D channel network in which cavities accommodate alkali metal cations [3]. A necessary condition for the formation of a NASICON structure is that the doubly and triply charged cations should be 0.6–0.9 Å in size (this condition is met by Mg2+, Sc3+, and Lu3+) and the cations filling framework cavities should be of moderate size (Li+, 0.7 Å; K+, 1.2 Å). This work deals with studying the possibility for the Li+, K+, Mg2+, Sc3+, and Lu3+ cations to enter the structure of the phase of variable composition Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3), which is a solid solution of subtraction based on the KMgSc(MoO4)3 structure, determining the synthesis conditions of this phase, the homogeneity range, and thermal stability, as well as with studying the phase by vibrational spectroscopy, the temperature dependences of conductivity, permittivity, and dielectric loss tangent.

NASICON-like solid solutions Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) were synthesized via the ceramic route from stoichiometric amounts of preliminarily synthesized molybdates Li2MoO4, K2MoO4, MgMoO4, Sc2(MoO4)3, and Lu2(MoO4)3. Li2MoO4, K2MoO4, MgMoO4, Sc2(MoO4)3, and Lu2(MoO4)3, prepared from the Li2-CO3, K2СO3, and MgСO3 carbonates, molybdenum trioxideМоO3 (pure for analysis grade), and Lu2O3and Sc2O3 oxides (with a purity of no less than 99.99%) were homogenized and sintered in alundum crucibles in the temperature range 450–750°С with repeated intermittent grindings every 20–30 h. The annealing time at each temperature was 100–120 h. After annealing, the samples were furnace cooled. Nonequilibrium samples were additionally annealed. Equilibrium was considered achieved if the phase composition remained unaltered after two successive annealings.

The achievement of equilibrium was monitored by X-ray diffraction (a Bruker D8 ADVANCE automated diffractometer (CuKα radiation, graphite monochromator)). Unit cell parameters were refined with the use of the Rentgen programs. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) was carried out on an MOM OD-103 derivatograph at a heating rate of 10 K/min for a sample weight of 0.3–0.4 g (Fig. 1). Vibrational spectra of polycrystalline Li0.2K0.8‒ yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) samples were recorded on Bruker FT-IR and SpecordМ-80 spectrophotometers with near-IR laser excitation at 1.06 nm using reflection scattering geometry; resolution was 3–5 cm–1. Samples were prepared as mineral oil mulls on a polyethylene support and as KBr pellets. Molybdenum and magnesium isotopesubstituted samples were synthesized using 92MoO3, 100MoO, 24MgO, and 26MgO. The temperature dependences of conductivity (σ), permittivity (ε), and dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) were studied using the Vest–Tallan polarization procedure [4–8] on densely compacted ceramic samples shaped as pellets 10 mm in diameter and 1–1.5 mm thick with platinum electrodes. Electrodes were applied by firing platinum paste. The electrophysical properties were measured with an E8-4 ac bridge at a frequency of 103 Hz equipped with a P-5025 capacity box, which extended the range of measurements of the dielectric loss tangent (the accuracy of determination was ±5%). The direct current was measured with an E6-13A teraohmmeter at a voltage of 30–50 mV. The temperatures of the samples in the course of electrophysical studies were monitored using a chromel–alumel thermocouple connected to a V7-21A voltmeter with an accuracy of ±2°C. The reproducibility of measurement results was verified under heating and cooling in the temperature range 20–600°С.

The formation of the Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 phase of variable composition (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) in the Li2MoO4–K2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3–Lu2(MoO4)3 system was observed at 550–600°С. The resulting phase is a solid solution of subtraction based on the triple molybdate KMgSc(MoO4)3 [4]. According to X-ray diffraction, the samples of the variable-composition phase (Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K0.3Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3) are single-phase and belong to the NASICON structure type (trigonal space group R Z = 6), (Fig. 2); they are isostructural to the triple molybdate KMgIn(MoO4)3. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K0.3Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 were indexed in the trigonal crystal system using the unit cell parameters of the KMgIn(MoO4)3 single crystal [4]. The extended crystallization range of NASICON solid solutions is due to the possibility of isomorphous substitutions in octahedra. The octahedral positions A(R)O6, randomly occupied by Mg, Sc, and Lu atoms, contain an excess of Sc and Lu and is deficient in magnesium. The lithium and potassium atoms located in framework cavities do not distort the lattice symmetry and are also in deficiency. Specific features of the Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K03Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 structure and the character of cation distribution lead to an increase in the contribution of Sc–O and Lu–O bonds to the overall electrostatic balance of the structure. The weakening of the Li–O and K–O bonds, necessary to maintain the balance of structure, is achieved due to the insufficient amount of lithium and potassium atoms in the cavities of the framework and an increase in its size, which leads to an increase in the unit cell volume with an increase in the homogeneity range (Table 1). Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K03Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 melt incongruently at 1045 and 1060°С, respectively, without undergoing polymorphous transformations. In the Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K03Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 structure, the Mg (Sc, Lu) atoms are statistically distributed over two sets of octahedral crystallographic positions on threefold axes (symmetryС3), and theМоO4 groups are located on twofold axes (С2). The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral voids coalesce to form a 3D network of chan3c nels, in which cavities are occupied by lithium and potassium cations; their positions have symmetryС3i. The existence of discrete distorted tetrahedral anions allows us to perform comparative analysis of internal vibrations of discrete groups and vibrations of cationic sublattices andМоO4 tetrahedra as a whole [9]. The bands corresponding to the vibrations undergo an isotope shift caused by the 92Mo–100Mo and 24Mg–26Mg substitution (Tables 2, 3). The relatively low symmetry of theМоO4 tetrahedra implies the lift of degeneracy of their doubly and triply degenerate vibrations as well as the IR-activity of the components of the totally symmetric stretching vibration. Group-theoretical analysis assumes the following distribution over irreducible representations of factor group D3d of the space group of crystals: ГNa = A1u(inactive) +А2u(IR) +Еu(IR), ГNi+Fe = A1g + A2g(inactive) + 2Еg(Raman) + A1u(inactive) +А2u(IR) + 2Еu(IR), ГМо = 3A2g(inactive) + 3Еg(Raman) + 3А2u(IR) + 3Еu(IR). The Raman spectrum should show three bands of vibrations of Mg2+ and Sc3+ + Lu3+ cations, and the IR spectrum should show two vibration bands of Li+ and K+ cations and three bands of Mg2+ and Sc3+ + Lu3+. As for the MoO4 vibrations, six lines should be observed in the Raman spectrum and nine bands, in the IR absorption spectrum. The bands at 986–769 (stretching) and 408–310 cm–1 (bending vibrations), observed in the spectral range characteristic of vibrations ofМоO4 tetrahedra [4, 9] and experiencing a shift upon molybdenum isotope substitution, were assigned to the internal vibrations of the MoO4 groups. Totally symmetric stretching vibrations of molybdate groups distributed over two sets of crystallographic positions turned out to be degenerate, presumably due to close geometrical and dynamic characteristics of these polyhedra [9]. The stretching vibration frequencies of MoO4 groups increase by 20–25 cm–1 with an increase inх, which is likely caused by an increase in Mg–O and Sc(Lu)–O bond energies when additional vacancies appear in the cationic sublattice. The statistical distribution of cations, while not affecting the character of the spectrum as a whole, leads to some line broadening; this is accompanied by a decrease in the degree of distortion of MoO4 tetrahedra and in the splitting into components of the triply degenerate stretching vibration. The lines observed in the Raman spectrum below 300 cm–1 (263–269 cm–1), were assigned to Mg2+ and Sc3+ + Lu3+ cations. The band at 192 cm–1 was assigned to the vibration of the scandium and lutetium cations. The low-frequency groups of Raman lines at 112–111–87 cm–1 were assigned to magnesium vibrations because the lithium and potassium vibrations are Raman inactive. In the IR absorption spectra, the bands observed below 160 cm–1 can be assigned to vibrations of lithium and potassium ions. The plots of conductivity versus temperature in logσ– 103/Т coordinates for Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K0.3Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 are shown in Fig. 3. The conductivity of the variable composition phase changes within 10–8–10–2 Ω cm–1; Li0.2K0.8MgSc0.5Lu0.5(MoO4)3 and Li0.2K0.3Mg0.5ScLu0.5(MoO4)3 are characterized by predominantly ionic conductivity (ti = 0.86–0.89) (Table 4). Above 300°С, the curves of conductivity versus temperature have a kink, and the conductivity activation energy increases, which is presumably due to the transition from extraneous to intrinsic conductivity. For the extraneous conductivity segment, the activation energies are 1.03–1.08 eV and for the intrinsic conductivity segment, 2.15–2.34 eV. The conductivity 10–2 Ω cm–1 typical of the Li0.2K0.8‒ yMg1‒хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) phase with a NASICON structure is caused by rather large voids in the framework, which significantly reduces steric hindrances for K+ and Li+ transfer [7, 8]. Aliovalent substitution (K(Li)++ Mg2+→ Sc(Lu)3+ + h) in a series of Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) solid solutions leads to the appearance of additional vacancies in the potassium and lithium sublattice, which enhances the mobility of alkali metal cations and conductivity with and increase inх from 0 to 0.5. There is a correlation betweenσ and the unit cell volume of the phase of variable composition.

The permittivity (ε) and the dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) have an exponential temperature dependence (Fig. 4). The absence of extrema on the permittivity and dielectric loss tangent curves indicates that Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 (0≤х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) has no phase transitions and ferroelectric properties. The high ionic conductivity of the Li0.2K0.8– yMg1–хSc(Lu)1 + x(MoO4)3 phase of variable composition (0≤ х≤ 0.5; 0≤ y≤ 0.3) makes is a candidate for use as a solid electrolyte with lithium and potassium ion conductivity.
