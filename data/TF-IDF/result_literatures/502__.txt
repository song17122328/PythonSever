Perovskite-type oxide solid electrolyte Li0.33La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) samples are known to have high ionic conductivities and grain-boundary resistances from AC impedance spectroscopy. In addition, the existence of domain structures has been shown by transmission electron microscopy and other techniques. In this study Li+ migration in tetragonal and cubic samples (t- and c-LLTO) was studied in micrometre space by pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR from the room temperature up to 100 °C. The grain-boundary effects appeared clearly in the 7Li echo attenuation plots, which were not linear and included at least two components. Previously, we reported that the Li+ diffusion in inorganic solid electrolytes (garnets, NASICON, sulfides) distributes widely in time and space, illustrated by the dependences of the measuring parameters such as observation time (Δ) and pulsed-field gradient (PFG) strength (g). In addition to the complexities of parameter dependent Li+ diffusion, grain-boundary disturbance effects were observed for Li+ diffusion phenomena in LLTO samples. We indicated that a unique DLi value could be estimated from the linear echo attenuation plot at convergent measuring conditions with long Δ and large g for garnets and NASICON. The LLTO samples showed curved echo attenuation plots at the convergent measuring conditions, which were analysed by two components to give two Li+ diffusion constants (DLi-fast and DLi-slow). These values are consistent with the tracer diffusion constants measured at higher temperatures (>150 °C). For c-LLTO, DLi-fast and DLi-slow showed good correspondences with the bulk ionic conductivity (σbulk) and grain-boundary ionic conductivity (σgb), respectively. The Li carrier numbers estimated from DLi-fast and σbulk for c- and t-LLTO showed similar values, whereas those estimated from DLi-slow and σgb for c-LLTO were smaller by approximately one-order of magnitude.

High ionic conductivities in inorganic solid electrolytes have attracted much attention owing to possibilities producing all-solid-state Li batteries with good safety performances. Many review articles have been dedicated to the production of all-solid rechargeable batteries [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Various-type inorganic solid electrolytes have been proposed including perovskite-type lithium oxide electrolytes. At an early stage (1984), ionic conductivity and 7Li NMR studies were reported for perovskite-type LixLn1/3Nb1−xTixO3 (Ln = La, Nd) [5]. In 1993, Inaguma et al. reported that the ionic conductivity of a polycrystalline cubic lithium lanthanum titanate, Li0.34La0.51TiO2.94 (LLTO) can be divided into two parts (bulk crystal and grain boundary) in AC impedance analysis with a fast bulk ionic conductivity of 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 observed at room temperature [6]. Subsequently, new perovskite compounds have been synthesized [7,8] and to improve ionic conduction, various synthetic and structural studies have been performed [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Bulk ionic conductivities were mainly determined by impedance spectroscopy [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. At high temperatures, the ionic conductivity was reported to exhibit non-Arrhenius behaviours [28]. Microstructural studies using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed existence of domains in LLTO for the first time in 1995 [29] and many subsequent studies have reported precise details about the micro-domain structures using TEM and other techniques [[30], [31], [32], [33], [34]]. Ionic conduction in solid electrolytes is caused by Li ion migration. Li tracer diffusion measurements were performed for La2/3−xLi3xTiO3 between 150 and 400 °C and fast Li tracer diffusion constants were obtained using neutron radiography (10−9 to 10−11 m2 s−1) [35]. Li diffusion pathways in the LLTO crystalline structure have been proposed based on neutron powder-diffraction studies and found the vacancies at the La site are important to Li+ migration [36]. The domain-boundary structures and the bulk conductivity have been discussed for LLTO [37]. Further, computational approaches have been applied to interpret atomic structures, domain boundaries and ion conduction [[38], [39], [40], [41], [42]].

7Li NMR studies on perovskite-type electrolytes have been conducted first in 1984 [5], and the fast ion conduction of perovskites was reported with 7Li NMR spectra and T1 values [26,27]. Up to 2006, various approaches for understanding fast ion conduction have been made by measuring 7Li NMR spectral patterns and 7Li relaxation times (T1, T1ρ and T2) over wide temperature range [[43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52]]. In 2011, 7Li and 1H NMR studies were conducted to characterize the size effects connected to micro- and nanostructures in LLTO [53]. General and comprehensive review articles on NMR of solid Li ionic conductors were published in 2007 [54] and 2016 [55]. These reports mainly focused on the 6,7Li NMR spectral patterns and 6,7Li relaxation times over a wide temperature range. The precise atomic-level Li dynamics have been described for various conductive materials by NMR spectroscopy. The relaxation times can provide correlation times (~10−9 s) for fast Li jumps at the atomic-level, which can be related to the lithium structures observed by solid-state NMR methods.

Ion conduction is one of most important properties of bulk materials, and ionic conductivity (σ) is defined as the velocity multiplied by the number of carrier ions that are successively moving. Ion conduction in solid-state Li electrolytes is assumed to be related to Li migration on micrometre length. Diffusion measurements are possible in micrometre space using pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) NMR methods [56]. The scales of the diffusion measurements are 10−3 s in time and 10−6 m in space, which are much longer than nano-scale parameters.

We have applied PGSE-NMR methods to solution electrolytes and ionic liquids including Li salts, which allowed determination of the lithium (7Li), anion (19F or 11B) and solvent (1H NMR) diffusion constants (D). In the liquid electrolytes all of the D values can be related to physical constants such as viscosity, ionic conductivity and density [57]. In our extended studies of Li diffusion in solid-state inorganic electrolytes, we encountered many complicated phenomena [[58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64]]. We observed parameter-dependent Li diffusion and collision-diffraction behaviours in sulfide-, garnet- and NASICON-type LAGP (Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3) solid electrolytes. In these materials, we did not obtain clear evidences for grain-boundary effects in the 7Li diffusion phenomena. Recently, Haaks et al. reported the DLi values of sulfide-type electrolytes using static field gradient (SFG) with ultrahigh strength of 72.8 T m–1 [65], which is higher than our experimental conditions more than seven times larger.

In the present study, we examined Li diffusion in perovskite-type electrolytes, using tetragonal and cubic Li0.33La0.55TiO3 (LLTO) samples (t- and c-LLTO). The existence of micro-domain structures in LLTO has already been reported and complex phenomena were encountered in our Li+ diffusion measurements. The diffusion plots previously studied in solid inorganic electrolytes were almost linear, except for collision-diffraction regions. However, the plots for the t- and c-LLTO samples were clearly curved, suggesting the existence of grain boundaries. Over short observation times, Li+ collision and diffraction were also observed in LLTO samples similar to the behaviours of other solid electrolytes, but following collision, the Li+ ions remained near-by the collision positions and clear diffraction patterns were not observed. The micro-domain structures significantly affected the Li+ migration behaviours, and quick Li+ diffusion was observed together with slow migration.

Parameter-dependent 7Li diffusion phenomena were also observed similar to those in other solid electrolytes. We have showed that the parameter-dependent apparent diffusion constant (Dapparent) approaches an equilibrated diffusion constant (DLi) by larger g and longer ∆, which can be compared with the ionic conductivity [[62], [63], [64]]. In this study, the two components of DLi (DLi-fast and DLi-slow), estimated from the curved plots were shown to be related to two ionic conductivities, namely the bulk (σbulk) and grain-boundary (σgb) conductivities for c-LLTO [6] and to the bulk ionic conductivities for t-LLTO [8]. The estimated Li carrier numbers showed temperature dependent behaviours.

Powder samples of perovskite Li0.33La0.55TiO3 (t- and c-LLTO), which were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction, were purchased from Toshima Manufacturing Co., Ltd, (Saitama, Japan). A pellet of the tetragonal sample was sintered at 1150 °C for 30 h and then cooled in air. The cubic sample was prepared from the tetragonal sample by sintering at 1050°C for 5 h and quenched in liquid nitrogen. Each powder sample was inserted into a Shigemi 5-mm micro-sample tube (Tokyo, Japan) with a height of 8 mm, which was then flame sealed.

The phase compositions of c- and t-LLTO were recorded at room-temperature by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Rigaku Miniflex 600, Japan) using Cu-Ka radiation (λ = 1.5406), in the 2θ range from 5° to 90°.

7Li NMR spectroscopy was performed using a JEOL fully tunable pulsed-field gradient (PFG) probe and a JEOL 50A amplifier (Tokyo, Japan). The probe was set in a 4.7 T wide-bore superconductive magnet (SCM) without a room-shim unit and the 7Li resonance frequency was 78.4 MHz. The PFG had a good rectangular shape and the residual eddy current effects diminished at times shorter than 0.4 ms after the application of PFG = 14 T m−1 and δ = 4 ms. Measurements of NMR were performed by using a Tecmag Apollo and NTNMR console (Huston, USA). 7Li T1 and T2 were observed using standard inversion recovery (180°-τ-90°-Acq of FID) and Hahn echo (90°-τ-180°-τ-Acq of echo) pulse sequences, respectively. The PGSE NMR pulse sequence to observe Li+ diffusion is shown in Fig. 1.

The echo attenuation, E, is related to the experimental variables, and the diffusion coefficient, D, can be obtained using the Stejskal and Tanner equation for a homogenous systems [66,67].

where γ is the 7Li gyromagnetic ratio (1.03977 × 108 s−1 T−1). In the measurements, τ and Δ are related to T2 and T1, respectively. By varying g × δ, the echo attenuation, E, can be measured, normalized by E0 near g × δ = zero, and plotted versus b (γ2δ2g2(Δ – δ / 3)). From Eq. (1), g and δ appear equivalent, and in homogeneous liquids this concept is valid. However, the anomalous Li+ diffusion in solid electrolytes was shown to depend on g. The echo attenuation plots obtained by fixing g and varying δ, differs from that obtained by fixing δ and varying g [61]. Basically, g cannot be used as measuring variables in the region where g-dependent Li+ diffusion is assumed. Then in this work, the echo attenuations were always observed at a fixed g with varying δ. The temperature was determined from the 1H shift differences of ethylene glycol.

Fig. 2 shows the XRD pattern of the cubic and tetragonal LLTO samples. Both patterns were well agreed with previous reported samples [68]. We also attempted Rietveld refinement of both samples (Tables S1 and S2), and clearly differences were found between cubic and tetragonal phases on both a and b axes.

The 7Li NMR spectra measured at 70°°C are shown in Fig. 3(a) t- and (b) c-LLTO. The spectral patterns show that existence of narrow and broad components, similar to the 7Li spectra of the garnets electrolytes. In the present samples, the linewidths of the narrow components were sharp (approximately 0.20 kHz) and insensitive to temperature, whereas the linewidths of the broad component became slightly narrower as the temperature increased. We did not observe any eqQ satellite peaks, which have been reported for layered and orthorhombic LLTO samples [26,[45], [46], [47]]. The area ratio of the narrow component, about 55% in both samples at 70 °C was almost temperature independent. The broad component did not contribute to Li+ diffusion, because the echo signals were sharp which are corresponding to the narrow component. At the present temperatures, almost half of the Li atoms do not contribute to Li+ migration.

Fig. 3. 7Li spectra of (a) t- and (b) c-LLTO at 70 °C. The central peak positions of t- and c-LLTO were 2.7 and 2.5 ppm, at lower field side from aqueous 7Li signal, respectively. Each spectrum was decomposed to overlapping two Lorentz lines. The full widths of the narrow lines were 0.21 and 0.20 kHz for t- and c-LLTO, respectively and insensitive to temperature. The line width of the broad components became narrower as the temperature increased from 30 to 100 °C; 7.5 to 3.6 kHz (t-LLTO) and 2.8 to 0.6 kHz (c-LLTO).

To determine the parameters for the PGSE NMR measurements, 7Li T1 and T2 values are important and shown in Fig. 4. In the present temperature region, the temperature dependences of T1 and T2 were small, corresponding to near bottom of the Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound plots in the wide temperature range for the 7Li T1 of perovskite-electrolytes [5,[43], [44], [45], [46],[48], [49], [50], [51]]. The T2 values were between 4 and 7 ms and not very short to measure Li+ PGSE NMR compared with those of the garnets [64]. The short T1 values of less than 70 ms require long-term accumulation for long Δ measurements.

To observe the 7Li diffusion using the PGSE-NMR pulse sequence (Fig. 1), we need to set three measuring parameters, namely, Δ, g and δ. As described previously [[58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64]], Li-diffusion is dependent on the observing time, Δ, for inorganic solid electrolytes (sulfides, garnets and LAGP), similar to well-known molecular diffusion in microporous materials. In this study, Δ-dependent Li diffusion was also found for the LLTO samples in the observed temperature ranges (25 to 100 °C). As an example, the echo attenuation diffusion plots following Eq. (1) are shown in Fig. 5(a) t-LLTO and (b) c-LLTO at 38 °C measured with g = 10.0 T m−1 and ∆ = 10 to 100 ms.

When Δ = 10 and 15 ms, diffraction or diffraction-like patterns were observed. For longer Δ, the plots of the LLTO samples showed slightly concave curvatures. The LLTO samples, occasionally, exhibited random scattering plots, which were not experienced previously in sulfides, garnets, and LAGP. The scatterings were likely induced by grain boundaries with non-uniform distribution. Long-term accumulations did not always improve the scattering in the plots of the LLTO samples, which was also quite different in measuring Li+ diffusion in garnets and LAGP samples. After repeated measurements, we obtained apparent 7Li diffusion constants (Dapparent) from reasonable and smooth plots. As Δ became longer, the gradients became smaller, indicating slower apparent diffusion (Eq. (1)). It should be noticed that the minimum E/E0 values for t-LLTO were 0.18 or larger, and never became smaller (Fig. 5(a)). In contrast, the minimum value for c-LLTO was about 0.025 (Fig. 5(b)). The short echo decay limits in the diffusion plots for t-LLTO are very different from those observed in other solid electrolytes, suggesting that grain boundaries disturbed Li+ ions for travelling in longer distances. The grain-boundary effects to prevent longer-distance travelling must be significant in t-LLTO with larger E/E0 minimum, than c-LLTO which showed much smaller E/E0 values.

As poor sensitivity and scattering, complete analysis of the curved lines was limited. Two Dapparent values were estimated from the initial linear decay and the linear tail in each plot. The estimated numerical values of Dapparent for the fast and slow components of the t- and c-LLTO are plotted versus Δ in Fig. 6(a) 38 and (b) 80 °C.

When ∆ = 15 ms, the Dapparent values of t- and c-LLTO were similar at both temperatures. As the ∆ became longer, rapid decreases in the Dapparent were observed in the two components of the Dapparent values. The Dapparent values at 38 °C had two components in c-LLTO for Δ longer than 40 ms and in t-LLTO for longer than 70 ms. The Dapparent values changed by almost two orders of magnitude (10−11 to 10−13 m2 s−1), for which a larger decrease in Dapparent was observed in t-LLTO than in c-LLTO. At 80 °C, the ∆-dependent Dapparent behaviours of c-LLTO showed smaller changes than those at 38 °C. The Δ-dependent Dapparent values approached a convergent value as the Δ became longer. At ∆ = 100 ms, the values are close to an equilibrated value. Owing to experimental uncertainties, we did not attempt to measure the values with longer Δ and adopted the Li diffusion constant, DLi, observed at ∆ = 100 ms for the LLTO samples.

As a measure of the Li+ migration, the distance moved during a time interval (∆) is important. The mean square displacement (MSD, ) was calculated from the data in Fig. 6 and plotted versus Δ in Fig. 7.

Clearly, the MSD values are large at short time intervals (up to 0.8 μm in Δ = 10 ms), indicating the existence of quick Li+ migration in short time intervals. As the Δ became longer, the MSD values of each component became shorter and were insensitive to Δparticularly in t-LLTO, probably owing to grain-boundary effects that prevent Li+ ion longer-distance migration. The MSD values ranged approximately between 0.2 and 0.7 μm for ∆ longer than 50 ms.

Previously, we observed g-dependent Li+ diffusion in garnet and LAGP solid electrolytes. The g-dependent Li+ diffusion in inorganic solid electrolytes is an extremely curious phenomenon, and we have not observed any such phenomena in liquid and polymer electrolytes. Actually we spent long time until we noticed that the experimental facts are true after piling up garbage data. Experimentally, smaller g-values can observe quick-moving Li+, whereas large g-values detect slow Li+ migration. The g-dependence suggests the scattering Li+ mobility, probably due to non-uniform Li+ pathways. The recent report using an ultrahigh static field-gradient lost information on quick-moving Li+ [65].

In this study, we confirmed g-dependent Li+ diffusion for the t- and c-LLTO samples with Δ = 15 ms at 38 °C, as shown in Fig. 8. The echo attenuations are plotted in q- and b-spaces, in which q = γgδ / 2π [m−1] for diffraction pattern modes and b = γ2δ2g2(Δ – δ / 3) [m−2s] for diffusion modes following Eq. (1). The collision and diffraction patterns in Fig. 8(a) and (b) are distorted compared with those measured under the similar conditions for the garnet and LAGP samples [[61], [62], [63], [64]]. The diffraction patterns in t-LLTO are shallower than those in c-LLTO, and they are both shallower than those for garnets and LAGP samples as discussed later. The collision and diffraction distance (Rdiffraction) estimated from the minimum in the q-space plots was between 1.6 and 2.6 μm for t-LLTO and between 1.4 and 2.4 μm for c-LLTO. These ranges are much smaller than those for garnets and LAGP samples (up to 4 μm). In the LLTO samples, after collision and diffraction, clear diffraction patterns did not appear and the echo attenuation signals remained in the similar values with the increased q, suggesting the Li+ does not migrate further. In the b-space plots for the Li+ diffusion (Fig. 8(c) and (d)), the initial decays became slower for larger g values. The echo attenuation signals in t-LLTO remained constant with increased b values, indicating the Li+ ions cannot migrate further, owing to the grain-boundary effects. The minimum E/E0 value for t-LLTO was 0.2 suggesting that the Li+ ions could not migrate over longer distances, even if a larger PFG were applied. These trends were slightly reduced in c-LLTO. As the minimum E/E0 values of c-LLTO were smaller (~0.06) and the possible migration distance (MSD) must be longer.

We have found that the g-dependence of Dapparent decreased as Δ becomes longer. As the plots were smooth at Δ = 50 ms (Fig. 5), the g-dependent echo attenuation plots were observed using Δ = 50 ms for (a) t- and (b) c-LLTO at 38 °C as shown in Fig. 9. Compared with the g-dependent plots at Δ = 15 ms (Fig. 8), the g-dependent effects reduced, particularly in c-LLTO. For smaller g, larger gradients with a single component were observed. With larger g, the plots were curved for which we analysed by two components to obtain two Dapparent values. In Fig. 10, the estimated Dapparent values for t- and c-LLTO are plotted versus g.

As the g values became larger, the 7Li Dapparent values decreased continuously. The fast component of t-LLTO decreased considerably with increasing of the g value. The slow component is sensitive to g-values, especially in t-LLTO. The origins of g-dependent Li+ diffusion in solid inorganic electrolytes are assumed to divergent broad distribution of Li+ migrations owing to wide-spread mobility. The 7Li Dapparent values are not physical constants. Description of the Li+ diffusion behaviours and comparison with the ionic conductivity (observed as a single value), require the use of a representative value. Generally, as the sensitivity of the echo attenuation plots is poor at longer ∆ and the long-term accumulation is necessary to obtain the reliability. As described above, considerable scatterings were observed in their echo attenuation plots of the LLTO samples at long ∆ and large g values (Fig. 5, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). The Dapparent values approached an equilibrated value near Δ = 100 ms where the g-dependence of Dapparent is reduced. Thus in this study, for the purposes of practicality and also comparison of previous data of garnets and LAGP, we used g = 10 T m−1 and Δ = 100 ms as standard measuring conditions and assumed that the obtained data can provide close to a single DLi at each temperature. However, as the diffusion plots following Eq. (1) were curved, we took two values from the initial linear decay (DLi-fast) and the linear tail (DLi-slow) of the plots. Thus, the DLi in this study contains inevitably uncertainties.

The temperature dependent diffusion plots for t-LLTO and c-LLTO at 25 and 80 °C using g = 10.0 T m−1 and ∆ = 100 ms are shown in Fig. 11(a) and (b), respectively. The plots were analysed assuming two components. Apparently, the faster components became more dominant as the temperature increased. Further, t-LLTO showed greater temperature dependence than c-LLTO.

Arrhenius-type plots for the two components of DLi are shown in Fig. 12(a) t-LLTO and (b) c-LLTO, respectively. The plots of the faster (DLi-fast) and slower components (DLi-slow) of t-LLTO appeared linear, providing apparent Ea values were 14 and 9.4 kJ mol−1, respectively. Because the relative ratio of the two components varied depending on temperature, the calculated values include uncertainties. The plot for the DLi-fast of c-LLTO was curved whereas that of the DLi-slow was almost unchanged in the examined temperature changes. Overall, the DLi values of c-LLTO are slightly larger than those of t-LLTO.

As the tracer diffusion coefficients between 150 and 400 °C have been reported using neutron radiography [35], the data for Li0.348La0.55TiO3 were plotted with our results in Fig. 13.

Although the tracer diffusion coefficients were measured in a much higher temperature region, simple extrapolation to the temperature range used in this temperature of the present study did not much deviated. Also the neutron radiography method may be insensitive to the grain-boundary effects. Since there are differences between the sample materials, the direct comparison of the data may be difficult. However, we think the trend shown in Fig. 13 is quite reasonable. Note that the relative ratio of DLi-fast and DLi-slow changed depending on temperature, and we don't discuss the activation energies derived from the Arrhenius-type plots.

Generally, the most important feature of inorganic solid electrolytes is high ionic conductivity (σ). In the present study, we attempted to find the relations between DLi and σ. In the literature, the impedance spectroscopy analysis of c-LLTO (Li0.34La0.51TiO2.94) afforded two σ values (σbulk and σgb) [6]. The σ values reported for Li0.34La0.51TiO2.94, which had a XRD pattern resembled to that of t-LLTO in Fig. 2, were similar values of σbulk of c-LLTO [8]. These σ values were almost overlapped to that of Li-rich tetragonal Li0.33La0.56TiO3 (σrich) [37]. In this study, we compared the DLi-fast of c-LLTO with the σbulk and the DLi-slow with the σgb. For t-LLTO, we assumed that the DLi-fast was correlated with the σ, for which there exist abundant experimental values of Li0.34La0.51TiO2.94 [8] and the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) analysis [31]. We could not find σ values to account the DLi-slow of t-LLTO. Note that the σ values at 25 °C were 10, 0.67, and 8 × 10−4 S cm−1 for the σbulk and σgb of c-LLTO and σ of t-LLTO, respectively. In Fig. 14, the DLi values are plotted versus literature σ values, obtained from various samples. Thus, the plots may include inevitable errors in addition to the uncertainties in the DLi values. However, Fig. 14 indicates that the DLi values correlate well with the ionic conductivities, in particular, the fast and slow Li diffusion components observed by NMR spectroscopy correspond to the bulk and grain-boundary ionic conductivities of c-LLTO measured using impedance spectroscopy. We have reported the relationship between DLi and σ for garnets, LAGP, and 1 M LiPF6 in propylene carbonate [64]. Fig. 14 indicates that the two components of DLi correspond to the two components of σ observed by impedance spectroscopy for c-LLTO.

It is noted that the DLi-fast values were 9.7 and 16.5 × 10−13 m2 s−1 at 38 °C for t- and c-LLTO, respectively, whereas LAGP gave DLi values of 3.7 and 3.2 × 10−13 m2 s−1 (∆ = 100 and 300 ms, respectively) at 38 °C. At the same temperature, the DLi values of the LLTOs are larger than that of LAGP. For reference, the σ values (bulk) of t-LLTO, c-LLTO and LAGP were 1.0, 1.7 and 0.90 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 38 °C, respectively. A linear relation exists between DLi and σ for these three inorganic oxide electrolytes at 38 °C.

As ion conduction in inorganic electrolytes is driven by the diffusion of Li ions, the Nernst-Einstein equation is given as [69].

It is very important that we can evaluate Nbulk and Ngb for c-LLTO separately and that Ngb is smaller than Nbulk by almost one order of magnitude. The carrier numbers in the bulk are almost the same for c- and t-LLTO. We have reported the temperature-dependent Ncarrier values of LAGP in the same temperature range [63,64] measured at ∆ = 300 and 100 ms as 2.9 and 4.7 × 1022, respectively at 38 °C. In contrast, the carrier numbers are 2.4 × 1022 for t-LLTO and 1.7 and 0.2 × 1022 for bulk and grain diffusion in c-LLTO at 38 °C. The LAGP showed slightly larger carrier numbers than LLTO samples, though the molecular formulae and structures of LAGP (Li1.5Al0.5Ge(PO4)3) and LLTO (Li0.33La0.55TiO3) are different. Previously, we reported that the calculated carrier numbers of LAGP is much larger than the Li number in a unit cell from density [63]. More discussion is necessary on the relationship between the ionic conductivity and Li+ diffusion in inorganic solid electrolytes.

Collision and diffraction echo attenuation patterns have been observed for inorganic solid electrolytes for short ∆. Here we compare the patterns for LAGP, c-LLZO, LLZO-Ta, LLZO-Al-Ta, t-LLTO and c-LLTO. In Fig. 16, diffractive patterns measured under the same experimental conditions (∆ = 15 ms, g = 10 T m−1 (fixed) and δ varied up to 4 ms) are plotted in q-space [m−1] for (a) LATP at 38 °C, (b) c-LLZO (powder and pellet) at 80 °C, (c) LLZO-Ta at 80 °C and LLZO-Al-Ta at 100 °C, (d) t-LLTO at 38 °C and (e) c-LLTO at 38 °C. Owing to the short 7Li T2 of the garnets, these measurements were conducted at temperatures above 70 °C. As described in previous papers, the diffraction patterns are insensitive to temperature. Thus, the collision and diffraction in short observing periods are not thermally activated and these behaviours must be related to the inner structures of Li+ migration channels.

As shown in Fig. 16, LAGP exhibited a deep and sharp dip, suggesting regular inner structures. Among garnets, the c-LLZO pellet and powder samples showed simple patterns with a shallower diffraction. When Ta was included in the garnet samples, the reflection in the diffraction patterns collapsed. Under the same experimental conditions the echo attenuation plots of the LLTO samples did not show a clear diffraction pattern. Furthermore, the minimums in E/E0 values are larger than 0.2 for t-LLTO and slightly smaller than 0.1 for c-LLTO, suggesting that Li+ ions in the LLTO samples encounter grain boundaries. As the results, Li+ ions do not move far from the initial position and remain near the grain boundaries. The PGSE NMR method marks the initial Li+ position with the first PFG and detects the position of the encoded Li+ ions by the second PFG after the interval time ∆. The echo attenuation values do not change significantly with increasing PFG strength (g × δ) suggest that the Li+ ions remain in similar positions. The slightly lower minimum of c-LLTO compared with that for t-LLTO suggests a wider space for Li+ diffusion in c-LLTO. If the grain-boundary effects were negligible, the echo attenuation would become deeper as observed for LAGP. The echo attenuation plots at short ∆ afford information on the inner structures of the Li+ migration pathways in the micrometre space.

The Li+ diffusion behaviours of the LLTO samples are influenced by the grain boundaries. As the diffusion plots are curved at long ∆, they were analysed by two components to give DLi-fast and DLi-slow. It was shown that the DLi-fast and DLi-slow correlate to the σbulk and σgb values of c-LLTO, respectively, which were obtained in the impedance spectroscopy. The Li+ carrier numbers were calculated between 25 and 100 °C. The carrier numbers estimated from the DLi-fast and σbulk in the c- and t-LLTO were similar, and those calculated from the DLi-slow and σgb of c-LLTO were approximately one-order of magnitude smaller. The collision and diffraction patterns observed at ∆ = 15 ms reflect inner structures of Li-migration channels. Owing to the grain-boundary effects in the LLTO samples, the decreases in the echo attenuation plots were much shallower than those in the patterns of garnets and LAGP samples. Finally, important questions remain about carrier numbers calculated from the Nernst-Einstein relation. The NMR methods observe the Li+ diffusion between the time interval ∆ for the encoded species at the first PFG, which is detected by the second PFG. Whereas, the ionic conductivity is the sum of the charged species having velocities. The Nernst-Einstein relation is so easy to be used, but an overestimate of carrier numbers may be possible.
