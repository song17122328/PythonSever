Lithium ion conducting solid electrolytes, lithium aluminum hafnium phosphate  (Li1+xHf2−xAlx(PO4)3, x = 0–0.75) are  prepared via solid state synthesis technique. Thermo-gravimetric analysis indicates that the thermal decomposition and  thermal stability of the reaction mixture is generally affected by a high content of x value substitution. It can be observed  that as x content or aluminum substitution increases, the thermal decomposition and thermal stability increase which  leads to the sample formation towards higher temperature. For X-ray diffraction analysis, the Rietveld refinement analysis  indicates the presence of different types of secondary phases as aluminum content increases. Single phase of lithium  hafnium phosphate  (LiHf2(PO4)3) is only achievable in the absence of any aluminum substitution. Furthermore, for the  lithium ionic conductivity, the findings indicate that conductivity increases with increase in x substitution in lithium  aluminum hafnium phosphate. The highest AC conductivity is observable in the sample with composition x = 0.25 of  about 2.5 × 10−3 Ω−1m−1 with low activation energy 0.36 eV. The present studies recommend the sample with composition x = 0.25  (Li1.25Hf1.75Al0.25(PO4)3) to be a future solid electrolyte material for battery applications.

Lithium based superionic conductors (NASICON-type)  analogs to Sodium Zirconia Phosphate NZP are known  to be fast ionic conductors due to the high mobility of   Li+ ions in its structure. It is a rhombohedra crystal system  with several interesting features and potential applications; which include high ionic conductivity, low thermal  expansion coefficient [1] and thermodynamic stability  [2]. It has a unique property of varied ionic substitution in  its structure that could accommodate many elements in  the periodic table in its lattice without altering the basic  structure. Superionic conductors based on lithium titanium phosphate (Li-Ti2(PO4)3) [3] are the most promising compounds studied in recent decades. Most researches on  superionic conductors were done in the titanium system   LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP). The small size of the  Ti4+ cations makes  the size of the site’s in the channels more appropriate for  lithium cations [4, 5], but instability was reported in the  LTP compounds due to the reduction of  Ti4+ to  Ti3+ by the   Li+ ion which restricts their application in solid state electrolyte [5, 6]. However, it has been reported that  Hf4+ ion  is more stable towards lithium metal and reductive gasses  than the  Ti4+ ion, which is an additional advantage for battery applications [6].

Lithium hafnium phosphate LiHf2(PO4)3 (LHP) material crystallizes in NASICON-type structure, but there is  the problem of the material undergoing a top tactic and 

The microcrystalline materials, lithium aluminum hafnium phosphate  (Li1+xHf2−xAlx(PO4)3, (x = 0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3,  0.4, 0.5 and 0.75) were synthesized by conventional solidstate synthesis technique. Materials of AR grade were  used as basic starting materials,  Li2CO3 (99% Alfa Aesar),   HfO2 (99.9% Alfa Aesar),  (NH4)2HPO4 (98% Alfa Aesar), and   Al2O3 (96% Strem) in a stoichiometric amount. Seven compounds according to the x values were prepared. The stoichiometry mixture is mixed in methanol and ball-mixed for  24 h and then dried in an oven for 24 h. The dried mixtures  were calcined in an alumina crucible at 700 °C for 3 h at  the heating rate of 2 °C  min−1 in air in order to release volatile products such as carbon dioxide, ammonia and also  water content. The overall chemical reaction is given in  Eq. 1. The calcined powders (with uniform size) were made  into pellets by pressing uniaxially at 200 MPa. Sintering  was carried out at 1100 °C for 3 h at the same heating rate  i.e. 2 °C  min−1.

Virgin powders of the specimen (of about 16 mg) were used  for TGA/DTG analysis after ball mixing for 24 h. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried using TGA machine  Metler Toledo Brand, (Model number TGA/DSC HT). The  measurements were carried out in air from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 K min−1.

The phases and structural compositions of the as-prepared samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis using an XRD machine, Philips  X’pert diffractometer  model 7602 EA Almelo with Cu Kα radiation source with  λ = 1.5418 Å. The measurement was carried out at room temperature with 2θ scanning range from 10 to 60°. The interpretation and data analysis of the XRD patterns were conducted for the entire prepared samples sintered at 1100 °C  based on the database of the Inorganic Crystal Structure  Database (ICSD) using High Score X-pert plus software version 3.0e. The lattice parameters and unit cell volume of  LAHP were obtained from the software after the Rietveld  analysis.

In  a  similar  analysis  reported  by  Ahamdu  et  al.  [9],  the thermal analysis of  Na1−xLixZr2(PO4)3 was conducted  with a lighter ion (lithium ion) substitution in the system.  The report indicated that as the content of lithium ion  increases, the percentage of mass loss decreases which  may be associated with very low weight and small size of  the substituted lithium ions.

Thus, for the un-substituted composition (x = 0), a total  mass loss of 20.20% was observed from room temperature  to 800 °C as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 1 where 4.20%  weight loss was observed in region I (onset region) which  is the initial mass loss, 10.87% mass loss in regions II and  III and approximately 5.13% weight loss in region IV which  is the offset region beyond which stability is achieved  suggesting a complete chemical decomposition of the  mixture. Higher percentage weight loss was observed in  regions I and II. The TG curves indicated that LHP (x = 0)  start attaining stability at around 345 °C. The DTG peaks in  Fig. 2 confirm all the decomposition processes occurring  in the TG curve. Similar behavior was observed in the TG  analysis of  Na1−xLixZr2(PO4)3 [15] in terms of mass loss in  the regions I, II, III, and IV.

The curves for compositions x = 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, and 0.4  are equally shown in Fig. 1. All the curves exhibited almost  similar behavior with respective average overall mass loss.  The trend of the curves was observed to be similar as in 

The XRD results of unsubstituted LHP shows the sample powder sintered at 1100 °C for 3 h exhibited single 

For the Al substituted x = 0.2, only one secondary phase  was observed which is  AlPO4 corresponding to ICSD database 98-010-3915. However, as Al substitution is increased  more Al secondary phases were detected. For compositions x = 0.25 and 0.3, other phases were observed; Berlinite  (AlPO4) corresponding to ICSD database 98-002-2357,   AlPO-D corresponding to ICSD database 98-002-6723 and  Aluminum Phosphate  (AlPO4) corresponding to ICSD database 98-002-6280. An additional of two more secondary  phases were detected for x = 0.4 and x = 0.5 which include;   AlPO-31, with ICSD database 98-002-9743 and  AlPO-8 with  ICSD database 98-002-9742. As the number of Al content  increases, the number of secondary phases also increases.  More phases were observed for x = 0.75. These include  lithium Cantena Phosphate  (LiPO3) with ICSD database  98-000-6328 and  AlPO-54 with ICSD database 98-002-3820  from the Rietveld analysis.

The  effect  of  Al  substitution  on  the  lattice  parameters, unit cell volume, and the densities is tabulated in  Table 2. The values of the lattice constants were observed  to decrease due to the Al substitution in the basic structure of the material and this is attributed to the shorter  ionic radius of the substituting  Al+ ion (0.54 Å) compare  to that of the substituted  Hf+ ion (0.71 Å). According to  [19] a limiting difference of radii = 0.1 Å between the ionic  radii is considered a good criterion for the forming a solid  solution, this limit has been considerably exceeded in the  present solid solutions and results in the formation of the  secondary phases. Experimental and theoretical densities  are tabulated in Table 2. All the experimental densities are  more than 90% of the theoretical densities and this may  improve the densification of the samples for higher ionic  conductivity. A similar observation was also reported [6].

The quality of the as-prepared samples was obtained using  the Fourier-transform infrared analysis. Figure 4 depicts  the FTIR spectra of  Li1+xAlxHf2−x(PO4)3 for x = 0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3,  0.4, 0.5 and 0.75 which showed strong bending vibrations  and stretching modes at various positions of the vibration band. The FTIR technique has advantages in identifying phases formed in a compound, structural exposition  and functional group identification. It was reported that  the spectra obtained from the FTIR for a NASICON-type  compound are dominated by strong overlapping inter3−  stretching  modes  of  vibration  which  molecular  PO4 are expected to be within the range of 1300–700 cm−1  [20]. It can be seen that region I is associated with asymmetry stretching vibration band corresponding to the  wavenumber 1100–1227 cm−1 while region II is due to  3− anions  the symmetry stretching vibrations of the  PO4 which is within the wavenumber 900–1000 cm−1. However, the observed absorption bands in region III from  643 to 750 cm−1 are assigned to the symmetry stretching  vibration of P–O–P and region IV is the absorption band  in the range 553–630 cm−1 due to the asymmetry bending vibration modes of O–P–O bonds. Similar behavior for  NASICON-type materials were also reported [21–23]. In  another observation, the modes slightly shifted towards  higher wave number as Al content is increased in the basic  LHP structure. This is attributed to the smaller atomic number of aluminum compared to the substituted hafnium  atomic number. It was reported that absorption modes  shift to higher wavenumbers when a substitution occurs  for materials having low molar mass [24].

The AC conductivity (σac) is one of the electrical parameters used to investigate and analyzed the dynamics of ions  in polycrystalline materials such as NASICON compounds.  The variations of AC conductivity (σac) with frequency of  un-substituted LHP and Al substituted LAHP at room temperature and within the frequency range 40 Hz to 1 MHz  are depicted in Fig. 5. It is well known that AC conductivity, σac of an ionic polycrystalline material at a certain  temperature is always explained in terms of Jonscher′s  power law as described in Eq. (3) [10]. The plots in Fig. 5  give the variation of AC conductivity with frequency in  the log scale. The conductivity is frequency-independent in the low frequency region. However, as frequency  increases, the features of power law () n are observed  in the higher frequency region, where the AC conductivity is frequency dependent. The switch over behavior of  AC conductivity from low frequency plateau region to  higher frequency regime is an indication of an onset conductivity relaxation property of the as-prepared samples.  The increasing trend of AC conductivity with increasing  frequency is associated with the disorder of the Li cations within the sites. The presence of space charge also  contributes to the increase in the conductivity. It is also  observed that the un-substituted LHP pellet showed low  AC conductivity in the order of 2.45 × 10−4 Ω−1m−1 at room  temperature as reported elsewhere [16]. On the other  hand, the Al substituted sintered pellets exhibited high Li  ionic conductivity than the un-substituted LHP. The highest conductivity was observed in the sample with composition x = 0.25 where σac = 2.5 × 10−3 Ω−1m−1. In a similar  study, Morimoto et al. [25] investigated the lithium ionic  conductivity of  Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 LATP with compositions  x = 0, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5 and 0.6. The findings indicated 

The  thermal  decomposition  behaviour  and  stability  properties of the chemical reaction mixtures; lithium aluminum hafnium phosphate (LAHP) with various compositions (x = 0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.75) were established using TGA/DTG. XRD and FTIR identified the various  phases and composition in the as-prepared LAHP. The TGA  results indicated systematic substitution and increase in  the x content in the lithium aluminum hafnium phosphate  (LAHP) reaction mixtures leads to the sample formation  towards higher temperatures. The percentage mass loss  and stability temperature of the reaction mixture increase  as the x content is increased from x = 0 to 0.75. This is confirmed by shifting the DTG peaks to higher temperature.  The XRD analysis confirmed the sample formation with  hexagonal crystal axis belonging to R-3c space group  with ICSD database 98-004-0755. The Rietveld refinement
