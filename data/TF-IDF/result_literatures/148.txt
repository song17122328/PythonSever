NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 is regarded as promising electrode material due to stable structure and large three-dimensional channels. NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite with carbon nanotubes modification (NTP-CNTs) has been synthesized via sol-gel approach and employed for sodium ion battery. Carbon nanotubes have no distinct influence on crystal form of NaTi2(PO4)3. NTP-CNTs displays distinguished cycling and rate performance. NTP-CNTs delivers discharge capacity of 246.2, 220.2, and 183.5 mAh g−1 at 0.04, 0.1, and 2 A g−1, respectively, 60.4, 57.4, and 70.9 mAh g−1 larger than those of bare NTP . Moreover, discharge capacities of NTP and NTP-CNTs are 121.6 and 169.3 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1, respectively. Outstanding electrochemical property may be due to that carbon nanotubes enhance electrical conductivity and dispersibility of NTP-CNTs. Decentralized NaTi2(PO4)3 particles and carbon nanotubes corporately form three-dimensional conductive network with good dispersion, which is beneficial to accelerating the migration of sodium ions and electrons.
Human beings have to face the serious problems of energy shortage and environmental pollution in the twenty-first century. Due to the continuous development of non-renewable resources such as coal and oil, air pollution in modern cities is more serious than last century. At present, researchers are looking for other energies, such as tide, wind, and solar energy, to replace conventional fuels [1, 2]. However, the geographical environment and other factors restrict the further development of these green energies. With the energy storage equipment development, these green energies can achieve efficient utilization [3–7]. Since 1991, commercial lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been used successfully [8–12]. However, the commercial LIBs cannot meet the demand for future using of large-scale energy storage devices in new electric vehicles [13, 14]. At present, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have demonstrated more advantages than LIBs for large-scale applications [15]. SIBs show similar electrochemical behavior with LIBs, and reserves of sodium are considerable on earth [16–19]. Due to the understanding of lithium-based electrochemical system, rechargeable SIBs as substitute of LIBs show rapid development [20–22].
During past years, attentions of researchers have been paid to seek suitable anode and cathode materials for SIBs [23, 24]. V arious cathode materials have been reported, such as transition metal oxides [25–27], phosphates [28], and Prussian blue [29, 30]. In addition, as counterpart to the cathode, hard carbons [31, 32], transition metal sulfide [18, 33], and NASICON-type phosphates [34] as anode materials for SIBs have also been developed. Among them, due to excellent electrochemical properties and multifunctional structure, NASICON-type phosphates have attracted more and more attention as promising anode for SIBs [35]. According to Zhu’s report, Na3V2(PO4)3/C/TiO2 was prepared by electrospinning process and demonstrated good reversible capacity of 164.8 mAh g−1 at 89 mA g−1 after 100 cycles [36].Wang et al. [37] synthesized NaZr2(PO4)3 through solid state reaction, and the specific discharge capacity remained 123 mAh g−1 at 20 mA g−1 after 100 cycles. Zhan et al. [38] prepared NASICON-structure Mn0.5Ti2(PO4)3 as anode by sol-gel method for SIBs. This material showed discharge capacity of 75.9 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles.
NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 possesses similar structure to Na3V2(PO4)3, which can avoid sodium deposition as anode and reduce the probability of forming solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Therefore, it exhibits good safety and high coulombic efficiency [39]. In addition, NaTi2(PO4)3 shows two discharge plateaus at 2.1 V and 0.4 V vs. Na/Na+, corresponding to two intercalation/deintercalation processes [40]. As anode material for SIBs, low electronic conductivity essentially limits further application of NaTi2(PO4)3, although symmetric NASICON structure effectively guarantees rapid permeation of sodium ions [41]. Li et al. [42] designed and prepared NaTi2(PO4)3/graphene through simple sol-gel process, which demonstrated good reversible capacity of 102 mAh g−1 after 700 cycles at 100 mA g−1 in SIBs. According to other reports, NaTi2(PO4)3 showed enhancement in electron conductivity by combining with carbon coating on surface of the material particles [34, 43–45]. Pang et al. [46] reported the carbon coated NaTi2(PO4)3 electrode, which delivered reversible capacity of 101 mAh g−1 for 1000 cycles at the rate of 0.2 C.
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with the advantages of large surface and good electrical conductivity have been widely used as conductive agents [47]. There are many application fields of carbon nanotubes, such as lithium ion battery, sodium ion battery, fuel cell, etc. [48, 49] Herein, CNTs decorated NaTi2(PO4)3/C nanomaterial as anode for SIBs are successfully prepared by a sol-gel method, and the prepared process is shown in Fig. 1. Electrochemical properties of NaTi2(PO4)3/C modified with CNTs are investigated in detail.
First, 0.3404 g CH3COONa∙3H2O and 20 mL ethanol were mixed together and dissolved evenly by ultrasonication to form solution A. 1.7202 g Ti(OC4H9)4 and 20 mL ethanol were blended by magnetic stirring (solution B). 15 mL ethanol and 0.8566 g concentrated H3PO4 were blended under ultrasonication (solution C). Then, solution A, 1 mL concentrated HCl, and 0.1800 g phenolic resin (carbon source) were put into solution B, successively. Solution C was added dropwise to solution B using separatory funnel. After completing addition, the beaker sealed with plastic wrap was kept at 55 °C for 3 h under stirring condition. Then the mixture was heated and dried at 80 °C in drying oven to obtain the precursor. The precursor was ground and calcined at 750 °C for 5 h with argon atmosphere (heating rate: 5 ° C m i n−1). The NaTi2(PO4)3/C composite was denoted as NTP . The preparation process of carbon nanotubes modified NaTi2(PO4)3/C (NTP-CNTs) was the same as the preparation of NTP . The only difference was that 0.05 g carbon nanotubes were added in the solution B after adding HCl solution.
The crystal information of NTP and NTP-CNTs were acquired by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation using X-ray diffractometer (D/MAX2500PC, Rigaku). Transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100F) and scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Japan) were used to characterize the microstructure and morphology of the materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-Alpha) with Al-Kα radiation was carried out to characterize surface chemistry of the materials. Raman spectra were inspected using LabRAM Aramis spectrometer (HORIBA). The content of carbon and carbon nanotubes of samples was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TG50, Shimadzu).
The electrochemical performance of two samples was tested by CR2016-type half of cell with metal sodium disk as counter electrode, and NTP or NTP-CNTs as working electrode. Glass fiber was used as separating membrane. 1 M NaClO4 dissolved in mixture solvent (ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate (1:1:1 volumetric), and 5% fluoroethylene carbonate) was utilized as electrolyte. 70 wt% active materials (NTP or NTP-CNTs), 15 wt% adh esive agent (polyvinylidene fluoride), and 15 wt% conductive agent (super P) were mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent to acquire slurry. After that, the slurry was coated onto copper foil and put in vacuum oven for 8 h at 80 °C. Then it was cut into circular piece in diameter of 14 mm to form working electrode. The cell was constructed in glove box, which was full of Ar. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement with the voltage between 0.01 V and 3.0 V was performed on electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China) at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1. Neware battery testing system (CT-3008 W, Shenzhen Neware Electronics Co., Ltd.) was used to test charge-discharge performance of cells with voltage region of 0.01–3 V . Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements with the frequency range of 0.01– 100,000 Hz were also performed on CHI660E electrochemical workstation. Before EIS measurements, assembled cells were activated at 0.04 A g−1 for 5 cycles and then charged at voltage of 2.1 V for 2 h.
XRD patterns of NTP and NTP-CNTs samples are shown in Fig. 2. As observed, there are no remarkable miscellaneous peaks, and both composites have analogous diffraction peaks, which correspond well to orthorhombic NaTi2(PO4)3 (JCPDS no.01–084-2008). This result indicates that obtained NaTi2(PO4)3 is pure phase and CNTs modification cannot influence the crystal phase of NaTi2(PO4)3. Moreover, no other obvious peaks for carbon nanotubes were detected, which is ascribed to that the mass of added carbon nanotubes is small.
SEM was employed to evaluate morphology of NTPCNTs, and the images in different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3a and b. As can be seen, the agglomeration of primary particles results in an increase in the size of the secondary particles. Carbon nanotubes and NaTi2(PO4)3 particles are interlaced dispersion to form a three-dimensional conductive network. Figure 3c and d present TEM images of CNTs and NTP-CNTs. The carbon nanotubes exhibit elongated hollow tubular structure. And the diameter of carbon nanotubes varies from 10 to 30 nm. As can be seen in Fig. 3d, N a T i2(PO4)3 particles and carbon nanotubes link with each other, forming a continuous conductive network. The conductive network accelerates the transfer of electrons and sodium ions, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance of the composite.
To analyze element species of the sample surface, XPS measurement of NTP-CNTs was conducted. Figure 4 displays XPS full spectrum of NTP-CNTs composite. The peaks are located at 134.0, 285.1, 460.0, 531.9, and 1071.9 eV , corresponding to P 2p, C 1 s, Ti 2p, O 1 s, and Na 1 s, respectively. This verifies the existence of P , C, Ti, O, and Na elements of the composite, which is consistent with the component of NTP - CNTs.
To evaluate surface carbon structure, Raman spectroscopy measurement was performed. Figure 5 shows spectra of two samples. Two recognizable peaks are located at about 1600 and 1350 cm−1, correlating to G band and D band, separately. G band is connected with sp2 ordered graphitic carbon, and D band is corresponding to sp3 disordered carbon. The value of ID/IG for NTP and NTP-CNTs is 0.961 and 0.935, separately. The difference in ID/IG can reveal degree of graphitization. The lower value of NTP-CNTs results from the addition of carbon nanotubes with high graphitization degree of carbon.
The composition of NTP and NTP-CNTs was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. The TGA curves for two samples are displayed in Fig. 6. As observed, there is little decrease of weight at > 200 °C corresponding to the evaporation of water. The next large weight decrease is ascribed to the burning of carbon. Calculation indicates that the carbon content of NTP is 6.5%, and the content of carbon nanotubes of NTP-CNTs is 4.8%. As can be known, the proper carbon can raise the electrical conductivity, and the introduction of carbon nanotubes can further improve the electrode performance.
CV measurements were used to study insertion/extraction progress of sodium ions, and the results are shown in Fig. 7. There are two pairs of well-defined redox peaks in potential range of 0.01–3 V for two composites. The large peaks located at 1.83–2.34 V correspond to redox reaction of Ti4+/Ti3+ [50]. The corresponding reduction and oxidation peak current densities for NTP-CNTs are 0.38 and 0.68 A g−1 and 0.08 and 0.12 A g−1 larger than those for NTP , indicating excellent sodium storage performance of NTP-CNTs. Another pair of oxidation and reduction peaks appears at 0.11–0.65 V , corresponding to redox reaction of Ti3+/Ti2+ [51]. As can be seen, redox peak current densities of NTP-CNTs show a significant increase than those of NTP , further explaining higher electrochemical performance of NTP-CNTs. The enhancement of electrochemical performance may be due to that carbon nanotubes improve conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3/C materials. In addition, good dispersivity of NaTi2(PO4)3 particles because of adding carbon nanotubes is beneficial for transfer process of sodium ions.
To study the impact of CNTs modification on electrochemical kinetics of active substances, EIS tests of half cell were carried out. The results are displayed in Fig. 8. As shown , any Nyquist curve consists of intercept on Z’axis in high frequency region, a semicircle in middle frequency region, and an inclined line in low frequency region, corresponding to ohmic resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct), and Warburg impedance (Zw), separately. Obviously, NTP-CNTs exhibits smaller Rct (191.7 Ω) compared with NTP (342.6 Ω), which demonstrates that the addition of carbon nanotubes can obviously accelerate charge transfer process. Besides, Rs of NTPCNTs is 8.7 Ω, a n d Rs of NTP is 18.2 Ω. After the addition of carbon nanotubes, the Rs of NTP-CNTs decreases compared with NTP , which may be due to that carbon nanotubes contribute to enhancement of electrical conductivity of composite and formation of three-dimensional conductive network [48].
 Galvanostatic charge-discharge test of two samples was carried out at different current densities, as exhibited in Fig. 9a. A s shown, NTP-CNTs demonstrates higher discharge capacities compared with NTP at all current densities. NTP-CNTs delivers the discharge capacities of 246.2, 220.2, and 183.5 mAh g−1 at 0.04, 0.1, and 2 A g−1, separately, with obvious increase of 60.4, 57.4, and 70.9 mAh g−1 at equivalent current densities compared with NTP . When current density comes back to 0.1 A g−1, d i s charge capacity of NTP-CNTs can attain 99.8% of its original capacity, larger than that of NTP (96.7%). This demonstrates that rate performance of NTP-CNTs is obviously improved. Figure 9b and c present charge-discharge curves of NTP and NTP-CNTs. Two voltage plateaus appear for both composites at about 0.4 and 2.1 V . The voltage plateaus for NTP-CNTs are wider and more stable than those for NTP. This reveals outstanding electrochemical performance of NTP-CNTs.
To explain the effect of carbon nanotubes on conductivity of NTP-CNTs, graphic illustration of transfer mechanism of electrons and sodium ions in NTP and NTP-CNTs is shown in Fig. 10. The transmission path of electrons and sodium ions in NTP electrode is random and irregular, causing lower conductivity. The transmission of sodium ions in NTP-CNTs electrode is also disordered. However, the electron transport is more ordered and transmitted along the carbon nanotubes. With carbon nanotubes as conductive additives, the conductivity of NTP-CNTs can be enhanced. This shows positive effect on enhancing electrochemical performance of materials.
To evaluate the stability properties of NTP and NTP-CNTs samples, the charge and discharge tests were conducted for 500 cycles at 1 A g−1, and Fig. 11a shows the results. Discharge capacities for NTP-CNTs sample are higher than those of NTP sample. Discharge capacity for NTP-CNTs sample can maintain at 169.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 after 500 cycles, which is 47.7 mAh g−1 larger compared with NTP sample. Clear distinction between NTP and NTP-CNTs samples explains that electrochemical performance of resultant nanomaterials is significantly enhanced by CNTs decoration. To further verify the structure stability of NTP-CNTs, SEM images of NTP-CNTs after 100, 300, and 500 cycles at 1 A g−1 are shown in Fig. 11b-11d. As observed, the surface of NTP-CNTs electrode is smooth and has no significant changes after different cycles, which demonstrates high stability of NTP-CNTs after 500 cycles.
In summary, NaTi2(PO4)3/C modified with carbon nanotubes was successful synthesized through a mild sol-gel method. NaTi2(PO4)3 particles and carbon nanotubes are interlaced distribution, and link with each other, forming a threedimensional conductive network. The addition of carbon nanotubes increases conductivity of NTP-CNTs and makes the particles better dispersed. NTP-CNTs exhibits great cycling and rate capability compared with NTP . Discharge capacities of NTP-CNTs at 0.04, 0.1, and 2 A g−1 are 246.2, 220.2, and 183.5 mAh g−1, separately, much higher than those of NTP (60.4, 57.4, and 70.9 mAh g−1). In addition, NTPCNTs shows outstanding long period cycling performance. NTP-CNTs delivers discharge capacity of 169.3 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1, which increases by 47.7 mAh g−1 contrasted with NTP . These excellent electrochemical performances may be due to that conductive network formed by NaTi2(PO4)3 particles, and carbon nanotubes can accelerate the transfer of electrons and sodium ions.
