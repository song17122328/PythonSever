In this paper, Na3V2-xMox(PO4)3@C including sol-gel and solid was successfully prepared through two steps method, state thermal reduction.
The optimal doping amount of Mo was deﬁned by experiment.
When x was 0.15, the Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C sample has the best cycle performance and rate performance.
The discharge capacity of Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C could reach 117.26 mA$h$g-1 at 0.1 C.
The discharge capacity retention was found to be 94.5% after 600 cycles at 5 C.
The requirement of energy is more and more urgent with the development of the society.
Renewable energy sources, such as the wind energy and the solar energy, are hopeful to support this requirement.
However, they are all affected by intermittent natural conditions and the cost-effective energy storage solutions are needed.
After development for many years, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are more and more skillful and the applications of LIBs to electric vehicles (EVs) and large-scale energy storage systems (EESs) show great advantages [2–5].
However, when taking many factors such as cost, abundance, energy density into consideration, the largescale applications of LIBs are not satisfactory.
Based on this consideration, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) attract attention as they show more advantages than LIBs.
First, the reserve of sodium is twenty times than that of lithium.
Second, sodium carbonate (0.07–0.37 £/kg) is much cheaper than lithium carbonate (4.11–4.49 £/kg).
Furthermore, sodium and lithium are alkali metals and they have many similar properties.
So, developing SIBs can adopt similar theories and technologies of LIBs.
Till now, developing suitable electrode materials which have similar storage capacity, cycling life and rate capability as LIBs do for SIBs is still a great challenge.
Although both sodium and lithium are alkali metals, compared with Li+ (0.76 Å), Na+ (1.02 Å) has larger ionic radius and severer structure degradation in the charge/ discharge progress, leading to poor cycle performance and rate performance [16–17].
Up to now, many materials which could be applied in SIBs as cathode materials, such as Na0.7Fe0.7Mn0.3O2, NaxCoO2, NaFePO4, NaxMnO2 and Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) [22–30], have been investigated.
Among these materials, the discharge voltage plateau of NVP is about 3.4 V (the same as LiFePO4) and is relatively higher compared with other sodium cathode materials.
In addition, the empty space made up of large interstitial channels will well facilitate the Na+ transport in the NVP crystal structure.
Unfortunately, NVP has a poor electronic conductivity like Li3V2(PO4)3 and LiFePO4, which results in poor cycle performance and rate performance.
At present, three main methods are used to improve the performance of electrode materials.
The ﬁrst is to reduce the size of the material to nanoscale.
The second is to formate a hybrid electrode material with carbon or other conductive materials.
As for NVP, according to the reported papers, compounding with carbon or other conductive material is the most commonly used method.
More recently, doping other cations to substitute V to improve the electrochemical performance of NVP has aroused more interest of researchers.
A good ionic and electronic conductivity was obtained when Cr, Ni, and Mg were used, resulting in improved rate and cycle performance.
The increase of capacity and theoretical energy density could also be achieved by doping Fe and Al.
In this paper, Mo was chosen as a dopant to partially substitute V in NVP.
As we know, Mo3+ (83 pm) has a larger ionic radius than V3+ (78 pm), which may bring a larger channels and pathways for the transportation of Na+ in the crystal lattice and result in an improved dynamicperformance.
The Mo-doped high crystalline NVP nanoparticles wrapped in carbon layer (named MoNVP@C hereafter) were synthesized through two steps of sol–gel method and solid state thermal reduction method.
By adjusting different dosages of the doped Mo, a series of Mo-NVP@C materials were prepared.
The electrochemical performance of as-synthesized materials applied as the cathode of SIBs was investigated.
Experimental2.1 Synthesis of Mo-NVP@C nanocompositesTwo steps of the sol–gel method and the solid state thermal reduction method were used to prepare the Mo-NVP@C composites.
In the ﬁrst step, precursor gel was obtained by hydrothermal reaction which makes the components mixed homogeneously.
NH4VO3, molybdenum acetylacetonate, Na2CO3 and NH4H2PO4 [(2 – x):x:1.5:3 by molar ratio (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25)] were added into 40 mL distilled water with strenuous stirring at room temperature to form yellow solution.
Then, 5 mL ethylene glycol was added into the above solution.
The ethylene glycol acted as a gel formation reagent and the carbon resource in the later process.
The solution was continuously strenuously stirred for 30 min.
After that, the mixed yellow solution was placed into a 60 mL Teﬂon vessel which was positioned in a stainless-steel autoclave.
The autoclave was transferred into an oven which temperature kept at 180°C lasting for 24 h.
After the oven was cooled to the room temperature, a blue gel was got in the vessel.
The blue gel was dried in an oven at 120°C for 12 h.
After that, the gray NVP precursor was obtained.
Subsequently, the gray NVP precursor was ground into powder, pre-heated at 350°C for 3 h and then further calcined at 850°C for 6 h in the ﬂow of Ar/H2 atmosphere.
After cooling to room temperature, the MoNVP@C sample was obtained.
It was obvious that the position of the peak was shifted with doping, indicating that Mo has entered the NVP lattice.
In order to further explore the structure change by the Mo doping, Rietveld reﬁnement was conducted for Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3 samples (Fig.1) and other Mo-NVP@C samples by using the GSAS program suite within the R-3c space group.
The structure of NVP could be regarded as three [PO4] tetrahedrons sharing one corner of each octahedron [VO6].
A highly covalent three-dimensional framework is constituted by [VO6] octahedrons and [PO4] tetrahedrons together.
The three-dimensional framework can provide channels and pathways for the transport of electron and Na+.
Moreover, it needs to identify the doping site of Mo for the two-possibility sites (Na and V).
The preferred doping site in polyanion can be predicated by the following formula:where, XM and XM1(2) are electronegativity values of the dopant and the substituted ions, respectively; rM and rM1(2) are ionic radii of the dopant and the substituted ions, respectively.
The morphologies and sizes of the sample were observed by a Hitachi-S-4800 ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope and a FEI-TECNAI-G2 transmission electron microscope, respectively.
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results were also obtained by using the Hitachi-S-4800 ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were got via a JEOL-2010 transmission electron microscope.
Electrochemical measurements of NVP@CThe electrochemical performance of the Mo-NVP@C samples were measured through 2032-type coin cells whose counter electrode was sodium foils
The oxygen and moisture levels of the glove box were no more than 1 and 0.1 ppm, respectively.
Active materials, super P and PVDF (80:10:10 by weight) were mixed into N-methylpyrrolidone solvent forming uniformly mixed slurry for preparing the working electrode.
Following it was transformed into a vacuum oven to dry at 110°C for 12 h.
The electrodes possess a mass loading of the active materials about 1.0–1.2 mg$cm–2. The electrolyte was 1 mol$L–1 NaClO4 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (1:1:1, volume ratio).
A CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai, China) was used to test cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
Figure S1(a) shows XRD patterns of the Mo-NVP@C samples and the peaks can be indexed in rhombohedral phase of NVP.
No other peaks related to carbon could be the carbon in Mo-NVP@C found, demonstrating thatFig.

To identify the content of Mo, Mo-NVP@C was characterized by EDS and the results are shown in Fig.
From the spectra, elements of C, V, Na, Mo, O and P were clearly observed in the doped NVP.
The speciﬁc content of Mo was illustrated in the inset table of Fig.
With the increase of the dosage of Mo, the content of Mo in MoNVP@C samples was increased too.
SEM was applied to characterize morphologies and the structure of prepared Mo-NVP@C samples.
Figures 4(a)–4 (f) represented images of prepared Na3V2 – xMox(PO4)3@C samples at high magniﬁcation with x for 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25, respectively.
The samples were the same with each other which constituted by nanoparticles with the average size of about 200 nm.

These nanosized particles could decrease the path way of Na+ and beneﬁt the Na+ diffusion.
Many holes were formed for the accumulation of particles.
It could enlarge the speciﬁc surface area of Mo-NVP@C samples [27,43–44].
Figures 4 (g)–4(l) represented images of the prepared Mo-NVP@C samples at low magniﬁcation with x = 0–0.25, respectively.

The morphology of the samples is of 2–4 μm sphere constructed by nanoparticles.
To obtain more detailed information of the prepared Mo-NVP@C samples, TEM and HRTEM were applied to characterize the samples.
The porous structure facilitates for both the inﬁltration of electrolyte and the transformation of ions.
Figures 5(b)–5(d) show HRTEM images of the Mo-NVP@C (x = 0.15) sample.
Clear lattice fringes could be observed in the HRTEM images.
The distances between neighboring lattice fringes were 0.625, 0.44 and 0.31 nm, which consist with the (012), (104) and (024) planes of rhombohedral phased NVP, respectively.
In addition, a layer of carbon with an average thickness of 7 nm covered on the NVP particles could be observed clearly in Fig.5(b).
This layer of carbon could not only restrict the size of NVP at nanoscale, but also enhance the electrical conductivity of materials.
To better obtain the detailed information of the layer of carbon covered on NVP, Raman spectroscopy was performed on prepared Mo-NVP@C samples.
The peak located at 1359 cm–1 represented D band which was caused by disordered carbon.
Another peak located at 1587 cm–1 stood for G band related to graphite carbon.
The two bands were further deconvoluted into four peaks byFig.5 (a) TEM image and (b)(c)(d) HRTEM images of asprepared Mo-NVP@C sample (x = 0.15).
The D3 and D4 modes are attributed to interstitial defects of disordered carbon and sp2-sp3 stretching vibrations of polyene-like structures.
The ratios of the integrated areas (ID1/IG) are 3.9, 3.2, 3.3, 3.9, 3.8 and 3.8 for Mo-Na3V2 – x(PO4)3@C samples with the x values of 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25, respectively, indicating a high disordered carbon phase.
To better understand the electrochemical performances of as-prepared Mo-NVP@C samples, CR2032 coin-type batteries were assembled and measured.
The CV curves of fresh Mo-NVP@C electrodes were shown in Fig.7(a).
There was one oxidation (desodiation) peak located at 3.5 V caused by theFig.

phase conversion from NVP to NaV2(PO4)3. However, two split peaks located at 3.3 and 3.2 V were observed in the reduction (sodiation) process, which may originate from the transfer of Na1 to Na2 in the NVP structure for heat release during the discharge–charge process.
The average voltage was in agreement with the equilibrium voltage of V4+/V3+ redox couple in this compound (3.40 V vs.Na+/ Na).
No other paired oxidation/reduction peaks were observed in the CV curves, indicating that Mo did not participate in the electrochemical reaction, which consists with Mo-doped LiFePO4/C sample.
It also should be pointed out that the voltage separation of the redox couple has a minimum value of 0.17 V when x = 0.15. As the minor voltage separation means a good reversibility of theelectrode, the Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C sample will have a better cycling performance.
The initial discharge capacities of the six samples were 104.62, 102.77, 102.57, 102.48, 101.40 and 100.32 mA$h$g–1 with x of 0.15, 0.10, 0.05, 0.20, 0.25 and 0, respectively, and after 600 cycles, the corresponding discharge capacities were 97.85, 93.41, 91.20, 82.71, 75.13 and 67.56 mA$h$g–1. Corresponding capacity retention rates were 94.5%, 90.9%, 88.9%, 80.7%, 74.1% and 67.3%, which are shown in Table 1. According to the result, the stability ofFig.

Mo-NVP@C samples was better than that of the NVP@C sample.
And when x was 0.15, the Mo-NVP@C sample obtained the best electrochemical performances.
The sample showed 112.1, 110.5, 107.4, 102.1, 96.8, 83.4 and 69.7 mA$h$g–1 discharge capacities at the current rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 C, respectively.
When the current rate turned back to 0.5 C, the discharge capacity was 111.7 mA$h$g–1. In addition, at the small current rate (0.5 or 1 C), the discharge capacity difference of the six samples was tiny.
With the increase of the current rate, the discharge capacity difference was increased.
In order to study kinetics process of the prepared Mo-NVP@C electrode, EIS tests were carried out at the frequency range from 106 to 10–2 Hz.
Nyquist plots as well as ﬁtted equivalent electrical circuit of the fresh cells of Mo-NVP@C electrode were shown in Figs.9(b) and S3. The Nyquist plots were made up of a straight line in the low-frequency region which represent the Warburg resistance (Wo) and a semicircle in the high-frequency regionTable 1 Capacity retention of as-prepared Mo-NVP@C samples at 1 and 5 C for 200 and 600 cyclesValue of xCapacity retention/%Capacity retention/%slope of the straight line in the low-frequency region, which is larger than that of the sample with x = 0.10 and 0.20. Therefore, a suitable Mo doping quantity for NVP will improve its electrochemical performance.
On the basis of the experiment results, optimal doping amount of Mo was selected.
Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C sample had the best cycle performance and rate performance.
The discharge capacity of Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C could reach 117.26 mA$h$g–1 at the current rate of 0.1 C.
A steady long-cycle life at 5 C for about 600 cycles was observed.
The discharge capacity could even keep 94.5% of the initial capacity.
The outstanding performance of the as-prepared Na3V1.85Mo0.15(PO4)3@C sample could result from follows: Firstly, the doping Mo was good for overcoming the kinetics restrictions.
Secondly, the carbon covered on Mo-NVP@C particles could not only restrict the size at nanoscale, but also enhance electrical conductivity.
Thirdly, porous structure of Mo-NVP@C could enlarge contact area of electrode/electrolyte.
