This  paper  describes  a  simple  procedure  to  synthesize  materials  with NASICON-like structures, using starch as a mild combustion  fuel.  The  results  of  ICP-MS,  x-ray  and  Raman  spectroscopy  present that the samples can be classified as a solid solution and  isostructural  to  Li2Co2(MoO4)3.  The  analysis  by  x-ray  diffraction  shows  that  the  increase  on  starch  amount  promotes  crystallinity,  leading  to  diffraction  peaks  more  intense  and  better  defined.  Moreover,  we  can  infer  that  the  amount  of  starch  increases  substantially  the  material  capacity  (5  mAhg-1  to  52  mAhg-1),  as  well leads to a better definition of the redox peaks.     

The evolution of humanity and the human necessity for cells capable of storing energy  did  the  researches  for  batteries  have  been  widely  studied  over  the  past  decades  by  scientists and multinationals. In this class there are the rechargeable batteries and the ion  lithium batteries have featured because they have smaller dimensions and greater energy  density.       Rechargeable lithium batteries have revolutionized portable electronic devices. They  have become the dominant power source for cell phones, digital cameras, laptops etc.,  because of their superior energy density (capability to store 2– 3 times the energy per unit  weight and volume compared with conventional rechargeable batteries). The worldwide  market for rechargeable lithium batteries is now valued at 10 billion dollars per annum  and growing. They are the technology of choice for future hybrid electric vehicles, which  are central to the reduction of CO2 emissions arising from transportation (1).       Based  on  that,  the  search  for  cathodes  of  lithium-ion  batteries  follows  the  rapidly  developing, especially the research for a material that has a high performance, is safe and  clean, but to achieve these objectives there is a strong dependence of the materials used.       Therefore,  the  research  for  cathode  materials  are  more  developed  than  for  anode  materials,  whereas  most  of  the  batteries  have  the  carbon  as  anode  and  this  material  presents experimental load capacity of 366 mAhg-1 (2) or higher. Among the cathodes  LiCoO2  is  the  most  widely  used  commercially.  It  has  experimental  load  capacity  of  ~130  mAhg-1  (3).  In  other  words,  the  cathodes  are  the  limit  of  lithium-ion  batteries  capacity,  and  so  much  is  being  invested  in  research  by  such  materials,  to  improve  its  capacity.       In 1980, Mizushima et al. (4) proposed the use of transition metal oxides for battery  cathodes and since then, several transition metal oxides have been proposed for use in 

batteries, especially lithium-ion, among  these, bi-dimensional oxides such as LiCoO2 (5),  LiNiO2  (6), LiMnO2  (7),  LiV2O5  (8),  as  the  three-dimensional  spinel  LiMn2O4  (9)  and  quite recently the use of polyanions as olivine (10) and NASICONs (11) were reported,  demonstrating  low  cost  and  their  superior  electrochemical  proprieties  as  positive  electrodes.       Recent studies (11) demonstrate that LiSICON type structures LiM'2(XO4)3 [M '= Ni,  Co, Mn, Fe, Ti or V and X = S, P, As, Mo or W] are good candidates as cathodes for  lithium ion batteries, due to their high ionic conductivity. These properties are attributed  to  the  crystal  structure  of  this  extraordinary  family  composed  by  tetrahedra  XO4  and  octahedra MO6 both exhibited relatively strong connections (12).       This  work  aims  to  develop  a  new  methodology  for  the  synthesis  of  LiSICON   Li2Co2(MoO4)3,  using  starch  as  a  mild  combustion  fuel,  as  well  as  to  study  the  dependence of different amounts of starch in synthesis and electrochemical capacity of  Li2Co2(MoO4)3. 

The  synthesis  were  performed  by  dissolving  1.00  g  of  Co(NO3)2.6H2O,  0.26  g  of  LiNO3, 0.91 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24.4H2O in 10 mL of water. The molar ratio (cobalt/starch)  quantities were 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:6 with cobalt.       Then the solution was homogenized in ultrasonic probe (Sonics, Power 130 W) with  an amplitude of 50 % during 10 minutes with pulse of 15 s each 50 s. After that time we  observed the formation of a gel which was dried 120 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the dried  sample was calcinated at 300 °C for 1 hour and after further homogenization it continued  to be calcinated for about 5 h at 600 °C.       The final product was structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) ( Bruker  AXS  D8  Advanced),  Raman  spectroscopy  (Raman  Systems,  Inc.  model  R-3000  CN)  mass  spectrometry  with  induced  argon  plasma  (ICP-MS)  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific   XSERIES  2).  The  electrochemical  characterization  (Autolab  model  Microautolab Type  III), was performed by using, a three-electrode cell: working prepared from the mixture  of  the  Li2Co2(MoO4)3  (80  %  by  weight),  carbon  black  (10  %)  and  PVDF  (poly  (vinylidene fluoride)) (10 %), Ag wire was pseudo-reference electrode and Pt as counter  electrode.  As  a  supporting  electrolyte  was  used  a  1.0  molL-1  solution  of  lithium  perchlorate in acetonitrile. All measurements were performed at 5 mVs-1. 

The  traditional  solid  state  reaction  synthesis  of  LiSICON  need  a  temperature  of       1200 ºC and 12 hours of calcination, but when is used a mild combustion like starch this  parameters decrease.       This  occurs,  because  the  use  of  starch  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  starch-OH  groups  interact with the ions of the solution, thus forming a complex with gel appearance. Upon  heating this gel at low temperatures, the oxide particles grows slowly due to the smaller  space between the ions, so the formation of small particles occurs. At higher temperatures  the starch breaks down, and then the oxide particles grow and larger and defined crystals  are formed. 

The phase identification through structure analysis of the samples were carried out by  x-ray diffraction using CuKα radiation (λ=1.540562 Å) at 40 Kv / 40 mA. The diffraction  patterns were recorded at room temperature in the range 5-60º (2 31)) in steps of 0.05 s-1.  The results reveals that all samples synthesized have the same profile and can be indexed  as  orthorhombic  compound  Li2Co2(MoO4)3  [space  group:  Pnma  (62)]  (ICSD  Ref  #  401169). Moreover, the peaks are in good agreement with the literature (13).        The unit-cell parameters calculated and refined by refinement program (ICSD using  Powder Cell) (14), compared with literature (13), are present in table 1. It´s reveals that  increasing amount of starch, representing an increase of cell volume, thus suggests that a  larger amount of lithium ions can be inserted in the 3D framework.      TABLE I: Refined lattice constants and volume from LiSICON Li2Co2(MoO4)3 

It  can  also  be  seen  (figure  1)  that  the  increase  in  starch  amount  promotes  an  increasing in crystallinity, promoting a better intensity and definition of the diffraction  peaks due to crystalline growth.       The LiSICON Li2Co2(MoO4)3 consist of five different coordination polyhedral: two of  them are crystallographically independent, MoO4 tetrahedra with near-ideal Mo-O bond  distances. Lithium and cobalt are distributed in the remaining three polyhedral, two of  them octahedral [M(1) and M(2)] and the third is trigonal-prismatic [M(3)] (15).

The ICP-MS analysis revealed that samples containing 1:1 and 1:2 Co: Starch showed  a ratio of 1 mol of cobalt for each 1.3 mol of molybdenum and samples containing 1:4  and  1:6  (mol-cobalt/mol-starch)  had  a  mole  ratio  of  cobalt  for  each  1.4  mol  of  molybdenum. This slight difference between the experimental and theoretical result can  be attributed to the reagents impurities.  

The Raman spectroscopy analysis of the samples (figure 2) shows that principal bands  of the spectra are in good agreement with the literature (16) (table 2). We observed, for  all  molar  ratio,  that  the  region  of  882-995  cm-1  present  symmetric  (ν1)  (882  cm-1)  and  asymmetric  (ν3)  (995  cm-1)  vibrations  of  the  tetrahedra  formed  by  molybdenum  and  oxygen.  The  bands  around  360  cm-1  are  assigned  to  the  bending  vibrations  MoO4  tetrahedra. We also observed, for de molar ratio 1:2 (B), 1:4 (C) and 1:6 (D), at 662 cm-1  vibration links relating to Li-O-Co and also at 465 cm-1 for vibrations corresponding to  the bindings Mo-Co-O (16). The fact that the sample 1:1(A) not exhibit these bands is an  indication that there is probably formation of secondary products on a larger scale than in  other  samples,  this  may  contribute  to  an  electrochemical  result  different  for  the  others  compounds, how to be demonstrate in the next topic.

The  cyclic  voltammetry  (CV)  of  all  samples  was  performed  with  a  pretreatment  of     60 s in 0 V. It’s possible, observing the figure 3, to infer that the sample with molar ratio  1:1 (figure 3A) was the only one that did not exhibit reversible electrochemical behavior.  On the other hand, those samples with molar ratio 1:2 (figure 3B), 1:4 (figure 3C) and 1:6  (figure 3D) showed two oxidation peaks at a 0.87 V on the oxidation of Mo4+/Mo6+ and  one at 1.25 V which is the oxidation of Co2+/Co3+ and two reduction peaks one in at 0.70  V related in reduction of Mo6+/Mo4+ and one in 0.91 V in the reduction of Co2+/Co3+.

The cyclic voltammogram of 1:1 Co-Starch (figure 3A) sample shows an irreversible  electrochemical profile, the first oxidation of Co2+/Co3+ was observed at 1.45 V during 

the first anodic scan. During the cathodic scan after first oxidation, the reduction of Co3+  was observed as a single peak at about 1.1 V corresponding to the Co3+/Co2+ reduction  process. In subsequent cycles there is a rapid drop in oxidation current and there is no  reduction peaks, thus causing the material to become non-electroactive.  The cell reaction  with respect to first scan state occurs as follows:    • Charge (extraction of Li+): 

The  CV  profile  of  1:2  Co-Starch  (figure  3B)  demonstrates  the  electrochemical  reversibility of the material and exhibits the reduction and oxidation peaks corresponding  of two transition metal ions Co3+ and Mo6+.       During the first charge, the oxidation of Co3+/Co2+ was observed as a single peak at  about 1.15 V and during the first reduction cycle a single peak was observed at 0.94 V  corresponding to the Co2+/Co3+ . In subsequent cycles, two anodic peaks were observed  and were attributed to the oxidation of Mo back to it higher oxidation state (Mo4+/Mo6+)  and  cobalt  oxidation  (Co2+/Co3+),  the  oxidation  potentials  were  0.78  V  and  1.10V,  respectively.  Furthermore  two  cathodic  peaks  were  observed  corresponding  to  the  reduction of Mo6+/Mo4+ and Co2+/Co3+, the reduction potentials were 0.70 V and 0.87V,  respectively.  Important  note  that  the  redox  peaks  of  molybdenum  is  current  increased  over the cycles, while the cobalt redox current decreased. The cell reaction with respect  to first scan state occurs as follows:    • Charge (extraction of Li+):   

The electrochemical reversibility of the material is evident in the CVs of samples 1:4  and 1:6 Co-Starch, the profiles clearly exhibit sharp redox peaks corresponding to two  transition metal ions, namely, cobalt (3+) and molybdenum (6+).       During  the  initial  cathodic  scan  the  first  reduction  peak  observed  at  approximately  1.10  V  corresponds  to  Co3+/Co2+ transition.  The  second  reduction  process  occurred  at  about 0.70 V is due to Mo6+/Mo4+ that represents two-electron transfer.        During the first charge, the oxidation of Co3+/Co2+ was observed as a single peak at  about 1.35 V and from the subsequent cycles the oxidation of Mo was observed at 0.78 V  and the potential of oxidation of Co3+/Co2+ decrease of 1.35 V to 1.20 V. In both samples  over the cycles the redox current of molybdenum has increased substantially, while the  cobalt  redox  current  decreased.  The  charge/discharge  reactions  of  the  process  are  the  same that was proposes in equations 4 and 5, respectively. 

Similar studies were performed by Nanjundasamy et al. (17) when they reported that  the redox potentials of the M cations are shifted due to the change in the polyanion group.  Based in this we can infer that the presence of molybdate polyanion, (MoO4)2-, in the host  framework  structure  is  the  possible  origin  for  the  distinct  feature  of  the  voltammetry  curves from the first to the subsequent cycles.       The charge capacities, calculated from the CV, shows that the sample with 1:1 ratio  presented an initial load capacity of 12 mAhg-1 and ultimate load capacity of 5 mAhg-1,  representing a 42 % of charge retention. For the sample with 1:2 and 1:4 ratios the initial  load  capacity  of  was  22.7  mAhg-1  and  25.4  mAhg-1,  respectively.  The  ultimate  load  capacities  of  these  samples  were  5.7  mAhg-1  and  15.7  mAhg-1  which  correspond  to  charge retention of 25 % and 59 %, respectively. Finally the sample with 1:6 Co-Starch  reveals for the first cycle a load capacity was 80 mAhg-1  and in the end of 25th cycle the  value  was  52  mAhg-1,  that  representing  a  65  %  of  the  initial  value.  To  increase  the  electronic conductivity, various chemical routes are employed to produce carbon coating  on  the  surface  of  cathodic  materials.  The  sample  with  molar  ratio  1:6  has  the  load  capacity obviously increased mainly due to in situ composite carbon, large surface area,  and the porous network how was showed for Zhou et al (18).  

Synthesis  of  LiSICON  Li2Co2(MoO4)3  was  demonstrated  using  starch  as  mild  combustion,  making  the  final  temperature  of  the  synthesis  and  calcination  time  considerably reduced compared with the traditional synthesis process. It was shown also  that  the  amount  of  starch  influence  in  the  crystallinity  of  the  products  formed;  the  increase  in  starch  amount  promoting  a  better  intensity  and  definition  of  the  diffraction  peaks  due  to  crystalline  growth  which,  as  well  as  an  increase  of  cell  volume,  thus  suggests that a larger amount of lithium ions can be inserted in the 3D framework.       Electrochemical  performance  of  the  different  materials  present  that  the  increase  the  amount of starch induce a substantial increase in the reversibility redox, specifically in  the ratio molar 1:2 to 1:6, that reveal, over the cycles, the redox current of molybdenum  has  increased  substantially,  while  the  cobalt  redox  current  decreased,  until  stabilized  redox process in the 25° cycle. Charge capacities exhibits that the sample with 1:1 ratio  presented a very low capacity, but in the major quantity of starch (1:6) shows, in the first  cycle, 80 mAhg-1 and a 65 % retention of capacity in the 25th scan, probably this increase  in the capacity is because the electronic conductivity was increased with the formation, in  situ, of carbon in the materials.
