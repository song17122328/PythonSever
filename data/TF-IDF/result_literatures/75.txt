NASICON-structured cathode materials are considered as possible candidates for high-performance Na-ion bat-teries. Further increase of energy density of the Na3V2(PO4)3 may be achieved by substitution of the V cations by other transition metals. Here, we show that a family of Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1, Δx=0.2) cathode materials demonstrates remarkable diversity of the electrochemical properties and phase transformations depending on degree of substitution and cut-off voltage. An intermediate “Na2M2(PO4)3” phase was found for all compounds studied by means of operando powder X-ray diffraction. When Mn content is low (x~0–0.4), it coexists with Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 or Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3. Increase in Mn content extends the length of the solid solution region corresponding to sodiated, intermediate and desodiated phases. All Mn-substituted samples are charac-terized by additional high-voltage plateau (~3.9 V) at charge-discharge curves. Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (x≥0.4) compositions exhibit 8–10% energy density gain in comparison to Na3V2(PO4)3 material, Na3.2Mn0.2V1.8(PO4)3 and Na3.4Mn0.4V1.6(PO4)3 are most preferable in terms of cycling stability.   
The high cost of lithium-ion batteries (LIB) is one of the major bar-riers for its implementation in applications such as starting lighting ignition (SLI), forklifts, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), large scale energy storage etc. [1]. The cathode material is considered as one of the most signiﬁcant contributors to the cell cost of which the price for lithium precursors are particularly substantial [2]. Due to the two orders of magnitude lower price for sodium precursors Na-ion batteries have recently regained a great interest. Among various cathode materials NASICON-type Na3V2(PO4)3 exhibits extremely long cyclic stability and an outstanding ability to operate at high (dis)charge rates [3–6]. How-ever, its cost-effectiveness can still be improved by advancing energy density above its 400 Wh kg- 1 by using transition metals cheaper than vanadium. The substitution of transition metal in cathode materials is one of the most widely used ways to improve the energy density of the metal-ion battery electrodes. As for NASICON-type materials, different Na3+δV2- xMx(PO4)3 compositions were reported. Generally, incorporating triva-lent metal cations, which are not electrochemically active (e.g. Al3+) or not active at the typical working potential range (Fe3+ etc.), activates V4+/V5+ redox couple at ~3.9–4.1 V, which increases average operating voltage [7–12]. Vanadium substitution with divalent metal cations also leads to the V4+/V5+ redox couple activation, in addition, to introduc-tion of greater amount of Na ions into the NASICON structure [13–22]. Recently, an opportunity of reversible cycling of more than two Na ions in NASICON-type cathodes was demonstrated due to an effect of V3+ substitution by Mn2+ in Na4MnV(PO4)3 [17,18]. When cycled below 3.8 V, this material is capable of rapid charge and discharge at current rates up to 90C (delivering more than 60% of theoretical capacity) and sus-tains ca. 70% of initial capacity after 4000 cycles at 20C [20] and 40C [21]. It is essential that electrochemical signature and phase trans-formation behavior of Na4MnV(PO4)3 noticeably differs from that of Na3V2(PO4)3. From the other side, the type of electrochemical response of two recently studied materials with intermediate compositions – Na3.5Mn0.5V1.5(PO4)3 and Na3.75V1.25Mn0.75(PO4)3 – differ signiﬁcantly from both Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3 end members [19,22]. These ﬁndings demonstrate the need to systematically explore electro-chemical properties and phase transformation behavior, which remarkably evolves with V3+ to Mn2+ substitution in NASICON-type Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) cathodes for Na-ion batteries. 
Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1, Δx=0.2) samples were prepared by dissolving manganese(II) acetylacetonate, ammonium metavanadate and citric acid in deionized water in the molar ratio x:(2-x):3 and stirring for 40 min at 70 °C. Then sodium carbonate and ammonium dihy-drophosphate solution in deionized water in the molar ratio (3+x):3 was drop-wise added and stirred for 40 min followed by evaporation at 95 °C overnight. Vanadium oxide and sodium dihydrophosphate were also used to obtain Na3V2(PO4)3. After that the solid residue was mortared and pre-heated at 350 °C for 3 h under argon atmosphere following by grinding in a high-energy SPEX-8000 M ball-mill for 5 min and subse-quent annealing at 750 °C for 8 h in Ar atmosphere. The chemical composition of the synthesized samples was measured using an induc-tively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Agilent 720) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX, FEI Titan Themis Z operated at 200 kV).Attenuated total reﬂectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra of the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 samples were collected with a stand- alone FTIR microscope LUMOS (Bruker) equipped with Ge ATR crystal and liquid N2 cooled Mercury–Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) detector. Spectra were recorded in the 1800-600 cm- 1 range with 2 cm- 1 reso-lution and averaging of 64 scans. The reproducibility was checked by probing different spots of the same powder sample. 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were recorded with a Huber G670 Guiner Camera (Co Kα1 radiation, Ge(111) mono-chromator, 10–100°, 40 kV/30 mA) equipped with an image plate de-tector. Operando X-ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu Kα1,2 radiation, 19–38°, 40 kV/ 40 mA) equipped with the energy-dispersive LYNXEYE XE position- sensitive detector using an electrochemical cell with Be windows sup-plied with the diffractometer [23]. Operando high-resolution synchro-tron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD) patterns were recorded at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline (SNBL) BM01 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (λ = 0.68987 Å) using an electrochemical cell with sapphire windows [24]. Sequential LeBail ﬁtting was performed using Jana2006 software [25]. Selected patterns were reﬁned using Fullprof software [26]. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in two-electrode cells. The working electrodes were composed of active material, car-bon black (Timcal Super P) and polyvinylideneﬂuoride in 6:1:1 ratio, respectively. The dry mixture was blended with N-metyl-2-pyrrolidone, spread on aluminum foil and vacuum dried at 110 °C for at least 1 h. Metallic sodium was used as a negative electrode, which was separated from the positive electrode by a sheet of borosilicate glass ﬁber soaked in 0.5 M NaPF6 solution of propylene carbonate and ﬂuorinated ethylene carbonate in 95:5 vol ratio. Galvanostatic tests were performed with Elins P20x8 potentiostat- galvanostat (ES8 software) between 2.5 and 4.1 V vs. Na/Na+ at C/10 current rate (long-term cycling), with Biologic SP-150 potentiostat-gal-vanostat (EC-Lab software) between 2.5 and 4.1 V at ~ C/8 current rate (laboratory operando experiments) and with Neware battery cycler (BTSClient software) between 2.5 and 3.8 V at ~ C/5 current rate (synchrotron operando experiments). Potentiostatic intermittent titra-tion tests (PITT) were performed with Biologic VMP3 potentiostat- galvanostat (EC-Lab software) using potential steps of 10 mV between 3.0 and 4.1 V terminated at C/50 current cut-off. 
Fig. 1a shows selected region of the XRPD patterns of the as-prepared Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) samples. The XRPD patterns of the whole series can be indexed in the well-known NASICON unit cell with R3c space group [27]. Rising the Mn2+ content leads to the unit cell volume increase (Fig. 1b, Table S1), which is due to the replacement of smaller V3+ cations with larger Mn2+ (ionic radii are 0.64 Å and 0.83 Å, respectively) [28] in addition to incorporation of neutralizing excess of Na+ cations. Due to a steep rise of the parameter a (and a slight fall of the parameter c, Fig. 1b) the 110 and 104 reﬂections positions show an evident change as Mn2+ content increases. The changes in the NASICON framework caused by Mn2+ substitution are presented in Fig. S1. The samples consist of irregularly shaped agglomerated platelets with the size of 0.1- 1 μm (Fig. S3). The actual stoichiometry of the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) samples is conﬁrmed by the ICP-AES and EDX measurements (Fig. S4). Infrared spectra of Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 materials presented in Fig. 2a are dominated by absorption bands due to internal vibrational modes of the PO43- anion. These spectral features are typical for various NASICON-type compounds [29–33]. The band near 620 cm- 1 is assigned with antisymmetric bending vibrational mode of the O–P–O unit (ν4). The broad structured absorption in the 900–1100 cm- 1 range includes bands due to both the symmetric (ν1) and the antisymmetric (ν3) stretching vibrations in PO43- tetrahedra. The ν3 vibrational mode is also featured by the higher-frequency band near 1160 cm- 1. It is known that v3 mode is sensitive to phosphate-group distortion caused by the polarizing effect of the neighboring metal ions in the crystal structure [29]. The more polarizing the ion (smaller size, larger charge), the more localized are the electrons on the P–O (M) bond, which results in higher force constants and hence the higher vibrational frequencies [33]. Such effect has been previously reported for NaM2(PO4)3 (M = Ti4+, Zr4+) [29] and AgSbM(PO4)3 (M = Al3+, Ga3+, Cr3+, Fe3+) [31] NASICON-type materials. We observed that in a series of the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 materials, the partial substitution of the V3+ ions with less polarizing Mn2+ ions leads to the evident lower-frequency shift of the ν3(PO4) band position: from 1182 cm- 1 for Na3V2(PO4)3 to 1147 cm- 1 for Na4MnV(PO4)3. In fact, the absorption maxima of the ν3(PO4) band in FTIR spectra shows virtually linear dependence on the Mn2+–substitution degree x in Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3, as shown in Fig. 2b. This observation is an additional experimental evidence for monotonous chemical composition changes in a series of synthesized Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 materials. 
With the increase of the substitution level x electrochemical prop-erties of Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 also change. We investigated them within two voltage windows: 2.5–3.8 V and 2.5–4.1 V vs. Na/Na+ (Fig. 3). Several points can be highlighted for the cycling between 2.5 V and 3.8 V. For the (0.2≤x≤0.8) samples electrochemical responses of va-nadium and manganese cations are very close (details can be seen in differential capacity plots presented in Fig. S5a). Rise of the average charge/discharge voltage is the main visible result of the Mn substitu-tion. However, further increase of the Mn content above x = 0.8 trans-forms the shape of the charge/discharge curve. The voltage plateau at ~3.4 V ceases to be ﬂat, and the slope splits for two steps, the lower step remains to be inclined, the upper becomes ﬂat again. Zhou et al. pro-posed that for Na4MnV(PO4)3 lower plateau corresponds to V3+/V4+ and the upper one – to Mn2+/Mn3+ redox transition [15]. When the voltage rises above 3.8 V, an additional voltage plateau appears on charge at ~3.9 V for all Mn-substituted compounds. For different compositions this feature has a slightly different shape and position (Fig. S5b). For the low Mn contents (x = 0.2, 0.4) the 3.9 V plateau is reversible on discharge, however for x ≥ 0.6 the 3.9 V step vanishes on the ﬁrst discharge and then does not reappear on either charge or discharge in case of lower cut-off voltage of 2.5 V. Further discussion of the irreversibility can be found in subsection 3.3.2. In addition, the compositions with x ≥ 0.6 have low capacity retention, and the fade is the stronger the higher the Mn content is (Figs. 3 and 7b). It is essential that the expansion of the voltage window beyond 3.8 V leads to a capacity increase above the theoretical values for (de)intercalation of 2 Na ions (Fig. 7a). Energy density improvement for all Na3+xMnxV2- x(PO4)3 (x ≥ 0.4) exceeds 8%. Deintercalation of extra Na+ ions in Na4MnV(PO4)3 was shown to proceed through depletion of Na1 position [17,18], which possibly also takes place in Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 com-pounds with lower Mn content. 
In order to link electrochemical features with the phase trans-formations in Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) samples operando XRPD was carried out for two charge-discharge cycles in different voltage windows using an electrochemical cell supplied with the Bruker D8 diffractometer [23]. Fig. 4 shows a 2D proﬁle of the 024 reﬂection evolution for the cases of cut-off voltage at 3.8 V on the bottom plots and at 4.1 V on the top plots overlaid with the corresponding galvanostatic curves. 3.3.1. Phase transformations in the 2.5–3.8 V voltage window General overview of the operando patterns in 2.5–3.8 V window suggests that several single and two-phase domains exist during Na+ (de)intercalation from Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 compounds. To systemize the phase transformation behavior over Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) family a schematic diagram was constructed (Fig. 5). It illustrates how the composition of the present phases change, and what the dein-tercalation mechanism is at different states of charge. According to the scheme, at the beginning extraction of Na+ from the initial Na3+xMnxV2- x(PO4)3 leads to a “Na3MnxV2-x(PO4)3” through a solid solution mech-anism. Then Na+ extraction proceeds by a biphasic “Na3MnxV2- x(PO4)3”–“Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3” transition. Importantly, we note that around “Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3” composition a narrow solid-solution domain is observed. Further Na+ extraction occurs via a biphasic reac-tion until the “Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3” composition is reached around 3.8 V. Towards this point, Na+ reinsertion on discharge would be reversible passing through the same (de)intercalation domains. In addition, this accords with the PITT data, which clearly represent the diffusion- and the phase-transition-limited processes by the shape of the current tran-sients (Fig. S6). Apparently, the end-members (x = 0 and x = 1) demonstrate the least diverse phase transformation processes composed of only two distinguishable domains. As discussed below we provide greater detail of the phase transformations in the 2.5–3.8 V voltage window for the studied compositions.3.3.1.1. Na3V2(PO4)3. The operando pattern for Na3V2(PO4)3 shows an entirely biphasic mechanism: Na3V2(PO4)3 phase reﬂections disappear during Na+ deintercalation followed by the NaV2(PO4)3 reﬂections in-tensity enhancement on charge (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with the previous ﬁndings [36]. Interestingly, on charge deintercalation proceeds through an intermediate phase, possibly Na2V2(PO4)3, mani-festing itself in appearance of well-discernible reﬂections at 20.5, 24.3, 29.3, 32.6 and 36.4° (Fig. S8). Careful examination of the Na3V2(PO4)3 operando patterns in the former works conﬁrms the presence of this in-termediate phase on charge [36,37]. Moreover, electrochemical curves and XRPD patterns of Na3V2(PO4)3 synthesized by different routes have respectively slightly different shape and distinct reﬂection intensities of the intermediate phase both on charge and discharge (Fig. S8), which is probably related to the different size of the coherently scattering regions of the “Na2V2(PO4)3” nuclei. Hence, on charge Na3V2(PO4)3 demon-strates two biphasic phase transitions (Fig. 5). 3.3.1.2. Na3.2Mn0.2V1.8(PO4)3 and Na3.4Mn0.4V1.6(PO4)3. Heterovalent substitution of V3+ to Mn2+ in Na3V2(PO4)3 requires an excess of Na+ cations for charge compensation. Extraction of this excess Na+ ions from the initial Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 leads to a “Na3MnxV2-x(PO4)3” through a solid solution mechanism, the unit cell volume change ΔV varying almost concomitantly as Na-excess x (Table S2, Fig. S9). Further charge to 3.8 V leads to a composition “Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3” by extracting (2- x) Na+ ions as can be deduced from the electrochemical measurements (Fig. 3). For x = 0.2 and x = 0.4 the “Na3MnxV2-x(PO4)3”–“Na1+xMnxV2- x(PO4)3” process exhibits two ﬁrst-order phase transitions, which reversibly proceeds through an intermediate “Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3” composition. The 2θ position of the clearly visible reﬂections of the “Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3” slightly shifts during the charge and discharge processes indicating the presence of a narrow solid-solution domain (Fig. 4). Such an intermediate was also present in Al- and Ti-substituted Na3V2(PO4)3 [12,38]. Examples from Li-ion systems are also well-known, e.g. intermediate Li-deﬁcient phase in Mn-substituted LiFePO4 [39,40]. Its appearance in olivine-type cathode materials was associated with dilution of phase-separating interactions between alkali cations and transition metal cations, which transformed the ﬁrst-order transition into a second-order forming a metastable solid solution [41, 42]. While it is hardly discernible on the galvanostatic curves, the sig-natures of two biphasic transitions are clearly shown by differential capacity plots on Fig. S5a, the derivative reﬂections show separation increasing from 0.002 V for Na3V2(PO4)3 to 0.15 V for Na3.4Mn0.4V1.6(PO4)3 on charge.
3.3.1.3. Na3.6Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3. The case of x = 0.6 has several unique features for the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 family. Firstly, Na3.6Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3 doesn’t display deﬁnite borders of the biphasic “Na3Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3”–“Na2Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3” transition, well-marked for other compositions by essentially unchanged 2θ positions of each phase’s reﬂections. Secondly, since the unit cell volume of the inter-mediate phase “Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3” becomes closer to the volume of “Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3” with increasing the Mn-content x, the “Na2Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3”–“Na1.6Mn0.6V1.4(PO4)3” transition seems to occur through a solid solution reaction (Fig. 4). However, even in a case of actual presence of a biphasic domain, the 2θ positions of their reﬂections are too close to each other, so that they can hardly be resolved by standard laboratory X-ray diffraction methods. As a result, these two expanded single-phase transitions with a short biphasic domain are characterized by a sharp differential capacity peak with wide shoulders (Fig. S5a). This phase transformation behavior is believed to be effective for reducing the volume strain and was also shown to occur at non- equilibrium conditions in several other compounds such as LiMn0.4-Fe0.6PO4 [40], NaFePO4 [43,44] and Li2VPO4O [45]. 
3.3.1.4. Na3.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3. The operando XRPD pattern for the Na4MnV(PO4)3 is already known [17,18]. It adopts two phase transitions: a single-phase Na4MnV(PO4)3–Na3MnV(PO4)3 and a biphasic Na3MnV(PO4)3–Na2MnV(PO4)3 transitions. Closer inspection of the dQ/dV and PITT data (Figs. S5 and S6) for the Na4MnV (PO4)3–Na3MnV(PO4)3 transition suggests a presence of 2 separate processes, which are hardly visible on the X-ray diffraction data at the applied current rates. Similarly to Na4MnV(PO4)3, in the case of x = 0.8 deintercalation of 0.8 Na ions from Na3.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3 occurs via a solid-solution regime followed by a biphasic reaction until the “Na1.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3” composition is reached (Fig. 4). Utilization of a higher resolving synchrotron radiation (Fig. 6) allows to clearly observe that at approximately 50% state of charge the “Na3Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3” reﬂection broadens, and concurrently reﬂection of a new “Na2Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3” phase appears and shifts to higher 2θ angles until the “Na1.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3” composition is reached. On the one hand, this operando SXRPD pattern is very similar to the case of x = 1.0. It has a broad domain of concurrent co-existence of two phases (“Na3Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3” and “Na1.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3”), but on the other hand the mentioned broadening and reﬂection shifting resembles the case of x = 0.6 in that two single-phase domains exist between “Na3MnxV2-x(PO4)3” and “Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3”. Since the synchrotron operando SXRPD pattern reveals symmetry reduction from rhombohe-dral to monoclinic due to the appearance of additional reﬂections (Fig. S10) exactly as for the Na4MnV(PO4)3 [17], we used a well-known monoclinic modiﬁcation of the NASICON structure with C2/c symmetry for the sequential Le Bail ﬁtting of the Na3.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3 operando SXRPD pattern [46]. Using the monoclinic symmetry enable indexing the additional reﬂections and ﬁt the aforementioned broadening (Figs. S11 and 6c). Le Bail ﬁtting indicates an ongoing alteration of the unit cell parameters of both phases present during the biphasic domain on charge to 3.8 V, which explains the sloped shape of the E-x curve, unlike Na4MnV(PO4)3, which has a plateau at the same two-phase domain (Fig. 6b and c). 3.3.2. Phase transformations in 2.5–4.1 V voltage window According to galvanostatic curves and operando XRPD patterns, cycling Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) samples below 3.8 V demon-strates that deintercalation process is reversible on discharge. Charging Na3V2(PO4)3 from 3.8 V to 4.1 V doesn’t change positions of NaV2(PO4)3 reﬂections. Charging Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0.2≤x≤1) compounds above 3.8 V gradually shifts the Na1+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 re-ﬂections towards higher 2θ angles due to further Na+ extraction via a single-phase mechanism. This shift and the corresponding unit cell volume change become greater as Mn-content increases and are asso-ciated with a voltage step at ~3.9 V. In the case of x = 0 this step was also found on charge. It was induced by superstoichiometry in the Na3- 3δV2+δ(PO4)3 phases [47]. It is important to note that extraction of Na above the Na1+xMnxV2- x(PO4)3 (x ≥ 0.4) limit smooths features of biphasic reactions on sub-sequent cycling (Fig. S12). The higher cut-off voltage upon charge and the higher the Mn-content is, the stronger the disappearance of this transition [17] . Careful analysis of the differential capacity plots (Fig. S5b) and the operando pattern of the Na3.4Mn0.4V1.6(PO4)3 on discharge after charge to 3.8 V (Fig. 4c) indicate that for some com-pounds this threshold occurs between 3.7 and 3.8 V. 
According to our previous work [17] and Chen et al. [18], the solid solution-type deintercalation step above 3.8 V for Na4MnV(PO4)3 is associated with extraction of Na+ from Na1 position. Ghosh et al. [19] suggested that in case of the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 with low Mn2+ con-tent (x = 0.25) this step is related to vanadium oxidation only, and in case of high Mn2+ content (x = 0.75, 1) – to formation of mixed V4+/V5+ and Mn3+/Mn4+ redox states. The access to the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple in NASICON-type compounds was also shown by Gao et al. [48, 49]; on the basis of DFT calculations the authors proposed that although cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion of the Mn3+ is suppressed in the Na2Mn3+Zr4+(PO4)3, on the local scale MnO6 octahedra are distorted, and Na is locally ordered. DFT calculations for Na-deﬁcient NASICON phases by Wang et al. [50] showed that migration of transition metal to the adjacent unoccupied Na2 site as well as transition metal/Na antisite defects are unlikely in the NaMnV(PO4)3 and NaMnCr(PO4)3. These ﬁndings may support the hypothesis that Na+ deintercalation from the Na1+xMnx3+V42-x+(PO4)3 during charge above 3.8 V may occur through depletion of Na1 position causing local Na+ and/or charge reordering, which is in part comparable to Li+ extraction from the LiV2(PO4)3 [51]. Most likely that on discharge Na+ is randomly inserted into available sites, but due to kinetic limitations Na+ does not fully reoccupy Na1 position, and certain amount of Na vacancies affect the (de)intercalation mechanism during subsequent cycling. 
Overall, we can highlight the following aspects. Within 2.5–3.8 V potential window the increase in Na content in the initial Na3+xMnxV2- x(PO4)3 (0.2≤x≤1) samples does not result in a speciﬁc capacity in-crease. As such, only 2 Na may be reversibly (de)intercalated, which corresponds to utilization of Mn2+/Mn3+ and V3+/V4+ redox pairs (Fig. 7a). The potential of these redox pairs is very close to each other, and only for the x = 1 composition the intercalation isotherm splits into two distinct steps. Raising the voltage cut-off above 3.8 V leads to an increase in reversible capacity due to extraction of the additional Na. This feature was observed for all studied samples besides x = 0. Inoishi et al. found similar extra Na+ deintercalation step at elevated voltage for the Na3+xMgxV2-x(PO4)3 cathode materials [14]. However, low Coulombic efﬁciency resulted in returning of only 2 Na+ into the crystal structure of the phosphates. Authors attributed that to poor reversibility of the V4+/V5+ redox reaction. In our case, the reversibility of the charge-discharge process is much more efﬁcient (Fig. 3) which should be associated with positive Mn contribution. There are several possible reasons for such inﬂuence: better electronic conductivity of the mate-rials due to presence of fast electron exchange between cations with different oxidation states; contribution of Mn3+/Mn4+ and V4+/V5+ redox pairs at elevated voltage; mutual compensation of the distorted MnO6 and VO6 octahedrons etc. To ﬁnd a clear answer, further studies are needed, including spectroscopic and local structure determination methods that are beyond the scope of this work. Cycling stability (resistance to capacity fade) is another important factor determining the level of attractiveness of electrode materials. As it was reported for Na4MnV(PO4)3 [17,18], rising the cut-off voltage above 3.8 V leads to fast capacity fade during cycling. We studied cycling stability of the Na3+xV2-xMnx(PO4)3 samples (0≤x≤1) and found a straightforward dependence between substitution degree x and the rate of capacity fading (Fig. 7b and c). The cases of x = 0.2 and x = 0.4 compositions still demonstrate ~5% energy density gain towards Na3V2(PO4)3 after 23 charge-discharge cycles within 2.5–4.1 V potential window. Yet stabilization of the practical energy density above 410 Wh kg- 1 observed for x > 0.4 samples (Figs. 3 and 7c) is still an important challenge. 
In this work, we report a systematic and comprehensive study of the electrochemical and phase transformation behavior for the six Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 (0≤x≤1) family members, most of them are probed for the ﬁrst time. Two sodium ions may be reversibly (de)intercalated in all studied samples within 2.5–3.8 V vs. Na/Na+ potential window, regardless of initial Na content. In addition, we show that during Na+ extraction the Na3+xMnxV2-x(PO4)3 compounds undergo multiple structural phase transitions including a formation of intermediate single-phase domain at composition ~ Na2MnxV2-x(PO4)3. The dein-tercalation mechanism is reproduced over Na+ insertion in case of cycling within 2.5–3.8 V window. When the cut-off voltage exceeds 3.8 V, additional Na may be extracted via solid solution mechanism from all samples with x > 0. In addition, we observed that charging above 3.8 V for x ≥ 0.4 suppresses the phase transformation features on discharge in favor of one solid- solution mechanism. By means of operando SXRPD, we also found a rather unusual behavior for Na3.8Mn0.8V1.2(PO4)3 and Na4MnV(PO4)3 compositions, which demonstrate almost identical phase transformation behaviors, but at the same time show absolutely different types of voltage- composition curves. These observations and results detailed herein illustrate the necessity of operando diffraction experiments since similar structural transitions may result in the different macroscopic properties. Importantly, when the voltage window above 3.8 V is utilized, Mn2+ substitution enhances the energy density for up to 10% compared with the Na3V2(PO4)3. This improvement is sustained with cycling for Na3.4Mn0.4V1.6(PO4)3, however retaining this increase in case of higher Mn content is necessary towards the pragmatic utilization of NASICON- type cathodes in Na-ion batteries.
