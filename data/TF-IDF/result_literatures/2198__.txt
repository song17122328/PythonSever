The structures and electrical properties of four NASICON compositions, Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr), have been determined and compared. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed the basic rhombohedral NASICON structure with random occupancy of the octahedral In/M sites, full occupancy of the Na(1) sites and partial occupancy of the Na(2) sites. For three compositions, M ) Zr, Sn, and Hf, the 31P MAS NMR peak intensities of the four detected signals, attributed to four different phosphorus environments [P(OM)4-n(OIn)n (n ) 0-3)], were close to the ratios expected for a random distribution of In/M. For M ) Ti, some departures from statistical occupancy were apparent. 23Na MAS NMR data gave evidence for two Na+ positions at room temperature for M ) Ti, Sn, attributable to occupation of Na(1) and Na(2) sites. For M ) Hf, Zr, only a single signal could be resolved at room temperature, which splits into two signals on cooling to 50 °C, indicating high Na mobility at room temperature. Impedance data obtained on pressed sintered pellets over the range 25-300 °C showed that bulk ionic conductivities increased and activation energies decreased in the sequence Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr. The geometry of the M1M2 bottleneck has been determined from structural data, and a direct correlation found between activation energy for ion conduction and the bottleneck size.

NASICON materials Na1+xZr2P3-xSixO12 (0 e x e 3) are well-known due to their high Na+ mobility within a three-dimensional rhombohedral R 3hc network.1,2 There are many papers devoted to structurally related compounds such as Na1+xMIV x(PO4)3, and some of these studies have tried to correlate crystal structure and ionic conductivity.3,4 In the 3D skeleton, described x(PO4)3](1+x)-, PO4 tetrahedra by the formula [MIV are linked by their corners to MO6 octahedra. The infinite ribbons resulting from this linkage are connected together, perpendicular to the c direction, by PO4 tetrahedra to form the NASICON framework (Figure 1). The Na+ ions can occupy two positions in the conduction channels: the M1 site (one per formula) is coordinated by a trigonal antiprism of oxygens, and the M2 site (three per formula) has a distorted 8-fold coordination. M1 and M2 sites are located inside and between the ribbons, respectively. The literature agrees

Most authors agree that structural features are the key to explaining the conduction mechanism, but the relevant structural parameters have not yet been identified. Some authors found correlations with ionic radii

of the octahedrally coordinated cations, and others with unit-cell parameters, a and c or the cell volume.5,6 This initial approach was followed by the scrutiny of factors such as the size of the bottleneck that connects M1 and M2 sites.4,7,8 To establish this type of correlation, however, the full crystal structure determination by either single-crystal diffraction or by Rietveld analysis of powder diffraction data is necessary. Other factors that affect conductivity include the nature of the octahedral cations. For instance, NASICONS with main-group metals in the octahedral sites usually have lower conductivities than similar ones containing transition metals.6,9

The increase in the number of carriers (in this case expressed by 1 + x) improves the conductivity up to a limiting value that depends on the material (for instance,  243)max occurs at x ) 2 in NASICON silicophosphates). There is general agreement that it is necessary to have mobile cations partially distributed over several sites and that stoichiometric materials are comparatively much poorer ionic conductors. However, it is often difficult to compare reported data as it is common to find discrepancies in the conductivities for a given phase depending upon a number of factors: (1) preparation method, (2) thermal history,10 (3) true bulk stoichiometry, (4) sintering processes,11 and hence (5) possible influence of grain-boundary effects. Due to these factors, it appears that some degree of nonreproducibility is unavoidable and should be kept in mind when comparing results of different authors.

In the present work, we have attempted to understand the relation betwen Na mobility and structure in the series Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3: M ) Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr. The choice of materials with different metals M and this particular stoichiometry have been made so as to use a common synthetic method that results in the usual R 3hc rhombohedral symmetry over a wide range of temperatures. The combined use of X-ray powder diffraction (Rietveld method), 31P and 23Na MAS NMR, and impedance spectroscopies has provided a better understanding of structural factors that control Na ion conduction, establishing conclusions that can be extended to other ion conduction systems.

Synthesis. Stoichiometric amounts of Na2CO3, In2O3, (NH4)2HPO4, and MO2, synthesized as described below, were ground together and heated in a Pt crucible up to 1100 °C to give the following overall reaction:

The tetravalent metal oxide starting materials were prepared as follows. MO2 (M ) Ti, Zr) were synthesized by slow

hydrolysis (with 1:4 water/2-propanol ratio) of commercial alkoxides: 97% Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 and a solution of 70% Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4 in 1-propanol. The resulting white suspensions were centrifuged, washed thoroughly with water, and heated at 200 °C for 2 h. SnO2 was prepared from commercial SnCl4 226)5H2O by hydrolysis with NH3(aq) to pH ) 9. The white solid was centrifuged, washed with water to pH ) 7, and heated at 200 °C for 2 h. The MO2 (M ) Ti, Sn, Zr) solids showed amorphous X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) profiles, and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) did show small weight losses up to 700 °C which were taken into account for the NASICONs syntheses. HfO2 (Aldrich, 99.8%) with microparticle size < 1  237)m was dried at 200 °C and used without further treatment.

The starting mixtures were ground in an agate mortar with ethanol for 1 h, dried, heated at 0.5 °C min-1 to 400 °C, and left at that temperature for 1 day to release gases (NH3, H2O, and CO2). To avoid/minimize the formation of byproducts, MP2O7 and unreacted MO2, the samples were heated at 0.5 °C min-1 to 1000 °C with intermediate regrindings (for 30 min every 150 °C). Finally, the samples were left at 1000 °C for 2 days and 1100 °C for 3 days.

Thermal Characterization. TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) was carried out in air on a Rigaku Thermoflex TG 8110 apparatus from room temperature to 1100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min with calcined Al2O3 as the reference.

X-ray Diffraction Characterization. The powder patterns were collected at room temperature in a Siemens D5000 diffractometer with (ı/2ı) Bragg-Brentano geometry. For phase purity assessment and indexing purposes, data were recorded between 13 and 50° 2ı. To refine the crystal structures by the Rietveld method,12 data were collected between 13 and 125° 2ı with 0.03° step size and 16 s counting time.

MAS NMR Characterization. 31P and 23Na MAS NMR spectra were obtained between 25 and -50 °C using a B-VT 1000/SU07 unit adapted to a MSL 400 Bruker spectrometer. The frequencies used for 31P and 23Na spectra were 161.96 and 105.84 MHz. Samples were spun in the range 3-4 kHz, and spectra taken after  240)/2 pulse irradiation. A time interval between successive scans in the range 2-90 s was chosen, depending on the spin-lattice relaxation times of nuclei at the analyzed temperatures. The number of scans was in the range 10-30. The 23Na and 31P chemical shift values are given relative to 1 M NaCl and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solutions, respectively. Quantitative analyses of spectra were carried out with the WINFIT (Bruker) program. This program allows the position, line width, and intensity of the components of an experimental profile to be determined by using a standard nonlinear least-squares method. Ionic Conductivity Characterization. Cylindrical pellets ( 25)10 mm diameter and  25)1 mm thickness) of the samples were obtained by applying uniaxial pressure of 200 MPa. The pellets were heated to achieve good sintering at 1150 °C (M ) Ti) and 1300 °C (M ) Sn, Hf, and Zr). The porosity estimated from the pellet mass and geometry was 17%, 21%, 29%, and 32% for M ) Ti, Sn, Hf, and Zr, respectively. In-Ga alloy

The initial XRD data indicated that the four phases were highly crystalline with structures belonging to the rhombohedral R3hc NASICON-type. Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Ti, Hf, Zr) were single phase by XRD. A small amount of cassiterite (SnO2 oxide) was detected in the Na1.4Sn1.6In0.4(PO4)3 sample. Thermal analysis showed the absence of phase transitions between room temperature and 1100 °C.

Rietveld Study. The crystal structures of all four phases were refined from XRD data by the Rietveld method using the R3hc structure of NaZr2(PO4)3 as starting model.1 The nominal M/In composition was assumed to be randomly distributed at the octahedral site. Full occupancy of the Na(1) site at (000) (6b Wyckoff notation) and the excess sodium located in the Na(2) site at (0.65 0 1/4) (18e) was initially postulated. The common overall parameters, histogram scale factor, background coefficients, unit-cell parameters, zero-shift error, and pseudo-Voigt coefficients13 corrected for asymmetry14 were refined first. Then, the positional parameters were optimized. After convergence, the fraction of In at the metal(IV) site was allowed to vary but constrained to full occupancy of the site. The occupation factors of Na(2) site were refined in such a way that electroneutrality of the refined chemical formula was maintained. Finally, the temperature factors of different sites were refined freely. Refinements of the Na(1) site occupancy indicated full occupancy for M ) Sn, Hf, and Zr but slightly lower occupancy for M ) Ti.

As Sn and In are adjacent elements in the periodic table, these cannot be distinguished by XRD. Hence, the occupancy of Sn was set to 1.00, and the amount of Na at the M(2) site was refined freely, which indirectly indicates the degree of substitution of Sn by In. The presence of cassiterite was taken into account in the Rietveld refinement. The relative amounts of the two phases was 97.9(1) mol % Na1.45Sn1.55In0.45(PO4)3 (99.43(3) mass %) and 2.1 mol % SnO2 (0.57 mass %).

The refined metal ratios (summarized in Table 1) agree very well with the nominal starting compositions which indicates that the mixtures reacted thoroughly

31P MAS NMR Study. 31P MAS NMR spectra of the samples (Figure 3), taken at room temperature, are formed by four components with their corresponding spinning sidebands (not shown in Figure 3). In all cases, intensities of different components decrease when going toward more positive chemical shifts. In the Hf sample, the components exhibit similar line widths and their separation is lower than in the other samples. In these samples, the most intense component is considerably narrower than the others lines.

In the NASICON structure each tetrahedron shares oxygens with four octahedra: two in the same M2(PO4)3 unit and two with other adjacent units. On the basis of a random distribution of tri and tetravalent cations, five possible environments for P atoms can be imagined in Na1+xM2-xInx(PO4)3 phases: P(OM)4, P(OM)3(OIn)1, P(OM)2(OIn)2, P(OM)(OIn)3, P(OIn)4. From statistical considerations, the four components detected must correspond to the first four of these environments.

The variations observed in the position of the P(OM)4 component in the four samples is associated with differences in the polarizing strength of tetravalent cations (Table 8). In general, cations with smaller radii pull the electron density away from oxygen atoms more effectively, leaving the phosphorus atoms more positively charged. This produces a higher shielding effect on the 31P NMR resonance, which explains the more negative  243)iso values observed. On the basis of the regular separation between components, the position of the nondetected component, associated with the P(OIn)4 environment, can be extrapolated to occur between -6 and -9 ppm in all analyzed samples. This value confirms again the lower shielding effect of trivalent cations. A similar effect was reported in tectosilicates where tetravalent Si is substituted by trivalent Al.

From the integrated intensities of the four observed 31P NMR components, the chemical composition of samples can be estimated. In particular, M4+/In3+ ratios (Table 1) can be calculated from the expression:

where Ii intensities, with i ) 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, correspond to components with increasing number of In atoms. From the M4+/In3+ ratios, the M4+ (2 x) and In3+ (x) contents of the octahedral sites can be deduced using the expression

The deduced occupancies (Table 1) are very close to the nominal values used in sample preparation and to those deduced from the Rietveld analyses.

A random distribution of M4+ and In3+ cations in the octahedral site would give intensities of 31P NMR components proportional to (2 x)4, 4(2 x)3x, 6(2 x)2x2, 4(2 x)x3, and x4, respectively. From integrated intensities of adjacent components corrected for statistical multiplicity, the (2 x)/x ratio were again calculated (Table 1). These ratios (4I0/I1, 6I1/4I2, 4I2/6I3) are very similar for M ) Zr, indicating a random distribution of the two metals at the octahedral site. For M ) Ti, the bands associated with groups of higher In content, especially P(OTi)3(OIn)1 and P(OTi)2(OIn)2, are larger than expected from a statistical distribution which indicates that the cations are not homogeneously distributed and some departure from statistical distribution is present. The situation for M ) Sn, Hf is intermediate. It shoud be pointed out that the values given in the 4I2/6I3 column are affected by larger errors due to the low intensities of the I3 bands.

23Na MAS NMR spectra were recorded for Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Hf, Zr) at room temperature and -50 °C (Figure 4a), and for NaHf2(PO4)3 and Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Ti, Sn) at room temperature (Figure 4b). In this figure, the spectrum for NaHf2(PO4)3, included as reference, displays two lines at -18.3 and -31.7 ppm with a small shoulder at -40.3 ppm. The observed pattern is produced by the second-order quadrupole interaction of Na nuclei at the Na(1) site with the electric field gradient. The NMR profile of the transition -1/2 to 1/2 was fitted

by a unique signal with an isotropic chemical shift of -14.2 ppm and quadrupole constants CQ ) 2.27 MHz and Ł ) 0. The location of Na(1) on 3-fold axes accounts for the observed Ł value (Ł ) 0) in NaHf2(PO4)3, in agreement with the observation reported for isostructural NaZr2(PO4)3.15 For M ) Ti and Sn, three broad components are detected at  25)-3, -19, and -32/-36 ppm (Figure 4b). For M ) Zr and Hf at room temperature, two main components are detected at -19 and -29 ppm (Figure 4a). On cooling these samples below -40 °C, the 23Na spectra reveal the presence of a new component at -7 ppm (Figure 4a).

On the basis

the Rietveld analyses

of NaM2-xInx(PO4)3 samples, one Na occupies M1 sites and the rest are distributed over the three symmetryequivalent M2 sites. Hence, 23Na spectra should give two signals, the main one with characteristics similar to those detected in NaHf2(PO4)3. In all cases, MAS NMR spectra are formed by two main components with positions (-19 and -29/-32 ppm) near those detected in NaHf2(PO4)3. However, the components are very broad indicating the existence of different environments for Na atoms.

In the case of Ti and Sn members, a third band is detected around -3 ppm in the 23Na spectra. These

spectra have been analyzed by supposing the existence of two components: one is associated with Na cations located at M1 sites, with similar characteristics to Zr and Hf samples, and the other with Na cations at M2 sites. From the difference between the experimental envelope and the profile calculated for M1 sites, the quadrupole constants associated with the second environment was derived. The quadrupolar constants associated with the two Na sites of the Sn sample are CQ  25) 2.24 MHz and Ł ) 0 for M1 sites and CQ  25) 2.40 MHz and Ł ) 0.7 for M2 sites. The relative intensities of the two components agree reasonably well with those predicted on the basis of a preferential occupation of M1 sites (M2:M1 ) 0.4:1). Asymmetry Ł values deduced for the two sites are very different, confirming that the point symmetry of the two sites is different. Chemical shifts of the two components, corrected for second-order quadrupolar effects, are -12 and 4 ppm, for Na at M1 and M2, respectively.

23Na NMR spectra for Zr and Hf samples, recorded at room temperature, show the absence of the signal associated with M2 sites. This can be explained by assuming the existence of a significant mobility that enables Na cations to exchange between the M1 and M2 sites in the NMR measuring time scale. This phenomenon would produce a single averaged line displaying intermediate chemical shift and quadrupole constants. As the Na cations are preferentially located at M1 sites, the time spent by a Na atom at M1 sites should be higher than that spent at M2 sites and the resulting quadrupole constants would be similar to those of M1 sites. The somewhat greater line widths measured for Na components in these samples suggests that some heterogeneity in the Na environment exists, probably due to mobility-related effects. When Na mobility is eliminated, by decreasing the temperature, the two environments for Na cations are resolved by 23Na NMR spectroscopy (Figure 4a), with intensities that are near those of other samples and similar to those expected from Rietveld analyses.

Impedance Study. Impedance data in the form of a complex plane plot are shown for one sample, M ) Ti, at two temperatures in Figure 5. These data are typical of all compositions. The data show a single, rather broad arc at high frequencies/low temperatures (a). With increasing temperature, lower frequency effects are seen, in the form of an inclined spike (b). This has an associated capacitance, given from the ideal relation Z¢ ¢ ) ( 246)C)-1, of about 0.6  237)F. From these data, it may be concluded that the samples are ionic conductors and that the overall pellet resistance can be determined from the intercept of the low-frequency spike or the low-frequency end of the broadened semicircular arc, on the real, Z¢ axis.

To investigate the electrical microstructure of the pellets and in particular determine whether the overall pellet resistances represented the bulk resistance of the grains or were influenced by grain boundary effects, the experimental data were replotted as the imaginary parts of the impedance, Z¢ ¢ and electric modulus, M¢ against log frequency, as shown in Figure 6 for the four samples. The data for M ) Zr showed single peaks in both the M¢ ¢ spectra, separated in frequency by about half a decade. The peaks are somewhat broader

forms the main component of the resistance of the pellet. It is attributed to a thick grain boundary effect, probably associated with the poor sintering of the ceramic.

The main conclusion for these Hf-containing samples, then, is that the Z¢ ¢ spectra and hence the Z* complex plane plots are dominated by the grain boundary component. Consequently, the Arrhenius conductivity plots for the four compositions (Figure 7a) correspond to the bulk data for M ) Ti, Sn, and Zr but to grainboundary-dominated data for M ) Hf; this accounts for the apparently anomalous response of the M ) Hf sample.

A better comparison of the intrinsic bulk conducting properties of the four compositions is obtained from Arrhenius plots of the frequency of the modulus peak maxima, M¢ ¢ (max) occurs, ideally, when  246)RC ) (2 240)f)RC ) 1; assuming that C is independent of temperature, then f(max)  181) R-1 and hence the temperature dependence of f(max) reflects the temperature dependence of R. The data in Figure 7b show that f(max) increases with increasing temperature. For a given temperature, f(max) increases (and hence R decreases) in the sequence Ti j Sn , Hf j Zr. The activation energies, given by the slopes of the Arrhenius plots (Table 2) also decrease in the same sequence.

The unit cell a and c parameters of Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3: M ) Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr (Table 2) increase in the sequence Ti < Sn < Hf < Zr, consistent with the variation in the ionic radii of M.16 When the unit-cell parameters of the parent phases, NaM2(PO4)3, and their derivatives Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3, are compared, an increase of a, a decrease of c, and an overall increase in

cell volume for each pair of phases is observed. The increase in volume is 2.6% for Ti, 2.9% for Sn, 1.0% for Hf, and 0.5% for Zr. Thus, the substitution of M(IV) by In(III) with the subsequent insertion of extra Na+ ions expands the framework anisotropically and especially in the phases with less free volume, i.e., M ) Ti and Sn. Earlier reports on the substitution of Zr(IV) by In(III) showed similar expansions in the ab plane and contractions in the c direction.5,6

The above comments relate to macroscopic or overall unit-cell data. However, the main objective of this work is to relate the structural characteristics, deduced from the XRD data, to the microscopic site and mobility information obtained from MAS NMR and to the ionic conductivity obtained from the impedance analysis. These materials have the same framework, symmetry, and overall cation ratios but significantly different local structures, affecting bottleneck sizes in the mobile ion conduction pathways.

A nonstandard view of the NASICON structure was presented in Figure 1. Long-range conduction of the Na ions in the NASICON structure involves hopping between Na(1) and Na(2) sites. These sites are joined by a bottleneck generally termed the M1M2 bottleneck. Symmetry-related infinite channels running in different directions are interconnected at the M1 site. A polyhedral view of the M1M2 bottleneck is given in Figure 8. The pseudo-hexagonal bottleneck is formed by three MO6 octahedral edges and three PO4 tetrahedral edges as previously pointed out by Hong.1 Some authors have suggested that the important structural parameter to characterize the bottleneck is the size and shape of the (T2) triangle defined by three O(2) atoms shown in Figure 8. However, Kohler and Schulz4,7,8 have suggested from the study of the probability density function (PDF) that the real M1M2 bottleneck is situated away

from the T2 triangle. These authors identified a second triangle T1 defined by one O(1) and two O(2) and suggested that the bottleneck of the M1M2 pathway is located between the T1 and T2 triangles. T1 and T2 are indicated by thick lines in Figure 8 and an ORTEP view of the pathway for a Na+ ion to jump from the M1 site to the M2 site is shown in Figure 9. As the full structures are known, all distances between atoms can be calculated. The edges of the triangles T1 and T2 and their respective areas are given in Table 9. The areas for the T1 triangles are clearly smaller than those for the T2 triangles. Hence, it seems reasonable to suggest that it should be more difficult for Na+ ions to pass between the oxygen atoms that define T1 than to pass between those that define T2.

We have sought correlations between these structural parameters determined from the XRD study and the mobility/conductivity data. In Figure 10, the areas of the T1 and T2 triangles are plotted against the activation energies for conduction from the fmax representa-
Understanding Na Mobility in NASICON Materials

tion. Although there is no obvious correlation between T2 areas and Ea, there is a clear correlation between the T1 areas and Ea. In particular, as T1 areas become smaller, activation energies increase and the hopping process is disfavored; this is consistent with the much lower Na mobility, deduced from the 23Na NMR study. The changes observed in 23Na MAS NMR spectra of the Hf and Zr materials on cooling have been assigned to a decrease of Na mobility. The averaging of the two signals due to Na(1) and Na(2) sites, induced by Na motion, is eliminated by cooling the sample. Conversely, increasing the temperature should result in loss of the Na(2) NMR signal in the spectra for Ti and Sn, as a consequence of the rapid exchange of Na between M1 and M2 sites. Further variable-temperature XRD and MAS NMR studies and isothermal impedance investigation are in progress to characterize this twostate transition.

Conclusions

(1) The multitechnique approach employed to study Na1.4M1.6In0.4(PO4)3 (M ) Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr) has allowed us

to establish the key structural parameters that relate the crystal structure with the Na mobility and ionic conductivity.

(2) M ) Ti and Sn samples have lower ionic conductivities and higher activation energies with low Na mobility at room temperature. M ) Hf and Zr samples have higher conductivities and lower activation energies with high Na mobility at room temperature.

(3) The changes in area of the T1 triangle (as simplification to define the irregular M1M2 bottleneck) correlate with variations in MAS NMR data and in the ionic conductivity properties with composition. The T1 triangle is identified as the key bottleneck in the irregular, M1M2 conduction pathway.
