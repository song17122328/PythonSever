Single-phase Na3ZrMgP3O12: Eu2+ (NZMP: Eu2+) phosphor was prepared via high-temperature solid-state reaction. The crystal structure, lattice parameters and occupied sites of Eu2+-doped Na3ZrMgP3O12 are elucidated by powder X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. It is found that majority of Eu2+ ions occupy 8-coordianted Na2 site while minority of Eu2+ are in 6-coordianted Na1 site of NZMP host. NZMP: Eu2+ shows a strong blue emission broadband with peak at 450 nm under UV excitation, which can be decomposed into two sub-bands peaking at 446 and 474 nm based on the substitution of two kinds of Na+ sites by Eu2+ ions. Luminescence properties of NZMP: Eu2+ phosphors were investigated in detail, including excitation and emission spectra, decay lifetime, concentration quenching and temperature-dependent emission spectra.

Phosphates are known as hosts of multifunctional materials for optical devices like fluorescent lamps, plasma panel display and light emitting diodes (LEDs) [[1], [2], [3], [4]], due to their excellent properties such as large band gap, good chemical/mechanical stability, and low calcination temperature synthesis. Eu2+-activated phosphates, such as LiCaPO4: Eu2+ [5], Na3Sc2(PO4)3: Eu2+ [6] and Ca6Ba(PO4)4O: Eu2+ [7], are one class of desirable phosphors for UV excitation, which exhibit color-tunable broadband emission, high quantum efficiency and excellent stability.

NASICON (sodium ion conductor), which has a three-dimensional framework structure and possesses a high Na ionic conductivity, is one of the most efficient and best known classes of fast-ion conductors [[8], [9], [10]]. NASICON compounds are characterized by an anionic framework of PO4 or SiO4 tetrahedral linked by shared oxygen ions to octahedral frame. Although NASICON systems have been much studied, researchers have mostly focused on their ionic conductivity. Although some lanthanides ions such as Eu3+/Eu2+/Dy3+/Tb3+ have been incorporated in various NASICON hosts [[11], [12], [13]], the corresponding luminescent properties have not been investigated in detail.

Na3ZrMgP3O12 is one of NASICON compound which crystallizes in trigonal R3c space group with unit cell parameters a  = 8.905 Å and c = 22.191 Å [14]. In this work, novel single-phase blue-emitting Na3ZrMgP3O12: Eu2+ phosphors were prepared for the first time via high-temperature solid-state reaction. The corresponding structure and photoluminescence properties, including Eu2+ site occupancy, CIE chromaticity coordinates, thermal quenching, and energy transfer mechanism, have been systematically investigated.

Samples with composition formula of Na3(1-2x)ZrMgP3O12: xEu2+ (x = 0.01∼0.09) were synthesized by high-temperature solid-state reaction. The stoichiometric amounts of raw materials Na2CO3 (A. R.), MgCO3 (A. R.), ZrO2 (A. R.), NH4H2PO4 (A. R.) and Eu2O3 (99.99%) were thoroughly mixed by grinding. They were pre-sinter at 300 ℃ for 2 h in air, and re-sintered at 750 ℃ for 8 h in a reducing atmosphere (N2:H2 = 90:10). Then the as-synthesized samples were cooled to room temperature and grounded to powder for further characterization.

The phase purity of samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, Japan) Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5403 Å), performing at 40 kV and 26 mA in the 2θ range from 10° to 120° with scanning speed of 10° per minute. The data for Rietveld structure refinement were collected by the same equipment with scanning speed of 1° per minute. The Rietveld structure refinements were performed by using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer with an integrated sphere attachment, and BaSO4 was used as a white standard. Room temperature photo-luminescent excitation (PLE) and emission (PL) spectra, as well as temperature-dependent PL spectra were monitored by an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 spectrofluorimeter using a continuous 450 W xenon lamp as excitation source and a R928 photomultiplier tube as detector. The decay time curves were collected using a 100 W pulsed hydrogen lamp (nF900) on the same spectrophotometer and detectors.

The phase purity of the NZMP: xEu2+ samples were identified by XRD, and the patterns of all samples are shown in Fig. 1a. The standard JCPDS card (No. 41-0503) of Na3ZrMgP3O12 is also presented for a comparison. As observed in Fig. 1a, all the diffraction peaks were similar and well-matched with that of standard card JCPDS 41-0503, indicating a single phase without impurity and good crystalline for NZMP: xEu2+ phosphors.

In order to verify the crystal structure and occupied sites, the XRD patterns of representative sample NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ was collected for Rietveld refinement by using GSAS software. In this structure, almost all peaks were indexed by trigonal cell (R3c) with parameters close to standard Na3ZrMgP3O12 (ICSD 172806), which was taken as starting model for Rietveld refinement. There are two kinds of Na sites (6-coordinated Na1 and 8-coordinared Na2) and one kind of Mg/Zr site (6-coordianted Mg/Zr) in Na3ZrMgP3O12 structure. Fig. 1b shows the observed patterns (black), calculated patterns (red), the difference patterns (yellow), background (green) and the Bragg reflections (black verticals) of the calculated patterns. The final refined residual factors and crystallographic data are illustrated in Table 1, which demonstrates the atomic coordinates, cation and anion occupancies of NZMP compound. The refinement R factors finally converged to Rwp = 7.08%, Rp = 4.98%, which indicates that NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor is a single phase without any impurity. In addition, the crystal structure of Na3ZrMgP3O12 is shown in the Fig. 2. The phosphor crystallizes with the trigonal R3c (167) structure and exhibits three different kinds of crystallographic cation sites, i.e. 6-coordinated Na+ (r = 1.02 Å), 8-coordinated Na+ (r = 1.18 Å) and 6-coordinated Zr4+/Mg2+ (r = 0.72 Å), which might be occupied by Eu2+ (r = 1.17 Å for 6-coordinated, r = 1.25 Å for 8-coordinated). Since the ionic radius of Eu2+ is larger than that of Na+, the lattice parameters of NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ sample (a = b = 8.9053 Å, c = 22.3003 Å, V = 1531.58 Å3) are slightly higher than those of NZMP host (a = b = 8.905 Å, c = 22.1910 Å, V = 1523.97 Å3).

According to the refinement result, site of fractional (S.O.F.) of Eu2+ occupied Na2 site is much higher than that occupied Na1 site, which reveals the preference of Eu2+ occupation sites. Several factors (such as ionic radii, coordination number and amount of sites) determine which lattice site Eu2+ might prefer to enter. Pires and Davolos reported that an acceptable percentage difference between doped and substituted ions do not exceed 30% [15]. The radius percentage difference between dopant ions and the matrix ions can be calculated using Eq. (1):(1)where Dr is the radius percentage difference; C.N. is the coordinate number of the cations: Rm (C.N.) and Rd (C.N.) is the radius of the possible substituted matrix ion and that of the dopant ion, respectively. The value of Dr for Eu2+ occupying Na1, Na2 ad Zr/Mg site is calculated to be 14.7%, 5.93% and 62.5%, respectively. Besides, the number of 8-coordinared Na2 sites in NZMP host is three times higher than that of 6-coordinated Na1 site. Both ionic radius and site amount will result in a fact that Eu2+ ions prefer to replace Na2 sites rather than Na1 site in NZMP host. As shown in Table 1, the anisotropic temperature factors (U[Å2]) in Na sites are relatively high, which indicates the thermal vibration in these sites is quite intense and it might have some negative impact on phosphor’s thermal stability [16].

Fig. 3 demonstrates the diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of un-doped and Eu2+ doped Na3ZrMgP3O12. An obvious drop at 215 nm with shoulder at 230 nm is observed in the DRS of un-doped Na3ZrMgP3O12, which could be attributed to the band gap of Na3ZrMgP3O12 host. Eu2+ doped Na3ZrMgP3O12 exhibit an extra absorption band at ∼320 nm, which could be attributed to Eu2+ 4f-5d transitions.

The experimental band gap (Eg) value is estimated through DRS by:(2)Where hν is the incident photon energy, α is the absorption coefficient, and A is a constant. The value of n in present case is 2 for direct transition. The absorption coefficient α is obtained as:(3)R is the observed reflectance in the DRS. The value of (αhν)2 is plotted against the incident energy hν in Fig. 3 inset. By extrapolating the linear portion to the photon energy axis, the Eg value is found as 5.15 eV.

Fig. 4a shows the PLE spectrum of NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor which consists of a broad hump from 240 nm to 400 nm peaking at 320 nm, corresponding to the electronic transition from 4f ground state to filed-splitting levels of the 5d state of the Eu2+ ion. Upon 320 nm excitation, the NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor shows a broad and asymmetric emission band from 340 nm to 570 nm peaking at 450 nm, which attributed to the spin-allowed 5d - 4f transition of the Eu2+ ion [17]. Fig. 4b demonstrates the calculated Commission International de L’Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates for the NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ sample under its maximum excitation wavelengths. The CIE coordinates are calculated to be (0.147, 0.082), indicating the color purity of NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor is close to that of BAM: Eu2+ commercial phosphor (0.144, 0.061). The photo of actual sample under 300 nm UV excitation is shown in Fig. 4b inset. As mentioned in Section 3.1, there are two Na sites with differently coordinated environments for Eu2+ occupation in NZMP structure, generating two emission bands because of the crystal field environment dependent Eu2+ emission. Based on this, Eu2+ deconvoluted Gaussian components are found from the PL spectrum (Fig. 4a), resulting in two different sub-bands centered at 443 and 471 nm.

To confirm the existence of two Eu2+ occupied sites in the system, the room-temperature PLE spectra or the two well-defined emission sub-bands were determined. As seen in Fig. 4a, although the PLE spectra overlap largely with each other, the shape and peak wavelength is different. Under an emission wavelength of 443 nm, the PLE spectrum shows the maximum peak at approximately 320 nm and a shoulder at approximately 270 nm. Meanwhile, when monitoring the emission wavelength of 471 nm, the excitation maximum wavelength is about 330 nm. The emission color is blue with the CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.147, 0.082) under 300 nm excitation (Fig. 4b).

To further identify the influence of coordination surroundings on Eu2+ different emitting peaks in NZMP: Eu2+ phosphor, the well-known empirical Van Uitert equation [18] was considered to provide a good fit to the emission peak and occupied sites:(4)in which E is the energy location of the lower d-band edge for Eu2+; Q is the energy location for the lower d-band edge for the free ion; V is the valence of the active cation; n is the coordination number; ea is the electron affinity of the coordinated anion, and its value is 2.5 eV for O2− anion; r is the radius of the host cation replaced by the activator Eu2+ ion. According to Eq. (2) the emission wavelength exhibits blue-shift when Eu2+ occupy larger site with higher coordination number, provided that the coordinated anions are of the same kind. In the present case, Eu2+ ions could occupy 6-coordinated Na1 sites (r = 1.02 Å) and 8-coordinated Na2 sites (r = 1.18 Å). The emission wavelength of Eu2+ shifts to the red region with the decrease of coordination number and cation radius. Therefore, the emission sub-band peaked at 443 nm and sub-band peaked at 471 nm are ascribed to the 5d-4f transitions of Eu2+ in 8-coordinated Na2 site and 6-coordinated Na1 site, respectively. The refinement results (Table 1) shows the majority of Eu2+ ions occupy 8-coordinated Na2 site, and thus the intensity of corresponding sub-bands has the same tendency.

Fig. 4c and d shows the luminescence decay curves of Eu2+ in representative NZMP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor. Since Eu2+ ions are occupied multi-sites in Na3ZrMgP3O12 host, the decay lifetimes of each emission sub-band were measured with excitation of 320 nm laser. The effective decay time for 443 nm and 471 nm emission is 136.85 ns and 120.96 ns, respectively. The difference in lifetime indicates the blue emission band of NZMP: Eu2+ is composed of at least two contributions of Eu2+. Above analysis further proves the existence of multiple Eu2+ luminescent centers in the phosphor host.

Fig. 5 demonstrates the decay lifetimes of NZMP: xEu2+ samples monitoring 450 nm emission at 320 nm laser excitation. It is found that all decay curves could be well-fitted with bi-exponential function as followed:(5)where I is the luminescence intensity; A1 and A2 are constants; t is the time; and τ1 and τ2 are rapid and slow lifetimes for exponential components. Using these parameters, the effective decay times (τ*) can be determined by:(6)where I is the luminescent intensity at time t, and t is the time. The fitted results indicate that the effective decay time of all NZMP: xEu2+ samples are around 130 ns.

Fig. 6a presents the dependence of the PL spectra of NZMP: xEu2+ with changing Eu2+ concentration (x) with the excitation wavelength of 320 nm. It can be seen that with the increasing of x, there is no obvious shift on emission wavelength or spectral shape. Therefore, the corresponding CIE coordinates remains unchanged with varied Eu2+ content. Meanwhile, the luminous intensity increases gradually to a maximum (x = 0.04, Fig. 6b), then decreases due to the concentration quenching effect.

As we know, the concentration quenching process depends on the critical transfer distance (Rc), which is the shortest average distance between the nearest activator of Eu2+ at critical concentration. The critical distance ions is critical for further understanding the interaction mechanisms, which was often calculated by using concentration quenching method and the relationship proposed by Blasse [19,20]:(7)where V is the volume of the unit cell, xc is the critical concentration, N is the number of cations in the unit cell. For the host Na3ZrMgP3O12, the values V = 1524.0 Å3, xc = 0.04, N = 6*3 = 18. Thus, the Rc value was calculated to be 15.93 Å. There are three mechanisms for the nonradiative energy transfer, i.e. exchange interaction, radiation reabsorption and electric multipolar interaction. Since the spectral overlap between PL and PLE spectra is negligible, radiation reabsorption could not be dominant. Blasse et al. reported that the critical distance for an exchange interaction is approximately 5 Å or less. Therefore, an exchange interaction is impossible. Thus, the energy transfer mechanism among the Eu2+ ions is expected to be a multipolar interaction [21]. According to Dexter’s theory, the exact interaction type between activators can be calculated by [22]:(8)in which x is the activator concentration, not less than the critical concentration, I⁄x is the emission intensity (I) per activator concentration (x), K and β are constants for the same excitation condition for a given host lattice. Q is a function of electric multipolar character and Q = 6, 8, 10 corresponds to dipole-dipole (d-d), dipole-quadrupole (d-q), and quadrupole-quadrupole (q-q) interactions, respectively [23]. As represented in Fig. 6c, the correlation between lg(I/x) and lg(x) can be fitted linearly with a slope of -1.64 equaling to − Q/3. The Q value is determined to be 4.92, close to 6. Therefore, the concentration quenching mechanism of NZMP: xEu2+ is mainly attributed to the dipole-dipole interaction.

Generally, the thermal stability is a key parameter for phosphors to be considered in actual application. The temperature-dependent PL spectra of NMZP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor under excitation at 320 nm are shown in Fig. 7a. It can be seen that the emission intensity of NMZP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor generally decreases with increasing temperature from 273 K to 473 K, while the peak wavelength and shape of emission spectra remains unchanged. As seen in Fig. 7b, the integrated emission intensity still remains about 50% at 373 K and 30% at 473 K compared with the initial value at 293 K. Further, no obvious shift was found for the emission peaks positions, which indicates that the color coordinates of the phosphor are stable with increasing temperature.

As seen in Table 1, the anisotropic temperature factors (U) of Eu2+ in Na sites (∼0.1 Å) are relatively high compared with Ce3+ in Y sites of YAG (0.0093 Å) [24]. According to studies of Seshadri et al. [[25], [26], [27]], high U values indicate a larger number of phonon levels accessible through thermal activation which enhances the quenching process of excited electrons nonradiatively. Thus, the probability of nonradiative transitions increases and a stronger thermal quenching is expected.

In order to further investigate the thermal quenching mechanism, the activation energy was also calculated using the Arrhenius equation [28]:(9)where I0 and IT represent the PL intensity at room temperature and testing temperature, respectively; k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617*10−5 eV K−1); A is a constant; and Ea is the activation energy for thermal quenching. According to the Eq. (4), the activation energy Ea can be calculated from a plot of ln[(I0/IT)-1] against 1/kT. Fig. 7c plots the dependence of ln[(I0/IT)-1] on 1/kT for thermal quenching of NMZP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor. The corresponding activation energy Ea was found to be 0.184 eV (=1480 cm−1, i.e. less than two lattice phonons), which is quite a small value and therefore result in thermal quenching of emission with rising temperature. As a comparison, temperature-dependent PL spectra of representative NZMP: 0.02Eu2+ and NZMP: 0.07Eu2+ samples are also measured (Fig. 8a and b). It can be seen that both phosphor demonstrate a constant decrease of emission intensity and relatively obvious thermal quenching with increasing temperature, which is similar with that in NMZP: 0.04Eu2+ phosphor.

A series of blue-emitting Na3ZrMgP3O12: Eu2+ phosphors were synthesized for the first time by high-temperature solid-state reaction. The XRD results show that the Na3ZrMgP3O12 belongs to NASICON-type phosphate and doped Eu2+ ions prefer to occupy Na2 site. Under UV excitation, the NZMP: Eu2+ phosphor exhibit one dominating emission broadband with peak at 450 nm, which can be resolved into two sub-bands peaking at 446 and 474 nm, attributed to Eu2+ occupying two kinds of Na+ sites. The critical quenching concentration of Eu2+ is 0.04, and the concentration quenching mechanism in NZMP: Eu2+ is dipole-dipole interaction on the basis of Van Uiter equation. The NZMP: Eu2+ phosphor showed obvious thermal quenching and its corresponding CIE coordinates are (0.147, 0.082).
