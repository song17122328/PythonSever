This paper presents a physicochemical study of Na1 – xMg1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) glass 2) ceramics and oxide glasses containing different amounts of bismuth oxide and having broad glass 2)forming regions, which allows the composition and properties of the materials to be varied over a rather wide range. We have studied Eu3+ luminescence under ultraviolet excitation in glass 2)ceramics containing a crystalline phase with the composition Na1 – xMg1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5). The highest Eu3+ luminescence intensity is offered by the NaMgSc(MoO4)3 and Na0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3 materials. With increasing Eu2O3 concentration, the luminescence intensity increases, reaching the highest level at 5 mol %. The glass 2)ceram 2) ics have trigonal symmetry (sp. gr. R c). The emission band at 614 nm (Eu3+ 5D0 → 7F2 transition) has high intensity, whereas the bands at 592 and 596 nm ( 5D0 → 7F1 transition) are rather weak. This suggests that Na1 – xMg1 – xSc1 + x(MoO4)3:Eu3+ (0  ≤ x  ≤ 0.5) glass 2)ceramics are potentially attractive, bright red phos 2) phors.

A  great  deal  of  attention  is  currently  paid  to  the engineering  of  glass 2)ceramic  composite  materials offering unique nonlinear optical properties and lumi 2) nescence  spectra  that  would  allow  the  efficiency  of lasers to be improved by several times and possessing catalytic activity, ionic conductivity, and thermal and chemical stability [1]. The most widespread approach for  producing  composites  is  the  annealing  of  glassy materials prepared from melts containing a presynthe 2) sized  fine 2)particle  crystalline  phase  that  possesses required functional characteristics and allows one to obtain poreless, defect 2)free, fine 2)grained mate 2) rials [2].

In  this  paper,  we  report  the  preparation  of  Eu3+ 2) doped  borosilicate  glasses.  We  analyze  the  spectro 2) scopic  and  luminescence  properties  of  borosilicate glasses  containing  various  amounts  of  bismuth oxide,  discuss  the  feasibility  of  using  such  glasses as  red  phosphors,  and   examine  the  effect  of Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 (0  ≤ х  ≤  0.5)  additions with  a  NASICON 2)related  structure  on  the  prepara 2) tion of glass 2)ceramic materials. The choice of phases of  variable  composition  with  a  NASICON 2)related structure has been prompted by the fact that a number of materials with such structures have electrical, non 2) linear optical, spectroscopic, and luminescence prop 2) erties of interest for practical applications [1, 2].

Activator  ions  in  glasses  have  broader  absorption bands  owing  to  inhomogeneous  broadening,  which allows one to improve the excitation efficiency. Oxide glasses possess high chemical stability and weak tem 2) perature quenching. They have a lower emission prob 2) ability  owing  to  their  high 2)phonon  vibrational  spec 2) trum [3].

The purpose of this work was to study the lumines 2) cence  spectra  of  glass 2)ceramics  based  on  Eu3+ 2)acti 2) vated borosilicate glasses intended for use as photolu 2) minescent phosphors.

We studied two borosilicate glasses. Glass Gl 2)1 had the following composition (wt %): SiO2, 15; B2O3, 25; Al2O3, 3; La2O3, 2.5; Lu2O3, 2; ZnO, 5.5; Bi2O3, 47. The  Eu2O3  activator  concentration  was  1–6  mol  %. Glass  Gl 2)2  had  the  following  composition  (wt  %): SiO2, 8; B2O3, 20; Lu2O3, 5; ZnO, 36; Bi2O3, 31. To obtain  various  activator  concentrations,  aluminum, lanthanum, and lutetium oxides were replaced by an equimolar amount of europium oxide. In this way, we obtained  glass  samples  containing  1–6  mol  %  rare 2) earth oxide (Eu2O3) (Fig. 1).

The  starting  materials  used  in  the  preparation  of the glasses were the SiO2, B2O3, Al2O3, La2O3, Lu2O3, ZnO, Bi2O3, and Eu2O3 oxides. All of the oxides were of  analytical  or  reagent  grade.  The  rare 2)earth  oxides were of extrapure grade (99.99+% purity). The glasses were prepared in closed platinum crucibles by stepwise firing of stoichiometric amounts of appropriate oxides in  the  temperature  ranges  550–650  and  700–980°С for  80–100  h  with  repeated  intermediate  grindings. The  melt  was  homogenized  at  a  temperature  of 1000°С for 3 h and then cast into a copper mold. The resultant glass samples were additionally annealed for 40 h at 300°С to relieve stresses.

The glass transition temperature (tg) and crystalli 2) zation temperature (tx) were determined by differen 2) tial thermal analysis (DTA) using an MOM OD 2)103 thermoanalytical  system.  The  glasses  and  the Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  phase  of  variable  com 2) position were characterized by X 2)ray diffraction on a Bruker  AXS  D8  Advance  diffractometer  with  CuKα radiation  in  the  angular  range  2θ  =  10°–70°.  The unit 2)cell parameters of the phase of variable composi 2) tion were determined using Rentgen software.

The  luminescence  spectra  of  the  samples  were measured on an SM 2203 spectrofluorometer (Solar, Belarus). Powder samples were placed between opti 2) cally  transparent  (quartz)  glasses.  Excitation  light (from  a  DKsSh  150 2)1M  high 2)pressure  xenon  arc lamp) was incident along the normal to the surface of the sample, and steady 2)state photoluminescence (PL) was detected at 45°, which reduced the contribution of the  light  reflected  from  the  lamp.  The  measurement accuracy was ±2 nm.

The  starting  materials  used  to  study  the  system were Na2MoO4, MgMoO4, and Sc2(MoO4)3 presynthe 2) sized by solid 2)state reactions between Na2CO3, MgO, Sc2O3,  and  MoO3  in  the  temperature  range  400– 650°С,  with  repeated  intermediate  grindings  every 20–30  h.  The  calcination  time  at  each  temperature was 120–250 h. After annealing, the samples were fur 2) nace  cooled.  Nonequilibrium  samples  were  further annealed.  Equilibrium  was  thought  to  be  reached  if two sequential anneals did not change the phase com 2) position of the samples.

The  phase  relations  in  the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3 system were studied in two steps. First, we determined the phase composition at the intersection of joins between intermediate and binary molybdates in  systems  Na2MoO4– MgMoO4,  Na2MoO4–Sc2(MoO4)3,  and  MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3.  In  the  second  step,  we  studied  the pseudobinary  joins  identified,  which  allowed  us  to construct the phase compatibility diagram of the sys 2) tem (Fig. 2).

In  the  plane  of  the  Na2MoO4–MgMoO4– Sc2(MoO4)3  composition  triangle  and  along  the NaMgSc(MoO4)3–Sc2(MoO4)3  join,  we  observed  the formation of the Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х (MoO4)3 (0 ≤  х ≤ 0.5) phase of variable composition, which is a cation 2) deficient  solid  solution  based  on  the  ternary  molyb 2) date NaMgSc(MoO4)3. In addition, at temperatures from 600 to 650°C we observed the formation of the ternary  molybdate  NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5  on  the NaSc(MoO4)2–MgMoO4  join  (1  :  3  ratio).  Single 2) phase samples of the Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 phase of  variable  composition  with  a  NASICON 2)related structure (sp. gr. R c, Z = 6) were obtained by calcina 2) tion at 680°C for 140–160°C. The ternary molybdate NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5, crystallizing in triclinic symmetry (sp. gr. P1, Z = 2), was obtained in single 2)phase form by firing at 700°C for 200 h. NaMg3Sc(MoO4)5 has the following  unit 2)cell  parameters:  a  =  6.949(2)  Å,  b  = 17.588(5)  Å,  c =  6.859(1)  Å,  α  =  87.82(2)°,  β  = 101.45(2)°, and γ = 92.38(2)°.


According to   X 2)ray   diffraction   data, Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  crystallizes  in  trigonal  sym 2) metry  and  is  isostructural  with  the  ternary  molybdate Na0.625Zn0.625Sc1.375(MoO4)3 [4]. The large width of the primary  crystallization  field  of  the  NASICON 2)type solid solution (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5) is due to the possibility of isomorphous substitutions in the octahedra. The octa 2) hedral site (M), occupied at random by the Mg and Sc atoms, contains an excess of scandium (at х > 0) and is deficient in magnesium. The sodium atoms, residing in  voids  of  the  framework,  do  not  distort  the  lattice symmetry and are also deficient. These structural fea 2) tures of Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 and the cation dis 2) tribution lead to an increase in the contribution of the Sc–O bonds to the overall electrostatic balance in the structure.  To  maintain  the  balance  in  the  structure, Na–O bond weakening is required, which is achieved through sodium deficiency in the voids of the frame 2) work and an increase in its size (table).

The  Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3  (0  ≤  х  ≤  0.5) phases of variable composition obtained in this study have  a  corundum 2)like  rhombohedral  framework,  in which three sites in voids are empty and the fourth may contain,  in  addition  to  the  alkali  cation,  vacancies. whose fraction reaches 50% at the boundary composi 2) tion  Na0.5Mg0.5Sc1.5(MoO4)3  [4].  In  the  structure  of Na1 – хMg1 – хSc1 + х(MoO4)3 (0 ≤ х ≤ 0.5), the Mo atoms occupy special positions on the twofold rotation axis (sp. gr. R c, С2 symmetry). The Mg and Sc atoms are located on the threefold rotation axis and are distrib 2) uted at random over two sets of crystallographic sites in octahedral  oxygen  coordination  (С3  symmetry).  The vacant octahedral and tetrahedral sites form a three 2) dimensional  network  of  channels,  whose  voids  are occupied  by  sodium  cations.  The  position  of  the sodium cations has С3i symmetry.

Analysis of the luminescence spectra of the glass 2) ceramics  indicates  that  the  europium 2)oxide 2)doped samples offer high lasing efficiency of the Eu3+ 5D0 → 7F2  transition,  a  narrow  luminescence  band,  a  long decay  time  (86  µs),  and  a  small  thermal  expansion coefficient (6.4 × 10–6 K–1).

Studies of the spectroscopic and luminescent prop 2) erties of Eu3+ 2)activated borosilicate 2)glass 2)based glass 2) ceramics will make it possible to considerably extend their application field as efficient phosphors and laser media.

The luminescence spectra of the Eu3+ ion in the glasses contain a band at 578 nm, corresponding to the selection  rule  forbidden  transition  5D0  →  7F0  of  the Eu3+  ion  in  the  4f  configuration.  We  also  detected Stark splitting of bands, suggesting that the Eu3+ ion was in a low 2)symmetry environment [5].

The  luminescence  spectra  of  the  glass 2)ceramics contain four bands corresponding to transitions from the 5D0 level to levels of the Eu3+ 7FJ ground state mul 2) tiplet.  The  ratio  of  the  integrated  intensities  corre 2) sponding to the 5D0 → 7F2 and 5D0 → 7F1 transitions in  the  samples  under  consideration  is  considerably larger than that in the glasses. In particular, this ratio is 16.4 in the NaMgSc(MoO4)3 sample.
