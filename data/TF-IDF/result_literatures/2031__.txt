Li mobility in triclinic and rhombohedral phases of the Nasicon-type compound LiZr2(PO4)3 as deduced from NMR spectroscopy

The Nasicon-type LiZr2(PO4)3 compound exhibits, around 310 K, a ﬁrst order transition from the triclinic C1¯ to the rhombohedral R3¯c form, which has been followed by DSC, XRD and NMR (31P and 7Li) techniques. During heating–cooling treatments a hysteresis cycle was detected in which triclinic and rhombohedral phases coexist. In the low-temperature triclinic form, the four-fold coordination of Li deduced from neutron diffraction experiments, at midway positions between M1 and M2 sites, was conﬁrmed. From relaxation NMR data, a microscopic activation energy of Em ~ 0.43 eV was measured in the triclinic phase. Above the phase transition a strong delocalisation of Li over structural sites disposed along conduction paths was detected. The high mobility of Li detected in the high-temperature form explains the outstanding conductivity reported for the rhombohedral phase.

Lithium-ion conducting solids are materials of increasing interest because of their possible use as solid electrolytes in high-energy solid-state batteries. Nasicon1 materials of formula LiM2(PO4)3, where M ~ Ge, Ti, Sn, Hf, Zr, have been extensively studied2–6 because of their good ionic conductivity. The framework of these compounds is built up by M2(PO4)3 units in which two MO6 octahedra and three tetrahedral PO4 share oxygen atoms. The [MO6][(PO4)3][MO6] units alternate with the alkali cations to make inﬁnite chains parallel to the ternary axis of the structure (c-axis). Each PO4 tetrahedron shares its oxygens with four MO6 of three M2(PO4)3 units to form the Nasicon’s framework. In this structure, alkali cations can diffuse along a three-dimensional network of conduction paths, where they can be accommodated at different sites.

In LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiTi2(PO4)3 compounds, a rhombohedral symmetry (space group R3¯c) was deduced from X-ray (XRD) and neutron diffraction (ND) experiments.7,8 In this phase Li ions are octahedrally coordinated at the intersection of three conduction channels (M1 sites). When the ionic radii of the tetravalent cation M41 become bigger (M ~ Sn, Hf, Zr), a triclinic distortion was detected9–11 that disappeared when samples were heated above the phase transition temperature. Concerning LiZr2(PO4)3, Sudreau et al.5 concluded from NMR and XRD analysis that the symmetry of the low-temperature form was monoclinic (space group Cc). Later, a detailed indexing of the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of LiZr2(PO4)3 conﬁrmed the triclinic symmetry for this phase.12 Finally, neutron diffraction studies of lowand high-temperature forms11,13 of LiZr2(PO4)3 conﬁrmed triclinic and rhombohedral symmetries for the two related phases. In the triclinic phase (called a’), this study showed that the Li ions occupy, with probabilities 0.71 and 0.29, Li(1) and Li(2) positions between M1 and M2 sites (see Fig. 1). In the rhombohedral phase (called a), Li1 ions are distributed over six equivalent positions around M1 sites making detection difﬁcult with diffractometric techniques. Structural analysis carried out in both phases conﬁrmed different mobilities proposed for Li in the two forms.

In this work, structural sites and the mobility of Li1 ions in LiZr2(PO4)3 are analyzed by 7Li NMR spectroscopy. For that, the triclinic–rhombohedral transition has been previously characterized with DSC, XRD and 31P MAS-NMR techniques. Obtained results permit a better understanding of the conductivity data reported on this compound.5

The sample of LiZr2(PO4)3 was prepared by the ceramic method. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3, ZrO2 and

(NH4)2HPO4 were ﬁrst dried at 120 uC for 10 h and then mixed and treated in a platinum crucible at 180, 300, 500, 700, 900 and 950 uC. After each treatment, the mixture was ground using an agate mortar and analyzed by X-ray diffraction. The samples were stored for later use when the characteristic peaks of reagents and/or intermediate compounds such as pyrophosphates were not detected.

A differential scanning calorimeter (Seiko 220 CU) was used to analyze the phase transformation of LiZr2(PO4)3. The experiment was carried out under a static air atmosphere between 260 and 100 uC with heating and cooling rates of 10 uC min21. The estimated error on enthalpy values was lower than 0.1 J g21.

X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were recorded at different temperatures in the range of 20–70 uC using a hightemperature AP HTK10 camera adapted to a PW 1050/25 Phillips diffractometer. In cooling and heating experiments, the sample was kept at each temperature for 5 min before recording XRD patterns with Cu-Ka radiation (l ~ 1.5405981 A˚ ). Data were collected in the 2h range 12–40u with a step size of 0.02u and a counting time of 0.1 s step21.

31P and 7Li NMR spectra recorded under static and MAS conditions were obtained at different temperatures between 18 and 80 uC using a B-VT 1000/SU07 unit adapted to an MSL 400 Bruker spectrometer. The frequencies used for 31P and 7Li were 161.97 and 155.50 MHz, respectively. Spectra were taken after a p/2 pulse irradiation and the interval between successive scans chosen to avoid saturation effects (20–30 s). In the MASNMR experiments, the spinning rate of samples was 4 kHz. In all cases, the number of accumulations was 10. 7Li and 31P chemical shift values were given relative to 1 M LiCl and 85% H3PO4 aqueous solutions. The ﬁtting of NMR spectra was carried out using the Bruker WINFIT software package.14 This program allows the position, line width and intensity of components to be determined with a non-linear, least-squares iterative method; however, quadrupole CQ and g values have to be deduced with a trial and error procedure. For quantitative purposes, the sum of the integrated intensities of spinning sidebands of each component was calculated. 7Li spin-lattice (T1) relaxation times of LiZr2(PO4)3 were obtained between 270 and 100 uC with the p–t–p/2 sequence. Reciprocal spin21) were deduced from the spin relaxation times values (T2 full-width at half-height (FWHH) of the NMR lines. In the 21 values were calculated as 0.6p 6 case of Gaussian lines, T2 21 were calculated as FWHH; in the case of Lorenzian lines, T2 p 6 FWHH.

Calorimetric curves obtained during the heating and cooling runs of LiZr2(PO4)3 are shown in Fig. 2. During heating experiments, an endothermic peak was detected at ca. 51 uC with an enthalpy of 13.2 J g21. In cooling treatments, an exothermic peak was detected at 33 uC. The enthalpy corresponding to this peak was 211.5 J g21. The position of the high temperature peak shifted towards slightly lower temperatures, decreasing the separation between two peaks, in subsequent heating and cooling cycles (not shown in Fig. 2)

X-Ray diffraction patterns of LiZr2(PO4)3, recorded between 20 and 70 uC, are shown in Fig. 3. In agreement with previous results,12 the phase detected at room temperature displays a triclinic distortion (space group C1¯), with unit cell parameters a ~ 15.079 A˚ , b ~ 8.855 A˚ , c ~ 9.123 A˚ , a ~ 89.7u, b ~ 123.95u and c ~ 90.44u. In the case of the rombohedral phase (space group R3¯c), obtained above 50 uC, unit cell parameters are a ~ 8.85493 A˚ and c ~ 22.1440 A˚ .13 In the temperature range 35–55 uC,

the triclinic and rhombohedral phases coexist in the XRD patterns.

31P NMR spectra recorded at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4. At room temperature, the spectra are formed by the three lines at 222.2, 223.6 and 224.1 ppm ascribed to three crystallographic sites of the triclinic phase.11 Up to and above 40 uC, the intensity of the 222.2 and 223.6 ppm lines decreases progressively. When the structural transition was achieved, the 31P MAS-NMR spectrum is formed by a single component at 224 ppm ascribed to the unique site occupied by phosphorus in the rhombohedral structure.13 Small peaks near 222 ppm have been assigned to the presence of an amorphous secondary phase. During cooling treatments, the opposite behavior was detected. From the intensity of 31P NMR lines, the relative proportion of the rhombohedral phase as a function of the temperature was deduced (Fig. 4, bottom). During heating treatments, the rhombohedral phase was preponderant above 50 uC; however, during cooling treatments the triclinic

According to deduced values, distortions produced in Li polyhedra are more important in the triclinic than in the rhombohedral phase.

The 7Li MAS NMR spectrum of the triclinic phase was reproduced with a single site indicating that, contrary to results deduced from ND experiments, Li1 ions occupy only one type of site. Quadrupole constants deduced in the triclinic form of LiZr2(PO4)3 are very similar to those deduced in LiHf2(PO4)3, where Li1 ions occupy Li(1) sites, located between M1 and M2 sites10 (see Fig. 1). Calculated second moment values of the triclinic phase (0.30 G2) agree reasonably well with those deduced from the central NMR line recorded under static conditions (0.33 G2), conﬁrming again the occupation of Li(1) sites. These values were deduced from the Van Vleck’s expression:17 3 5

where the ﬁrst term accounts for dipolar interactions between like spins and the second for interactions between unlike spins, cI and cS are the gyromagnetic ratios for I and S spins and rjk is the distance between interacting spins. In these calculations, it was shown that dipolar Li–P interactions (0.2 G2) are considerably higher than Li–Li interactions (0.06 G2).

In the rhombohedral phase, the 7Li NMR signal displays axial symmetry, suggesting that lithium ions occupy M1 sites located at the ternary axis. However, the static 7Li NMR spectrum of the rhombohedral phase, displays narrowing effects associated with an increase of the Li mobility. According to this fact, the line changes from Gaussian to Lorenzian shape. The increase in Li mobility was supported by the structural analysis of the two related phases: Li–O bond distances increase from 2.09 to 2.27 A˚ when going from the triclinic to the rhombohedral phase.11,13 In the last phase, Petit and Sapoval18 concluded from crystallographic data that the M1 site splits into six equivalent positions to conserve the D3d symmetry. As a consequence of the lithium delocalization in M1 cavities, an averaged axial symmetry is detected by 7Li NMR spectroscopy. In 7Li NMR spectra recorded with the MAS techniques, dipolar interactions are eliminated and the linewidth of central transitions is reduced. From this fact, spectral resolution increases considerably allowing a better analysis of structural sites occupied by lithium in the two crystallographic forms. A comparison of MAS-NMR spectra of the two phases showed that the linewidth of the central transition of the rhombohedral phase is higher than in the triclinic phase (not shown), suggesting that Li ions occupy several sites in the rhombohedral phase and that the central component is the result of averaging effects. According to this fact, the experimental MAS-NMR envelope of the rhombohedral phase could not be ﬁtted with a single component and an additional narrow component, associated with mobile Li species, should be included in the analysis of the spectrum.

The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation 21 values time is given in Fig. 6. In this plot, relaxation T1 remain constant below 250 K, but increase considerably above 21 values increase sharply as this temperature. At 310 K, T1 a consequence of the triclinic–rhombohedral transformation. 21 curve attains a broad maximum.

Li mobility 7Li (I ~ 3/2) NMR spectra of LiZr2(PO4)3, recorded at different temperatures, are given in Fig. 5. 7Li static NMR spectra, obtained at room temperature, are formed by a central (21/2, 1/2) line and two satellite transitions (¡1/2, ¡3/2) that produce small shoulders at both sides of the maximum [spectra at the bottom of Fig. 5(a) and 5(b)]. In the case of the 7Li MASNMR spectra, central and satellite transitions are modulated by narrow spinning sidebands, and this favors the detection of the quadrupole pattern (see Fig. 5). 7Li NMR spectra of LiZr2(PO4)3 recorded at T w 50 uC are clearly different from those recorded at T v 40 uC indicating that Li1 ions change their position when going from the triclinic to the rhombohedral phase. In the triclinic phase, satellite transitions in static 7Li NMR spectra display three broad shoulders; however, in the rhombohedral phase the same transitions display only two shoulders at both sides of the central transition16 [see bottom spectra of Fig. 5(a) and 5(b)].

By ﬁtting the static and MAS-NMR spectra, quadrupole CQ and g constants related to principal values of the electrical ﬁeld tensor at structural sites occupied by lithium were determined. From these values, point symmetry and polyhedra distortions can be estimated.16 In the case of the rhombohedral

the reduced temperature range analyzed, 21 values remain constant below 250 K, indicating that time spent by Li at Li(1) sites is important. Above this temperature, the residence time at these sites becomes shortened and the mobility of the lithium increases. 21 curve, detected below the From the linear part of the T1 phase transition temperature, a microscopic activation energy Em ~ 0.43 eV, was deduced for the Li motion in the triclinic phase. This value is lower than that obtained with impedance spectroscopy5 (EM ~ 0.65 eV), suggesting the existence of correlation effects on the lithium motion. According to Ngai’s work,21 the long-range activation energy EM is given by the expression: bEM ~ Em, where Em is the microscopic energy deduced from NMR results and b is the correlation parameter associated with the Li motion. From Em and EM values, a value of b # 0.6 was deduced. Above the phase transition, T1 21 values attain a broad maximum indicating that correlation times are near tc # 1028 s. In a previous work, two different 21 curve of this relaxation mechanisms were resolved in the T1 compound; however, long-range activation energies could not be measured precisely. From electric impedance measurements, a macroscopic activation energy of 0.43 eV could be ﬁnally measured for the high-temperature phase5,16 of LiZr2(PO4)3. Along the transition, the quadrupole constant of the rhombohedral phase, CQ ~ 110 kHz, decreases considerably with respect to that measured in the triclinic phase (CQ ~ 186 kHz). However, CQ values measured in the rhombohedral LiZr2(PO4)3 phase are considerably higher than those measured22,23 in LiTi2(PO4)3 (CQ # 45 kHz), where Li ions occupy M1 sites. This difference supports the hypothesis that lithium ions occupy, besides M1 sites, other structural sites with high CQ values in the rhombohedral form. If it is assumed that lithium ions spend similar times at M1 and intermediate Li(1) sites, the

Q and CB

where CA Q are the quadrupole constants of M1 and Li(1) sites, PA and PB are the occupation probabilities of M1 and Li(1) sites, and the factor 3 takes into account the multiplicity of Li(1) sites. However, the calculated value (CQ # 145 kHz) is higher than that deduced from the NMR spectrum (110 kHz), suggesting that Li occupies sites with lower CQ constants [M2 or Li(2)] or that CQ values of the Li(1) sites decreased above the phase transition. The structural analysis of two phases of LiZr2(PO4)3 showed that Li(1)–O distances increase when going from the triclinic to the rhombohedral form, supporting the assumed decrease of CQ in Li(1) sites. Above the phase transition, CQ values do not change, indicating that PA and PB must be near 0.25 (the maximum delocalisation of lithium).

Taking into account the results obtained in this work, the schematic diagram of potential wells given in Fig. 7 can be tentatively proposed. In the triclinic phase, Li1 ions occupy the potential wells associated with Li(1) sites and the resulting mobility is very low. According to this fact, the four-fold coordination of Li at Li(1) sites, deduced from ND data, could be responsible for the triclinic distortion detected in LiZr2(PO4)3. Above 310 K, coordination of Li becomes uncomfortable at the Li(1) sites and potential wells at Li(1) sites decrease producing the triclinic–rhombohedral transformation. In the rhombohedral form, potential wells of Li(1) decrease and become similar to that of the M1 sites; from this fact, residence times at M1 and Li(1) sites become similar, favoring exchange processes between these sites and the delocalisation of lithium in conduction paths. Taking into account the important amount of vacant sites in conduction channels and that structural bottlenecks along conduction paths do not limit Li diffusion, the resulting mobility of Li is important in the rhombohedral phase. The existence of frequent hops between Li(1) and M1 sites explains the averaged rhombohedral symmetry detected by NMR and the difﬁcult localization of Li by ND technique.

Conclusions

The triclinic–rhombohedral transformation of LiZr2(PO4)3 produced at 310 K has been studied by DSC, XRD and 31P MAS-NMR techniques. Along the transition, a hysteresis loop was detected in which both crystallographic phases coexist.

The use of 7Li NMR spectroscopy has permitted the analysis of structural sites occupied by Li1 ions in the two structural forms of LiZr2(PO4)3. From the analysis of quadrupole parameters (CQ ~ 186 kHz, g ~ 0), the four-fold coordination of Li at Li(1) sites, deduced from the ND study of the triclinic phase, has been conﬁrmed. In this phase the activation energy deduced from Li NMR data is Ea ~ 0.43 eV; however, correlation effects on Li motion increased to EM ~ 0.65 eV, the macroscopic activation energy deduced from conductivity measurements. Above the phase transition, residence times at structural sites decreased, favoring delocalization of Li ions in conduction paths. As a consequence of the averaging motions, an axial symmetry was deduced from the 7Li NMR spectrum of the rhombohedral phase (CQ ~ 110 kHz, g ~ 0). The important mobility of lithium, explains the difﬁculties found studying the localization of lithium in the rhombohedral phase by diffraction techniques.
