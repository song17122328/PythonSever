Ternary indium (III) phosphates with three-dimensional frameworks, [M3In(PO4)2]n (M ¼ K, n ¼ 10; M ¼ Rb, n ¼ 2), are found andfirstly reported in this paper.
These compounds have been obtained by high temperature solid-state reactions and their crystal structureshave been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
The title compounds, which crystallize in monoclinic system, possessthe same [In(PO4)2]n3n anionic frameworks built up from interconnected InO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra and have an interestingtunnel structure where M+ cations are located.
Optical and bonding properties of [Rb3In(PO4)2]2 are investigated in terms of measuredabsorption and emission spectra, and calculated band structures and density of states.
The crystal band structures obtained by the DFTmethod show that the solid compound of [Rb3In(PO4)2]2 is an insulator with direct band gap, and the P–O covalent bond characters arelarger than the In–O ones in this compound.
In the present work, [M3In(PO4)2]n (M ¼ K, n ¼ 10;M ¼ Rb, n ¼ 2) have been synthesized by solid-statereaction and their structures have been determined by thesingle crystal X-ray diffraction technique.
These compoundspossess the same three-dimensional [In(PO4)2]n3nanionic frameworks with channels occupied by M+ ions.
The frameworks are built up from interconnected [InO6]octahedra and [PO4] tetrahedra.
The observed absorptionedge and shoulder peak is separate at about 400 and220nm, and two emission peaks are located at 445nm and575nm for the powder phase of [Rb3In(PO4)2]2. Thecalculated band structures show that the solid state of[Rb3In(PO4)2]2 is an insulator with direct band gap atabout 3.18 eV and the optical transition of lowest energymainly originates from O-2p to In-5s states.
In [Rb3In(PO4)2]2, the [PO4] tetrahedra have covalence bondcharacters and the Rb–O ionic interactions are stronger.
The optical dielectric constant of [Rb3In(PO4)2]2 crystal isestimated to be 1.5102, 1.5914, and 1.5657 in x, y, and zdirections, respectively, taken as theoretical predictions.
