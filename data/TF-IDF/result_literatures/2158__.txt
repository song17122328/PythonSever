Solid reaction and sol–gel varieties of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphates have been investigated by magnetic susceptibility and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). As expected from the formulation, they contain an important amount of paramagnetic Cu21 ions. Room-temperature EPR spectra in the X and Q bands exhibit relatively different local information about paramagnetic environments related to structural properties. Analysis of the spectra reveals that Cu21 ions are distributed in two types of site. Computer simulations of EPR spectra have been realized: EPR parameters suggest that Cu21 environments are less distorted for the ﬁrst type of site and more distorted for the second one. In the sol–gel variety the copper complex exhibits a larger distortion than in the solid reaction variety. The Cu21 ions are distributed in ratios of about 2/3 to 1/3 for the solid reaction variety and of about 60 to 40% for the sol–gel variety. From EPR parameters, it is found that the covalency of copper ion bonding with the surrounding oxygen atoms is appreciable. q 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphates are prepared either by solid state reaction or by the sol–gel route. They have been extensively studied with respect to their catalytic and low thermal expansion properties, as well as to the ionic conductivity of their derivatives [1–9]. The Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 solid variety belongs to Nasicon-type family with a threedimensional network built up of PO4 tetrahedra sharing corners with ZrO6 octahedra (Fig. 1(a)). Its structure shows a monoclinic distortion compared with that of NaZr2(PO4)3 [6] in which two sites, usually labeled M(1) and M(2), can be occupied by copper ions [3,6,7]. The M(1) site is a trigonally distorted octahedron, formed by the common faces of two neighboring ZrO6 octahedra perpendicular to the c-axis of the hexagonal cell. Thus the three-dimensional network can be considered as made up of

inﬁnite ribbons [O3ZrO3M(1)O3ZrO3M(1)O3ZrO3]1 linked by PO4 tetrahedra. The M(2) site with a coordination varying from eight to ten, is located in a large and distorted cavity between these layers. Nevertheless, the symmetry of the available sites should decrease, since Cu21 ion has a tendency to dictate its own environment in many oxide compounds [10]. The Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phase prepared by the sol–gel route has a three-dimensional framework that is probably close to the Sc2(WO4)3 structure [1]. It is built up of analogous distorted octahedra and tetrahedra with sharing corners. The connections of the Zr2(PO4)3 units differ from that of the Nasicon-type (Fig. 1(b)). Copper ions occupy the vacant cavities of the structure. With fouror ﬁve-fold coordination they are smaller and more or less distorted. The the Cu1/Cu21 skeleton displays a substantial redox reaction is then set up without any three-dimensional framework modiﬁcation, hence their use in heterogeneous catalysts [6].

The present work is aimed at studying the magnetic properties of paramagnetic copper ions, in solid and sol–gel

was removed by washing the reaction products with dilute and warm HNO3 for 5 min. The product was ﬁnally heated at 6008C for 15 h [6].

The sol–gel route utilized the starting compounds ZrOCl2·8H2O and CuO, separately dissolved in 2 N HNO3. The addition of a solution of NH4(H2PO4) with constant stirring gives rise to a gelatinous precipitate. The gel and the supporting solution were maintained for 24 h at 808C. The residue was afterwards heated in the range of 700 to 8008C for 48 h [6]. The compound obtained is called the gvariety.

EPR spectra of the ﬁrst derivative absorption lines were recorded on a Varian Spectrometer operating in the X-band frequency (n < 9.5 GHz). The magnetic ﬁeld was scanned between 250 and 360 mT. DPPH (g  136) 2.0036) with Mn21 ions in a solid solution of MgO were used as ﬁeld markers. EPR spectra were also obtained in the Q-band (n < 35 GHz) using a Bruker Spectrometer. The average magnetic ﬁeld was 1177 mT, the magnetic ﬁeld B and the microwave frequency n were measured directly.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements in the temperature range 4.2–900 K were performed using a Faraday-type balance.

65Cu isotopes are not resolved. Spectra recorded in the Q-band are more resolved; they reveal the presence of several lines. A careful examination of different inﬂection points of the spectra shows that these lines are presumably assigned to several superimposed signals; sample heating ‘‘in situ’’ at different temperatures, from room-temperature to 3008C, shows that the different lines do not vary in the same manner. This is conﬁrmed by the satisfactory computer simulation which takes into account two signals, hereafter called signal 1 and signal 2, related to two crystallographically non-equivalent Cu21 ions (computer simulations using only one site are not satisfactory and the possibility of a third signal is left out, as shown

by a temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiment [6]).

relative intensities of the two signals are given from the EPR computed spectra. The individual line-shape is Lorentzian for the s-variety and a combination of 80% Lorentzian and 20% Gaussian for the g-variety. Small shifts exist in g and A values (, 2%) between the X and Q bands for the sol–gel compound; these come partly from uncertainties in simulation parameters which are carried out independently and partly from the different calcination temperatures of samples used for the two experiments. Considering the complexity of the resulting spectra and some approximation in computations, the experimental discrepancies are small. The number of Cu21 is evaluated by measuring the EPR absorption after double integration of the ﬁrst derivative spectrum and comparing the ﬁndings with those for the reference sample from Varian ‘‘1% Pitch in KCl’’. The total copper is also calculated from the molecular weight. From EPR investigations the spin concentration is estimated to 6 £ 1020 ions g21 for the s-variety and to 5 £ 1020 ions g21 for the g-variety. The relative concentration of paramagnetic ions thus calculated is important; approximately 95% of the copper total is paramagnetic for the s-variety and 80% for the g-variety.

At low m  136) f 133)T 134) corresponds to a Curie law. temperature x21 Above 160 K the curve becomes progressively concave toward the T-axis. Such magnetic behavior results from a growing inﬂuence of the temperature-independent paramagnetism term [1,7]. The susceptibility can be expressed by the following equations: xm  136) 0:452 T xm  136) 0:425 T

to the value 0.495 which is found for the majority of the copper(II)–Nasicon-type compounds. The discrepancies observed in the materials investigated most probably result from the covalency effect. This latter effect should reduce the spin–orbit coupling constant with respect to the free ion value. Using the experimental Curie constant, the reduced value lr is found to be equal to 2570 cm21 for the s-variety which gives the reduction factor k  136) 0.83 (lr  136) k2l). The gvariety exhibits a more reduced value, such as 2320 . lr . 2380 cm21, corresponding to 0.62 , k , 0.68; this indicates that the Cu21 ion is more covalently bound in the case of the g-variety.

The g-tensor is characterized by the degree of orthorhom-

The g-factor components (Table 1) are such as gz . gy, gx . ge (ge  136) 2.0023 is that of free electron). These values are typical of Cu21 ion in a distorted octahedron [10,15,16]. This result is conﬁrmed by the presence of a 500–1400 nm optical spectrum band (Fig. 5). The factor R  136) (gy 2 gx)/ (gz 2 gy) is less than one, which supports an essentially dx2–y2 ground state [15,17]. The large anisotropy of the g-tensor can be explained by considering the paramagnetic ion to be surrounded by a highly distorted region, and suggests that the orbital contribution of the excited state udz2l to the ground state is considerable [15]. This admixture can lead to some reduction of Az values, and may result from octahedron distortions [18]. Ax and Ay values are higher than those reported for the majority of known Cu21 complexes. Nevertheless, analogous values have been observed for some highly covalent square-planar Cu21 complexes with organic ligands and for Cu21 compressed octahedra [18]. This latter symmetry corresponds to the relationship gx,y . gz ø ge; this is not the case for the investigated signals.

The thermal variation of the Cu21 ion susceptibility in an

axial symmetry is given by the usual relationships [19]: xi  136) 0:376 T x’  136) 0:376 T where l 136) 2 z828 cm21 is the spin–orbit coupling constant for the free copper ion. D1 and D2 are respectively the energies of the electronic transitions B1g 133)dx2–y2 134)–B2g 133)dxy 134) and B1g 133)dx2–y2 134)–Eg 133)dxz;yz 134). The average susceptibility is xm  136) (xi 1 2x’)/3, from where the Curie constants C are evaluated to 0.490 for the svariety and between 0.489 and 0.514 for the g-variety. The C values have been calculated with the energy level splittings D1  136) 11 300 cm21 and D2  136) 14 290 cm21 for the svariety [7]; in the case of the g-variety, the corresponding values of D1 and D2 are suspected to be respectively in the 12 000– energy 15 380 cm21 (5). The calculated values of C are slightly larger than the experimental ones (0.452 and 0.425 for s and g varieties respectively). Nevertheless, they are close

In the case of the s-variety, we can consider the occupation of both M(1) and M(2) sites available for copper ions in the Nasicon-type lattice. Indeed, the slightly higher value of the crystallographic parameter c, which is more sensitive to the M(1) site occupation, discards the hypothesis of the 2 133)PO4 134)3 with Cu21 location in only M(1) sites as in Cu0:5M 0  136) Ti and Sn [1]. In addition, the c parameter has a M relatively higher value for Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 than that for M0.5Zr2(PO4)3 set (M  136) Ca, Sr, Ba, Cd) where M21 ions occupy 50% of M(1) sites [1]. Taking this into account, one may expect that the M(2) sites are partially occupied in the case of Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 solid compound. The presence of copper ions in the second coordination shell, as determined by an EXAFS study [2], conﬁrms this result. The EPR signal 1, which is less asymmetrical and coherent with the less distorted Cu21 environment (Table 2), can be attributed to the M(1) site. The signal 2, which corresponds to large distortion of a copper octahedron (Table 2), is assigned presumably to the M(2) site. The Cu21 relative densities in both M(1) and M(2) sites are determined by the EPR absorption of signals 1 and 2 respectively. As a result, approximately 2/3 of the Cu21 ions are located in M(1) sites and 1/3 in M(2) sites.

For the g-variety, Cu21 ions are distributed on two types of cavity, which are relatively more distorted than the Nasicon copper sites (Table 2). They display a larger anisotropy in the plane perpendicular to the z-tetragonal axis than the svariety cavities. This local difference between the solid reaction and sol–gel varieties may be associated with a diversity of paramagnetic ion environments which has previously been shown by EXAFS [2]. Indeed Cu21 is surrounded by ions of different charges and sizes, not dispersed in the same manner. The large difference between the sand g-varieties resides essentially in the second shell of the copper ion coordination. This involves not only the stereochemistry related to the preparation mode (Fig. 1), but also the distribution of Cu21 between the two available sites.

The distribution rates determined in terms of EPR spectra in the two sites indicate that 60% of Cu21 ions are located in the ﬁrst site and 40% in the other. This is in agreement with the TPR experiment [6].

complexes; nevertheless, it does occur in other complexes in some oxidase copper enzymes [21]. For the compound investigated, this is presumably associated with catalytic behavior.

As one can see from Table 1, g and A tensors are orthorhombic; the precise point group symmetry of the sites is not well-known. For simplicity, we assume an orthorhombic symmetry, e.g. D2h. (The observed optical spectrum of the Cu21 ion in the present compounds suggests that the ﬁeld surrounding the ion should be orthorhombic (D2h) in nature rather than simple tetragonal (D4h) [20].) Under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld D2h the udx2–y2l ground orbital state is combined with the udz2l excited orbital state [17]: uGround statel  136) a1 133)udx2–y2l 2 tudz2l 134); where a2 1 is the probability of the electron being found in the metal d-orbitals, and t is the mixing ratio of the dz2 excited orbital to the dx2–y2 orbital linked to gx and gy by the following relationship [17]: p  133)1 2 t 134)2 2  133)1 1 p  133)7 134) 3  133)1 2 t 134)2 1  133)1 1 3 with Dgx,y  136) gx,y 2 ge. Using the relations quoted in Ref. [17], we have evaluated, in terms of EPR-parameters, the dorbital anisotropic dipole terms adi, the isotropic Fermi contact term K and the unpaired spin density in d-orbitals a2 1. Table 3 summarizes adx, ady, adz, a2 As g-factor the adi hyperﬁne terms also exhibit a relatively more marked anisotropy in the sol–gel host. In the case of the less distorted site (related to signal 1), the calculated values of the K Fermi contact terms are approximately unaffected by the preparation mode of these compounds; they are close to 0.32. This result agrees with other results on copper compounds [17]. In contrast, for the more distorted site (related to signal 2), K is different for the sand gvarieties. The K value related to the M(2) site of the Nasicon-type structure is relatively low. Analogous values have been found for some other copper compounds [17]. In the case of the g-variety, the K value is close to that of the free electron (K0  136) 0.43) and the covalency of Cu–O 1 < 0:5). Such a particular value bondings is appreciable (a2 the majority of Cu21 of a2 than for 1

From an EPR study the Cu0.5Zr2(PO4)3 phosphates present a signiﬁcant content of Cu21 paramagnetic ions, as expected from the formulation. EPR results obtained in the X and Q bands reveal that Cu21 ions are situated in two crystallographic distorted octahedra.

For the s-variety the Cu21 ions are distributed on the available M(1) and M(2) sites; 2/3 of these ions are located in the ﬁrst site and 1/3 in the second site. However, the gvariety displays relatively different X and Q band EPR spectra. In contrast with the Nasicon structure results, the EPR parameters deduced from computer simulations indicate that Cu21 ions occupy two types of cavity with relatively higher distortions, the Cu21 ions being distributed in ratios of about 60 to 40%. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal that spin–orbit coupling constants are reduced by the covalency effect with respect to the free ion value; this indicates that Cu21 ions are more covalently bound in the case of the gvariety.

The ground states have a predominant udx2–y2l character and exhibit a large covalent degree of copper ion bonding with the surrounding ligands. g and A anisotropies are concluded to be mainly the result of an admixture of udx2–y2l and udz2l orbitals.
