Sodium ion conducting solid electrolytes are important for a wide variety of applications ranging from energy storage to industrial process control. Improved energy storage devices are not only needed for mobile applications, such as portable electronics and electric vehicles, but also have become increasingly important for load leveling in the use of renewable energy conversion technologies, such as wind and solar. Concerns over the availability of mineral resources of lithium for lithium ion batteries have increased the level of interest in sodium-based batteries, which also have high energy densities. One promising battery is the sodium–sulfur cell, in which sodium (or sulfur) is contained in sodiumion-conducting ceramic tube and placed into sulfur (or sodium) [1,2]. Recent developments in improving speciﬁc energy storage have led to planar designs with chloride (rather than sulfur) cathodes in what is referred to as a ZEBRA cell [3–5]. The different designs have different requirements for the electrolyte both in terms of chemical stability, due to the different electrode materials, as well as processing, due to the different electrolyte geometries. High temperature batteries use ceramic electrolytes, but batteries using sodium conducting polymer electrolytes, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) [6] and poly(vinylidene diﬂuoride) PVdF [7,8] have also been developed. In another energy-related application, the ﬂow of sodium ions can be induced by a temperature gradient in the alkali metal thermal electric converter (AMTEC) [9,10] which allows for conversion of thermal energy to electrical energy. In the reverse mode, electrical current can be used to generate a ﬂow of sodium ions for the production of sodium by electrolysis [11] or to control the amount of sodium as an alloying addition in molten aluminum [12].

Solid electrolytes can also be used to transduce a chemical potential into a voltage in a chemical sensor. A sodium ion conducting electrolyte can be used most directly to measure sodium content, such as the concentration of Na+ in an aqueous solution [13] or the amount sodium dissolved in molten aluminum [14]. Fortunately, the use of sodium ion conducting electrolytes is not limited to the measurement of sodium. The addition of particular phases to the electrode establishes chemical equilibrium that relates the concentration of target species to the sodium ion activity (which generates the sensor voltage) so that sensors for the measurement of species other than sodium can be produced [15]. For example, sodium ion conducting electrolytes have been used in sensors for measuring the concentrations of gases, such as CO2 [16–18] and volatile organic compounds [19]. The use of a solid, rather than liquid, electrolyte is particularly advantageous in sensors, since solid-state devices are generally more durable and can be more easily miniaturized and integrated into systems as compared to devices containing liquids. Thus, implementation of sodium ion conducting electrolytes in solidstate sensors requires the fabrication of thick [20] or thin [21] ﬁlms.

The electrolyte material is critical in all these energy storage, energy conversion, process control and sensing applications. The primary function of the electrolyte is to transport ions, but low electronic conduction is also required. Electronic conduction through the electrolyte in a battery leads to a decrease in energy conversion efﬁciency, while in a sensor, electronic conduction leads to an erroneous sensor output. The electrolyte materials must be chemically stable over all operating conditions, which can be extreme in high voltage batteries. In most, but not all, designs the electrolyte material does not need to support a large mechanical load. However, stresses develop during operation due to thermal cycling or expansion/contraction of electrodes during charge/discharge, so mechanical properties are a consideration. In addition, cost and ease of fabrication are important in the production of cost effective systems.

This paper focuses on the ionic conductivity of sodium ion conducting electrolyte materials that enable the technologies described above. In particular, the conductivities of sodium ion conducting electrolytes are compiled to illustrate the range of reported results. Variation among results can be due to a range of factors, such as processing conditions, impurities and microstructure, which are not always described completely in literature reports. Summaries of the range of reported results are useful for comparing different materials and for judging how new results compare to results from the literature, as well as to identify results that are outside of reasonable variation and may not be valid.

One widely used sodium ion conducting solid electrolyte is Na1 + xZr2SixP3− xO12, which is commonly referred to as NASICON. The NASICON structure consists of corner-sharing PO4–SiO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra that create a 3-D network of channels through which sodium ions can be transported [22]. The most common NASICON composition is Na3Zr2Si2PO12, the conductivities of which are shown in Fig. 1 [23–34]. Most of the conductivities are in the range indicated by the bold line, which will be used to compare with the conductivities of other materials. The conductivities that are higher than the range at high temperatures are for a thin ﬁlm [33]. These higher conductivities may be associated with difﬁculties associated with measurements on thin ﬁlm samples due to, for example, the enhanced inﬂuence of interfacial effects. The conductivities in another report [34] are about an order of magnitude lower than the ranges shown in Fig. 1, but the reason for this difference is not clear.

Conductivity can be affected by the composition of the surrounding atmosphere. The gas compositions used during the conductivity measurements are shown in Fig. 1 for those papers in which it was reported. In cases where it was not reported the atmosphere was most likely air. There does not appear to be a systematic difference between the conductivities in air and nitrogen. In one case [30] the conductivity was measured using molten sodium as the electrodes, which would establish a very low oxygen partial pressure, and was similar to the conductivities measured in air or nitrogen. The oxygen partial pressure independence of ionic conductivity of an oxide is expected for a pure ionic conductivity and thus indicates that the electronic conductivity is low.

The sodium content in NASICON can be varied and, as shown in Fig. 2 [23,26,32,35–37], affects the conductivity. The conductivities of compositions containing less sodium, e.g. Na2.8Zr2−xSi1.8−4xP1.2+4xO12 [35], are lower than those of Na3Zr2Si2PO12, while the conductivities of compositions with higher sodium content (e.g. 3.2 Na) [26,36] are the upper range of the conductivities of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 (even higher at low temperatures). The conductivities for the thick ﬁlm sample with high sodium content are low [37], but this may be due to effects associated in the sample preparation or conductivity measurement of the ﬁlm. Other reports on the effects of sodium content have indicated that the maximum conductivity occurs for 3.0 Na (i.e. x=1 in Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12) [38,39]. The increase in sodium content leads to an increase in lattice parameter, which has been proposed to decrease the barrier to sodium migration and thus increase conductivity [40]. The results in Fig. 2 also show that reducing the zirconium content tends to lead to a decrease in conductivity. These results illustrate that the control of the stoichiometry is important in obtaining the optimal conductivity.

The most common NASICON structure contains two SiO4 tetrahedron for every PO4 tetrahedron, but this ratio can be varied. Fig. 3 [29,35,41–45] shows that the conductivities of NASICON materials with no silicon, i.e. PO4 tetrahedra only, are lower than those shown in Fig. 1. NASICON materials containing only SiO4 tetrahedra have also been reported, having a lower conductivity than those containing both phosphorous and silicon [46].

NASICON materials have also been modiﬁed by doping on the octahedral site. For example, replacing zirconium with titanium has been shown to improve the room temperature conductivity of NASICON with high sodium content [47]. However, another report showed that the conductivity at 300 °C for NASICON with a range of sodium contents decreased with titanium doping [48]. The conductivities of some other titanium containing NASICON composition are shown in Fig. 4 [27,49–56]. The conductivity of Na3Zr1.6Ti0.4Si2PO12 [27] is in the same range as the conductivities of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 from Fig. 1. However, replacement of zirconium with hafnium, i.e. Na3Hf2Si2PO12 [27], leads to a slightly higher conductivity. Also shown in Fig. 4 are results for titanium-based NASICON compounds with no silicon, all of which have conductivities lower than those of Na3Zr2Si2PO12.

Rare-earth element additions have been shown to increase the conductivity of NASICON [57], some examples of which are shown

in Fig. 5 [31,41,42,58–65]. Yttria, either added directly as a dopant or indirectly using additions of tetragonal polycrystalline zirconia (TZP) which contains 3% Y2O3, is effective in increasing the conductivity of NASICON. The other rare earth additions shown in Fig. 5, ytterbium and neodymium, however, do not appear to increase the conductivity. The effect of additions can also be related to improvements in material processing. For example, replacing a small amount of phosphorous with aluminum has been shown to increase the conductivity due, at least in part, to improvements in the sintering behavior, which decreases the amount of porosity [66]. A number of other elements, such as indium [41,42,67], scandium [42,68], germanium [69], magnesium [70,71],

gallium [72] and ﬂuorine [73], have been added to NASICON, but the resulting conductivities are lower than those of Na3Zr2Si2PO12.

Another widely used sodium ion conducting electrolyte is beta alumina. β-alumina with the formula Na2O·11Al2O3 is a layered structure that consists of dense blocks of aluminum oxide, which are separated by a less densely packed layer of sodium oxide [74] as shown in Fig. 6a, which is a schematic view of the oxygen ions perpendicular to the c-axis. The alumina layer forms the spinel structure (labeled as “spinel

block”) which is a close-packed arrangement of oxygen ions with aluminum occupying some of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites. The less-dense-packed layers of sodium oxide between these spinel block are referred to as the conduction planes and are indicated by the broken line in Fig. 6a. β-alumina forms a hexagonal structure with the c-axis normal to the conduction plane. Doping of the oxide with magnesium or lithium can alter the stacking sequence and lead to a rhombohedral structure, referred to as β″-alumina, which is shown in Fig. 6b. The altered stacking creates a conduction plane (labeled as “conduction slab”) in which the sodium ions are more mobile than in β-alumina.

Doping can also increase the concentration of sodium ions in the conduction plane, so β″ has a higher conductivity and is generally the desired phase.

Although identiﬁcation of the exact locations of sodium ions is difﬁcult [75], the conduction is generally attributed to an interstitialcy mechanism in which sodium ions move between lattice and interstitial sites in the conduction plane [76,77]. Fig. 6c shows the conduction plane as viewed along the c-axis. The oxygen ions in the spinel block are represented by the open circles and the oxygen ions in the conduction plane are represented by gray-ﬁlled circles. The most stable

location for sodium ions is represented by the open square and is referred to as the Beevers–Ross site. For conduction to occur, however, the sodium ions must move through other locations. The most important other sites are the anti-Beevers–Ross (ﬁlled diamond) and mid-oxygen sites (small ﬁlled circle). Molecular dynamics calculations support the interstitialcy mechanism [78] and also indicate that vacancies may order at low temperatures [79], which leads to a non-linear relationship in an Arrhenius plot.

The apparent change in activation energy with temperature is illustrated in Fig. 7 [80–88], which shows the conductivities of magnesium-stabilized β″ alumina single crystals. In contrast, the conductivities of β-alumina single crystals, shown in Fig. 8 [76,83,85,87,89–91], appear to follow an Arrhenius relationship with a single activation energy, which suggests that the ordering of vacancies may be less prevalent in β-alumina as compared to that in β″-alumina. Comparison of Figs. 8 and 9 also shows that the conductivity of β″-alumina is typically higher than that of β-alumina.

Single crystals are good for understanding fundamental material properties, but are difﬁcult to synthesize and not practical for most applications, so polycrystalline materials are more commonly used. In some materials, grain boundaries can provide paths for rapid mass transport (relative to the bulk grain), but this is not the case for β-alumina. Because the transport of sodium ions along the conduction plane in β-alumina is so fast, the grain boundaries act as a barrier to ion transport. This is illustrated by the conductivities of polycrystalline β″-alumina shown in Fig. 9 [24,92,93]. Speciﬁcally, the conductivity of a coarse-grained material is higher than that of a ﬁne-grained material, which indicates that the additional grain boundaries in the ﬁne-grained material impede ion transport [92]. The other results shown in Fig. 9 are from impedance spectroscopy measurements in which the bulk grain and grain boundary contributions to the resistance could be separated. In both cases the grain boundary resistance is higher than the bulk grain resistance, so the total conductivity is lower than the bulk grain conductivity [24,93]. A similar trend is observed for β-alumina in Fig. 10 [89,94]. In these reports impedance spectroscopy was used to determine the bulk grain conductivity, which was reported separately from either the grain boundary [94] or total [89] conductivity for materials with two different grain sizes. In both cases the bulk grain conductivity was independent of microstructure, while the grain boundary or total conductivity depended on microstructure and was lower than the bulk grain conductivity.

In addition to grain size other factors such as porosity and crystallographic orientation affect the conductivity, so material processing is important for improving the material performance [95]. For example, the application of a magnetic ﬁeld has been shown to control crystallographic orientation of the grains, which provides a means of optimizing the material for the particular design [96]. Processing of β-alumina is further complicated since a loss of sodium can occur during the long times and high temperatures used to obtain dense materials. In response to this challenge, processing techniques such as microwave sintering [97,98] or radio frequency (rf) induction heating [99] have been used to reduce the processing times. These multiple factors lead to more variability in the conductivities for polycrystalline than for single crystals. In addition, the presence of grain boundaries also leads to a lower conductivity for polycrystalline materials as shown by the results in Fig. 11 [80,100–111]. Hydronium ions (H3O+) can be accommodated in both β-alumina and NASICON, which allows for their use as proton conductors. However, the interaction with water has been shown to lead to degradation in both β-alumina [112] and NASICON [113], which can be an important factor in some applications, so electrolytes with improved stability are needed.

The conductivities of a few alternatives to β-alumina and NASICON are shown in Fig. 12 [114–121]. One example is the telluride compound, Na2M2TeO6, where M is Ni, Co, Zn or Mg [114]. The composition with the highest conductivity is Na2Ni2TeO6, which, as shown in Fig. 12, has a conductivity that is similar to the conductivities of β-alumina and NASICON at temperatures of around 300 °C. The inclusion as a transition metal may be of concern, since valence changes of the nickel ion could lead to electronic conduction by a small polaron mechanism, particularly at high temperatures. The conductivities of some other materials, Na1.2Ag0.8PbP2O7 [115] and NaCa2Nb3O10 [116], however, are lower. The addition of γ-Al2O3 to NaNO3 increases the conductivity [117], but Fig. 12 shows that the conductivity of the composite is still lower than those of β-alumina and NASICON. The conductivities of two sodium ion conducting glasses, a sodium silicate glass with a rare-earth dopant Na0.23Y0.05Si0.18O0.55 [118] and a sodiumphosphorous sulﬁde Na0.17P0.21S0.62 [119] are shown in Fig. 12. The sulﬁde and oxide glasses have relatively low conductivities, but the conductivity of the glass-ceramic, Na2O–Na5.9Sm0.6Al0.1P0.3Si3.6O9 [120], is similar to the conductivities of β-alumina and NASICON. The higher conductivity of crystalline phases is consistent with the high grain boundary resistance of grain boundaries observed in β-alumina. Similarly, the conductivity of amorphous NASIGLAS has been shown

Fig. 7. Conductivities of Mg-stabilized β″ alumina single crystals [80–88].

to be lower than crystalline NASICON with the same composition [122]. Also shown in Fig. 12 for comparison is the range of conductivities for lithium ion conducting lithium phosphate (i.e. LISICON), which is higher than that of NASICON [121].

Polymer electrolytes offer advantages relative to ceramic electrolytes in terms of mechanical ﬂexibility in low temperature applications and sodium ion conducting polymer electrolytes have been reported. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is effective in solvating a variety of salts and is widely used as a solid electrolyte. PEO has been used with sodium salts including NaClO3 or NaClO4 and the conductivities of some examples of this are shown in Fig. 13 [123–125]. The decrease in the apparent

activation energy at high temperatures is associated with heating above the glass transition temperature of the polymer. The addition of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a plasticizer leads to an increase in the conductivity as indicated by the ﬁlled data points in Fig. 13. Fig. 14 [126–134] shows that other sodium salts including NaI (labeled “I”) [126], NaCF3COO (labeled “TFAc”) [127] and NaF (labeled “F”) [128] have been used in PEO electrolytes. One difference between polymer electrolytes and the ceramic electrolytes discussed above is that an amorphous, rather than crystalline, structure is desired for high conductivity in polymer electrolytes. PEO has been blended with poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) to promote formation of the amorphous phase as well as salt complex formation. However, the conductivities of the PEO–PVP with NaF (labeled “F”) [129] and PVP alone with NaClO3 (labeled “Cl–O”) [130] are relatively low as

Fig. 9. Conductivities of polycrystalline β″-alumina [24,92,93].

compared to those of PEO. Similarly, the conductivities of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) blended with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) [131] or poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) [132] and NaClO4 (labeled “Cl–O”) as the salt is low relative to the conductivity range of PEO. However, the conductivities of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PAA) with NaI (labeled “I”) [133] or NaBr (labeled “Br”) [134] as the salt are similar to those of PEO.

Another approach is to use a gel electrolyte in which a liquid organic electrolyte is incorporated into a polymer matrix. The conductivities of some sodium ion conducting polymer gel electrolytes, PAA–PEG [135], PMMA [136] and poly(vinylidene ﬂuoride-co-hexaﬂuoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) [137] are shown in Fig. 15 [121,135–137]. The conductivities of gel electrolytes are higher than those of PEO, but the mechanical strengths of gels are lower. The results in Fig. 15 show that the addition

of silica to PVdF-HFP, which can increase the mechanical strength, increases the conductivity. Inorganic particles can also decrease crystallization and improve the ionic transport number, so polymer composites have been developed in other electrolytes, such as PEG [138].

As noted above, concern over potential limits in the supply of lithium has increased interest in sodium based batteries as replacements for lithium ion batteries. Fig. 15 shows that the conductivities of sodium ion conducting gel electrolytes are similar to those of lithium ion conducting gel electrolytes [121]. Similarly, Fig. 15 shows that the conductivities of sodiumand lithium-ion conducting PEO electrolytes are in the same range. Thus, electrolyte availability will likely not be the limiting factor in the replacement of lithium with sodium in polymer electrolyte based batteries.

The conductivities of ceramic and polymer sodium ion conducting electrolytes are summarized in Fig. 16. The highest conductivities are for single crystal beta alumina materials, since the sodium moves more easily through the grain than through grain boundaries in polycrystalline beta alumina. The conductivities of polycrystalline beta alumina are similar to those of NASICON. However, the variation in the conductivities of polycrystalline beta alumina is higher than that for NASICON, which is likely due to the inﬂuence of grain boundaries (composition and amount) in limiting the transport of ions in polycrystalline beta alumina. Polymer gel electrolytes have conductivities that are similar, or slightly higher than these ceramic electrolytes,

while the conductivity of the most commonly used polymer electrolyte, PEO, are lower than those of the ceramic electrolytes.
