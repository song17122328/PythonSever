A SO, sensor based on Na-I3-A120~ interfaced with an auxiliary electrode of Na2SO 4 formed in-situ and a solid mixture of Fe304, Fe2Os, 3Na20"5FezO3 as the reference electrode was developed. The sensor displayed a good response to changes in the partial pressure of SOt with a linear relationship between the measured emf and the logarithmic values of the partial pressure of SO2, as predicted by the Nernstian equation. Using an electron probe X-ray microanalyser, the formation of a Na2SO 4 reaction layer was confirmed on the surface of Na-~-A1203 tube due to surface reaction with the SO2 gas.
The emf values of these cells were essentially consistent with those theoretically calculated using the Nernst equation within a certain range of SO2 partial pressure. In order to further decrease the response time, Eastman et al. [6] have developed film SO, sensors based on the above electrolyte by both thin film and thick film technologies. Reliable and reproducible results were achieved. Recently a thin film SO2 sensor has been developed by using a mixed sulphate of Na2SO 4 + BaSO 4 + Ag2SO 4 film as the electrolyte with metal Ag as the reference [7]. Both electrodes of the sensor were exposed to the same atmosphere during operation. A response time of 300 seconds was observed, but the sensor could be operated only at below 800 K due to the low melting point of the sulphate mixture. 
However, sulphates suffer from poor sinterability, phase transitions with large volume changes, which can cause cracks and pores in the electrolyte during preparation or operation. In order to avoid these problems, more practical devices have been developed by using Na ยง ion conductors such as NasZrzSizPOiz (Nasicon) and Na-[3-A12Os [8-9], Ag + ion conductor [10], magnesium and calcium ion conductors [11,12], oxygen ion conductors [13,14] or bi-electrolyte systems [15,16].
Recently sodium ferrites ,are recognized as good sodium reference materials and have been successfully applied in sodium sensors [24] and H,S gas sensors [25] and their thermodynamic data have been detemfined by electrochemical method [26]. The activity of sodium oxide can be established by a mixture of sodium ferrite + ferric oxide. Since sodium ferrite is a mixed ionic mad electronic conductor, rapid equilibration can be reached at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte [27]. The response is expected to be more rapid than those using reference with pure ionic conducting material such as Na-[3-A1203 in conjuction with a metal conducting phase.
The SO 2 sensors were tested under controlled conditions at varying SO2 concentrations and temperatures. Measurements were carried out in a conventional gas-flow apparatus equipped with a heating furnace. Premixed sample gases were prepared by diluting a parent gas (5000 ppm SO2 in air/N2), with synthetic air in a gas blender, at a controlled flowrate, typically 100 cm3/min. The SO2 concentration in gas mixture was varied from 0.6 ppm to 1000 ppm, while the temperature was varied from 873 to 1073 K. The electromotive force (emf) signals from the sensors were measured with a Keithely digital electrometer of high impedance (>1014 ~) and transferred to a PC-based data collecting system.
Using eq. (15) it is possible to calculate the theoretical emf of the SO2 sensor as a function of SO~ concentration at a fixed temperature. The calculated results are compared with experimental data at two selected temperatures in Fig. 9, which shows that the calculated emf is higher than the measured values by about 240 mV and 310 mV at 988 K and 1054 K, However, it should be noted that the slopes of the calculated emf agrees well with the experimental slopes. A systematic shift downwards in the experimental values vis-a-vis the calculated values suggests that some of the assumption in the calculation have to be re-evaluated in future work. For example, the aNa2O in Na-I3-AlzO 3 is taken from the literature for composition corresponding to the normal Na20"llAI203 (eq. (3)) which implies Na-~-A1203 is in equilibrium with t~-A1203. In reality the variation in the aNa_~O as composition of Na-I]-A1203 is changed can be over several orders of magnitude [34]. 
Therefore at the sodium-rich composition of Na20"5.5A1203 the activity of Na20 can be much higher than the normal values used in the estimated calculations. And furthermore, the in-situ reaction between Na-~-AI203 and SO2 (and 02) (reaction (2)) will result in the depletion of Na20 from the surface of NaI~-AI20 s leading to a decrease in aN,2o. It should be noted that the sensor is primarily sensitive to SO 3 (g), which in turn is an in-situ product on the Pt catalyst by the reaction between SO2 and O, according to eq. (4), which may not necessarily have achieved equilibrium. The reference electrode aN~ is calculated assuming equilibrium between all the solid-state components namely 3Na20"5Fe203, Fe30~ and F%Os. Furthermore the aN,2o (RE) is taken from the literature, so any error in these values will affect the calculated values. Despite this discrepancy, which will be evaluated in future work, the SO2 sensors have produced reproducible results.
In this work, a new SO 2 sensor based on Na-~3-A1203 with Na2SO~ auxiliary electrode fonned in-situ and a sealed Fe304 + Fe203 + 3Na20'5F%O3 solid reference electrode was fabricated and tested. The experimental results have shown that the sensor exhibits rapid and reproducible response to SO2. The measured emf of the sensor was found to be a linear function of the logarithm of the partial pressure of SO: over a wide concentration and temperature range, Discrepancy between calculated and experimental values requires clarification in future work by assessing the various assumptions made in the calculation.
