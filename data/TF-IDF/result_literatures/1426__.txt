The 950°C isothermal section of the InPO4–Na3PO4–Li3PO4 ternary system was studied and con 2) structed; one 2), two, and three 2)phase fields are outlined. Five solid 2)solution regions exist in the system: solid solutions based on the complex phosphate LiNa5(PO4)2 (olympite structure), the indium ion stabilized high 2) temperature Na3PO4 phase (Na3(1 – x)Inx(PO4); space group Fm m), the complex phosphate Na3In2(PO4)3, and the α and β phases of the compound Li3In2(PO4)3. A narrow region of melt was found in the vicinity of eutectic equilibria. All the phases detected in the system are derivatives of phases existing in the binary sub 2) systems. Isovalent substitution of lithium for sodium in Na3In2(PO4)3 leads to a significant increase in the region of a NASICON 2)like solid solution.

Since recently, the search has been actively made for  new  ferroelectric,  piezoelectric,  laser,  lumines 2) cent, and other materials that can be used in quantum electronics and fiber optics, and also as sorbents and catalysts. In this context, of great interest are complex phosphates  of  mono 2),  di 2),  and  tervalent  cations,  in   (MI  = particular,  Li, Na; MIII = In, Sc, Fe, Cr, Yb) [1], which are notable for their high cation mobility at both relatively low and high temperatures and have high hydrolytic and ther 2) mal stability [2, 3]. Currently, phase formation in ter 2) nary systems is being intensely studied for finding new promising  phases  for  electronics  and  microsystem technology [4, 5].

In this work, we investigated the 950°С subsolidus section of the InPO4–Na3PO4–Li3PO4 ternary system and  characterized  isolated  phases.  The  binary  sub 2) systems the ternary system were studied previously. In the  Li3PO4–Na3PO4  system,  there  are  two  complex phosphates:  LiNa5(PO4)2,  which  has  a  homogeneity region, and Li2NaPO4 [6]. In the InPO4–Li3PO4 sys 2) tem, there is complex phosphate Li3In(PO4)2 and com 2) pound  Li3In2(PO4)3  with  a  wide  homogeneity  range [7]. In the Na3PO4– InPO4 system, there are complex phosphates Na3In(PO4)2 and Na3In2(PO4)3 with a nar 2) row homogeneity region, and a region of solid solution based  on  the  high 2)temperature  sodium  phosphate phase (space group Fm m) [7].

The  initial  substances  were  sodium,  lithium,  and indium phosphates. Sodium phosphate was prepared from  pure  for  analysis  grade  sodium  phosphate dodecahydrate  Na3PO4  ·  12H2O  by  drying  at  75  to 180°С followed by annealing at 500°С for 6 h. Chemi 2) cally  pure  lithium  phosphate  (γ 2)phase)  was  used  as received.  Indium  phosphate  was  produced  by  solid 2) state  synthesis  from  indium  oxide  and  monosubsti 2) tuted  ammonium  phosphate.  The  synthesis  was  per 2) formed  in  platinum  crucibles  at  1000°С  for  100  h. Then,  recrystallization  in  an  autoclave  gave  high 2) quality microcrystals.

The phase formation in the system was studied by X 2)ray  powder  diffraction  on  DRON 2)3M  (Co  radia 2) tion) and Shimadzu XRD 2)600 (Cu radiation) diffrac 2) tometers.  The  lattice  parameters  were  calculated  by least 2)squares software. The melting region was investi 2) gated by differential thermal analysis with a Q 2)1500 D derivatograph.

The  complex  phosphates  used  in  this  work  were prepared by a ceramic method by mixing stoichiomet 2) ric amounts of simple phosphates, which, after being triturated  with  ethanol,  were  annealed  in  corundum crucibles at 950°С for 100–200 h and then quenched in liquid nitrogen.

The  ternary  system  was  studied  by  the  sections method.  A  total  of  seven  sections  were  examined: InPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2,  Li3In2(PO4)3–Na3In2(PO4)3, Li3In(PO4)2–Li2NaPO4, Li3In(PO4)2–Na3In2(PO4)3,  and InPO4–Li2NaPO4,  Li3PO4–Na3In2(PO4)3,  Li3In2(PO4)3–LiNa5(PO4)2 (Fig. 1).

The  InPO4–LiNa5(PO4)2  section  was  found  to  be the most informative of all the sections. This section intersects three homogeneity regions in the composi 2) tion triangle. The first of them is a narrow (to 3 mol % InPO4) region of a solid solution based on the compound LiNa5(PO4)2  with  olympite  structure.  The  second  is  a wide  homogeneity  region  within  17.65–25.00  mol  % InPO4 for a solid solution based on the high 2)tempera 2) ture  cubic  Na3PO4  phase  stabilized  by  indium  ions (space group Fm m). The third extends from 53.8 to 66–67 mol % InPO4 and represents a NASICON 2)like solid  solution  based  on  the  complex  phosphate Na3In2(PO4)3.  These  homogeneity  regions  are  sepa 2) rated by two 2)phase fields. Figure 2 presents X 2)ray dif 2) fraction patterns for the major phases identified in this section.

The  study  of  the  α 3)Li3In2(PO4)3–α 3)Na3In2(PO4)3 section detected two solid solution regions: one based on  Na3In2(PO4)3  (space  group  R c)  and  the  other based on the low 2)temperature β phase of Li3In2(PO4)3 (Fig. 3).

Interestingly, the low 2)temperature β phase exists in this section due to its stabilization by sodium ions. We indexed  the  β  phase  of  Li3In2(PO4)3  using  published data (table). Figure 4 shows the X 2)ray powder diffrac 2) tion patterns of the major phases in the section.

The investigation of the  Li3PO4–Na3In2(PO4)3 sec 2) tion revealed a wide (to 70 mol % Li3PO4) homogene 2) ity region for a NASICON 2)like solid solution based on the  complex  phosphate  Na3In2(PO4)3.  The  unit  cell parameters  of  the  Na3In2(PO4)3 2)based  solid  solution were  calculated  by  least  squares.  Figure  5  illustrates the  dependence  of  the  unit  cell  parameters  on  the Li3PO4 concentration.

An  insignificant  region  of  melt  was  found  within 75–85 mol % Li3PO4. To confirm the results, we stud 2) ied a polythermal section of a portion of the Li3PO4– Na3In2(PO4)3 section in the melt region (Fig. 6).

The results of investigating the other sections con 2) firmed the existence of a wide homogeneity region for a NASICON 2)like solid solution based on the complex phosphate Na3In2(PO4)3 and allowed us to delimit two 2) and three 2)phase fields in the composition triangle.

The above data were used to construct a phase dia 2) gram of the system (Fig. 7). We showed that no new compounds are formed in the system. All the detected phases are derivatives of phases existing in the Li3PO4– InPO4, InPO4–Na3PO4, and Li3PO4–Na3PO4 systems. Lithium  introduction  into  the  NASICON 2)like  solid solution significantly increases the extent of the region of this solid solution, which is of practical importance. In  summary,  by  studying  the  InPO4–Na3PO4– Li3PO4 ternary system, we detected the NASICON 2)like complex  phosphates  α 3)Li3In2(PO4)3,  β 3)Li3In2(PO4)3, and α 3)Na3In2(PO4)3 with corresponding homogeneity regions. The structure of NASICON 2)like compounds is known to be a rigid framework with channels which ensure high ionic conductivity of these compounds.
