Crystal  structure  evolution  and  temperature-dependent  phase  transition  of  the  solid  solutions  are  much  desired  for  understanding  of  the  functional  properties  optimization.
Herein,  the  NASICON-type  NaZr2(PO4)3-SrZr4(PO4)6  solid  solutions with the formula Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 (0 ≤  x ≤ 1),  where represents the vacancy, were prepared by the sol-gel  method,  and  their  crystal  structures,  phase  transition  and  thermal  expansion  properties  were  investigated  in  detail.
In  the range of x = 0.3-0.35, there is a reversible structural phase  transition and the different structural models of ܴ3ത  phase and ܴ phase were built to better understand the phase  transition  mechanism.
The  results  indicated  that  Na0.5Sr0.75[  ]0.75Zr4(PO4)6  showed  near  zero  thermal  expansion  in  the  temperature  range  of  450-600  K, which can find potential applications.
Introduction Remarkable  progresses  in  different  fields  of  science  and  technology are boosting the discovery of new solid state materials  with  the  optimized  functional  properties1-3.  And  investigations  based  on  the  crystal  structure  and  temperature-dependent  phase  transition of new solid solutions are very important for the studies  on the physical properties, such as photoluminescence propeties48,  electrical  properties9-13  and  thermal  expansion14-19,  especially  for  inorganic  solid  state  compounds  with  the  open-framework  structure.
The NASICON structure is among those and consists of  a  rigid  three-dimensional  framework  of  (PO4)/(SiO4)  tetrahedra  sharing  common  corners  with  MO6  octahedra  and  containing  interstitial  ions,  including  alkali  and  alkaline  earth  metal  ions,  located in a three-dimensionally  linked interstitial space20. As to  the  NASICON  structures,  the  fast  Li-ion  conductor  lithium  zirconium phosphate LiZr2(PO4)3 have been studied for the fastionic conductivity.
For example, Al doped LiZr2(PO4)3 have been  reported for the stability of high conducting rhombohedral phase,  decrease in the intensity of impurity phase and increase in the Liion concentration with Al doping, which finally results in a high  total  Li-ion  conductivity21;  Sodium  scandium  phosphate for reported Na3Sc2(PO4)3  have  been  the  pronounced  luminescence  property.
For  example,  Im’s  group  reported  Na3– 2xSc2(PO4)3:xEu2+  phosphor  that  showed  the  blue  emission  and  did  not  exhibit  thermal  quenching  even  up  to  200  oC22;  The  NaZr2(PO4)3 family compounds have been studied to evaluate the  thermal  expansion  and,  for  example,  it  was  reported  that  Pb2/3FeZr(PO4)7/3(SO4)2/3  possessed  low  thermal  expansion  with  the average linear coefficient of thermal expansion αav = 1.7 × 10– 6 oC–1 in the temperature range from -120 to 200 oC23. state solid Among the  NASICON-type compounds,  NaZr2(PO4)3  and  SrZr4(PO4)6,  which  both  belong  the  NaZr2(PO4)3 (NZP) family, crystallize in rhombohedral structures  but  with  space  groups  ܴ3തܿ  and  ܴ3ത ,  respectively.
NZP  family  ceramics  have  been  drawn  considerable  attention  due  to  their  interesting  properties,  including anisotropic  thermal  expansion2426, high ionic conductivity27-28, and being host for immobilization  of nuclear waste29-30. From a previous report, the interstitial ions  in the structure play an important role in the thermal expansion of  NZP family ceramics: larger ionic radii or fewer interstitial ions  result in lower thermal expansion and some solid solutions in the  NZP  family  are  expected  to  be  candidates  for  structural  materials31.  However,  though  several  groups  have  investigated  the  thermal  properties  and  crystallographic  structures  of  a  wide  variety  of  NZP  family  ceramics  from  room  temperature  (RT)  to  1000  oC32-35,  seldom  study  has  been  focused  on  structural phase  transformations  of  the  NZP  family  solid  solutions  which  is  closely related to negative thermal expansions36. In this investigation, we designed and synthesized the nominal  Na(2-2x)Srx[  ]xZr4(PO4)6   (x  =  0,  0.25,  0.3,  0.35,  0.5,  0.75,  and  1)  solid  solutions,  where  [  ]  represents  the  vacancy,  by  the  sol-gel  method  and  the  samples  were  mainly  characterized  by  in  situ  variable  temperature  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (VT-XRD).
The  structure,  phase  transition  and  thermal  expansion  were  explored  in  detail.
In  the  present  work,  the  phase  transition  boundary  between  ܴ3തܿ  and ܴ3ത  structures  in  the  NaZr2(PO4)3-SrZr4(PO4)6  solid solutions is identified for intermediate x, which can help to  further  explore  controlled  physical  properties  in  the  NASICONtype compounds family.
View Ars  the  starting  model  for  Rietveld  refinement  of  the  patterns  recorded  for  x  =  0,  0.25  and  0.3, while the crystal structure of SrZr4(PO4)6 (ܴ3ത) was taken for  refinement of the patterns  obtained for x = 0.35, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.  However, some difficulties arose with the structural models of  x  = 0.35, 0.5, 0.75. In the SrZr4(PO4)6 structure, there is only one Sr  site which  can be occupied by Sr/Na, but, in this case, chemical  formula  can  be  written  as  Na(1-x)SrxZr4(PO4)6  which  dissatisfies  the  charge  balancing  and  is  inconsistent  with  the  composition  Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 due to lack of Na ions.
Hence, the crystal  structure of ܴ3ത phase should have an additional site occupied by  (1-x)  Na  ions.
The  morphology  of  the  selected  sample  NaSr0.5[  ]0.5Zr4(PO4)6 was observed by SEM analysis (Figure  2a), which  has  relatively  uniform  crystalline  particles.
Also,  the  EDS  elemental  mapping  technique  was  used  to  test  the  composition  uniformity  in  Na(2-2x)Srx[  ]xZr4(PO4)6  (x  =  0.5),  as  shown  in  Figure  2b-f.
It  is  evident  that  Na,  O,  P,  Sr  and  Zr  are  homogeneously distributed over the as-obtained particles.
Briefly,  NaNO3,  Sr(NO3)2,  and  ZrOCl2·8H2O  were  dissolved  in  distilled  water,  and,  then,  the  aqueous  solution  NH4H2PO4  was  slowly  added  to  the  first  solution  with  continuous  stirring.
At  room temperature, the resultant mixture was in the viscous slurry  form which was heated at 80 °C for 1 h for gelation.
The resulting  gel was dried at 150 oC for 4 h, ground, calcined at 700 oC for 6  h, and then finally sintered at 1100 °C for 5 h in a tube furnace.
After  furnace  cooling  to  room  temperature,  the  samples  were  ground into fine powders for subsequent characterization.
Characterization The  samples  of  Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6  with  different  compositions  were  characterized  by  D8  Advance  X-ray  diffractometer (XRD, Bruker Corporation, Germany) operating at  40  kV  and  40  mA  with  monochromatized  CuKα  radiation  (λ  =  1.5406 Å).
The scanning rate (2θ range of 10° to 60°) for phase  identification  was  fixed  at  8°  min-1  and  the  step  size  of  2θ  was  0.013°  and  the  counting  time  was  5  s  per  step  for  Rietveld  analysis.
Crystal structure solving and Rietveld refinements were  performed  by  using  TOPAS  4.2  software40.  The  energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and mapping measurements  of  the  selected  sample  NaSr0.5[  ]0.5Zr4(PO4)6  were  determined  at  room temperature by scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL  JSM-6510).
Additional  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  were  measured for Na0.5Sr0.75[ ]0.75Zr4(PO4)6 and NaSr0.5[ ]0.5Zr4(PO4)6  powder  samples  under  heating  in  the  range  of  298-1073  K  in  order  to  obtain  cell  parameters  dependence  on  temperature  and  find  the  phase  transition  temperature  and  thermal  expansion  properties.
The  in  situ  variable  temperature  powder  X-ray  diffraction  (VT-XRD)  data  were  collected  on  X’Pert  MRD  diffractometer  with  a  high-temperature  reactor  chamber  (AntonPaar XRK 900) attached.

Furthermore,  the  XRD  patterns  were  analyzed  by  the  Rietveld refinement with difference Rietveld plots (supplemental  Figures  S1),  and  the  refined  crystallographic  information  files  were provided in the Supporting Information.
All refinements are  stable  and  give  low  R-factors  (Table  1,  Figure  S2).
The  coordinates  of  atoms  and  main  bond  lengths  are  given  in  Table  1S  and  Table  2S,  respectively.
The  main  parameters  of  processing  and  refinement  results  are  presented  in  Table  1,  and  the  crystallographic  information files  (CIF)  of  these  samples  are  given  in  the  electronic  supplementary  information.
The  results  indicate  that  compounds  x  =  0  and  x  =  1  are  well  indexed  by  rhombohedral  unit  cells  with  parameters  close  to  these  of Figure  1.  a.

Gr  Cell parameters To  further  elucidate  the  crystal  structure  and  composition  dependent  phase  transition,  the  Fourier  difference  map  Fobs-Fcalc  which  represents  a  difference  electron  density  for  Rietveld  refinement  of  structure  x  =  0.75  (Figure  3)  was  depicted.
The  map  indicates  a  noticeable  maximum  at  (0,  0,  1/2)  and  other  symmetry-related sites.
Therefore,  to provide linear evolution from Na(1-x)SrxZr4(PO4)6 (x = 0.35) to  SrZr4(PO4)6 (x = 1), it was decided to refine only (1-x) Na in this  site for all compounds x = 0.35, 0.5, 0.75. Moreover, (0, 0, 0) and  (1/2,0,0)  sites  should  differ  in ܴ3ത phase  and,  as  it  seems,  they  should not be occupied by Sr/Na simultaneously.
So, finally, the  structure of ܴ3ത phase has two sites: 1) (0, 0, 0) occupied by (1-x)  Na and (x) Sr; 2) (0, 0, 1/2) occupied by (1-x) Na and (x) vacancy.
All these sites in ܴ3ത phase should be occupied by  (1-x) Na+ ions and by (x) vacancy.
Based  on  the  refinement  results,  the  dependences  of  cell  parameters of Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 on x (Sr2+ concentration) are This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry [year] Journal Name, [year], [vol], 00–00  |  3 InorganicChemistryFrontiersAcceptedManuscriptPublished on 15 January 2018. Downloaded by University of Leeds on 16/01/2018 09:34:06. View Article OnlineDOI: 10.1039/C7QI00782E Inorganic Chemistry FrontiersPage 4 of 6shown in Figure 4, which reveals two interesting features.
Firstly,  the  cell  parameter  a  (Figure  4a)  and  c  (Figure  4b)  have  a  fracture at x ~0.33, which is in a good agreement with the phase  transition ܴ3തܿ ↔ ܴ3ത previously found in the narrow range of x =  0.3-0.35  using  the  analysis  of  (0  0  3)  and  (1  0  1)  reflection  intensities.
Secondly,  with  Sr2+  concentration  (x)  increase,  cell  parameter a decreases (Figure 4a), while c increases (Figure 4b).
Such behavior leads to the nonlinear cell volume (V) dependence  on Sr2+ concentration (x) (Figure  4c) and, even in the range of x  = 0.7-1,  V decreases with  x increase despite the fact that the ion  radii of Sr2+ (CN = 6, 1.18 Å) is bigger than that of Na+ (CN = 6,  1.02  Å).
Therefore,  we  can  speculate  the  existence  of  negative  thermal  expansion  (NTE)  effect  in  the  compounds  Na(2-2x)Srx[  ]xZr4(PO4)6 at x = 0.7-1. It should be noted that refined values of x  are slightly smaller than the expected ones (Table 1, Figure 4d),  so the real concentration interval of such NTE compounds can be  0.5-1 instead of 0.7-1. Anyway,  the expected and refined values  of Sr concentrations are comparable and the overall increase trend  in the Sr2+ concentration is consistent (Figure 4d).
Brillouin zone of the high-symmetry ܴunit cell  (hereinafter  the  designation  of  irreducible  representations  (irrep)  and  points  of  the  Brillouin  zone  are  given  in  accordance  with  reference  books44-45.  The  Г2+  irrep  drives  this  phase  transition,  శሺ஗ሻ Гమ and the transformation can be written as R3തc ርۛሮ R3ത, where η is the  critical  order  parameter.
The  analysis  presents  that  this  irrep  allows a continuous phase transition and, indeed, there is no any  jump of cell volume or cell parameters when the phase transition  occurs (Figure 4a-c).
It should be noted that the phase transition  leads to charge ordering and splitting of positions.
For example,  Na site in ܴ3തܿ structure splits into two sites for ܴ3ത phase: Na1 at  (0, 0, 0) site and Na2 at (0, 0, 1/2) site.
Namely, these two sites  were  suggested  during  building  the  structural  model  of  Na(22x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6  in ܴ3ത phase  though  the pure  SrZr4(PO4)6 ሺܴ3തሻ  has only one filled site (0, 0, 0) and one vacancy site (0 ,0, 1/2).
Taking  into  account  all  obtained  information,  we  can  build  the model of structural transformation for NaZr2(PO4)3 doped by  Sr2+  ions  (Figure  5).
The  compound  NaZr2(PO4)3  crystallizes  in  ܴ3തܿ group  with  only  one  Na  site  in  the  asymmetric  part  of  the  unit cell.
Low Sr2+ concentration in the range of x = 0-0.3 doesn’t  lead  to  space  group  changing  and  only  the  ionic  replacement  (2Na+  ↔  Sr2+  +  Vacancy)  happens.
Higher  Sr2+  concentration  level leads to the phase transition and the Na site splits into two  cation  sites.
Na1  site  is  occupied  by  (1-x)  Na  and  (x)  Sr  ions,  while  Na2  site  is  occupied  by  (1-x)  Na  and,  so,  again  the  replacement  scheme  (2Na+  ↔  Sr2+  +  Vacancy)  is  valid.
The  vacancy part in the Na2 site increases with x increase up to total  disappearance of any ion in this site at x = 1 (Figure 5).
Dependence  of  refined  value  xrefined  of  Sr  concentration  in  the  compounds Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 per suggested concentration x.
Ideally,  all points should lie in the strait line which is depicted by the dashed line  in  Figure  3d.
In  our  case,  there  is  some  deviation  from  the  suggested  chemical formula, but the overall trend of the Sr concentration increasing  is the same.
First  of  all,  the measurements made for the sample x = 0.5 clearly show that  the cell parameter a decreases under heating (Figure 6a), with the  coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) -3.0 × 10-5 K-1 (ܴ3ത) and  -2.1  ×  10-5  K-1  (ܴ3തܿ )  (298-1073  K),  which  proves  the  linear  negative  thermal  expansion  in  this  crystallographic  direction.
Comparatively,  the  sample  x  =  0.75  shows  cell  parameter  a  decreasing  in  (NTE)  the  range  of  300-450  K,  near  zero  thermal  expansion  (ZTE)  in  the  range  of  450-600  K  and,  at  higher  temperatures,  cell  parameter  a  increasing  with  the  coefficient  of  thermal expansion varied from -6.4 × 10-6 to 3.1 × 10-6 K-1 (2981073  K)  (Figure  7a).
Such  behavior  is  extremely  unusual  and  near zero thermal expansion is a very useful property because the  ceramics  of  this  composition  will  be  less  strained  under  heating/cooling  which  leads  to  a  good  mechanical  feature.
It  should be noted that the point x = 0.75 is in close vicinity to the  point corresponding to the maximum of V (x) curve (Figure  4c).
Thus, one can suppose that the Sr2+ concentration (x) at which the  compounds  have  such  an  unusual  property  can  be  located  near  this maximum, i.e.x = 0.6-0.8. Figure  7.  Temperature  dependences  of  a.cell  parameter  a;  b.cell  parameter c; c.cell volume V and d.
Secondly,  it  can  be  seen  that  NaSr0.5[  ]0.5Zr4(PO4)6  has  a  phase transition ܴ3തܿ ↔ ܴ3ത upon heating at T ~700 K, because the  intensity of superstructure peak (101) becomes zero (Figure  6d)  and  all  cell  parameters  and  cell  volume  possess  jumps  at  this  temperature  (Figure  6a-c).
Thus  this  transition  cannot  be  of  second  order  type.
The  Na0.5Sr0.75[  ]0.75Zr4(PO4)6  sample  has  no  phase transition in the temperature region 25-800 oC (Figure 7ad),  but  the  extrapolation  presents  that  the  intensity  of  the  superstructure  peak  (101)  should  become  zero  at  ~1100  K  (Figure  7d).
It  should  be  noted  the  sample  Na(22x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 (x ~0.32) should have such a phase transition at  room temperature T ~300 K (Table  1,  Figure  4a-c), and all the  three points (x = 0.32, T = 300 K), (x = 0.5, T = 700 K), (x = 0.75,  T = 1100 K) lie on one straight line (Figure  8).
It can give us  the tool for prediction of the phase transition temperature in Na(22x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 with other x.
that there In  summary,  we  designed  and  synthesized  the  NASICONtype Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) solid solutions by the solgel  method  and  studied  the  crystal  structure,  thermal  expansion  properties  and  phase  transitions  of  samples  using  XRD  techniques.
Notably, the ZTE property is achieved in Na(2-2x)Srx[  ]xZr4(PO4)6 (x = 0.75) in the temperature range of 450-600 K.
Finally,  we  determined  the  phase  transition  between  ܴ3തܿ and ܴ3ത structures and give the prediction for phase transition  temperature of Na(2-2x)Srx[ ]xZr4(PO4)6 at arbitrary x.
