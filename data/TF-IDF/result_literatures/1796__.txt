A new NASICON-type chromium(III) phosphate,K0.16Na0.34Li2.5Cr2(PO4)3, lithium sodium potassium dichromatetris(phosphate), has been prepared by solid-state reaction.
It consists of CrO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra sharingcorners to form a three-dimensional framework.
The monovalent cations are located in the M1 (six-coordinate) and M2(four-coordinate) sites of the framework.
The M1 site isoccupied by Na+ and K+ cations with 69 (3) and 31 (3)%occupancy, respectively.
The Li+ ions, Li1 and Li2, are splitover twoM2 sites in general positions, with 60 (2) and 40 (2)%occupancy, respectively.
Atom Li2 is disordered around athreefold inversion axis.
Except for the two Li atoms, which were refined isotropically, allatoms were refined anisotropically.
The sums of the site occupancyfactors for the monovalent cations were restrained to unity.
