Herein, the hexagonal NaTi2(PO4)3/C was successfully synthesized by mechanical ball-milling using citric acid as the carbon source and characterized the structure and morphology of as-obtained samples, revealing that their surface was covered with a thin carbon layer. Charge/discharge testing revealed that the NaTi2(PO4)3/C sample with a carbon content of 4.4 wt% (prepared at 800 °C at a citric acid loading of 10 wt%) exhibited the highest initial discharge capacity of 869.5 mAh/g and featured excellent cycling stability. Thus, mechanical ball-milling coupled with carbon coating enabled the facile and practical preparation of NaTi2(PO4)3/C with enhanced electrochemical properties.

The global energy crisis requires the development of efficient energy utilization and storage systems such as Li-ion batteries, which are widely used in electric vehicles and mobile phones because of their high operating voltage and absence of memory effect [1], [2], [3]. At present, a wide range of lithium ion battery electrode materials are mainly concentrated in LiFePO4, Li3V2(PO4)3, LiMnPO4, etc. Xi et al. [4] synthesized Li3V2(PO4)3/C materials as cathode for lithium ion batteries by a microwave irradiation method in 2015, which displayed the excellent cycle life and stability as well as the fast and efficient method make the process feasible commercially. In 2016, Ding et al. [5] developed a two-step method to prepared the nanocomposite LiFePO4/C cathode materials for lithium ion batteries. The test results indicated a stable electrochemical performance and controllability with inseparable grains. However, the above materials and batteries are faced with the challenges of Li resource shortage, high cost and safety issues, which has revived the interest of the research community in Na-ion batteries as a better alternative in terms of cost (since Na is a much more widespread and abundant element than Li), environmental friendliness, and safety [6], [7].

Despite the vigorous development of cathode materials, the identification and study of suitable anode materials for Na-ion batteries has been underexplored. Although graphite, commonly used as an anode material, has excellent Li/Na storage performance, the radius of Na+ exceeds that of Li+, which causes structural collapse during Na+ insertion and de-intercalation and therefore results in irreversible changes [8]. Even so, research on carbon materials is still very extensive. For example, Hou et al. [9] produced carbon quantum dots and their derivative 3D porous carbon frameworks in a simple and low energy consumption approach. Furthermore, they have explored the corresponding mechanism of the above two materials. In addition, the obtained 3D porous carbon frameworks was first applied as anode material for sodium-ion batteries with ultralong cycle life and outstanding rate capability. Apart from carbon materials, a wide range of Na-ion battery anode materials such as metal oxide (TiO2, Na2Ti3O7, etc.) [10], [11], alloys (SnSb, ZnSb, etc.) [12], [13] and transition metal phosphates (NaTi2(PO4)3, Na3Ti2(PO4)3, etc.) [14], [15] have been studied, e.g., NASICON-structured NaTi2(PO4)3 offers high theoretical capacity, low cost and excellent thermal stability. The structure of this material features co-angled isolated TiO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, and the resulting three-dimensional framework provides numerous gaps, allowing sodium ions to be rapidly deintercalated with almost no lattice strain [16].

In fact, the corresponding Li analogue, LiTi2(PO4)3 has already been studied as a Li-ion battery anode material [17]. For example, Aravindan et al. [18] proved that NASICON-structured LiTi2(PO4)3 exhibits reversible Li+/Na+ embedding performance and observed high specific capacity and good cyclic performance for both of these alkali metals. Recently, Deng et al. [19] showed that LiTi2(PO4)3/C prepared by a simple solvothermal method followed by glucose pyrolysis exhibited a reversible capacity of 144 mAh/g at 0.2 C, stable cycling performance, and high rate performance. Consequently, NaTi2(PO4)3 has attracted increased attention as an anode material for Na-ion batteries. In their early research, Park et al. [20] pointed out that Na is embedded in NaTi2(PO4)3 at 2.1 V (vs. Na/Na+) via a two-phase reaction mechanism and described the electrochemical behavior of this material in organic and aqueous systems, indicating that whereas NaTi2(PO4)3 featured a reversible specific capacity of 123 mAh/g in an aqueous system and thus exhibited good electrochemical performance, only 60% of the initial capacity was retained after 30 cycles of cycling. Therefore, further research largely focused on the modification of NaTi2(PO4)3, mainly by carbon coating. In 2014, Li et al. [21] modified the above material by coating with graphene, at the same time achieving a specific capacity of 63.5 mAh/g at 20 C and a capacity retention of 71% after 2000 cycles. In 2015, Wu et al. [22] described a microwave-assisted synthesis method of NaTi2(PO4)3 and embedded this material into a three-dimensional graphene network. Composite material thus obtained featured specific discharge capacities of 112, 105, 96, and 67 mAh/g at 1, 5, 10, and 20 C, respectively, a capacity decay of 20% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, and a Coulombic efficiency of > 80%. In 2016, Wang et al. [23] embedded NaTi2(PO4)3 into mesoporous carbon, revealing that when the voltage range was extended to 0.01–3 V vs. Na/Na+, the initial specific discharge capacity equaled 455 mAh/g and decreased to a stable value of 208 mAh/g in the second cycle, which was indicative of superior cycling stability. The irreversible phenomena occurring during the first cycle were attributed to electrolyte decomposition and the production of a solid electrolyte membrane. In 2018, Cai et al. [24] synthesized porous NaTi2(PO4)3 coated by a 2–5-nm-thick carbon layer, demonstrating that this coating improved both rate and long-term cycling performances and achieving a capacity retention of 78.8% after 2000 cycles at 10 C. Based on the above, it can conclude that carbon coating can effectively improve the electronic conductivity of NaTi2(PO4)3, and therefore, its electrochemical performance [25].

In addition to being used as a Na-ion battery anode material, NaTi2(PO4)3 has also been applied in Mg-ion batteries [26] and other fields. However, this material has rarely been reported as an anode material for Li-ion batteries. Some researchers have also explored and discussed such Li/Na-Ion Batteries. Zhang et al. [27] have built a Li/Na hybrid battery based on Na plating/stripping with a high coulombic efficiency and high stability of 99.2% after 100 cycles, and featured low voltage hysteresis and fast charge transfer. In the work of Maletti et al. [28], LiV3O8 is prepared LiV3O8 by a conventional solid state synthesis, is also demonstrated for the first time in non-aqueous Li/Na-ion hybrid batteries with Na as anode electrode and different Na/Li ratios in the electrolyte. Meanwhile, they further discussed the electrochemical behavior of LiV3O8 positive electrode in hybrid Li/Na–ion Batteries.

In the case of NaTi2(PO4)3 material, the high voltage of 1.5–3 V have been generally accepted currently and capacity below 130 mAh/g can be obtained at the current density of 0.1 C. However, it is lower than the value of widely studied titanium oxides. Therefore, sensibly lower the operation voltage would be needed to enhance NaTi2(PO4)3's Li/Na ion capacity. Herein, the carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3 was synthesized by mechanical ball-milling and explored its performance as an anode material of a hybrid Li-/Na-ion battery with a Li sheet as a counter electrode and a Li salt electrolyte. At voltages of 0.01–3 V vs. Li/Li+, the above material exhibited a high first-cycle discharge capacity at a current density of 100 mA/g and featured excellent cycling stability after the second cycle.

All reagents used in the experiment were pure and were used as received.

NaTi2(PO4)3/C samples were synthesized by the mechanical ball-milling method. Typically, sodium acetate (0.8613 g, Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 99.0%), butyl titanate (6.8 mL, Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 99.0%), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (3.4506 g, Tianjin Beilian Fine Chemicals Development Co., Ltd., 99.0%), and a certain amount of citric acid were placed into an agate ball grinding tank and grounded in a planetary ball mill for 6 h at 400 rpm using absolute ethanol as a solvent. The ball-milled samples was oven-dried for 12 h at 80 °C in a drying oven to obtain a white precursor, an appropriate amount of which was placed into a tube furnace, pre-sintered at 350 °C for 4 h, and calcined at 750, 800, or 850 °C for 12 h to obtain NaTi2(PO4)3/C.

The phase composition of NaTi2(PO4)3/C was probed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D2, Cu Kα radiation, 2θ = 10–70°), while its morphology was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, H-600, Hitachi).

Electrodes were prepared by coating copper foil (current conductor) with a slurry of 80 wt% NaTi2(PO4)3/C active material, 10 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in deionized water and cut the slurry-coated foil into disks of 10-mm diameter. The thus obtained electrode films were dried in a vacuum oven at 110 °C for 12 h, and 2025-type cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox using Li foil as a counter electrode, a solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate(EC): dimethyl carbonate(DMC): ethyl methyl carbonate(EMC) (1:1:1, v/v/v) as an electrolyte, and Celgard 2400 as a separator.

Galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling was performed within a voltage range of 0.01–3 V at room temperature using an automatic battery tester(Land-2001A, Wuhan, China). Cyclic voltammetry (CV, scan rate = 0.1 mV/s) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, frequency = 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz) measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (Chenhua CHI 650D).

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of NaTi2(PO4)3/C samples synthesized under different conditions. In particular, Fig. 1a presents patterns of samples prepared using different amounts of citric acid but sintered under identical temperature and time conditions, with letters a, b, c, d, and e corresponding to citric acid loadings of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% respectively, while the carbon content is 0, 2.9, 4.4, 7.3 and 12.7 wt% respectively. Similarly, Fig. 1b presents XRD patterns of samples with a carbon content of 4.4 wt% sintered at different temperatures. The above figures reveal that all patterns were consistent with the standard card and previous literature, indicating that the synthesized NaTi2(PO4)3 material was belonging to the R-3c space group and indicating the high phase purity of the prepared material. Fig. 1a shows that the most intense and sharp peaks (and hence, the highest degree of crystallinity) were observed at a carbon content of 4.4 wt%, whereas a continuous reduction of crystallinity degree with increasing carbon content was observed at higher loadings, which was ascribed to the agglomeration of sample particles caused by excessive carbon coating. Fig. 1b shows that the sharpest peaks (and hence, highest extent of crystallinity) were observed at 800 °C. No carbon diffraction peaks were observed in the above XRD patterns, which indicated that the carbon present in the sample was amorphous.

Sample morphology was further observed by TEM images (Fig. 2). As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the black portions of the image correspond to NaTi2(PO4)3, while the outer light gray portions correspond to carbon. The high-power transmission diagram in Fig. 2b reveals that the surface of NaTi2(PO4)3 was covered by a 2.47-nm-thick carbon layer. Based on the observed lattice fringes, the lattice spacing of the material was calculated as 0.61 nm, corresponding to the (0 1 2) crystal plane of NaTi2(PO4)3. Based on the results of elemental analysis, carbon content was estimated as 4.4 wt%.

Fig. 3 presents the first-cycle charge/discharge curves of different samples recorded at a current density of 100 mA/g and voltages of 0.01–3 V. In particular, Fig. 3a features charge/discharge curves of samples with different carbon contents sintered under the same temperature and time conditions, revealing that the first-cycle discharge capacity was highest (869.5 mAh/g) at a carbon content of 4.4 wt%, while the second-cycle charging capacity equaled 427.8 mAh/g. Fig. 3b presents the first-cycle charge/discharge curves of 4.4 wt% carbon content samples calcined at different temperatures, demonstrating that the highest specific discharge capacity and second-cycle reversibility were observed when the calcination temperature equaled 800 °C. The specific capacity discharge first increased and then decreased with increasing calcination temperature, which was ascribed to the poor crystal growth at overly low temperatures and to the increased extent of particle size increase and agglomeration at overly high temperatures. Thus, optimal electrochemical performance was observed at a carbon content of 4.4 wt% and a calcination temperature of 800 °C.

Fig. 4 compares the cycling lifetimes of different samples determined at a current density of 100 mA/g and voltages of 0.01–3 V. In particular, Fig. 4a shows the effect of citric acid loading under identical temperature and time conditions, showing that the highest first-cycle discharge capacity of 869.5 mAh/g was observed at a loading of 4.4 wt%. The second-cycle charging capacity of the above sample equaled 427.8 mAh/g, and the discharge capacity after 100 cycles of cycling was determined as 390.7 mAh/g. Notably, the discharge capacity first increased and then decreased with increasing carbon content, which was rationalized by the concomitant increase of material particle size and the resulting agglomeration. Fig. 4b compares the cycling lifetimes of samples with a carbon content of 4.4 wt% calcined at different temperatures, demonstrating that the best specific discharge capacity and second-cycle reversibility were observed at a calcination temperature of 800 °C. After 100 cycles, the specific discharge capacities of samples calcined at temperatures of 750, 800 and 850 °C equaled 318.4, 390.7, and 283.1 mAh/g, respectively. The specific discharge capacity first increased and then decreased with increasing calcination temperature, since overly low temperatures prevented material crystal growth, whereas overly high temperatures promoted agglomeration. Based on the above, the best cycling stability was observed for the sample with a carbon content of 4.4 wt% calcined at 800 °C. The cycling lifetime diagram of the above sample (Fig. 5) reveals that a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% was maintained starting from the second cycle, which suggested that polarization during charge-discharge was insignificant and indicated that the tested sample featured excellent cycling stability. The significant attenuation observed in the second cycle was consistent with previous reports [20] and was ascribed to inactivation caused by the structural collapse of the material after the first cycle of discharge.

Fig. 6 presents the CV curves of the optimal (4.4 wt% carbon content, 800 °C) sample recorded during the first three cycles, demonstrating that redox peak positions were consistent with charge-discharge behavior. Two pairs of obvious redox peaks observed at 2.60/2.41 and 0.78/0.63 V corresponded to the interconversions of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Ti3+/Ti2+, respectively. In addition, the third pair of redox peaks close to 0 V was ascribed to the insertion/de-intercalation of Na+/Li+ between carbon layers. Moreover, Fig. 6 shows that the CV curve of the sample is not high in coincidence degree for the first three cycles, which indicated that certain polarization phenomena were observed for this sample during charge-discharge and led to irreversible changes. It is worth mentioning that the further reduction of Ti3+ to Ti2+ can only be carried out in the low voltage range, and the reason for the stability of this process is that the NaTi2(PO4)3 material is NASICON-type structure. At the same time, strong induction effect of polyanion PO4 tetrahedron effectively controls the ionocovalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds and tune the redox transition metal potentials [29]. As for NaTi2(PO4)3, the appearance of 0.7 V low-voltage platform is similar to the value of Na3Ti2(PO4)3 due to the contribution of Ti3+/Ti2+ redox couple.

Fig. 7 shows the EIS spectrum of the samples prepared at 750, 800 and 850 °C, revealing the presence of a semicircle in the high-frequency region and a diagonal line with an intercept with the real axis in the low-frequency region. The semicircular part represented charge transfer impedance (i.e., the difficulty of charge transfer), whereas the oblique line part represented ion migration impedance (i.e., the extent of Li+ diffusion in the electrode reaction). As can be seen from the above figure, the sample exhibited a minimum transfer impedance of ~ 370 Ω under 800 °C, showed that the electrochemical performance is better than the other two temperatures and the results are also consistent with the electrochemical performance.

In summary, NaTi2(PO4)3/C was successfully synthesized by mechanical ball-milling and characterized by XRD, which revealed that sample crystallinity first increased and then decreased with increasing carbon content and calcination temperature, with the best crystallinity observed in the case of 800 °C. Electrochemical testing showed that the sample with a citric acid loading of 10 wt% (carbon content = 4.4 wt%) prepared at 800 °C exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 869.5 mAh/g. Although its charge capacity irreversibly decreased to 427.8 mAh/g, the above sample featured excellent cycling stability and maintained a discharge capacity of 390.7 mAh/g after 100 cycles. This excellent electrochemical performance was attributed to the presence of the carbon coating.
