Sodium (Na) super ionic conductor (NASICON) polyanionic compounds have recently attracted much attention from the battery community because of their electroactive properties and reasonably high ionic conductivities, leading to their use as a cathode in sodium-ion batteries. This article describes the compositional optimizations, crystallographic evaluations, and electrochemical behavior of a new mixed NASICON polyanionic compound, NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2. By doping the characteristic Fe3+ sites of the FeO6 octahedrons with varying amounts of V3+, the electrochemical stability and charge transport in NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 were enhanced. The resulting best composition, with crystal structure NaFe1.4V0.6(PO4)(SO4)2 resolved through the Rietveld method, exhibited a stable capacity compared with the other synthesized compositions. In situ powder x-ray diffraction measure-ments, a single-phase intercalation/deintercalation mechanism of the NASICON structure in the measured so-dium concentration window was observed with no impurity phase formation. Further electrochemical assessments revealed the interfacial charge transfer kinetics to be the rate-limiting step in the sodium concen-tration window. Also, the measured sodium-ion diffusivity values in the range of 6 x 10- 11 to 7 x 10- 11 cm2/s in the measured sodium concentration range. The results reported here highlight the potential of compositionally and morphologically optimized NaFe1.4V0.6(PO4)(SO4)2 with higher particle surface areas as a cathode material for high-performance sodium-ion batteries.   
Sodium-ion batteries are very promising candidates to replace lithium-ion batteries for large-scale energy storage systems because of their cost and safety guarantees. However, several key challenges exist in identifying suitable electrode and electrolyte materials to enable high-power and -energy density with long lifespan [1–9]. To address these challenges, several sodium-transition metals–based mixed polyanionic materials—Na4M3(PO4)2(P2O7) [10,11], Na3M(PO4)(CO3) [12], Na2MPO4F (M = Fe, Mn, Co and Ni) [13], and Na3V2(PO4)2F3- xOx [14] have been widely investigated over recent years. These materials are considered as potential cathode candidates for sodium-ion batteries because of their excellent electrochemical performance, favorable crystal structures, and good thermal and structural stability. In this setting, mixed polyanionic compounds containing (SO4)2- have recently been reported as an attractive sodium-ion cathode material because of the presence of the highly electronegative (SO4)2- anion. Lu et al. [15] reported for the ﬁrst time the preliminary electrochemical results of a new series of mixed polyanionic with an alluaudite structure, NaxFey(-PO4)3–z(SO4)z (0 ≤ z ≤ 3). These materials were synthesized by ball-milling a mixture of Na2Fe3(PO4)3 and Na2.56Fe1.72(SO4)3 in controlled (argon) atmospheres. Lu et al. demonstrated the presence of a highly electronegative (SO4)2- species in the crystal structure that increased the operational voltage window from 3.19 (z = 0) to 3.36 (z = 1.5) and ﬁnally, to 3.72 V (z = 3) in Na2.56Fe1.72(SO4)3. Further in-vestigations revealed that the origin of the elevated voltage was the inductive effect caused by the highly electronegative (SO4)2- polyanion, which corroborated the overall trend of voltage enhancement in such polyanionic compounds. Additionally, Shiva et al. prepared a phos-phosulfate NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 with a large amount of impurities, leading to an unusual electrochemical behavior resulting in a trend of capacity increase with cycling [16], which warranted further investigations. In this context, in the past several years, the authors’ research team has focused on developing new compounds and evaluating them as positive and negative electrode materials for both lithium- and sodium-ion bat-teries. These materials predominantly consist of crystalline α-CrPO4, alluaudite, and Na super ionic conductor (NASICON) structures [3–6, 17–21]. Recently, the authors reported the synthesis and electrochemical properties of impurity-free NASICON NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 [22], showing good electrochemical activity with an average voltage of ~3 V. The material delivered a capacity of 89 mA h/g with 70% of the speciﬁc capacity realized (theoretical capacity = 127 mAh g- 1 for a 2e- reac-tion). In this material, insertion of 1.4 Na+ ion per formula unit NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 induced a 4.6% change in the cell volume. Expanding on this work, the authors here describe the synthesis protocols, struc-tural evaluations, and electrochemical behavior of a new mixed poly-anionic compound, NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 with a NASICON crystal structure as a potential cathode material for Na+ ion batteries. The Fe3+ (0.645 Å) sites of the FeO6 octahedrons at NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 were doped with V3+ (0.64 Å) to optimize the structural and electrochemical stability as well as increase the electrical conductivity of NaFe2(PO4) (SO4)2. The crystal structure was resolved by the Rietveld method from the powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) data. The oxidation state and local environment of Fe in NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 was also determined using M€ossbauer spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances were examined by galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were also employed to measure the ionic diffusivity and interfacial charge transfer kinetics of the cath-ode material. The stability of the NASICON structure during cycling was also conﬁrmed by in situ PXRD experiments of NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2. Overall, this systematic report aims to highlight the potential of NASI-CON type NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries. 
The NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 powders (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) were synthesized via sol-gel synthesis from stoichiometric mixtures of NaNO3 (Aldrich, 99%), Fe(NO₃)₃⋅9H₂O (Aldrich, ≥98%), NH4VO₃ (Aldrich, ≥99%),(NH4)2SO4 (Aldrich, ≥99%), NH4H2PO4 (Merk, ≥99%), and citric acid (CA) C6H8O7 (Riedel-deHa€en). First, NH4VO3 and CA with a mole ratio of x:2 were dissolved in 40 ml of water to form a clear blue solution; then, Fe(NO₃)₃⋅9H₂O was dissolved in 20 ml of water and added to the blue solution (Solution A). The NaNO3, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4H2PO4 precursors were dissolved together in 40 ml of water (Solution B). So-lution B was then added dropwise to Solution A under continuous stir-ring. Finally, the solutions were left to dry at 80 °C overnight. The resulting powders were pelletized, placed in alumina crucibles, and heated in argon at 400 °C h for 12 h to decompose the precursors and release the H2O, NH3, and NO2 molecules. The 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.4 samples were heated again at 500 °C h for 20 h under argon, whereas the 1.4 ≤ x ≤ 2 samples were heated at 400 °C for 20 h under argon. The progress of the reactions was monitored by PXRD measurements, and the NASICON phase was observed only for the 0 ˂ x ≤ 1.4 composition range. 
Semiquantitative energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometry analysis was performed with a Jeol JSM-7610F scanning electron microscope. The elemental compositions based on the Na/Fe/V/P/S atomic ratios were close to 1:2–x:x:1:2, as expected for NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1.4). 
To determine the purity of the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 samples, PXRD was performed. The data were collected at room temperature over the 2θ– angular range of 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 110° with a step size of 0.01° using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer operating with the Cu-Kα radiation. Full pattern-matching reﬁnements were performed using the Jana2006 program package [23]. The backgrounds were estimated by a Legendre function, and the peak shapes were described by a pseudo-Voigt func-tion. Operando XRD measurement (15–45° 2θ range, 0.02° step size, and 2 s/strip step time) was performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with a Cu-Kα radiation and a LYNXEYE XE-T 1D Detector (192 strips). The electrode was prepared by mixing 80% of active material with 20% of carbon black. Operando XRD data were collected during electro-chemical cycling in a specially designed cell with a beryllium window, using the diffractometer and a Biologic VMP3 galvanostat. The XRD patterns were recorded every hour during the ﬁrst cycle in the galva-nostatic regime at C/40, which corresponds to the reaction of 0.1 Na per formula unit. 
Mӧssbauer spectroscopy data of the 57Fe transmission were recorded with a constant-acceleration spectrometer with a57Co(Rh) source at room temperature. The M€ossbauer spectrum absorber was prepared with 40 mg/cm2 of material mixed with boron nitride. The spectrometer was calibrated at room temperature with the magnetically split sextet spectrum of a high-purity α-Fe foil as the reference absorber. The mea-surements were carried out in the 􀀆4 mm/s velocity ranges. Fitting the experimental data, the spectral parameters such as isomer shift (δ), quadrupole splitting (Δ), linewidth (Γ), and relative resonance areas of the different spectral components were determined. The validity of ﬁts was judged basis on minimizing the number of parameters and χ2 values. 
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2) samples using a TA Instruments Discovery Thermogravimetric Analyzer. The measurements were con-ducted between 25 °C and 800 °C or 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/ min. The experiments were performed in platinum crucibles under argon atmosphere. 
Positive electrodes were made from mixtures of NaFe2- xVx(PO4) (SO4)2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) powders, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene ﬂuoride in a weight ratio of 70:22:8. The resulting electrode ﬁlms were cut into discs (Φ = 14 mm) and dried at 120 °C for 12 h under vacuum. The electrolyte was 1 M NaPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC), and propylene carbonate (PC) (1 M NaPF6 in EC/PC). 
Coin cells (CR2032) embedding NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2/NaPF6+EC PC/Na were assembled in an argon-ﬁlled glove box with glass ﬁber(Whatman Grade GF/A, Φ = 20 mm) as separators. Room-temperature galvanostatic cycling tests (constant current mode) for all the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (0 < x ≤ 1) electrodes were performed using an Arbin cycler in the voltage range of 1.5–4.5 V at a C/10 rate; then, the rate capability was performed for the x = 0.4 sample. The GITT was also applied to the NaFe1.6V0.4PO4(SO4)2 active electrode material. The cell was charged/discharged galvanostatically at C/10 rate to form a stable solid electrolyte interphase layer in the ﬁrst cycle. Then, a charging/ discharging current equivalent to a C/30 rate was applied using Solar-tron 1470E battery cycler for 2 h to attain a certain state of charge/ discharge (SOC/SOD), followed by a 2-h rest to reach the steady-state cell voltage. The procedure was repeated stepwise to cover whole states of charge/discharge. During this titration process, a sodium con-centration gradient was built up across the active particles. Conse-quently, a cell voltage polarization occurred, followed by a relaxation of the cell voltage (depolarization) with time at the open-circuit voltage (OCV) condition. Then, the ionic diffusivity was derived from the voltage relaxation process as the derivative of the cell voltage depolar-ization vs. time. Details of the data evaluation and equations were dis-cussed in a previous report [22]. After partial sodiation/desodiation, the cell was relaxed under the OCV condition in every step to reach the steady state in which the voltage decay was less than 2 mV/h at the end of the time interval. Thereafter, EIS was performed in the frequency range of 5 MHz to 0.5 Hz to using a sinusoidal voltage amplitude of 10 mV. The obtained EIS spectra were ﬁtted using an equivalent circuit model built in ZView software to extract different resistive processes in the electrochemical measurements. 
Following the ﬁrst heat treatments at 400 °C for 12 h under argon, XRD patterns were collected; all the samples had an amorphous nature, which was determined since no XRD peak was detected. This result conﬁrmed that 400 °C is not hot enough to crystalize this material. After the second heat treatment at 500 °C, the XRD analyses indicated that pure NASICON phases could be formed only for 0 < x ≤ 1. Full pattern- matching reﬁnements using the space group R-3c and the cell parame-ters of NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 could index all the peaks except for the one at 2θ = 39° (cf. Supporting Figs. S1–S7). Therefore, the symmetry was reduced from R-3c to R-3. This symmetry enabled indexing of all the powder patterns. Evaluation of the obtained XRD data revealed the reﬁned cell parameters listed in Table 1. A Rietveld reﬁnement was performed for x = 0.4. The crystal structure of NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 was solved using the structure of NaMgFe(SO4)3 as a starting structural model [30]. Statistical disorders of Fe/V and P/S were introduced, and constraints on their occupancies and atomic displacement parameters were also imposed. The Rietveld analysis of the XRD data collected at 300 K led to the reliability factors listed in Table 2 (Rp = 0.26%, Rwp = 0.36%, RB = 4.86%). The ﬁnal atomic positions are given in Table 3. Fig. 1 shows a good agreement between the experimental and calculated patterns. 
For x = 1.2 and x = 1.4, the NASICON phases were observed; how-ever, tiny peaks of an unidentiﬁed impurity were detected. For x > 1.4, the samples remained amorphous because of the low-temperature heat treatment performed. The TGA measurements demonstrated that all the samples showed around 30% of weight loss due to the release of SO2 gas. Furthermore, their decomposition temperatures decreased with the in-crease of vanadium content (Fig. 2). Therefore, the x > 1.4 samples could not be heated above 400 °C to form NASICON phases. SEM micro graph of NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 with x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0. and 1.0 is given in the supporting Fig. S8 and all the samples exhibited similar micro structure. There was no speciﬁc particle shape was observed and the particles are agglomerated. 
The NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (0 < x ≤ 1) compounds crystallized with the NASICON structure with cell parameters very similar to those of NaMgFe(SO4)3 [24]. The structure can be described as a covalent skel-eton [(Fe/V)2P3O12] built of Fe/VO6 octahedra and XO4 tetrahedra (X = S, P), which formed 3D interconnected channels with four types of interstitial positions (3a, 3b, 9d, 9e) in which sodium atoms and va-cancies were distributed (Fig. 3). The interatomic distances in NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (x = 0.4) are listed in Table 4. The FeO6 octahedra were slightly distorted with d(Fe-O) distances ranging from 1.932 to 2.052 Å with average distances of 1.992 and 1.965 Å for Fe1 and Fe2, respectively. These values are in good agree-ment with the value of 1.95 Å calculated from the sum of the effective ionic radii of the six-coordinated low spin Fe3+ and O2- [25]. The bond valence sums of 3.24 and 3.17 indicate that Fe1 and Fe2 were slightly over-bonded [26,27] and the P1/S1O4 tetrahedra were strongly dis-torted. The P1/S1-O distances ranged from 1.470 to 1.483 Å with an average value of 1.477 Å. This value was lower than the values 1.55 and 1.50 Å calculated from the sum of the effective ionic radii of the four-coordinated P5+, S6+, and O2- . The bond valence sums of 5.84 and 5.95 for P1 and S1, respectively, indicate that P1 was over-bonded. The Na1+ and Na2+ cations were surrounded by six oxygen atoms (Fig. 3c). The average Na1-O distance of 2.441 Å was consistent with the value of 2.42 Å calculated from the sum of the effective ionic radii of the four-coordinated Na+ and O2- [25], whereas the average Na2-O dis-tance of 2.551 Å was larger. The bond valence sums of 1.07 and 0.795 for Na1 and Na2, respectively, indicate that Na2 was slightly under-bonded. 
M€ossbauer spectroscopy is an excellent technique for probing the oxidation states and the local environment of Fe atoms in Fe-based phosphate materials. To investigate the oxidation state and the local environment of Fe in the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 material, 57Fe M€ossbauer spectroscopy was used. The spectrum was consistent with the presence of paramagnetic Fe, conﬁrming the paramagnetic behavior of the material at room temperature. The lack of magnetic ordering also proved the absence of magnetic Fe oxides-based impurities at the 1 Fe at. % level, in good agreement with XRD results, which conﬁrms the high purity of the sample. The M€ossbauer spectrum of the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 sample recorded at room temperature (Fig. 4) shows the presence of two Fe(III) sites and two Fe(II) sites. A high-quality ﬁt of the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4) (SO4)2 spectrum was obtained using four components corresponding to two Fe(III) doublets (red and brown lines) that represent 86% of the total Fe and two Fe(II)-doublets (blue and purple lines). These data are in good agreement with the XRD data that suggests that the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 phase has four Fe crystallographic sites or some structural defects. The hyperﬁne parameters are presented in the Table 5. The prepared phase was also determined to be pure. The two Fe(III) doublets have isomer shifts of around 0.44 mm/s but with different quadrupole splitting of 0.87 mm/s and 0.47 mm/s, conﬁrming the different local environments of two Fe(III) sites corresponding to dis-torted octahedral sites. The estimated average isomer shift and quad-rupole splitting of Fe(III) were consistent with six-fold coordination, whereas Fe(II) sites showed broad quadrupole doublets (3.09 and 2.39 mm/s) with isomer shifts of about 1.26 mm/s and 1.24 mm/s. These results conﬁrm that Fe(II)-ions were in a highly asymmetric environ-ment in the structure of the NaFe1.6V0.4(SO4)2PO4 material compared with Fe(III)-ions. The M€ossbauer spectrum of the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4) (SO4)2 sample recorded at room temperature (Fig. 4) shows the presence of two Fe(III) sites and two Fe(II) sites. A high-quality ﬁt of the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 spectrum was obtained using four components corresponding to two Fe(III) doublets (green and brown lines) that represent 86% of the total Fe and two Fe(II)-doublets (blue and purple lines) and there red line correspond to ﬁt. 
The effect of vanadium-doping on the electrochemical performance of the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 samples was examined by performing galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Fig. 5a shows the charge/discharge proﬁles of the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 samples at 0.1 C in the voltage window of 1.5–4.5 V vs. Na+/Na. The average working potential of the cathode was ~3 V, with charge/discharge curves exhibiting similar behavior to that of NASICON NaFe2(PO4)(SO4)2 [23]. The NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 with x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 samples showed a relatively high discharge capacity (over 72 mAhg- 1) with a capacity retention of 96% after 50 cycles. The NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 composi-tion exhibited comparatively better cycling stability compared with the other compositions. The cell polarization trend with an increasing rate during discharge/charge cycling for NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 is shown in Fig. 6a at rates 0.1–5C. The rate performance was also tested from 0.1 to 10C (Fig. 6b). The capacity obtained at the rate of 0.1C was observed to recover after returning from 10 to 0.1C. This observation revealed that rate performance of the samples was limited by either interfacial ki-netics at the electrode/electrolyte interface or by charge transport properties of active particles. Details are discussed later in this paper at section 3.4.2. To further investigate the sodium intercalation/deintercalation mechanism into/from the host structure, operando XRD analysis was conducted with the speciﬁc Swagelok electrochemical cell in reﬂection mode during the discharge/charge process as shown in Fig. 7. During the discharge, only a slight shifting of peaks was observed (Fig. 7) without the formation of any new phase, indicating a single-phase mode of deintercalation in NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2. A complete original pattern was retrieved at 1.5 V, indicating the reversible nature of the interca-lation process. The in situ analysis clearly conﬁrmed that during the charging/dis-charging, the sodium intercalation/deintercalation in NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 occurred through a reversible single-phase reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. The peak shifts corresponded to the slight variations of the lattice parameters with the amount of inserted Na+. 
The GITT was applied to the best composition of NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4) (SO4)2 to measure the interfacial charge transfer resistance at electro-lyte/electrode interfaces. The GITT curves of the charge/discharge processes are displayed in Fig. 8a as a function of time. The NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 vs. Na/Na+ cell was ﬁrst discharged stepwise down to 1.5 V to convert the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 into a reduced phase (Fe3+ to Fe2+), followed by charging again to 4.5 V. Fig. 8a shows that the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 material exhibited a single-phase sodiation/desodiation mechanism in the measured voltage window (1.5–4.5 V). Fig. 8b shows the EIS spectra recorded on the half- cell of the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 material in the charging states. The cell was held at the OCV for 2 h with a voltage decay rate of ~3 mV/h at the end of the partial desodiation. Under the OCV condition, the cell voltage at a particular SOC/SOD was in between the oxidation and reduction states. Notably, small bias potentials during the EIS mea-surements in such a situation can initiate partial sodium intercalation/ deintercalation. The measured Nyquist plots of NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2  comprises the following features: 
1.	At high frequencies, Ohmic contribution caused by the ionic resis-tance of the electrolyte solution (R1)—along with a minor contri-bution of the solid electrolyte interphase and inductive effect—appeared below the real axis (L1). Induction was directly proportional to frequency (L ∝ f).2.	A single semicircle was observed at medium-high frequencies, which was likely due to the charge transfer resistance (R2) at the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2/electrolyte interface, since the associated capacitance value was relatively high (10- 6 F). The separation of charge transfer resistance at the metallic sodium/electrolyte inter-face was troublesome since it appeared to overlap with the relaxation process of the cathode interface.3.	A Warburg response (Ws) appeared at low frequencies. Very similar impedance spectra were measured during the discharge process.
Different resistance processes were separated by ﬁtting the spectra using the equivalent circuit shown in the top of Fig. 8b, and the obtained data for the semicircle are displayed in Fig. 8c as a function of the SOC/ SOD along with the electrolyte Ohmic resistance (R1). Fig. 8c shows that the resistances of the semicircles gradually increased and decreased with the degree of sodiation/desodiation, respectively, whereas R1 remained almost constant with the various SOC and SOD. The charge transfer reaction associated at the sodium/electrolyte interface might not have varied with the SOC or SOD. Here, R2 was mainly associated with the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2/electrolyte interface since the formation of mixed valence Fe2+/Fe3+ signiﬁcantly affected the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4(SO4)2/electrolyte interface during the desodiation/sodiation process. Fig. 8c also shows that the resistance R2 was relatively high. This huge value of R2 was likely due to agglomerated particle morphology and a relatively small surface area exposed to the electrolyte. The EIS results imply that the interfacial charge transfer resistance was likely rate-limiting in the whole range of sodium concentrations. The voltages obtained during the depolarization of the cell at different SOC and SOD were ﬁtted with Eq. (1) to derive the relaxation time, τ. 
A is the constant term for a particular material, and U(t) and U(t=∞) are the cell voltage at times (t) and t = ∞. The slope of the plot, lnðUðt+ - Uðt=∞++ vs. t, provides the relaxation time, τ. Details about the equation and its use and data evaluation can be found in the references. [28–30] As described in Section 2, depolarization was caused by the development of a sodium concentration gradient across the active par-ticle during the titration process. After each desodiation/sodiation step, the cell was allowed to relax under the OCV condition, leading to steady-state cell voltage. As an example, the depolarization cell voltage can be well-ﬁtted with Eq. (1) (Fig. S8a). The relaxation time obtained from the ﬁtted data is displayed in Fig. 8d as a function of SOC/SOD, which shows that relaxation time gradually decreased up to 75% SOC. Thereafter, a gradual increase was observed with further desodiation. Because getting the accurate particle diameter is difﬁcult, the authors could not reliably calculate the diffusivity values of the material. Nevertheless, the obtained relaxation times clearly indicated the range and trend of diffusivity as a function of sodium concentration. The diffusivity values were between 6 x 10- 11 and 7 x 10- 11 cm2/s (Fig. S8b) in the measured sodium concentration window by assuming a 2 μm diffusion length obtained from the SEM micrographs. Therefore, diffusivity can also be a rate-limiting factor at higher cycling rates as shown in Fig. 6b. 
Several new mixed polyanionic NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.60, 0.8, and 1.0) samples were synthesized with optimized composi-tions, considering structural stability and electrochemical performances. The structural stability was investigated by XRD followed by Rietveld reﬁnement protocols to obtain accurate structural reﬁnements of the synthesized compounds. The obtained parameters as a result of solving the crystal structure indicated NASICON phases for these materials. Of the various compositions evaluated, the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 composition exhibited comparatively better electrochemical perfor-mance. The structural stability was also investigated as a function of sodium content by using in situ XRD measurements during the galva-nostatic charge/discharge process. The in situ analysis conﬁrmed that the sodium intercalation/deintercalation in the NaFe1.6V0.4(PO4)(SO4)2 occurred through a reversible single-phase reaction instead of the pre-vailing notion of a two-phase reaction. However, XRD data suggested that the NaFe2- xVx(PO4)(SO4)2 phase has two Fe crystallographic sites or some structural defects, which agrees with spectra obtained from M€ossbauer measurements. The results from M€ossbauer studies also conﬁrmed that the Fe (II)-ions are in a highly asymmetric environment in the structure of the NaFe1.6V0.4(SO4)2PO4 compared with Fe (III)-ions. Further investigating the electrochemical behavior using EIS measure-ments indicated that the electrochemical performances of these mate-rials were limited by interfacial charge transfer kinetics in the whole range of sodium concentration at practical C rates. The range of diffu-sivity values determined using GITT measurements did not show sig-niﬁcant variation and was between 6 x 10- 11 and 7 x 10- 11 cm2s- 1 in the measured sodium concentration window. At higher C rates with particle sizes larger than 4 μm, ionic diffusivity appeared to also be a key rate-limiting factor. Overall, through these systematic investigations optimizing synthesis, crystallographic, and electrochemical parameters, NaFe1.6V0.4(SO4)2PO4 shows great promise for potential use as a cathode material for sodium-ion batteries.
