Tetravalent Ge4þ ion conduction in solids was first demon- strated by selecting a NASICON-type GeNb(PO4)3 solid and par- tially replacing P5þ ion in GeNb(PO4)3 with Si4þ ion to expand the crystal lattice, which allows for realization of a Ge4þ ion with high valence and electronegativity. Among the Ge1þx=4NbP3—x- SixO12 solids prepared, it was found that Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 (x ¼ 0:1) solid showed the highest Ge4þ ion conductivity.

Ion conduction in solids generally depends on the strength of the interaction between the mobile ion and surrounding counter ions in the crystal structure. Therefore, the higher the valence state of the mobile cations, the lower the ion conductivity of the solid, because of the strong electrostatic interaction. In addi- tion, cations with high electronegativity have not been explored as conducting species in solids because such cations should be lattice forming by covalently bonding to anionic species in solids. To date, the cation species known to conduct in solids have been those possessing low electronegativity such as monovalent alkali metal ions (Pauling’s scale of electronegativity [EN] 0.98),1–3 divalent alkaline earth metal ions (EN 1:0),4,5 trivalent Al3þ (EN 1:61)6 and rare earth ions (EN 1:36),7,8 and tetravalent Zr4þ (EN 1:33),9–11 Hf4þ (EN 1:3),12 and Ti4þ (EN 1:54)13 ions. There is, however, an exception of Agþ ion (EN 1:93)14,15 in the α-AgI structure, which can be regarded as an intermediate structure between that of a typical ionic solid in which every lattice site is occupied and that of a typical ionic liquid in which both anions and cations are disordered. There is another crystal structure suitable for ion conduction in solids, that is, three-dimensional networks. Recently, we have successfully demonstrated tetravalent M4þ (M Zr, Hf, and Ti) cation conducting MNb(PO4)3 solids9–13 with NASICON (Naþ superionic conductor)-type three-dimensional network structure which is built by NbO6 octahedron and PO4 tetrahedron by shar- ing the corner oxygen and has large open space for M4þ ion con- duction. Since O2— ions are strongly attracted to Nb5þ and P5þ in this structure, it is expected that the bonding between M4þ and surrounding O2— ions is effectively reduced. In this letter, we focused on the tetravalent Ge4þ ion with electronegativity of 2.01 as a target conducting tetravalent cation in solids. While Ge is a well-known glass-forming element due to its high electronegativity, Ge4þ ion also has a possibility for migration in NASICON-type structures in which other high- valent cations (such as Nb5þ and P5þ) form the rigid skeleton structure. For realizing Ge4þ ion conduction in solids, we select- ed NASICON-type GeNb(PO4)3 as the mother solid similar to the case of Zr4þ, Hf4þ, and Ti4þ ion conductors.9–13 In addition, we partially replaced the P5þ (ionic size = 0.031 nm [coordina- tion number (CN): 4]16) site with larger Si4þ (0.040 nm [CN: 4]16) ion for expanding the crystal lattice, which directly influ- enced the expansion of conduction pathways in the structure, and the Ge4þ ion conducting properties in the Ge1þx=4NbP3—x- SixO12 solids were investigated. Ge1þx=4NbP3—xSixO12 (x 0:0{0:3) were prepared by a sol–gel method. Stoichiometric amounts of ethanol solution of 1 mol L—1 GeCl4, 0.1 mol L—1 NbCl5, and 0.1 mol L—1 Si(OC2H5)4 were mixed. After homogenization of the ethanol solution, (NH4)2HPO4 dissolved in 3 mol L—1 nitric acid was added dropwise into the mixed ethanol solution to obtain yellow precipitates. The solution was stirred at 130 ○C for 24 h, and then the ethanol and water were vaporized at 130 ○C. The powder ob- tained was calcined at 600 ○C for 6 h and then at 1100 ○C for 12 h in air. The samples obtained were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis using Cu Kα radiation (MultiFlex, Rigaku). The XRD data were collected by the step scanning method in the 2& range from 10 to 70○ with a step width of 0.04○, and the lattice volume of the samples was calculated by refining the XRD patterns using α-Al2O3 as a standard. The Ge1þx=4NbP3—xSixO12 powders were pelletized and sintered at 1100 ○C for 12 h in air. The electrical conductivity was measured for the sintered pellet with Pt layer on both center surfaces by a complex impedance method in the frequency region from 5 Hz to 13 MHz (precision LCR meter 4192A, Hewlett Packard). DC electrolysis of the sintered pellet was carried out by applying a DC voltage of 6 V for 360 h at 800 ○C in air using ion-blocking platinum bulk electrodes, and XRD analysis and line electron probe microanalysis (EPMA; EPMA-1500, Shimadzu) were per- formed for the electrolyzed sample. From the XRD analysis of the Ge1þx=4NbP3—xSixO12 (x 0:0{0:3) solids, it was clear that single phase of the NASICON-type structure was obtained for the samples with x 0:1 and that the lattice volume linearly expanded in this compo- sitional region (Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2),17 suggesting that the P5þ ion site in GeNb(PO4)3 was partially sub- stituted with larger Si4þ ion. On the other hand, the samples with x > 0:1 were a mixture of NASICON-type phosphate, GeP2O7, and SiO2 without any lattice expansion of the NASICON-type phase compared to the sample with x 0:1. These results clearly indicate that the solid solution limit of Si4þ into P5þ sites in GeNb(PO4)3 is x 0:1. The compositional dependence of the electrical conductivity at 600 ○C for the Ge1þx=4NbP3—xSixO12 solids is presented in Figure 1. Among the single phase samples (x 0:1), the conduc- tivity increased with Si content (x) up to 0.1 because of the lattice expansion of the NASICON-type phase, and the conductivity of the sample with x 0:1 was ca. 3.3 times as high as that of GeNb(PO4)3 (x 0:0). In contrast, the conductivity of the sam- ples with x > 0:1 monotonically decreased due to the appear- ance of impurity phases of GeP2O7 and SiO2. For identifying the conducting species in the Ge41=40- NbP2:9Si0:1O12 solid which showed the highest conductivity among the prepared solids, we investigated the time dependence of the aDC=aAC ratio in oxygen and helium atmospheres. The ra- tios in both atmospheres abruptly reduced and the values were below 0.01 after 30 min (Supporting Information, Figure S3),17 clearly indicating that the cation transference number was higher than 0.99. To directly identify the conducting cation species, we carried out the DC electrolysis of the Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 solid by applying a DC voltage of 6 V for 360 h at 800 ○C in air for the demonstration of Ge4þ ion conduction. Figure 2 shows the re- sults of the EPMA line analysis of the sample pellet after DC electrolysis. A clear segregation of Ge was recognized near the cathodic surface from the EPMA line analysis of the electrolyzed sample pellet, while other cations distributed homogeneously over the sample. Furthermore, GeO2 formation was clearly ob- served only at the cathodic surface of the electrolyzed sample (Supporting Information, Figure S4).17 These results explicitly indicate that only Ge4þ ions migrated in the Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1- O12 solid by DC electrolysis and deposited at the cathodic sur- face. Consequently, Ge deposited was oxidized in air atmosphere at the cathodic surface. From the results mentioned above, it was found that the Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 solid is a Ge4þ ion conduct- ing solid electrolyte.

Temperature dependencies of the Ge4þ ion conductivity for the Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 solid is presented in Figure 3 with the corresponding data for GeNb(PO4)3. The activation energy for ion conduction in Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 (36.1 kJ mol—1) is lower than that in GeNb(PO4)3 (51.1 kJ mol—1). The enhancement in conductivity and the reduction in activation energy might be mainly caused by the lattice expansion by doping larger Si4þ in- to P5þ sites, realizing both the extension of Ge–O bonding and the expansion of the conducting pathway. In conclusion, we have successfully developed a Ge4þ ion conducting Ge41=40NbP2:9Si0:1O12 solid for the first time by strictly selecting the NASICON-type structure and by intention- ally expanding the lattice size by partially substituting the P5þ site with Si4þ ion in GeNb(PO4)3.
