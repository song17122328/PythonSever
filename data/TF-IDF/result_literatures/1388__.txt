Abstract. Lithium aluminium titanium phosphate (LATP) with different stoichiometric ratios according to the formula Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 with  x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8 are prepared by mechanical milling method. The structural and electrical properties of the prepared samples are investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and A.C Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). The XRD results showed that the sample milled for 60 hours has very low crystallinity with conductivity value of ∼10-7 S cm-1.  The conductivity is enhanced by one order of magnitude upon sintering of the samples at 900 oC for 6 hours. This enhancement may be attributed to formation of improved grain homogeneity and contacts.  Introduction Solid lithium ion conductors have drawn significant interests due to commercial needs of electrolytes for high energy density rechargeable power sources. Power sources using solid electrolytes are safer compared to those employing liquid electrolyte. They also offer advantages in terms of size, shape, manufacturability and life span. Research and development efforts conducted in the last three decades have contributed significantly towards identification and solution to issues related to solid electrolytes. These include ambient temperature conductivity, cationic transport number and electrode-electrolyte interfacial reactions [1,2,3]. Ceramic ionic conductors based on Lithium Titanium Phosphate, LiTi2(PO4)3 which has NASICON type structure [4], are amongst the most promising group of oxide-based lithium ion conductors investigated in recent years. This system is also known to exhibit good chemical stability. Adachi et.al [5], Chowdari et al [6] and  Hosono et al [7,8] reported high conductivity of about 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 oC for Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 material. Meanwhile Fu [9-12] have succeeded in obtaining fast lithium-ion conductor of the same system with conductivity of ∼ 10-3 S cm-1 at 27 oC.   Xu et al. [13] reported studies on LATP using mechanical milling method and their system showed conductivity values in the order of 10-3 S cm-1. In this study the same system is prepared using the same method but different starting materials and technique for obtaining the material pellets. The structural and conductivity behaviour of the prepared system are studied and presented in this paper.   Experimental  LATP with different stiochiometric ratios are prepared by mechanical milling method. Lithium oxide (Li2O), titanium oxide (TiO2), aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and P2O5 are used as starting materials. The powders are thoroughly mixed by Fritsch planetary ball mill and then heated in an alumina crucible at 700 oC for 4 hours. The mixtures of the starting materials are then placed together with 25 zirconium balls in a sealed zirconium oxide bowl and milled for 60 hours. The milling treatment is carried out at 500 rpm at room temperature. The resulting powders were Advanced Materials Research Vol. 545

pelletized using Specac Hydraulic Press at a pressure of 7 tonnes. The pellet are sintered at temperatures ranging from 600 oC to 1000 oC for 6 hours before characterization by XRD, DSC and IS performed using Bruker D8 Advance X-Ray Diffractometer, Setaram Setsys Evolution 1750 and Solatron 1260 Impedance Analyzer respectively.   Results and discussion Fig. 1 presents the results of thermal analyses of the samples with x = 0, 0.4 and 1 which are designated as LATP(0), LATP(0.4) and  LATP(1) respectively. The figure shows that a decrease in Tc is observed from ∼ 800 oC for x = 0 to ∼670 oC for x = 1. The Tc is ascribed to the chemical reactions between the precursors, which resulted in formation of crystalline phase. The values of Tc for sample with x = 0.4 and 1 are found to be within the same range of 600 oC – 700 oC as those reported by other authors [12,13,14].      Fig. 1 DSC curve of LATP(0), LATP(0.4), LATP(1) samples Fig. 2 depicts XRD patterns obtained for the as prepared LATP powders. The samples with x = 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8 show peaks attributed to LiTi2(PO4)3 which is known as a conducting crystalline phase [12]. The peaks attributed to TiP2O7 are also observed in all samples. However, in the sample with  x = 0.4, the intensities of the TiP2O7 peaks are significantly reduced showing that the sample contains the least TiP2O7 crystalline phase.  The variations of conductivity with sintering temperature of all samples are presented in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the highest conductivity is exhibited by the sample LATP(0.4) for all sintering temperatures. The highest conductivity value obtained for the sample is sintered at 900 oC with a value of 1.57 × 10-6 S cm-1.  In order to understand the effects of sintering temperature on the conductivity of this sample, XRD patterns of this system sintered at various temperatures are recorded and are shown in Fig. 4. The intensities of LiTi2(PO4)3 peaks is observed to increase with increase in sintering temperature, indicating an increase in LiTi2(PO4)3 crystalline phase with temperature. The unsintered sample and samples sintered at 600, 700 and 1000 oC contain traces of TiP2O7 while AlPO4 impurity is only observed in the sample sintered at 1000 oC as indicated by the presence of peaks at 2θ of 20 o to 22 o [6,12,15]. 192

The samples heated at 800 oC and 900 oC show the presence of a single crystalline phase of LiTi2(PO4)3 without any impurities present. Further analysis was done by calculating the crystallite size and these are plotted against sintering temperature for different planes as shown in Fig. 5.    Fig. 5 shows that the crystallite size is the smallest and quite homogeneous for LATP(0.4) sintered at 900 oC and the samples sintered at other temperature show crystallite sizes which are heterogeneous. These observations are used to account for the variation of conductivity with sintering temperature shown in Fig. 3. As seen in Fig. 3, the conductivity increases with sintering temperature from 600 oC to 900 oC but decreases for sintering temperature of 1000 oC. The increase Fig. 3 Conductivity variation with sintering temperature for all samples  Fig. 2 XRD pattern of as prepared LATP samples with (a) x = 0, (b) x = 0.2, (c) x = 0.4, (d) x = 0.5 and (e) x = 0.8  Advanced Materials Research Vol. 545

in conductivity for samples sintered at 600 oC to 800 oC is attributable to the increase in crystallinity while the increase in conductivity for the sample sintered at 900 oC is attributed to increase in homogeneity of the crystallites which leads to formation of better contacts between grains. This improved intergrain contacts increases the conduction path resulting in conductivity enhancement due to enhanced ion diffusion [17]. Eventhough the sample sintered at 1000oC is more crystalline, its conductivity is lower, this may be due to the presence of impurities in the system that impedes movement of ions. Apart from that the decrease in conductivity may also be due to its  inhomogeneity of crystallites which resulted in formation of poorer intergrain contacts [18]. Presented in Fig. 6 are the temperature dependence of conductivity for the LATP(0.4) sintered at different temperatures. The conductivity increases with temperature and achived a value of about  10-5 S cm-1 at 190 oC. This means that there is a possibility of this sample showing higher conductivity values at higher temperatures.

The conductivity values obtained in this work are lower than those reported by Xu et al. This may be due to the different technique employed for obtaining the material pellets which results in formation of electrolytes with different structural properties. The conductivity behaviour of the system studied in this work could be related to their structural properties, i.e. crystallinity, crystallite homogeneity and presence of impurities. There is a possibility of this system achieving higher conductivity value at higher temperatures indicating that this system may be suitable for use in high temperature devices.
