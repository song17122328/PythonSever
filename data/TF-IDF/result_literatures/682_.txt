NASICON-type NaTi2(PO4)3 material has been extensively studied as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteriesdue to the open 3D framework with the large interstitial spaces, high theoretical capacity and small volumechange during cycling process.
However, the practical application of NaTi2(PO4)3 is hampered because of its lowelectronic conductivity.
Herein, a simple approach along with post-annealing has been designed and adopted toprepare the carbon-coated NaTi2(PO4)3 (NaTi2(PO4)3@C) composite.
The as-prepared anode material is characterizedby XRD, SEM, TEM and Raman spectrum.
The electrochemical measurements reveal thatNaTi2(PO4)3@C has excellent Na-storage performances including high reversible capacity (112.6 mAh g−1 at0.2 C) and good rate capability (87.1 mAh g−1 at 5 C).
The superior electrochemical performance can be resultedfrom the synergistic effects of the nanosized NaTi2(PO4)3 particles and conductive carbon layer.
Herein, uniform composite of NaTi2(PO4)3@C was fabricated byusing a simple approach along with post-annealing technology.
Thisresearch revealed that the thin carbon coating could enhance thestructural stability and improve the electronic conductivity ofNaTi2(PO4)3. Therefore, the as-prepared NaTi2(PO4)3@C compositeexhibited outstanding electrochemical performances, such as high reversiblecapacity, good rate property and stable cycle life.
It could deliveran initial discharge capacity of 112.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a highrate capability of 87.1 mAh g−1 at 5 C with capacity retention of 98.1%after 20 cycles.
The results indicated that the nanosized NaTi2(PO4)3@Ccomposite would be a promising anode material for high performancesodium-ion batteries.
