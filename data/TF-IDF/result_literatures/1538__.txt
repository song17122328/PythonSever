The phase transition properties of A3Fe2(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na) were studied by Raman spectroscopy. Several Raman bands change continuously in 25–400 ?C temperature range, indicating a phase transition from the c, b to the a-phase occurring at this range of temperature. Bands caused by vibrations of phosphate anion and different ions have been found. The spectra analysis reveals that the modes, located at low frequency range 100–400 cm?1, near 500 cm?1 at room temperature, are the most thermo-sensitive. In addition, the modes corresponding to bond valence stretching of (PO4) unit in the frequency region 970–1200 cm?1 show also evolution with temperature but less sensitive than the above ones. It is observed that phosphate groups show some ordering with temperature. According to our Raman study, we can state that each of the compounds LiFeP and NaFeP shows two reversible phase transformations in the temperature range studied.

It is well known that supply problems in fossil combustibles have obliged industrial countries to turn towards other energy sources. So energy storage becomes a primordial problem. Nowadays, because of the huge demands of the modern society for a variety of consumer electronic gadgets and future hybrid electric vehicles, appropriate energy storage technologies have been developed. Among them, lithium-ion batteries have occupied a place of pride [1,2]. The lithium-ion battery was emerged in 1991 and grew rapidly as the power source of choice for portable electronic devices, especially wireless telephones and laptop computers, during the past years. In order to advance lithium-ion batteries, several concepts have been developed, leading to innovative new positive and negative electrode materials. It is their performance that governs the talking time when using a cellular phone or the working time when using a portable computer. Hence the need to constantly improve these energy sources for the benefit of the very demanding users. Among the typical positive electrode materials for lithium-ion cells three-dimensional (3D) materials containing PO43? anions in their structure have attracted particular attention due to the high energy density, low cost and good environmental compatibility of its basic constituents. Most notable of these materials are phosphates and its substituted variants belonging to oliv ine-type LixMXO4 (M = Transition metal) and NASICON structuretype LixM2(XO4)3 (M = Ti, Fe, V and X = P, As, Mo, W, S) [3–10]. Some of these compounds display high redox potentials and energy density comparable to that of conventional lithium metal oxides [10–15]. Nasicon compounds have attracted considerable attention over the past years because of (i) their unusual transport behaviour and (ii) their promise as solid electrolytes for incorporation into electrochemical devices. They represent a class of compounds exhibiting three-dimensional fast ion conductivity which is being investigated with a great deal of interest. Very recently [16], i t i s reported that glass–ceramics containing Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phase have been prepared and could be used in all solid state lithium-ion batteries. The performance of a battery depends on many factors amongst which the most critical are the electrode materials and their structural evolution upon cycling while in contact with the electrolyte. Masquelier et al. [11] reported that during the charge/discharge of a battery, intercalation compounds such as Li3Fe2(PO4)3 undergo structural/electronic changes that, when not controlled, could jeopardise the overall battery performance. So, with respect to the application, identification of the nature of the insertion process (single phase vs. two-phase) within a new electrode material is important. Usually a single phase process leading to smooth and reversible voltage versus composition dependence is preferred to a two-phase process (e.g. characterised by a constant voltage composition dependence). This is because the latter usually involves structural (volume) changes known to be highly detrimental to capacity retention upon cycling. For instance, while the monoclinic-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows a two-phase process the rhombohedral-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 shows a single phase mechanism. Furthermore, the A3Fe2(PO4)3 (A = Li, Na) have been observed to exhibit several distinct crystalline phases in the temperature interval 140–270 ?C and the phase transitions are accompanied by interesting electrical conductivity behaviour [11,17,18]. This polymorphism evidences the importance of carefully measuring physical properties evolution upon temperature as well as understanding structural details of possible phase transitions. Raman spectroscopy is one of the most convenient and powerful tools to unravel details about local and cooperative changes during transitions between phases. Thermo-Raman spectroscopy in which Raman spectra are measured dynamically as a function of temperature has been applied successfully in situ investigation of solid state phase transitions and composition changes [19–24]. Hence the thermo-Raman spectroscopic technique was used in this work to probe the structural changes of monoclinic-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and rhombohedral-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 phases upon heating. Several workers have utilised Raman and infrared spectroscopies to characterise the structure of A3M2(PO4)3 compounds, where A = Li and Na, and M = Fe, Sc, In, Zr, Cr [25–33]. Kravchenko et al. [28] have reported the Raman spectrum of Li3M2(PO4)3 (M = Sc, Fe) at different temperatures, however, for M = Fe only the room temperature Raman spectrum is given, and only the bands due to Li+ vibrations were assessed in any detail. The same authors [32], have reported IR spectra of the Na3Fe2(PO4)3 as a function of temperature, and their interest were focused on the motion of Na+ ions. Barj et al. [30] report the factor group analysis and spectra of compounds belonging to the Nasicon family of structures, and characterised the short-range disorder occurring in these systems. Recently, Butt et al. [26] reported the Raman spectra at room temperature of Li3Fe2(PO4)3 and Ti-doped Li3Fe2(PO4)3 phosphates. They studied the effect of replacement of Fe by Ti. The main objective of this work is to investigate the structural properties and lattice dynamics of monoclinic-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 abbreviated LiFeP and rhombohedral-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 phosphates (NaFeP) using in situ temperature Raman measurements in a wide range of frequencies, from 100 to 4000 cm?1. Analysis of internal and external modes of vibration allows making an accurate description of the structural environment of cations, lattice distortion and degree of covalency. These features can help in the understanding of the mechanism of the phase transitions occurring in the electrode materials under study. We show by Raman spectroscopy that PO4tetrahedra distortion and stretching modes can be used as probe to detect the phase transitions.

All the samples were prepared by usual solid-state reaction techniques [34,35]. Stoichiometric quantities of NaH2PO4?H2O, Na4P2O7?10H2O (99%, Merck) and Fe2O3 (99% Merck) as starting materials were well ground and mixed to elaborate Na3Fe2(PO4)3. The mixture was heated above the melting point 960 ?C for few hours and cooled to room temperature for above 20 h. The resulting product was dissolved in water and thoroughly washed to dissolve excess sodium phosphates. The quality of the final product was controlled by powder X-ray method. Li3Fe2(PO4)3 composition isotypic with the monoclinic form of Fe2(SO4)3 (P21/n) was prepared by direct decomposition at 930 ?C between intimately mixed LiOH?H2O, Fe2O3, and NH4H2PO4 powders. All the X-ray diffraction peaks for both samples could be indexed in a slightly distorted monoclinic unit cell with lattice parameters very close to previously reported values [34,36]. The monoclinic cell results from a small distortion of the framework from orthorhombic symmetry, due to lithium ordering at room temperature. X-ray powder diffraction patterns were taken at room temperature on a phillips D 5000 diffractometer: Bragg–Brentano geometry; diffracted-beam graphite monochromator; CuKa radiation (40 KV, 40 mA). The scan was carried out in steps of 0.02?, counting for 0.5 s at each step. Experiments have been carried out using Raman spectroscopic system designed and built at the Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University. The key system components include a highthroughput, single stage imaging spectrometer (HoloSpec f/1.8i, Kaiser Optical Systems) equipped with a holographic transmission grating and thermoelectrically cooled two-dimensional multichannel CCD detector (Newton, Andor Technology, 1600 ? 400 pixels, ?60 ?C), an argon-ion laser (Spectra-Physics, 514.5 nm, 20 mW), and an optical imaging system (magnification 20?, spatial resolution ?1 lm). Two holographic notch filters (Kaiser Optical Systems, Inc.) blocked the Rayleigh line. The spectrometer was calibrated by fluorescence lines of the neon lamp. Non-polarized Raman spectra were collected in the back-scattering geometry, in the range 180–2280 cm?1, at a resolution of about 3 cm?1. Accuracy of spectral measurements, resulting from the wavelength calibration procedure and experimental conditions, is estimated to be about 1.5 cm?1. Precision of the reported peak positions, as represented by standard errors obtained in peak fits, varied between 0.04 and 0.7 cm?1, the lower values representative for singlets and low temperatures, the higher values characteristic for overlapping peaks and high temperatures. The acquisition time varied from 30 s to 5 min. Heating was accomplished by using a mica insulated band heater (DuraBand, 200 W, Tempco Electric Heater Corporation) mounted around the sample ceramic holder and connected to a variable transformer. Temperature changes during the heating/ cooling cycles were induced and controlled by adjusting the transformer’s voltage (0–240 V) and monitored with an accuracy of ±1 K by the K-type thermocouple adjacent to the sample. During the spectral acquisitions, temperatures were stabilized to within 1 and 3 ?C, for the low and high temperature measurements, respectively. Principal layout of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.

X-ray diffraction patterns of Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (labelled in the following as NaFeP) and Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (regarded after as LiFeP) are indexed on the basis of a rhombohedral cell (S.G. R-3c, n?167) with hexagonal parameters a = 8.8285(5) Å, c = 22.019(1) Å, and a monoclinic cell (S.G. C21/n, n?14) with parameters a = 8.571(1) Å, b = 12.017(1) Å, c = 8:616(1) Å, beta = 90.52(1)?, respectively. These parameters agree well with other reported in the literature [18,34,36]. According to d’Yvoire et al. [34], LiFeP and NaFeP have a threedimensional mixed network [Fe2(PO4)3]3? with alkali (Li, Na) ions in the channels within this framework. Details of the crystal structure of LiFeP have been reported by Bykov et al. [18], and it has been established that there are three polymorphic modifications (a-, b-, and c-LiFeP phases). The peculiarities of the NaFeP structure have been studied by d’Yvoire et al. [34], and it has been recognized that there are three forms (a-, b-, and c-NaFeP phases). LiFeP and NaFeP crystals have a similar 3D-framework consisting of PO4 tetrahedra and MO6 octahedra sharing all their corners. A theoretical group analysis has been carried out for the AFeP-like structure (A = Li, Na). This treatment has been carried out by assuming the separation of the vibrations into internal PO4 3? and external (lattice) modes. The PO4 3? group has a singlet (A1) at a frequency m1 = 938 cm?1; a doublet (E) at m2 = 465 cm?1 and two triply degenerate (F2) modes, m3 at 1027 cm?1 and m4 at 567 cm?1. The m1 and m3 modes involve the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the P–O bonds, whereas m2 and m4 involve mainly O–P–O symmetric and antisymmetric bending mode. The optically-active normal modes of (a,b)-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (S.G. C21/n, n? 14) and c-Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (S.G. Pcan, n? 61) are distributed among the following irreducible representations of the C2h and D2h point groups, respectively: Ca;b vibðLiFePÞ = 60Ag + 60Bg + 59Au + 59Bu (after subtracting Au + 2 Bu acoustic modes); Cc vibðLiFePÞ = 36A1g + 36B1g + 36B2g + 36B3g + 35B1u + 35B2u + 35B3u (after subtracting B1u + B2u + B3u acoustic modes). The analysis predicts 120 Raman-active modes and 117 IR-active modes for (a,b)-LiFeP, while 144 Raman-active modes and 105 IR-active modes are expected for c-LiFeP. The irreductible representations Ca;b vibðNaFePÞ = 29Ag + 31Bg + 32Au + 34Bu (after subtracting acoustic modes Au + 2 Bu) and Cc vibðNaFePÞ = 9 A1g + 20Eg + 11A2u + 21Eu (after subtracting A2u + Eu acoustic modes) are related to (a,b)-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (S.G. C2/c, n?15) and c-Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (S.G. R-3c, n?167), respectively. The analysis predicts 60 Raman-active modes and 63 IR-active modes for (a,b)-NaFeP, while 29 Raman-active and 32 IR-active modes are expected for c-NaFeP. Raman spectra in the frequency range from 100 to 4000 cm?1 were recorded from room temperature to about 350 ?C. No peaks are detected in the frequency range 1500– 4000 cm?1. Thus, the spectra are given in the frequency range 100–1500 cm?1. The thermal evolution of the Raman spectra across the transition temperature region was carefully examined to follow the behaviour of well defined bands. Figs. 2 and 3 show the Raman spectra of LiFeP and NaFP in the frequency range 100–1500 cm?1 on heating and cooling. Tables 1 and 2 list the frequencies and assignments of LiFeP and NaFeP at various temperatures, respectively. The assignments of the vibrations are made by a comparison with the results taken from the following references [25–33].The bands are assigned to vibrations, of lattice modes (0–400 cm?1), FeO6 octahedra (300–400 cm?1), alkali-metal cage-modes (300–400 cm?1), PO4 3? deformations (400–600 cm?1) and vibrations of the valence bonds of PO43? (900–1200 cm?1). The spectra are dominated by the internal vibrations (m1, m2, m3 and m4) of the PO4 3? units which involve the displacement of oxygen atoms of the tetrahedral PO4 3? anions and present frequencies closely related to those of the free molecule. From the first glance, one can state that all the phase transitions are reversible (Figs. 2 and 3). The spectra analysis reveals that the modes, located at low frequency range 100–400 cm?1, near 500 cm?1 at room temperature, are the most thermo-sensitive. In addition, the modes corresponding to bond valence stretching of (PO4) unit in the frequency region 970–1200 cm?1 show also evolution with temperature but less sensitive than the above ones. Generally when the sample is subjected to heating, the intensity of the Raman bands goes down significantly on the whole. The other important feature of the spectra is the occurrence of well sharp resolved bands for the stretching and bending modes of the phosphate ion at room temperature. Some of them merge upon heating the samples. The origin of the internal modes split is a consequence of two effects: the site-symmetry effect due to an electric crystal field of symmetry lower than tetrahedral acting on the molecule and the correlation effect due to the presence of more than one molecular group in the crystal unit cell. It is worth to mention that the external modes occur, in general, below 400 cm?1 where translatory and lattice mode motions of the PO43? ions and translatory motion of the Fe3+ ions are recorded.

The high temperature Raman spectra in the region 100– 600 cm?1 are shown in Fig. 4. One can see clearly the presence of bands with an important broadness (100–300, 400–460 cm?1) and bands with a small broadness near 500 cm?1 and in the range 300–370 cm?1. These features are more visible at room temperature. The occurrence of the broad and narrow modes in the Raman spectrum indicates simultaneously the existence of order and disorder in the structure. According to the X-ray data [18], the low temperature phase a-LiFeP structure is characterised by the fact that the alkali-metal atoms (Li+) responsible for conduction are situated in the voids of the mixed framework Fe2(PO4)33? and compensate the total negative charge of the framework. Twelve lithium atoms of the unit cell occupy three different sites and are labelled as Li+1, L i+2, and Li+3. They have different isotropic temperature factors. The highest mobility is possessed by Li+3. L i+l cation forms a regular tetrahedron with oxygen atoms. Coordination polyhedra of Li+2 and Li+3 are distorted trigonal bipyramids. Thus, we propose to explain the above features – existence of bands with different broadness – by the existence of librational disordered tetrahedra associated to translational order of cations. For instance, this assumption is consistent with the Bykov X-ray studies [18] which give the following results (i) existence of strong correlation between lithium cations as a function of temperature, (ii) high thermal parameters for oxygen atoms of PO4 tetrahedra and for Li+3 cation. The modes located below 400 cm?1 could be external modes. They show some changes within the temperature. It involves Li+, F e3+ cation modes coupled with tetrahedra modes. However, it is difficult to separate the modes caused by vibrations of these cations from bands of deformation vibrations of PO4 tetrahedra. With respect to Butt et al. [26], the three Raman bands centered at 301, 337 and 361 cm?1 observed at room temperature show some (FeO6) contribution and the lithium–ion cage-modes. The frequency dependent temperature of these modes (Table 1, Fig. 5) indicates that they show a slightly shift to lower frequencies with increasing temperature. On the other hand, a band with a small broadness situated at 501 cm?1 (Table 1, Fig. 5) is shifted to lower frequencies by about 5 cm?1 by heating from 25 to 200 ?C. This band could be associated to lithium mode according to Kravchenko assignment [28]. Furthermore, the modes at 360 and 301 cm?1, in the temperature range 25–200 ?C, both show more frequency decreases, about 12 cm?1, than those of both the 337 and the 501 cm?1 ones (about 4 cm?1). Thus, these last modes seem to be coupled and those first modes are also very dependent. Such facts do not exclude the existence of coupling between all the above modes. Furthermore, deformation and lattice modes are split at room temperature that indicates existence of some distortions of the PO4 tetrahedra. With increasing of temperature up to 200 ?C, a part from some little broad shape in lattice (100–300 cm?1) and some intensity inversion of PO4 deformation (420–480 cm?1) modes, there is no significantly changes in the Raman spectra (Figs. 4 and 5). This broadening is caused principally by thermal effect. Above the 200 ?C, but below 247 ?C a transformation of the Raman spectrum is observed (Table 1, Figs. 4 and 5). Several bands disappear within the frequency range under investigation. We can mention for examples the bands at 300, 360, 435, and 501 cm?1. This disappearance is caused not by classical broadening of these bands with the temperature rise but by continued decrease of their intensity. Mainly, the disappeared bands belong to the lithium and/or iron modes and the deformation modes of the PO4 tetrahedra. Therefore, the thermal effect on Raman spectra in the temperature range (200–247 ?C) reflects that the PO4-tetrahedra distortion could be correlated to the temperature evolution of some lithium/iron modes. To get more insight to this correlation, we analyse the frequency temperature dependence of lithium and/or iron modes in Fig. 5. Firstly, one can observe that the bands at 300, 360 and 501 cm?1 tend to be zero at about 211 ?C. Secondly, even though the mode at 337 cm?1 is broad one can follow its frequency evolution with temperature. It presents a sharp decrease beginning from 200 ?C. In other words, the first changes in the Raman spectra are observed just below the temperature 211 ?C. It is worth to notice that the latter temperature corresponds to the well known a¡b phase transition [28]. Therefore, the changes observed in Raman spectra at this temperature could characterise the a¡b phase transition. Specially, the disappearance of the modes at 301, 360, 501 cm?1 and the sharp decreases of the band at 337 cm?1 are the most characteristics of the a¡b phase transition. One question arises, what is the nature of this phase transition? According to the X-ray data of the a-LiFeP and b-LiFeP phases [18], the mechanism is an order–disorder process. We consider here that there are almost two possible contributions to the a¡b phase transition mechanism: (i) the motions of the oxygens (ii) some type of motions of the lithium cations. However, with respect to X-ray data [18], one can suppose that the motions of the lithium Li3 contribute more to the above transition process. Such assumption is also consistent with the Mossbauer results [28]. Therefore, we can correlate all the Raman spectra changes at the a¡b transition, near 211 ?C, to the decrease of occupancy of some lithium sites in the lithium sublattice. The other interesting facts are: (i) that no softening bands in the Raman spectra of LiFeP are observed. It should be noted, however, that the latter result is in disagreement with data obtained in [28] according to which there are soft modes in the phonon spectrum of LiFe; (ii) the Raman intensity inversion of the lattice bands and a small shape changes of the PO4 deformation modes are observed before the latter phase transition, and the losing of the PO4 distortion could be caused by the redistribution of lithium over Li+1, L i+2, L i+3 and vacancy sites. From the evolutions of the Raman spectra of the LiFeP between 240 and 316 ?C for the frequency ranges between 100 and 600 cm?1 (Fig. 4) and between 960 and 1120 cm?1 (Fig. 6), it is seen that when the temperature increases, the number of bands observed in the PO4 stretching region does change. A band at 973 cm?1 is assigned to the m1(PO4) vibrations whereas those between 999 and 1105 cm?1 are due to the m3(PO4) modes. The frequency temperature dependencies of the above modes are represented in the Fig. 7. The bands at 973 and 1009 cm?1 do not change their positions in the temperature range from 25 to 241 ?C. Above this latter, they disappears simultaneously. By further increasing the temperature at about 260 ?C, a band situated at 1025 cm?1 vanishes. At 260 ?C, the modes at 1060 and 1105 cm?1 show shifts toward lower frequencies on heating (Fig. 7). The band at 999 cm?1 remarkably changes its position between 241 and 265 ?C. In Fig. 5 it is seen that also the position of the band at 337 cm?1 is a small stepwise frequency decreasing with temperature. Although the change observed at 337 cm?1 in the Raman spectra is rather small, the stepwise observation indicates the possible change in the dynamical state of the lithium cations. For instance, the data of structural and physical studies of lithium–iron phosphate [18,34] confirm that the phosphorous and iron ions remain motionless while lithium ions migrate from site-to-site with increasing temperature. This is in agreement with the fact that: (i) the m2(PO4) centered at 448 cm?1 shows no splitting above 240 ?C (Fig. 4), but such a split exists under the latter temperature; (ii) the stretching modes reveal a similar temperature evolution below the 211 ?C. This indicates that the latter modes are rigid in agreement with the fact that the LiFeP structure is based on the Fe2(PO4)3 framework. The ordering of phosphate groups seen with temperature, i.e. disappearance of splitting, is due to the fact that the motion of lithium ions results in the homogeneous spatial distribution of lithium ions around both iron and phosphorous units. Based on the above facts, one can suppose that the observed changes between 247 and 260 ?C could be ascribed to the high b¡d phase transition of the LiFeP. This hypothesis is in agreement with: (i) the DTA studies which show that the LiFeP compound showed the high phase transition b¡d at 265 ?C [34]; (ii) the electrical data that show two phase transitions in LiFeP crystal within 157 ?C < T < 307 ?C temperature range [28,34]: the As for other phosphates, internal modes involving the displacement of oxygen atoms of the pseudo-tetrahedral PO43? anions of NaFeP present frequencies closely related to those of the free molecule. The Raman spectra of NaFeP (Fig. 3) display bands which are nearly frequency–temperature independent and those which show some shifts with temperature. The observed bands are ascribed to the stretching, bending modes and external modes (Table 2). It is remarkable that, in the high-wavenumber range, some Raman bands show small change in positions while the others disappear. Bands of the stretching modes for NaFeP at room temperature are located at 969, 983, 1012, 1022, 1037, 1055, 1063, and 1134 cm?1. In comparison with the NaFeP spectrum recorded at room temperature, the spectra at high temperatures show small splitting of the stretching modes. This splitting vanishes with increasing temperature. The disappearance of both the bands and the splitting could reflect simultaneously that the condensed PO4 tetrahedra have gained some ordering when the temperature increases. In order to gain more information on the dynamics of the sodium cations and the degree of the disorder of the phosphate units in different phases, one should study the effect of temperature on the lowand high- frequency modes of NaFeP. Fig. 8 shows the Raman spectra of NaFeP for the wavenumber region between 100 and 600 cm?1 related to the deformation/lattice vibrations in the temperature range 25–300 ?C while heating. The wavenumbers and assignments of the bands observed in the spectra measured for different temperatures are listed in Table 2. The assignments of the vibrations are taken from Butt et al. [26]. Both analyzed modes reveal a similar temperature evolution at low temperatures, i.e. T 6 85 ?C (Fig. 9). The most interesting temperature effects in the Raman spectra of NaFeP appear in the PO4 deformation region in agreement with the IR data [32]. The stepwise splitting of dPO2 modes is remarkable and this behaviour is not reported before. If we suppose the presence of one phase transition at 85 ?C, the observed stepwise splitting could suggest that the nature of this transformation is discontinue. It is to note also that the lattice modes located under 150 cm?1 show changes both in band shape, intensity, and position even below 85 ?C. The first extinction of some PO4 deformation modes, in the Raman spectra, are observed at about 85 ?C. At this temperature, several modes such as 289 and 331 cm?1 disappear while the mode at 320 cm?1 shows an abrupt deviation. The observed disappearance of some bands (Table 2) a t 8 5 ?C reflects that the PO4 deformation modes are sensible to the thermal effect and the distortion diminishes upon increasing temperature. In other words, in the low frequency range 100–600 cm?1, the changes affect mainly the 289–331 cm?1 band which splits in the Raman spectra obtained for temperatures below 85 ?C.

Fig. 10 gives the temperature evolution for the Raman spectra of NaFeP in the frequency region 900–1200 cm?1 between 25 and 300 ?C. The Raman bands considered are ascribed to the P–O stretching. Fig. 10 shows the temperature dependence of these stretching bands. When temperature increases from the room temperature to about 85 ?C one can observe small changes in the spectra. There is a small intensity variation of the P–O stretching modes and the disappearance of the bands at 989 and at 1055 cm?1 at T = 8 5 ?C (Fig. 11). These features could indicate that the stepwise splitting of the 289–331 cm?1 (Fig. 9) and the above stretching components disappearance are coupled. According to the above observations, we can conclude that both the stretching and the deformation modes of PO4 are sensible to the temperature. By analyzing both Figs. 10 and 11, one can observe that large changes occur in the temperature domain 85–140 ?C. Both band shape and position of some bands are modified. The band components at 1063 and 969 cm?1 disappear at about 140 cm?1 while the band at 1022 cm?1 shows a frequency temperature deviation. Moreover, the components at 1022 and 1037 cm?1 emerged to form a single band at 140 ?C. These facts do indicate that the phosphate tetrahedra have became more ordered at high temperature and precisely above 140 ?C. According to our Raman study, we can retain that some transformations in the structure of NaFeP could occur at the characteristic temperatures 85 and 140 ?C. While the first one near 85 ?C is accompanied by an increasing order of the PO4 tetrahedra, the second transformation reflects more ordering of the phosphate units. Even though, the Raman spectra do not show any Na+ cage-modes, the ordering of PO4 tetrahedra could be associated with the repartition of the Na+ ions in the structure of NaFeP with respect to X-ray data [34]. It is worth mentioning that these transitions operate in a short temperature domain. The above transformations could be related to the well known phase transitions of NaFeP [18,34,38,39]: a¡b and b¡c, respectively. This assumption is confirmed by the NaFeP polymorphism studied by De La Rochère et al. [38]. DTA and X-ray diffraction experiments performed at controlled temperature showed that the compound NaFeP undergo several reversible phase transitions between room temperature and 180 ?C, i.e. at 95 and 145 ?C. These can be schematised as below: a¡b¡c. While the c-form is rhombohedral, the room temperature a-form present a weak monoclinic distortion. The b-form is trigonal and is a superstructure of c-form. These transitions were confirmed by conductivity measurements [34]. These two transitions a¡b and b¡c are first order and accompanied by sharp changes in the lattice constants and in the conductivity curves. As deduced from diffraction studies [38], the three phases are distinguished by their different Na+ sites occupations, and the phase transitions from the room temperature a-NaFeP to the high temperature c-NaFe, through the b-NaFeP form, are correlated to the Na+ transfer. While in a-NaFeP the two independent positions Na+2 and Na+3 exhibit strictly the same occupancy and the Na+1 site is completely filled with a long rang ordered vacancy repartition, the intermediate b-NaFeP is characterised by a very weak organization of the Na+1 ions but the Na+2–Na+3 ions remain rather strongly correlated; the a¡b transition corresponds to the transfer of some Na+1 to the Na+2–Na+3 empty sites. The c-NaFeP form exhibits only a short range Na+–Na+ correlations and corresponds to an increasing occupancy of the Na+2–Na+3 site when T is increased. Furthermore, our assumption is in agreement with the Mössbauer spectra of NaFeP which show two transitions of the isomer shift relative to iron at 87 and 142 ?C [39]. Since PO4 and FeO6 are connected as a Fe2(PO4)3 alliance in the structure of the NaFeP, one can expect that any variation of the Fe–O distance influences directly its associate P–O bond length. Therefore, the temperatures associated to the two phase transitions are similar both for Raman and Mössbauer spectroscopies.

n this work we have investigated the high temperature phase transitions of two phosphates Li3Fe2(PO4)3 (LiFeP) and Na3Fe2(PO4)3 (NaFeP) which have Nasicon-type structure using Raman spectroscopy. The purity of each material is confirmed by XRD patterns. In the region of internal modes of the phosphate (PO4)3? anion, the Raman spectra show clearly the symmetric stretching modes in the high-wavenumber region and deformation modes in the low-wavenumber. It is observed in both LiFeP and NaFeP phosphates that the internal modes of (PO4)3? involving the displacement of oxygen atoms of the pseudo-tetrahedral anions present frequencies closely related to those of the free molecule. By the analysis of the thermo-Raman spectra of LiFeP and NaFeP, it is confirmed the onset of two reversible temperatureinduced phase transformations both in LiFeP and NaFeP, discovered recently with the use of DTA, conductivity and Mössbauer tools.
