Nasicon type, Mg0.5+x/2Si2-xAlx(PO4)3 was synthesized using citric acid assisted sol-gel method.
The X-ray diffraction was applied to investigatethe effect of extra Mg2+ interstitial ion on the phase, unit cell parameters and structure of the samples.
The Mg0.625Si1.75Al0.25(PO4)3 sample exhibitedhighest bulk conductivity value of 1.54 × 10−4 S cm−1 at ambient temperature.
The frequency dependence of the σac of these ceramic electrolytesfollows the universal power law variation, σac (ω) = σo + Aωα.
The conductivity parameters such as hopping frequencies, charge carrier concentrationand mobile ion concentration proved that the increase in conductivity with x was due to the existence of Mg2+ interstitial ions.
Theexperiment results also revealed that the dielectric constant and dielectric loss decreased with frequency.
The Mg0.625Si1.75Al0.25(PO4)3 was foundto be electrochemically stable up to 2.51 V at ambient temperature.
Magnesium batteries have recently attracted great interestdue to their high energy density and environmentally friendlycomponents.
Theoretically, these Mg batteries can offer highvolumetric specific capacity compared to lithium (3833 mAh/cm3 for Mg vs.2046 mAh/cm3 for Li).
Considering all theseaspects, it is clear that magnesium battery systems could offera significantly cheaper, safer and better-performing batteryoption in contrast to lithium.
Despite these attractive attributesof Mg batteries, there are several challenges pertaining tothe use of cathodes, electrolytes and anodes.
With respect toelectrolytes, the magnesium electrolytes’ compound has toshow high ionic conductivity, large enough interstitial void andhigh structural stability based on 3D framework.
